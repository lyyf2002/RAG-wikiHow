Monitor the ear condition carefully.,
Notice if you feel severe ear pain followed by no pain at all.,
Call your doctor if your pain worsens within 48 hours.,
Get your hearing or your child’s hearing tested if fluid buildup in the ear continues after 3 months.",How to Cure an Ear Infection4," Check your temperature or your child’s temperature frequently and watch for other symptoms.


If a fever develops or you observe flu-like symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, this can possibly mean the infection is getting worse and that home ear infection treatments are not working effectively.
Symptoms that necessitate a trip to your doctor include confusion, neck stiffness, and swelling, pain, or redness around the ear. These symptoms indicate that the infection may have spread and that it needs immediate treatment.

, This could indicate the eardrum has ruptured. Ruptured eardrums can result in temporary loss of hearing. They can also make your ear more susceptible to infections, making the situation even worse.In addition to the absence of pain, there may also be drainage coming from the ear.
Although ruptured eardrums usually heal within a couple weeks, even without treatment, some problems may persist that require medical intervention or treatment., While most doctors recommend a 48-hour “wait and see” approach, if you experience worsening pain during that period, call your doctor. Your doctor will be able to recommend more intense treatment or antibiotics., This may be coupled with significant hearing problems.Sometimes, a short-term hearing loss can occur, which is especially concerning for children two years and younger.
If your child is younger than 2 and experiencing fluid buildup as well as hearing issues, your doctor may not wait three months to start treatment. Hearing problems at this age could affect your child’s ability to speak and lead to other developmental problems.

Get a prescription for antibiotics from your doctor.,
Ask your doctor for prescription ear drops.,
Ask your doctor about ear tubes if the ear infection is recurrent.,
Discuss the possibility of an adenoidectomy to remove swollen adenoids with your doctor.",How to Cure an Ear Infection5," Antibiotics will not help an ear infection that is caused by a virus, so doctors do not always prescribe antibiotics for ear infections. All children under 6 months old will be treated with antibiotics.Tell your doctor about the last time you used antibiotics, as well as what kind. This will help your doctor choose the most effective kind for you.
Make sure you or your child take all the doses of the medication on schedule, to ensure the infection does not return.
Do not stop taking antibiotics, even if you feel better until you have completed the entire course as prescribed. Stopping antibiotic treatment before you finish the full course can cause any remaining bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics, making the condition much more difficult to treat., Ear drops, such as antipyrine-benzocaine-glycerin (Aurodex), may help relieve the pain of ear infections. A doctor will not prescribe ear drops to people with torn or perforated eardrums.To give drops to a child, first warm up the eardrop solution by placing the bottle in warm water or holding it between your hands for a few minutes.Have your child lie on a flat surface with the infected ear facing up toward you. Use the recommended dosage. Have your child keep his or her head tilted with the infected ear up for about 2 minutes.
Because benzocaine is a numbing agent, it’s best if you can have someone else apply the drops to your ear. Avoid touching your ear with the dropper.Benzocaine may cause mild itchiness or redness. It has also been linked to a rare but serious condition that affects your blood’s oxygen levels. Never use more than the recommended dose of benzocaine, and consult your pediatrician to make sure that you give the right dosage to your child., Recurring otitis media may require a procedure called a myringotomy. Recurring means you have had three episodes in the past six months or four episodes in the past year, with at least one occurring in the past six months. An ear infection that does not clear up after treatment is also a candidate for this procedure.Ear tube surgery, or myringotomy, is an outpatient procedure. A surgeon inserts tiny tubes into the eardrum so fluids behind the eardrum can drain easier. The eardrum usually closes up again after the tube falls out or is removed., If you continue to have swollen adenoids, which are masses of tissue located behind the nasal cavity, they may need to be surgically removed."
"
Contact your doctor if the infection doesn’t improve after two days.,
See a doctor if the infection spreads or if you develop a fever.,
Have a doctor examine an infected cartilage piercing.,
Talk to the doctor about getting antibiotics.,
Ask for an allergy test.",How to Clean an Infected Ear Piercing2," Start by cleaning the infection twice a day at home. You should see signs of improvement, like reduced redness or swelling, after two days. If the infection worsens or shows no signs of improvement, schedule an appointment with your doctor or visit a healthcare clinic., Monitor the infection closely during the first day. See a doctor if the infection starts spreading beyond the piercing site or if you develop a fever. These could indicate a more serious infection that will require antibiotic treatment., Be extra cautious about dealing with an infected cartilage piercing, or a piercing at the top part of the ear. It’s better to be on the safe side and have a doctor look at infected cartilage sooner rather than later. Infected cartilage piercings are more likely to escalate, and they can lead to long-term deformities, such as ""cauliflower ear,"" which causes the cartilage to take on a bumpy appearance., When you visit your doctor, they’ll likely take a culture of the infection site. This will help them identify the type of bacteria that has caused the infection.Ask the doctor, “Do you recommend any antibiotics for this infection? What type of antibiotic is most effective for this type of bacterial infection?”
Do not wash or clean the piercing for at least 24 hours before seeing a doctor. The doctor will want to take a swab of the infected ear to diagnose it, and cleaning products can interfere with this test.

, Redness, swelling, itchiness, and other signs of infection can also be due to an allergy. If cultures come back negative, talk to your doctor about getting an allergy test.If you’ve never had a piercing before, you might find that you have a metal allergy. You can avoid allergic reactions to piercings by getting an earring that is nickel-free, as nickel is the most common metallic allergen.
Your doctor may refer you to an allergist for more specialized testing to identify what the allergy might be.

Avoid swimming after getting a new piercing.,
Keep hair away from the ear piercing.,
Disinfect your cell phone daily.,
Sleep without earrings after the piercings become permanent.,
Visit reputable clinics for new piercings.",How to Clean an Infected Ear Piercing3," Always avoid swimming for at least two weeks after getting a new piercing.Stay away from pools, lakes, and ocean water during that time, and clean the piercing with saline solution after taking a shower.You should also avoid swimming while treating an infected permanent piercing.

, If you have long hair, tie it back to keep it away from a new or infected piercing. Wash your hair more often than you ordinarily would.Take care not to get hairspray or gel in the piercing or to snag it when brushing your hair.

, Cell phones are covered with bacteria that can cause infections, so you should regularly disinfect your phone even if you’re not dealing with an infected piercing. Remove your phone’s case and clean both the case and the phone using a disinfecting wipe or paper towel sprayed with a cleaning solution.You should also sanitize any other phones you use.
You can also put your phone on speaker when people call. This will minimize how much you touch your ear.

, If your piercing is new, you should keep your first post in for six weeks and wear an earring at all times for six months. After six months, your piercing will become permanent. Once it’s permanent, you should take your earrings out at night to expose the channels to air and prevent infection., The cleaner the clinic you visit, the less likely your new piercing will become infected. Read reviews on piercing clinics and parlors before visiting. Make sure that the parlor is licensed. When you go to get a new ear piercing, watch to see that the staff wears latex gloves and ask if they have the proper machinery for sterilizing their equipment.It is not a good idea to get pierced at night markets or abroad while on vacation.
You should not have a friend pierce your ears for you at home, as they will not be able to properly sterilize their equipment.

Dampen a clean rag with warm water.,
Avoid getting the body of the earmuff wet.,
Wipe the ear cushions thoroughly with your soapy rag.,
Rinse and dry your earmuffs with paper towels.",How to Clean Ear Plugs2," Run a clean rag under warm running water. Wring the rag out over the sink to remove excess water from it. Apply a mild soap, like dish soap, to the rag. Rub the rag together to build up a light lather., Many earmuff style noise reducers have specially designed inner parts that can be damaged or compromised if wet. Refrain from submerging the muffs in water. Take care to prevent water from dripping into the earholes., Pay close attention to the folds in the cushions. Dirt, earwax, and dead skin often collect here. If dirt remains stubbornly stuck inside a crack or crevice, use a cotton swap dipped in warm, soapy water or a toothbrush., Dampen a clean towel with cool water and wipe away soap and remaining dirtiness from the muffs. Use a dry paper towel to dry any remaining moisture. Your earmuffs are now clean and ready to wear."

Rinse your ear plugs after using them.,
Allow plugs enough time to dry after swimming.,
Wash plugs in warm, soapy water.,
Store your ear plugs in their container.",How to Clean Ear Plugs3," Chlorine can remain on your ear plugs after a swim. This can cause your plugs to break down faster than normal. To keep your plugs in the best condition, rinse them thoroughly in non-chlorinated water after every swim., Putting your still wet plugs straight into a case, even after a quick rinse following a swim, could cause bacteria to grow in them. Your plugs should air dry completely before being stored in a container., Fill a small bowl with warm, soapy water and lightly agitate the solution to distribute the soap. With your clean fingers, a soft brush (like a toothbrush), or a towel, gently scrub the plugs. Lay the plugs on a clean towel to air dry.Clean your swimming earplugs when visibly dirty on an as-needed basis. For the cleanest plugs, you may want to clean them weekly or every other week.

, When not in use, your plugs should always be kept in their container. If your plugs didn’t come with a container or it got lost, use a small plastic container instead."

Soak your hands, feet or elbows in warm/hot water for ten minutes.,
Using a pumice stone, or foot file, scrub your calluses.,
Wash your feet/hands.,
Pat dry and rub lotion on your feet/hands.,
Maintain your soft hands/feet.",How to Get Rid of Calluses1," The skin should start to soften. You may add Epsom salts, bath oils, or even tea if you like, but they're not necessary.


Add 1 cup of apple cider vinegar if your calluses are harsh. (Warning: do not add vinegar if you have diabetes or poor circulation.);
, Be sure to periodically clean the stone or file. Do not overly scrub your feet/hands. 5 minutes is enough time. You want to slowly take down the callus over a month or so. If you begin to feel pain or after you have removed a couple layers of skin, stop.

, Make sure that you clean off all of the dead skin.

, Use a thick foot or hand lotion to hold in extra moisture. Lotions with Urea in them are particularly good.


If you are about to go to bed, put on socks or gloves to hold in the moisture and lotion.
Repeat this entire process at the end of every week.

, Reapply lotion to the callused area after showering. Use a thicker cream for the best results.

Determine if you need protection from water or sound.,
Consider your budget.,
Determine how many earplugs you need.,
Test different earplugs to see which you like best.",How to Choose Earplugs1," While some earplugs block out sound, others will protect your ear canal from water. Most earplugs don't have a duel purpose, so you should select the type of earplug that suits your specific situation. If you're in a loud environment, protecting your ears from excessive sound can help prevent hearing loss and other ear injuries.On the other hand, water in your ear can lead to ear infections, swimmers ear, and surfers ear, which are all conditions that can damage your ears over time and threaten your health.Decide on which kind of ear plugs you need and start searching for plugs designed specifically for your needs.


If you swim or dive, you should get earplugs to protect you from ear damage caused by water.
If you are a hunter, need help sleeping, are in the live music industry, or work construction, you may need noise canceling earplugs.;
, Figure out how much money you have to spend and how much money you're willing to spend on earplugs. Cheap, disposable earplugs can often get as low as a couple of cents per pair, while more expensive, custom earplugs can cost more than $150.If you swim often, however, purchasing one or two pairs of expensive earplugs rather than constantly buying disposable ones, can save you money over time. Figure out your price range and narrow down your decision.


Different brands of earplugs will have a different range of prices.

, Earplugs can come in pairs or can come in boxes with hundreds of pairs in them. Figure out how many earplugs you need based on your situation. If you are buying earplugs for a class or group of people, consider getting cheaper earplugs by the box. If they are for personal use, you can consider spending a little more for a nice pair of earplugs.

, Start by purchasing small, cheap quantities of various types of earplugs. Mimic the activity you'll be doing while wearing the earplugs. Take note of your comfort level as well as how secure the earplugs are in your ear. Talk, yawn, and move your jaw around to test how well the plugs stay in. If you can find a location that lets you test the plugs, take advantage. Once you find plugs that stay in and feel comfortable, you can see how well they work when doing activities.If testing the earplugs isn't an option for you, you can read customer reviews to get a sense for the quality and fit of the earplugs.

Keep all immunizations up-to-date.,
Keep your child’s hands, toys, and play surfaces clean.,
Avoid giving your child pacifiers.,
Breastfeed instead of bottle-feeding.,
Reduce your exposure to secondhand smoke.,
Don't abuse antibiotics.,
Avoid sending your child to daycare or take precautions.,
Eat a healthy diet that includes probiotics.",How to Cure an Ear Infection6," Many of the serious strains of bacterial infections can be prevented with immunizations. Seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines will likely help reduce ear infections.You and every member of your family should also get a flu vaccination every year. Vaccinating yourself will help keep both you and your family safer from infection.Experts recommend that you use the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children. Ask your pediatrician for advice., Wash your child's hands, toys and play surfaces frequently to reduce the likelihood of infection., Pacifiers can be vectors for bacteria, including bacteria that causes ear infections., Leakage is more likely to occur in bottle-feeding than it is in breastfeeding, making the transmission of bacteria higher.


Breastfeeding also boosts your child’s immune system, helping him or her to fight off infections easier.If bottle-feeding is necessary, place the child in an upright seat so that liquids drip down instead of possibly into their ear.Never give a baby a bottle while s/he is going down for a nap or to sleep at night., Do this both for the sake of preventing ear infections and for general health and safety.

, Prolonged usage of antibiotics can leave certain bacteria in your body or your child's body resistant to the effects of certain drugs. Only use antibiotics when prescribed by your doctor, or when other options aren't available., These facilities put your child at a 50% greater chance of developing an ear infection due to the common transmission of infections both bacterial and viral.If you cannot avoid sending your child to daycare, teach him or her a few tactics to help avoid the spread of infections such as colds, which can cause ear infections.Teach your child not to put toys or fingers in his or her mouth. S/he should avoid touching the face with his or her hands, especially mucous membrane areas such as the mouth, eyes, and nose. S/he should wash hands after eating and after using the bathroom., Eating a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins helps your body stay strong and healthy. Some research also suggests that ""good"" bacteria such as probiotics may help protect your body from infection.Acidophilus is a commonly studied strain of probiotic. You can find it in many yogurts.

Use aspirin to soften your calluses.,
Try baking soda.,
Put chamomile tea in your soak.,
Utilize cornstarch.,
Consider using vinegar.,
Put a pineapple to good use.",How to Get Rid of Calluses2," Crush five or six tablets of aspirin and mix them with one-half teaspoon (3 g) of lemon juice and water. Apply the resulting paste to the affected area, then wrap it with a warm towel and cover it with a plastic bag. Leave it for about ten minutes and then remove the coverings. Scrape off the calluses with a pumice stone.


Again, if you're diabetic, don't try this treatment. Also, if you're allergic to aspirin, do not use this method.

, One of the best ways you can treat corns and calluses is with a warm-water soak. This loosens the dead skin and helps with healing. Add 3 tablespoons baking soda to a basin of warm water and soak -- baking soda has a pH of 9 and is therefore alkaline and can disrupt the skin barrier.Or massage calluses with a paste of 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water., Soaking your feet in diluted chamomile tea can be soothing and will temporarily change the pH of the skin to help dry out sweaty feet. The tea will stain your feet, but the stain can be easily removed with soap and water., Sprinkle cornstarch between your toes to keep the area dry and protect the skin from breaking down. Moisture can make a corn or callus feel miserable and can promote fungal infections. This is more preventative than anything and should be used to eliminate discomfort.

, Soak a cotton ball in vinegar and tape it to your corn or callus. Leave the vinegar-soaked cotton on overnight. In the morning, rub the area with a pumice stone.Make sure to attach the cotton ball only to the callus itself. You don't want to irritate the skin around it that is doing just fine.

, Pineapple peel contains certain enzymes which help in softening corns and calluses and removing them from the skin. Place a small piece of fresh pineapple peel over the affected area and wrap a clean cloth around it. Do this every night for a week. You can also apply pineapple juice to the corns."

Change your footwear.,
Pad your shoes.,
Look into medicated solutions and pads.",How to Get Rid of Calluses3," One of the most common causes of calluses is simply that the wrong shoe is being worn. If your shoes fit badly, calluses are more likely to form -- so go get yours personally fitted. They should be snug (but not hurt) and cater to the width of your feet.


Avoid heels whenever possible; they put all your weight on the ball of your foot -- a recipe for calluses, indeed. Wear flats whenever you can; they're more comfortable, too.If the calluses are on your hands, wearing padded gloves with a comfortable fit will alleviate and lessen the problem of developing calluses. Make sure that the gloves fit well; very loose gloves will do the opposite and irritate your skin more through the constant friction they produce., Calluses, corns, and bunions are not an uncommon phenomenon; as a result, a bunch of companies have started making shoe liners designed to get rid of them. Many are made out of moleskin and easily slip into your shoes in the shapes of strips or patches.For corns, use doughnut-shaped pads. They fit over the corn, decreasing pressure, rubbing, and friction. They're cheap and easy to find at most convenience or drug stores., You don't necessarily have to go to a doctor to find medications to alleviate the problem; pads, plasters, and other medications can be found over-the-counter fairly easily. However, most of them contain salicylic acid as one of the active ingredients -- and this can cause irritation or infection that can be more annoying (or serious) than what you were originally dealing with. If you fit one of the following conditions, it's best to avoid these:If you have diabetes
If you have reduced feeling in your feet, either from circulation problems or from neurological damage
If you have poor eyesight or flexibility and may not be able to use the product properly

Determine the type of earplug that you need.,
Invest in custom earplugs if you spend a lot of time in the water.,
Choose moldable earplugs if you aren’t in the water frequently.,
Consider getting a swimming ear band for additional protection.",How to Choose Earplugs2," There are three main types of swimming earplugs and include custom swim plugs, moldable swim plugs, and cone plugs. Custom plugs are made by going to an ear doctor and getting a mold of your ear taken. Moldable ear plugs are the next best option and are made of a silicone or wax material and can be molded to the bowl of your ear. Cone plugs are inexpensive, but will not fit everyone's ears.Get moldable earplugs for kids that are growing up, as their ears will grow and will need to be refitted for plugs.
Moldable ear typically cost somewhere around $10 for a pack of two.
A popular moldable earplug brand is Mack's Pillow Soft.A popular brand of cone plugs are the Speedo Ergo Ear Plugs., If you swim often, are a professional swimmer, or find yourself in rough waters often, you may want to invest in custom earplugs. Custom earplugs create an airtight seal that will prevent water from going into your canal and fit perfectly since it's a mold of your ear.


Custom earplugs will cost more than disposable earplugs.
The average cost of custom earplugs will be somewhere around $150., If you're trying to save money moldable earplugs can be used for a one-time use. These earplugs act as a sort of putty and prevent water from going into your ear canal. These earplugs are great for those that go in the water sparingly. Moldable silicone earplugs can lose suction and fall out easily, so only go with these if you are in calm waters or shallow water.Reuse of moldable earplugs can be unhygienic because you can't clean them.

, A swimming ear band can create another layer of protection for your ears. These bands go around your head and fit over your ears and earplugs and prevent water from entering your ear canal. These are especially useful for smaller children, who often touch or adjust their earplugs."
"
Consider the noise reduction rating or NRR.,
Select disposable earplugs for a single use situation.,
Use reusable earplugs if you can afford them.,
Go with custom earplugs if you spend time in noisy environments.,
Compare different brands of earplugs.,
Take the comfort level into account.",How to Choose Earplugs3," The noise reduction rating is the number of decibels that your earplugs are blocking out. Being exposed to an environment with over 90 decibels of sound can be dangerous for your ears and hurt your hearing. Take a look at the decibel rating on the product's packaging or information page online. To determine whether you can block out enough sound, take the NRR rating, subtract the number by 7 and divide by two.Then take this number and subtract it from the likely decibel rating in the environment that you're in.


For example, 33dB earplugs at a rock concert at 100 decibels would reduce your decibel by (33-7)/2 = 13, thus reducing your exposure to noise to around 87 dB.
A rock concert can expose you to 150 decibels, and a jackhammer can expose you to around 130 decibels.
Things like the lawnmower, the subway, and construction saws can reach 100 dB.

, Disposable earplugs are the most affordable type of earplug. These earplugs are often made of foam and are a good quick solution for situations where you find yourself surrounded by loud noise. If there is an event that you need to attend, or if your job requires you to be in noisy environments occasionally, consider disposable earplugs.


A box of 200 pairs of disposable earplugs cost around $30.

, Reusable earplugs are a bit more expensive than disposable earplugs and fit inside of your ear. If you have trouble keeping disposable earplugs in your ear or want a tighter fit, reusable earplugs may be your best option.


If you aren't in noisy environments all throughout the year but do attend live concerts or other loud environments occasionally, consider investing a little extra to get this moderately priced earplug.
The cost of reusable earplugs is somewhere between $100-$200 for a box of 200., If you know that you have to be in a noisy environment regularly, custom earplugs may be your best bet, as they can cancel all noise that you might hear. These earplugs require you to take a mold of your ear and ear canal so they can fit tightly in your ears.Custom molded earplugs cost around $150., Different brands of earplugs will cost different amounts and be more and less effective. Read customer reviews online of the possible brands of earplug that you want to purchase. Eliminate brands that get overwhelmingly negative reviews or that don't cancel enough sound.


Popular noise canceling earplug brands include DUBS Acoustic Filters, ETY-Plugs, and Macks Acoustic Foam Earplugs., The comfort level of the earplugs will need to be different depending on what you're using them for. For instance, if you're using them to block out sound while you sleep, it's important that they are comfortable and stay in your ears even when you toss and turn. Other times it won't matter as much because you'll only have your earplugs in temporarily. Try out different brands of earplugs and choose ones that match your required comfort level."

Check the surface of the body for hard thick skin.,
Test joint mobility and flexibility.",How to Diagnose Stiff Skin Syndrome1," Stiff Skin Syndrome is characterized by the development of hard thick skin. This typically develops across the entire surface of the body on young children. The symptoms may begin to show immediately at birth or at some point during the child’s life, usually before the age of six. It typically does not develop after adolescence., The development of hard and thick skin across the body can often be accompanied by limited joint mobility. In some cases the joints may become so stiff that they get stuck in a particular position and are unable to move.For example, an arm may be stuck in a bent position as a result of the stiffening of the elbow joint.
This can also impact posture if the spine becomes bent.

"
Use medicated creams or ointments.,
Consider laser therapy.,
Try cryotherapy.,
Ask about dermabrasion.,
Try a chemical peel.,
Use onion and vinegar.,
Use aloe vera.,
Apply a turmeric face mask.,
Care for your skin.,
Determine if you have age spots.,
Seek a professional opinion.",How to Get Rid of Age Spots," Depending on specific factors, your doctor might prescribe medicated creams or ointments to help remove your age spots. Many of these creams will bleach your skin and lighten the color of the age spots until they match better with the rest of your skin. Medicated creams sometimes also contain a steroid that will temper the effect of the bleaching compound.


Keep in mind the best person to help you treat age spots is a dermatologist, as they specialize in skin care. Ask your primary physician for a referral to a dermatologist who will work with you to reduce age spots.
If you are prescribed medical bleaching cream, you will probably also be advised to use sunscreen of 30 SPF or higher at the same time, as this specific medication can make skin more susceptible to burning/sun damage.
Medicated creams can have a number of side effects, including itching, redness, and dry skin.
Medicated ointments might not be able to completely match the bleached age spots with your skin. Your skin could appear bleached and blotchy. ;
, Another course of action your doctor might recommend is that you rely on laser therapy to remove or lighten age spots. Laser therapy will destroy the cells that darken your skin (melanocytes) without damaging your overall skin. When thinking about laser therapy, consider:Laser therapy usually requires several treatments to be effective.
Laser therapy can be much more expensive than other treatments.
Results won’t be immediate and will take weeks or months to show.
Laser therapy can also produce a discolored appearance in your skin.

, Cryotherapy is the process in which age spots are frozen using liquid nitrogen and other chemicals. The result of cryotherapy is that the pigment of age spots are destroyed. In the end, the skin will heal and will better resemble the skin color surrounding the spot in question.


Cryotherapy is often done one time on a single area.
Results from cryotherapy can take several weeks to materialize.
Cryotherapy is often more expensive than medicated creams and cheaper than laser therapy.
Cryotherapy will temporarily irritate your skin.
Like with medicated creams and laser therapy, cryotherapy can cause scarring and permanent discoloration., Dermabrasion is another procedure that your doctor or dermatologist will consider. In a dermabrasion procedure, your doctor will essentially sand down the top layer of your skin. This often removes the darker skin and allows the opportunity for new and lighter skin to grow back in its place.


Dermabrasion may cause you pain and may be uncomfortable.
Dermabrasion will create temporary redness and scabbing.
Results will take several weeks until new and healthy skin has regrown., During a chemical peel, your dermatologist will apply a chemical solution that causes minor, controlled skin damage, removing the outer layer of skin and encouraging cell turnover and the growth of new skin. This can reduce the appearance of age spots and may also make your skin look smoother and less wrinkled.There are chemical peels available over-the-counter for use at home, but this is a procedure best performed by a trained professional, as they can determine the right type of peel for your skin type and the right depth of peel.

After the procedure you will experience redness followed by scaling three to seven days after the procedure. You may also experience swelling and minor irritation.
A medium or deep peel will cause the skin to blister. These blisters will crust, turn brown, and peel off between seven to 14 days after the procedure.
There is a risk for temporary or permanent change in skin color, scarring, or activation of cold sores when you get a chemical peel.
Avoid using medications such a Retin-A, Renova or glycolic acid before the procedure.

, Some people have had good results using onion and vinegar to remove age spots. Take 1 tsp of onion juice and 2 tsp of vinegar and mix them together. When doing this, make sure that they are mixed very well. Take a whisk or a spoon and whip and beat the mixture thoroughly for one to three minutes.


Make sure your vinegar and onion juice are mixed well.
Dampen a soft cloth with the mixture.
Wipe the dampened cloth over your age spots.
Repeat this every day until you notice a difference. It will likely take months of consistent use to notice a difference.
Try an alternative way for using this method by cutting an onion in half and dipping the cut side into a small dish of vinegar to soak up the liquid. Then rub the half onion on the spots., Aloe vera is renowned for its curative properties and the wonder it does helping skin heal. As a result, many people have seen great results treating age spots with aloe vera.


Apply a light coat of aloe to age spots two times a day.
Results should take several weeks to more than a month.
Avoid contact with your eyes., Turmeric is viewed in many parts of the world as a spice that has very helpful curative properties. In this vein, many people also use turmeric to help fight age spots. To use turmeric to fight age spots and to make a face mask:


Mix ¼ teaspoon of turmeric and 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of chickpea flour. Add ½ teaspoon of carrier oil, ½ teaspoon of whole milk and a squirt of lemon juice and/or cucumber juice.
Produce a paste and apply to your face.
Let sit for 10 – 20 minutes or until dry.
Remove with warm water and repeat up to twice a week., In most cases, age spots are caused by sun damage, general health problems, or environmental issues. Even if you already have age spots, you need to take immediate action to prevent more and to care for your skin. Ultimately, try not to view treatment for age spots as an end in itself — your end should be good skin and overall health. Consider:


Wearing sunscreen every day. Sunscreen will help reduce the probability of future age spots and/or skin cancer. Look for a sunscreen with broad spectrum coverage and an SPF of at least 30.
Try to cover up when you are outdoors. Even if you’re not in direct sunlight, sun can still damage your skin. Make sure to wear a hat, long-sleeves, and pants whenever possible.
Embrace proper nutrition. Poor nutrition can cause poor skin health or heighten the dangers of sun damage. Make sure you have enough of the proper vitamins and nutrition you need to ensure skin health. See your doctor for more information.

, Before you even consider treating your age spots, you need to consider if you actually have age spots or if they are something potentially more dangerous. Any skin abnormality should be evaluated by your primary care physician, who can then refer you to a dermatologist if necessary. There are a variety of skin issues that are associated with old age or poor health and they all require different treatment. Consider:


Age spots. Age spots are darkened areas on the skin caused by exposure to the sun.
Skin lesions. Skin lesions are rashes and similar problems with the skin caused by allergies to certain chemicals and/or poor nutrition.
Melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. These types of cancers are also linked to sun damage. They may look a lot like age spots and you should consult a doctor if you see the appearance of new dark skin or any other skin problems., Age spots are fairly common. As a result, the medical profession has developed a number of treatments that are effective in removing them. Before you do anything else, you should contact your doctor or dermatologist and let them know about your concerns. They can determine if the skin damage is benign. Depending on a variety of factors, your doctor will determine what treatment is the best course of action for you. Factors may depend on:Your age.
Your overall health.
Your financial situation.
The level of health risk you are willing to put yourself through

Watch for side effects.,
Report any side effects you or your child encounter.,
Check for evidence of immunity against the varicella virus.",How to Get Immunized Against Chicken Pox," Adults who work with children, health care providers, and people who live with an immunocompromised person should also get the vaccine, as well as any adults who have never had chickenpox. People who travel internationally, especially to those countries that do not vaccinate against the varicella virus, should be vaccinated., If you or your child is more than mildly ill, do not get the vaccine. People who cannot fight infections, such as those with cancer or HIV, should not get the chickenpox immunization. Also, people who have allergic reactions to vaccine components or who have a congenital hereditary immunodeficiency should not get the chickenpox vaccine. Finally, if you are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant, you should not receive the vaccine, since it could have a negative impact on fetal development.Common vaccine ingredients that could produce an allergic reaction include gelatin, eggs, and yeast — though people with egg allergies may still be able to be vaccinated (talk to your doctor). People who are allergic to the antibiotic neomycin should not get vaccine. Latex allergies might also make getting immunized difficult since latex is a component of the syringe used to administer the vaccine.People who are taking steroids or other medications that affect the immune system for longer than two weeks should not get the vaccine.
Your doctor will tell you if you or your child are able to receive the chickenpox vaccine.

, There are two vaccines available to immunize against chickenpox. One immunizes against chickenpox alone, and is appropriate for anyone over twelve months old. The other vaccine (MMRV) immunizes against measles, mumps, and rubella in addition to immunizing against chickenpox. This vaccine, however, can only be used by individuals between one and twelve years old.Choose the right vaccination for your child. If your child has already been fully immunized against measles, mumps, and rubella, you will not need the combination vaccine.
Consult your doctor about which vaccine your child should receive. The doctor will use the child’s medical history to develop an appropriate vaccination schedule.

, Ask your insurance provider if chickenpox immunization is covered. If your insurance doesn't cover the vaccine, there are many options available for free or discounted vaccinations. Check with your local health department to determine if and when they offer immunizations.


The Vaccines for Children program offers free vaccinations to individuals 18 and under who are eligible for Medicaid, Native Americans, or who do not have health insurance.Talk to a pediatrician if you believe your child qualifies.
Public health clinics, religious centers like mosques and churches, and schools and universities often offer common vaccinations (including chickenpox immunization) at little or no cost.
If none of these options are readily available, visit www.healthcare.gov to investigate your options for enrolling in health insurance through the public Marketplace website., Contact a vaccination clinic near you. Whether you visit a university health center, a doctor, or another venue to receive your vaccination, you can only get the chickenpox vaccine from a licensed medical practitioner.


Check www.vaccines.gov/getting/where/ for a database of vaccination providers near you.
Your doctor might recommend your child see a pediatrician to get vaccinated.

, If your child is under 13 years old, she will require two doses of the chickenpox vaccine.The first dose should be administered when the child is between 12 and 15 months old, but can be given at any time after 12 months old.

, The second dose of shots should be administered at least three months after the first dose; however, ensure your child receives the second dose before turning six years old if possible.


If your child is at least 13 years old, he can receive his second dose 28 days after his first dose., You might need only one dose, rather than the more traditional two doses. Talk to your doctor about when and how you can get immunized for more information.

, Common side effects include fever or fatigue. You may notice a rash up to one month after the chickenpox vaccine is administered, and may experience soreness or swelling on the site where you received the vaccine shot. More serious, but very rare side effects include shock, thrombocytopenia (blood disorder), seizures, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and infection with chickenpox.


Additional serious (but still rare) side effects from the chickenpox vaccine include seizures, pneumonia, loss of balance, and severe allergic reactions.People who have received the chickenpox immunization may get a mild form of the virus and can still spread the disease to those who are not protected, but this too is rare.A high fever, behavioral changes, or an allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face or throat, arrhythmia, or dizziness) should be reported to your doctor immediately. If the reaction is severe or the person experiences difficulty breathing, call 911 for emergency services., There are two programs that you can take advantage of if you or your child experiences adverse effects due to your immunization. The first is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Their site, https://vaers.hhs.gov/index will let you submit information to a national database to help health professionals track negative side effects and minimize them in the future.


The second is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP). The NVICP allows you to file a petition with the agency and potentially receive financial recompense if you believe you or your child were harmed by a vaccine.Visit their site at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html for more info.

, Once you’ve been vaccinated against chickenpox, or been infected with the virus, you will develop an immunity. Your doctor may recommend testing if you have problems with your immune system, or if you are unsure if you have had chickenpox or the vaccine. This can be done by having a blood test to determine if you have varicella antibodies.


If you’re unsure about your medical history and want to know if you have an immunity to varicella, ask a family member who might know like your mother or father.
You could also check your personal medical records for evidence of either a chickenpox vaccination or treatment.
Immunization for shingles (herpes zoster) could also constitute evidence of immunity to chickenpox."

Recognize causes of dry skin.,
Write down patterns to your dry skin.,
Recognize if you use harsh detergent or soaps.,
Pay attention to your bathing habits.,
Watch skin exposed to the elements.,
Keep underlying conditions in mind.,
Consider your medications.,
Eliminate potential causes of dry skin.",How to Diagnose the Cause of Dry Skin1," In most cases, environmental factors cause dry skin. However, other skin conditions can also cause dry skin. Causes of dry skin include:


Weather, especially when it is cold.
Heat from central heating, wood burning stoves, or space heaters.
Harsh soaps and detergents.
Long, hot baths and showers.
Swimming in heavily-chlorinated pools.
Underlying skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and lichen.Dehydration.;
, Keep a diary if you experience the symptoms dry skin. Note when you notice or feel any dry skin as well as what helps or worsens it. This can help gain an overall picture of when you have dry skin as well as identify the specific cause of your dry skin., Bathing and daily tasks such as laundry can expose you to soaps, body washes, and detergents. If you experience any symptoms, such as tightening skin patches, after coming in contact with a soap or detergent, note it in your diary. These could be a cause of your dry skin.Note what soap or detergent you used that caused the symptoms of dry skin. Every soap and detergent has various ingredients and your skin may react to different ones. For example, “Skin felt fine when I woke up. After shampooing two clients with clarifying shampoo, I started to feel tightness in my hands and wrists. Used a light hand lotion and this helped until I used the shampoo again.”

, Most people like a calming hot shower or bath. However, hot water can strip skin of its natural oils and cause dry skin. Take note of how your skin feels when you get out of the bath or shower. Also pay attention to how your skin feels after you pat or air dry it. These can indicate if your dry skin is a result of your bathing habits.Recognize that swimming—in a chlorinated pool or natural body of water—may also be a cause of your dry skin.
Keep in mind that the combination of hot water and harsh soaps can also contribute to dry skin. Using a mild soap can help you determine if the water or soap is the cause of your dry skin.

, Dry skin is often worse in the winter. However, being exposed to air conditioning during the summer can also reduce the amount of water in your skin. Keeping an eye on any skin that is exposed to low temperatures and the low humidity associated with very hot and dry heating can help you identify if atmospheric conditions are the cause of your dry skin.Look for differences in areas exposed to cold or dry heat and those protected by clothing.
For example, if you ski, check if the skin on your face is drier than the rest of your body after a day on the slopes. If it is, the cold weather may be the cause of your dry skin. Likewise, if you use space heaters or wood-burning fires in your home, see how proximity to the heat source affects your skin. Note if your dry skin eases if you sit farther away from the heater or fireplace.

, In some cases, underlying conditions, such as menopause or eczema, can cause or exacerbate dry skin. If have or are experiencing symptoms of dry skin, the following conditions may make either worse:Atopic dermatitis, or eczema.
Psoriasis.
Menopause.Hypothyroidism.
Hyperthyroidism.
Dehydration.Diabetes.
Kidney disease and dialysis., Just like underlying conditions, certain medications can cause dry skin or make it worse. Recognizing what medications can temporarily cause dry skin can help you determine the source of your specific case. Some medications that can cause dry skin include:Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide.Topical retinoids such as Retin-A.
Systemic retinoids.
Cholesterol medications such as pravastatin and simvastatin.

, If you suspect a specific environmental factor is causing your dry skin, remove it from your usual routine. Repeat this process until you can diagnose the cause of your dry skin. Some ways to eliminate potential causes of dry skin include:Wearing gloves if your hands are in water often or exposed to soaps or detergents.
Switching out cleansers for milder, unscented products.
Turning down the water temperature in showers and baths.
Taking shorter baths and showers.
Choosing non-alcohol based products.
Avoiding anti-bacterial products.
Considering alternative medications.
Covering exposed skin.

Talk with your doctor.,
Have a genetic test performed.,
Record your family medical history.",How to Diagnose Stiff Skin Syndrome2," If you suspect that your child is displaying symptoms associated with Stiff Skin Syndrome, you should talk with your doctor. This is a very rare genetic disorder and must be diagnosed by a medical professional. In order to diagnose a genetic disease, your doctor will look at the family history, symptoms, conduct a physical exam, and order laboratory testing., In order to diagnose Stiff Skin Syndrome, patients will need to have a genetic test performed. The disease is caused by genetic mutations that prevent the development of elastic fibers that help the skin, ligaments, and blood vessels move.In order to complete a genetic test the patient will need to provide a sample of blood, hair, skin, or another tissue for genetic analysis., Family medical history is often important when diagnosing genetic diseases. Gather information about your family’s medical histories. For example, provide your doctor with information regarding any major illnesses or diseases that may be hereditary within your family. Try and provide information about the medical history of multiple generations.Begin collecting and recording your family history in a database. There are online forms that can help you record your family history. For example, try this site: https://familyhistory.hhs.gov/FHH/html/index.html

Try physiotherapy.,
Purchase a walking aid or wheelchair.,
Join a support group.,
Take part in clinical trials.",How to Diagnose Stiff Skin Syndrome3," To date there is no known cure for Stiff Skin Syndrome, and instead patients must try and manage their symptoms. One of the most effective management strategies is physiotherapy. Because Stiff Skin Syndrome inhibits joint mobility, physiotherapy is used to help maintain or even improve joint movement.Physiotherapists will work on providing patients with a variety of stretches and strength exercises that will target the region of the body that is most impacted by the disease.

, Depending on the severity of the disease, your child may have severe mobility issue. If this is the case, you can purchase a walking aid such as a cane to help with their mobility. In some cases joints may become so stiff that walking is no longer possible. Use a wheelchair to help with mobility.


Look into government funding options for expensive aids, such as wheelchairs.

, There are numerous support groups available for patients and family members to meet other people experiencing the same rare disease. These groups allow individuals to share their stories and experiences. Many of these groups also engage in awareness-raising activities, and gather information for patients.Try contacting one of these foundations to find a support group: Children’s Skin Disease Foundation, National Marfan Foundation, Scleroderma Research Foundation.

, Stiff Skin Syndrome is a very rare disease and doctors are still trying to find ways to manage and cure the disease. As a result, there may be opportunities to participate in clinical trials. Check the website clinicaltrials.gov to learn more about participating in a clinical trial.Talk with your doctor about joining a clinical trial.

Schedule an appointment with your doctor.,
Undergo an examination.,
Get tests for underlying issues.,
Consider seeing a dermatologist.",How to Diagnose the Cause of Dry Skin2," Most lifestyle and home remedies will relieve dry skin. If you continue to have dry skin even after home care, see your doctor as soon as possible. Your healthcare professional can diagnose the cause of your dry skin and develop the best treatment plan for you.You should also see a doctor if you:


Have dry skin with redness.
Dryness and/or itching interrupt your sleep.
Have open sores or infections from cracks or scratching.
Have large areas of peeling or scaling skin.

, Your doctor will conduct a thorough examination of your skin. This will help your doctor feel or notice any particular symptoms of dry skin you have. An exam may also include answering questions your doctor has about your dry skin.Take your doctor any notes you have about your dry skin. Let the doctor know when the condition started and what makes it worse or better. You may also want to let your doctor know about any other factors that could contribute to your dry skin. Tell your doctor about things such as bathing and eating habits, medications, and other health issues such thyroid disease.Answer any questions your doctor asks honestly. Don’t be ashamed of any information that may help your doctor, who is asking questions to best help you.

, If your dry skin is especially severe or has no clear cause, your doctor may order diagnostic tools such as a blood tests or examining skin flakes or scales under a microscope.These can identify the specific cause of your dry skin, including underlying causes such as hormonal imbalances caused by menopause or hypothyroidism.

, A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the skin. Your regular doctor may suggest seeing a dermatologist if your skin doesn’t heal with medical treatment. A dermatologist can often more definitively diagnose a specific skin condition or issue and provide alternative types of treatment for your specific case."

Identify any foods that may have caused your allergy.,
Identify any body-care products that could have caused your allergy.,
Reduce the daily amount of stress in your life.,
Check yourself for injuries.,
Move on to treating the hives directly.",How to Get Rid of Hives Naturally1," Hives are most often caused by an allergic reaction, and food allergies are a common type of allergen.Check if you’ve eaten any new foods that you could have a previously unknown allergy to.
If the hives are recurring or you’re concerned about a food allergy, you should see your doctor.;
, If you doubt that a food allergy caused you to break out in hives, the reaction may have been caused by a chemical ingredient in a product. Check to see if you have started using a new:


Shampoo or conditioner.
Body soap or body wash.
Medicine, such as aspirin or penicillin (as these can also produce a reaction that causes hives)., Frequent stress can also cause an outbreak of hives.


If you identify specific stressors (especially if your stress developed around the time that your hives broke out), try to eliminate the stressors.These stressors could be related to your personal life or work life, relationships, lifestyle, etc.
To reduce stress, increase the amount and quality of your nightly sleep, and spend more time exercise daily.
Also eat a more balanced diet, and take time during your daily schedule to relax and think positively about your life.

, Infections that result from poorly healed injuries can sometimes cause your body to break out in hives—this does not mean that the hives will break out on the infected area itself.An infection—internal or external—in any part of your body could be responsible for your breakout of hives.
To examine yourself, examine every part of your body in detail. Keep in mind that injuries sustained months ago—which could appear healed—may be internally infected.
If you have reason to suspect an internal injury or infection, you should talk to your doctor.

, Ultimately, you may not be able to determine the specific food or product that caused your hives. Hives can be caused by nearly any allergen, including sunlight, dust, and medications.If you cannot identify a specific allergen, don’t waste too much time investigating other allergens.

Look for large blisters on the skin and the oral cavity, especially in people between the ages between 40 and 60 years..,
If there are large blisters on the skin but not in the oral cavity, consider the possibility of bullous pemphigoid in older patients.,
Look for erythematous vesicles in younger subjects.,
Check for the symptoms of lupus: Butterfly-shaped rash (malar rash) on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose, skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure, mouth sores, and hair loss (alopecia).This disorder can affect many organs in the body including the skin.,
Learn to recognize the symptoms of idiopathic skin diseases (skin diseases that are idiopathic or their etiology is not known).",How to Examine a Person for Skin Autoimmune Disorders," This is a major characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris. This is a chronic disease which is mediated by Immunoglobulin G antibody or IgG. Immunoglobulin G is thought to react in the skin in such a way as to break intercellular junctions of the epidermis and in particular that of keratinocytes. This leads in turn to separation of these cells from each other, a process which is called acantholysis. This in turn leads to the formation of vesicles that contain keratinocytes. There are accompanying to this disease several systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss. This is a potentially life threatening disorder that can lead to death if left untreated. Treatment of this disorder includes the administration of drugs that suppress the action of the immune system such as steroids. If you suspect this is the disorder you are identifying, try to make sure the person receives medical attention as quickly as possible.;
, It differs than pemphigus vulgaris in that it usually affects persons between the ages of 60 and 80. It differs than pemphigus vulgaris also by the lack of oral lesions. It is however, similar to pemphigus vulgaris in that it is mediated by the action of immunoglobulin G also. It is thought to deposit in the skin basement membrane. This causes the basal cells to detach from the dermal layer of the skin. This in turn leads to the formation of subcutaneous vesicles which contain predominantly white blood cells.

, This disease is common between the ages of 20 to 40 years. This disorder has strong association with gluten induced enteritis or celiac disease. In spite of the apparent link between the two disorders removal of gluten from the diet does not improve the dermatitis. It is mediated by the action of immunoglobulin A instead of immunoglobulin G. Clinically speaking, this is a chronic disease with relapses and remission. The treatment to this condition is also by suppression of the overactive immune system with steroids.

, Skin pathology in this condition can arise as a separate condition or accompanied by other organs in the body. The isolated skin disorder is called discoid lupus erythematosus while that involves other organs is called systemic lupus erythematosus. They differ by the fact that systemic lupus erythematosus has a deposition of immunoglobulin G in the basement membrane of the skin of both diseased and healthy skin, while discoid lupus erythematosus is manifested by deposition of IgG in the affected area only.

,


Psoriasis. This disorder is as was mentioned idiopathic in which its cause is unknown. The disease is common and affects approximately 1% of the total population. It has a chronic course with remissions and exacerbations. Often the nails of affected persons are involved. The disorder is manifested by the excessive formation of keratinocytes in the basal layer of the skin. This leads in turn to more formation of keratin and its deposition in the epidermis. This disorder is sometimes linked to joint diseases that are similar to rheumatoid arthritis.
Lichen planus. This disorder has a chronic course in which women are more affected than men. This disorder is manifested by a decrease in cell proliferation. This leads in turn to more keratin formation with hyperkeratosis.
Erythema multiforme. This disorder is a common disease and can affect people with any age. It is associated with many disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI).,
Determine your ideal weight range.,
Eat complex carbohydrates.,
Reduce your sugar intake.,
Avoid skipping meals.,
Eat foods high in omega-3s.,
Include more fruits, vegetables, and legumes.,
Prepare your own food from scratch.,
Cut back or eliminate alcohol.,
Avoid foods that are bad for your heart and increase inflammation.,
Talk with your doctor.,
Make sure you eat foods you enjoy.,
Consider supplementing with vitamin D. If your doctor has prescribed a topical ointment for your psoriasis, it might contain vitamin D. Ask your doctor about taking a vitamin D supplement.,
Exercise to help lose weight.,
Plan your meals.",How to Follow the Right Diet for Psoriasis," Your BMI is a number used to indicate your level of body fat. Use an online BMI calculator to find your BMI. All you'll need to enter is your weight and height. Ranges have been created to show which numbers are healthy, overweight, or obese.The BMI is simply a diagnostic tool that should give you an idea of your weight loss or maintenance goals. It's not an indicator of overall health.;
, If you're in a normal weight range, try to maintain your weight by eating the same number of calories. But, if you're overweight, consider what BMI weight range would be normal for you. Determine how many pounds you should lose and figure on cutting 500 calories a day to lose one pound a week. Aim for gradual weight loss, not a crash diet.For example, if you're 5'7"" and you weigh 180 lbs, your BMI is in the overweight range. Your healthy range would be 118 to 159 lbs, so you should lose a minimum of 21 lbs.

, Whole grains and complex carbohydrates have anti-inflammatory antioxidants and are high in fiber that can regulate your blood sugar and reduce inflammation. At least 90 to 95% of the carbohydrates you eat should be complex. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods like:Whole grains
Peas
Lentils
Beans
Vegetables

, Read food labels and pay attention to how much sugar you consume. In general, women should eat no more than two tablespoons of sugar a day and men shouldn't eat more than three tablespoons a day. Sugar can contribute to being overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese has been scientifically linked to an increased risk for psoriasis.A good rule of thumb is no “white” foods. Eat no white bread, white pasta, or white rice. You should also avoid candies, cookies, cakes and other confections.

, It's easy to think that just skipping breakfast will help you cut out your extra calories for the day. Unfortunately, skipping meals will only make you hungrier later and you'll be more likely to overeat or make unhealthy food choices. Try to eat meals throughout the day, just cut back on the portion sizes. Breakfast is especially important for starting the day in a healthy way.Studies have linked skipping meals with obesity.

, Omega-3s are fatty acids which are healthy fats that reduce inflammation and improve heart and brain health. Eating omega-3s can manage inflammation that causes your psoriasis. Eat wild-caught fish like salmon, cod, haddock, and tuna twice a week. You can also get omega-3s from flaxseeds. Include one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds at every meal.Your body best digests flaxseeds when they're ground. Use a coffee or spice grinder to grind your flaxseeds and keep pre-ground flaxseeds (also called flaxseed meal) in your refrigerator or freezer to keep them from getting rancid. You can buy whole and ground flaxseeds in health food stores.
Other oils that are high in omega-3 fatty acids include vegetable oils such as soybean and canola oil. Canola oil is a good oil to cook with because it is affordable and does not have an aftertaste, but it is high in good fat.

, Try to eat at least three to five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Keep changing the colors of the produce and eat different types so you get a full range of nutrients. Beans and legumes are also anti-inflammatory, so try to eat one to three servings a day. Try to eat a rainbow of color when it comes to fruits and vegetables. Other good anti-inflammatory choices include:Carrots
Squash
Sweet potatoes
Kale
Broccoli
Berries (blueberries, blackberries, strawberries)
Cherries

, Processed foods often contain preservatives, fats, added sugars, and food dyes. Many foods also have antibiotics, hormones, or pesticides. These can all build up in your body and irritate your skin. Try to do most of your cooking from scratch so you can control exactly what you're eating.


Choose organic food as often as possible since it isn't produced using hormones, pesticides, or antibiotics., Alcohol consumption can cause an imbalance within the immune system and lead to more psoriatic outbreaks. That is why it is a good idea to reduce your alcohol intake or stop drinking alcohol. This is especially important if your psoriasis is severe. Drinking alcohol could also interact with medications you're taking which could be dangerous.Don't forget that while you should cut back on alcohol, you should increase your intake of water. Try to drink one to two liters or six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day., While research conflicts about whether certain foods can make your inflammation worse, many people believe that eating specific foods can increase inflammation. These foods include:Fatty red meats. Although you can include a small amount of red meat if it is grass-fed since grass-fed beef has higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids (the anti-inflammatory fats).
Dairy products.
Processed and prepackaged foods.
Refined sugars.
Nightshade vegetables, such as potatoes, tomatoes and peppers.
Gluten products. A number of studies have shown that up to 25% of people with psoriasis are gluten sensitive.Try going gluten-free for at least six to eight weeks to see if it helps your psoriasis.

, Any time you start a new diet, want to take supplements, or are beginning a new exercise regimen, you should consult with your doctor. This is especially important if you're taking any medications, since some supplements can interact with your prescriptions.Your doctor will help you create a diet or workout routine that's suited to your particular needs.

, It's harder to stick to a diet if you feel like you're constantly depriving yourself of food you enjoy. If you practice moderation, you'll be more likely to stick to the diet. This means you can enjoy a little of a food that you consider to be a treat, just don't eat it every day.Don't think of certain foods as off limits. This may only make you want to eat them even more. Instead, think of them as foods you should rarely eat.

, It's been shown to change the way your cells grow and can slow them down (which is helpful since psoriasis increases the growth of cells). Moderate levels of vitamin D can also help your body fight inflammation. Take 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D daily or eat:Fish, such as cod liver oil, salmon, mackerel, tuna.
Dairy, such as milk, fortified yogurt, Swiss cheese.
Fortified cereals and juices.
Eggs.

, If you're watching your calorie intake and burning calories through exercise, you'll lose weight. Being overweight can contribute to the inflammation that's causing your psoriasis. Research shows that losing weight can make your treatments for psoriasis more effective.Since psoriasis is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, losing weight can be an important way to improve your risk factors for heart disease.
Exercise for 150 minutes or 21/2 hours every week.Do an activity that is of moderate intensity, such as swimming, brisk walking, or riding a bike. Activities like gardening and doing physical labor may also count if you are moving around enough. Try to do a 30 minute workout session on five days of every week.

, If you lead an active life, you know that it can be hard to find time to eat, let alone eat a nutritious meal. Take the time to plan your meals before your week gets too busy. Even taking five minutes to plan the next day's meals will mean that you're more likely to make healthy choices. You'll also be less likely to just grab prepacked convenience foods.Planning your meals is also a good way to keep track of the foods you're eating throughout the week. A food journal is a great way to be accountable to yourself and your dieting goals.

Take naturally occurring antihistamines.,
Consume foods that are high in vitamin C. Vitamin C is an effective antihistamine, and will have the same hive-reducing effect as will the antihistamine pills.,
Drink tea that is high in antihistamines.",How to Get Rid of Hives Naturally2," Naturally occurring antihistamines will help relieve the discomfort caused by hives. Antihistamines will also diminish the amount of fluid under your skin (which is what causes the visual bumps associated with hives).


There are plenty of herbal antihistamine capsules available at health-food stores or drug stores.
Look for pills that contain stinging nettle or coltsfoot., Foods high in vitamin C include:


Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruits, etc.)
Green, leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and kale.Berries and tomatoes.

, Many herbs contain helpful antihistamines, and herbal tea is an easy way to intake plenty of healthy herbs.

Stay out of the heat.,
Don’t wear tight-fitting clothing.,
Administer Aloe Vera.,
Take a cool bath.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Get Rid of Hives Naturally3," Heat itself can often cause a break of hives. Even if the heat did not cause your hives directly, it can still exacerbate the hives and increase the amount of discomfort that they cause.


If you are outdoors, go inside as soon as possible.
If you are engaging in physical activity, stop what you’re doing, sit down, and rest.

, Extra snug clothes—especially shirts and pants—will not only rub against your hives and cause them to itch more, but they’ll also be more likely to irritate your skin and cause hives in the first place.


Wear loose-fitting clothes.Wear lightweight clothing; this will prevent your skin from heating up.

, Aloe Vera can commonly be found in lotions and skin creams, and it will help relieve the itchy discomfort from your hives. The aloe will also reduce the inflammation of the hives themselves.


If you have access to an aloe plant, you can apply the leaves to your skin directly. To do this, cut the aloe leaf in half, then apply the clear gel directly onto the hives. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse with cold water., For most cases of hives, the temperature of cool bath water will relieve the symptoms of discomfort.The cool bath will also shrink the blood vessels near the surface of your skin. This will cause them to leak less fluid into the hives, and will consequently reduce the size of the hives.You can use bathing additives to relieve the itchy feeling of hives. Oatmeal is an especially effective bath additive; grind up 2 cups of oatmeal in your blender, and then add the ground oatmeal to your bath water.
Also try adding 2 cups of apple cider vinegar to your bath water., Sometimes dry skin itself will cause a breakout of hives—in this case moisturizing is preventative, as it can help prevent hives before they occur.


Even if you already have a case of hives, applying lotion or another moisturizer can help reduce the discomfort caused by itching.
To keep your skin moist, avoid excessively hot showers, and use a mild soap."

, Treatment consists of symptom management, topical treatments, medication, IV fluids, antibiotics and rest. In the early stages of treatment, bed rest in a warm room, cool dressings, topical steroids and moisturizers are advised. You may also be prescribed antibiotics.In severe cases an IV or medication containing systemic steroids is administered, for example, methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine.
To decrease inflammation, TNF-alpha blocking biologics are used like Enbrel, Humira, Remicade, and Simponi.
Ask your doctor, ""What kind of treatment do you recommend for patients with my stage of erythrodermic psoriasis?"" and ""What are the pros and cons of taking systemic steroids in addition to topical treatments?"""

Visit a specialist, such as a dermatologist.,
Consider turning to alternative medicine.",How to Cure Exfoliative Cheilitis," While some people experiencing extremely dry and chapped lips may assume they have this disease, exfoliative cheilitis is actually an extremely rare condition that few people actually suffer from. It is characterized by the following symptoms:


Cracking, flaking, itching, and/or burning of the lips.
Discoloration, especially around the vermillion border of the lips (in other words, the outside edge of your lips). Repeated peeling of a layer of excessive keratin that forms on the surface of the lips. Swelling of the lips.;
, The exact cause of the condition is unknown, but researchers have suggested that a variety of factors could cause it, including reaction to dental implants , hormone imbalances, diet imbalance, or liver malfunction. It has been suggested that this form of cheilitis may develop from other, less severe, forms. Exfoliative cheilitis may also be caused by a fungal mouth infection called “Candida Yeast Overgrowth”, or Thrush. , The best time to do this test is first thing in the morning, before brushing your teeth or drinking anything. Start by collecting a mouthful of saliva and spit it into a clear glass filled with bottled or distilled water. After 15 minutes check back - normal saliva should just float on top. Any of the following are positive signs that you have Candida Yeast Overgrowth and you should contact your doctor for treatment:


The saliva has formed strings that hang down into the water.
There are cloudy globs that slowly sink or suspend below the surface.

, Some health professionals believe that exfoliative cheilitis is actually caused by excessive licking of the lips, sometimes done unconsciously. Licking your lips to moisten them actually deposits saliva on the lips, which in turn dries them out further. It may take a lot of self control on your part, but the best way to heal your lips is to leave them alone and allow your natural body systems to heal them.

, Symptoms of exfoliative cheilitis may be temporarily alleviated by applying the following to your lips:


Natural lip balms
Cold compresses with vinegar and water (for 30 minutes)
Hydrocortisone cream
Lactic acid lotion

, It has been suggested that the condition can be diet induced, so it is important to reduce your intake of processed foods and preservatives.


Eat organic fruits and vegetables whenever possible. Also wash your fruits and vegetables to make sure any irritants are off them.
Take probiotics and digestive enzymes. While there is some debate as to whether or not over the counter enzymes actually help with digestion, many people have insisted that they assist digestion and aid in the absorption of key nutrients that are essential to overall health. Increase your intake of vitamin B, zinc, and iron.
Add Omega 3 fatty acids to your diet, whether through a supplement or the foods you are eating. Omega 3 fatty acids are found in fish and in some green vegetables, such as spinach and kale. , Find an all natural cleansing program to help rid your liver and kidneys of toxins. This treatment will not be for all people suffering from exfoliative cheilitis, as it can be an extreme process which largely consists of fasting. Be aware of the risks associated with elimination diets and fasting. It is best to consult a doctor before undergoing such an extreme option.

, Exfoliative cheilitis can be linked to serious medical issues, such as a vitamin deficiency, immunosuppression, or your body’s inability to efficiently process toxins. Therefore, if minimizing toxin exposure and maintaining a healthy diet do not reduce the symptoms, then it may be necessary to see a doctor to rule out other causes.


Medical professionals have used a variety of medications to treat this condition. Remember that the cause of exfoliative cheilitis is unknown, so medical treatments may vary depending on the practitioner. Corticosteroids have been used for a variety of skin conditions. One study found that the use of Topical Calendula officinalis ointment was very effective. , Dermatologists should have the specialized knowledge to get your symptoms under control, as they have probably studied and dealt with more skin conditions than your general practitioner.


If you are not having significant improvement under the guidance of one medical professional, consider contacting a different one.

, Because the cause of exfoliative cheilitis is still unknown to western medicine, you may find some relief from your symptoms through alternative medicines, such as acupuncture or Chinese medicine. Always remember, however, to let all of your doctors know what types of treatments you are receiving, so that the treatments don't conflict with one another.

Talk to your doctor about topical treatments.,
Try light therapy.,
Get a prescription for oral medications.",How to Diagnose Psoriasis3," There is no cure for psoriasis, so most treatments focus on removing the scaly layer of your skin so it is smooth and not irritated. The treatment may also prevent skin cells from growing too quickly, which can reduce inflammation and the formation of lesions. Your doctor may suggest topical treatments in the form of a cream or ointment as a first step to address your psoriasis, especially if it is mild.Your doctor may suggest topical corticosteroids that you apply as a cream or ointment to your affected skin. Your doctor may also suggest a medicated cream that contains vitamin D analogues.

, If your psoriasis is more severe or it does not go away with topical treatments, you doctor may suggest the use of light therapy or phototherapy.

These sores are filled with a yellow or honey-colored fluid. After a few days, these sores rupture and ooze pus for several days.After a few days, the blisters will turn into into brownish crusted areas.The sores are most commonly found around the mouth or nose, but they may also occur on other areas of the body such as the arms and hands.;
, Bullous impetigo is a less common form of impetigo, usually caused by the bacteria S. aureus. It creates larger blisters that are less likely to burst.The blisters in bullous impetigo may be found on the chest, abdomen, and diaper area of young children and babies., A third, more severe type of impetigo is ecthyma, which is often caused by Streptococcus bacteria. It may also be caused by Staphylococcus or ""staph"" bacteria. It often begins on the legs.Ecthyma is sometimes called ""deep impetigo"" because its symptoms are similar to other types of impetigo, but they occur deeper into the skin.
Look for small, red-bordered blisters. These blisters are often filled with pus and may look like they're very deep in the skin. After the blisters burst, you will see ulcers with thick, brownish-black crusts.This type of impetigo is much more painful.The ulcers from ecthyma will look ""punched out"" (well defined) around the borders, and the surrounding skin is often red and calloused.Unlike blisters, these ulcers will not heal or go away on their own.

, If you think you or your child has impetigo, the best course of action is to visit the doctor. The doctor can help ascertain that the rash on you or your child is, in fact, impetigo, as well as prescribe you the best medication., The rash is extremely contagious, so try to avoid touching the rash if possible. Wash your hands with antibacterial soap if you do touch the rash.This rash is often caused by variations of the staphylococcus bacteria (staph), which is why it is so contagious.However, it can also develop from the streptococcal (strep) bacteria, as well, which is also contagious., To help apply treatments, you may need to remove the top brown scabs first. Press a warm, wet cloth to the area for a few minutes, or soak the area in warm water to soften them.Gently rub the area with a wet, soapy washcloth when done, and rinse with water.Be sure to keep the washcloth separate from other people, as it can pass the rash.

, Antibiotic ointment is usually the first treatment option for impetigo, and your doctor will prescribe the best one for your rash. Put on gloves or a finger cot before applying the ointment. Rub the ointment on the affected area.If you do not have gloves, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands when you are done applying the ointment.Your doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic such as mupirocin, retapamulin, or fusidic acid., The other common treatment option for impetigo is an oral antibiotic. Usually, you take an antibiotic pill once or twice a day, with food, for up to 10 days.Your doctor will probably prescribe a topical antibiotic first, unless you have an extensive or resistant rash. Resistance to oral antibiotics is becoming a problem, so doctors tend not to prescribe them unless absolutely necessary.Your doctor will likely prescribe an oral antibiotic such as diclocacillin or cephalexin. If you are allergic to penicillin, she may prescribe clindamycin or erythromycin.

, Whether you are on pills or cream, follow your doctor's instructions for how long you should take it. Even if you seem to be better, the bacteria may not be completely gone, and it can come back worse if you don't finish out your medication., While it can be tempting to scratch the sores, it can also make the rash worse. It can spread the rash across your body or to another person., If you still have the rash after 7 days and it isn't showing signs of healing, you should return to your doctor, as he or she may need to give you a different antibiotic.Your doctor may need to run some tests to see what type of bacteria is causing the impetigo.Certain types of bacteria, such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), have become very resistant to antibiotics., While this rash is usually not serious, it can cause rare complications. For instance, the strep version can lead to a rare disease, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, which can harm the kidneys. If anyone with impetigo has dark urine, you should go back to the doctor to discuss the problem.Other complications include:Scarring, especially from ecthyma impetigo
Cellulitis, which is a serious infection that affects tissues beneath your skin
Guttate psoriasis, a non-infectious skin condition that causes scaly patches on the skinScarlet fever, a rare bacterial infection that may develop from a streptococcus impetigo infection in some cases
Septicemia, a bacterial blood infection that requires immediate medical attention
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), a serious but rare skin poisoning caused by the staph bacteria

, In the first couple of days of infection, especially, it's a good idea to stay home from work or to keep your child home from school or daycare. You remain contagious for up to 2 days after starting treatment.Children can return to school 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has started. Cover all impetigo sores with a watertight dressing, and make sure the child keeps them covered while at school., Encourage children to wash their hands as well. Use clean, running water and soap to wash your hands frequently throughout the day. If soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.The CDC recommends that you wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, or about the time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice through.Good handwashing hygiene can help avoid the spread of impetigo. Any contact with the discharge from the sores can pass the rash. Nasal discharge can also pass the rash. Washing your hands frequently reduces the likelihood of spreading discharge around., Impetigo is easier to spread when the environment is wet and humid. Air conditioners already take some of the humidity out of the air of your home, but if you live in an especially humid climate, you might want to invest in a dehumidifier for your home., The easiest way for impetigo to enter your body is through a cut or scrape. If you or your loved one has cuts, be sure to cover them up with band-aids or clean gauze to provide protection., Whether you have impetigo or someone you know does, make sure that person keeps her towels and clothes to herself and doesn't share with other people in the family. It's easy to pass the rash if cloth has been rubbed on the infected area.Do not share razors or other personal care products with people who have impetigo.Wash the infected person's clothes and towels daily, by themselves.Use hot water when washing them."

Take proper care of your hair as an easy, early way to battle some hair loss.,
Groom your hair less.,
Do not bleach, dye, or perm your hair frequently.,
Let your hair air-dry.,
Avoid hairstyles that hold hair tightly or pull on your hair.",How to Choose the Right Hair Loss Option2," This is both the simplest and cheapest option. In fact, most of these steps will actually save you money. This is a good place to start if you are in the early stages of losing your hair. If you have already lost a good deal of hair, you may want to begin with a more aggressive option such as taking Rogaine or Propecia, or having hair transplant surgery.


If your hair loss is due to your genetics (such as ""male pattern baldness""), you may not be able to do anything to win that battle.

, If you are losing hair, try shampooing, combing, and brushing it less. Let your hair air dry instead of rubbing it dry with a towel or using a blow dryer, and never brush or comb wet hair, as this will make it more likely to break., Bleaches, dyes, gels, and other hair products can all make your hair brittle, leading to breakage. If you are losing hair, consider limiting or stopping use of these products., Frequent use of blow dryers, flat irons, or hair curlers can boil the water in the shaft of your hair, leaving it brittle and prone to breakage. To slow hair loss, let your hair air dry before styling it., Over years, tight ponytails, cornrows, or braids can cause hair loss. If you are going to use scrunchies or rubber bands, be sure to wear them in different areas of your scalp instead of always forming a ponytail in the same place. If you like cornrows or braids, consider alternating these hairstyles with other ones that put less stress on your hair.

Use medical or herbal means to combat advanced hair loss.,
Choose herbal supplements that mimic the effects of monoxidil or finasteride.,
Use finasteride (Propecia).,
Try minoxidil (Rogaine).,
Consider hair transplant surgery for quick results of if medication and herbal remedies fail.",How to Choose the Right Hair Loss Option3," If your hair has already receded more than is to your liking, you may want to take more aggressive action than simply changing your hair care routine. Herbal remedies are an inexpensive place to start, while medications are more potent and surgery offers a quick, though expensive, fix.


Herbal Remedies. These remedies are relatively inexpensive and have been shown to be effective, though less so than medication. They are a good place to start if you are budget conscience and not too worried about your hair.
Medications. Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are more expensive than herbal alternatives, but also more potent. Start with Propecia, which has better clinical results. If that doesn’t work, consider using Rogaine. These medications can be very effective at treating hair loss because they block the formation of a hormone, DHT, that causes hair loss in men.Surgery. Surgery is the most expensive option – an average of $5,000 in the U.S. – but also yields immediate results. If you want to address your hair loss right away, then this is the way to go.

, There are a variety of over-the-counter supplement that have compounds that also increase blood flow to hair follicles like minoxidil or block DHT synthesis like finasteride. Clinical trials have proven some of these supplements to be effective at promoting hair growth.



Pumpkin Seed Oil – Patients taking 400mg of pumpkin seed oil once a day showed significant hair regrowth compared to patients on a placebo. There were no significant side effects, including no increase in erectile dysfunction or loss of libido.Saw Palmetto – Taken in doses of 320mg per day. Saw palmetto inhibits the production of DHT and has been shown to promote hair growth, though not as effectively as finasteride.Pygeum – The extract of the African prune tree, pygeum is often combined with Saw Palmetto. Taken at doses of 12 to 25mg per day, it reduces both the levels of DHT in the blood and the number of sites where it can bind and has been shown to effectively treat enlarged prostates, so by extension, may well be useful in treating hair loss.Green Tea – Green tea contains DHT blocking compounds and has been shown to promote hair growth.Grape, Peppermint, or Rosemary Oil – When applied topically, all of these have been shown to increase blood flow to the scalp and to thereby improve hair growth. Peppermint oil proved more effective than minoxidil in clinical trials.Dodder Seed (Cuscuta reflexa) Extract – This extract has been shown in mice to help regrow hair lost due both to excessive DHTand due to the use of cyclophosphamide, a common chemotherapy drug.No recommended human dosage has been established.

Soy Drinks and Soy Oil – Consumption of soy products like tempeh, edamame, tofu, and soy milk has been shown to prevent hair loss. Alternately, you can take 300mg of soy oil daily as a diet supplement., Finasteride is an oral drug taken once a day that does a lot more than just stop hair loss. It works by blocking the synthesis of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a chemical that causes hair loss and enlarges the prostate. It has been proven to be effective in both slowing hair loss and preventing prostate cancer,and may also reduce the risk of heart disease.Though reports that it causes erectile dysfunction have reduced its popularity, there is not substantial evidence that it does so.WARNING: Women should not use finasteride. Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not even touch broken finasteride tablets, as this may harm the fetus.You can take finasteride with or without food.

, Minoxidil is a topical formula, most effective in the 5% formulation,, which works by increasing blood flow to hair follicles. It is most often prescribed for women or men under 40 and is applied topically to the scalp twice a day.The most common side effect is contact dermatitis of the scalp.Consult your doctor to see if it is right for you.


Minoxidil is available in 2% solution, 5% solution, or 5% foam.

, Not all hair loss can be stopped through medication or changing your hair care regimen. If you are still losing hair, you may opt for hair transplant surgery, in which small, hair-bearing segments of scalp are surgically removed, and the hairs relocated to balding or thinning areas of the scalp. The surgery typically results excellent hair re-growth and is permanent.The average cost of transplant surgery is $5,000 in the United States.


There are two types of hair transplant surgery generally available. One type is follicular unit extraction, which removes individual hair follicles one by one. It does not leave a significant scar.Another type is follicular unit transplantation, which involves transplanting a strip of hair follicle tissue from one area (usually the back of the neck) to the area with hair loss. It can leave scarring."

Consider other options if you have already lost most of your hair or if other options don’t work.,
Consider a hairpiece for localized hair loss.,
Use a wig for more extensive hair loss.,
Pick a hairstyle that’s right for you.",How to Choose the Right Hair Loss Option4," You don’t have to fight your hair loss. Though they have a certain stigma, there is nothing wrong with hiding your hair loss with a wig or hairpiece. And if that’s not for you, consider embracing your hair loss with a hairstyle that suits you.


Choose a wig or hairpiece if you have lost a substantial amount of hair and want the look of a full head of hair. While both can be expensive, they offer an instant fix and, with bonding glue, can be worn like your natural hair.
Embracing your hair loss will cost you nothing, will let you stop fighting nature, and as Michael Jordan and Jason Statham show, can make you look pretty cool, too. If you want to stand out in a crowd, ditch the hairpiece and wig and go with a clean, trimmed look, or simply shave it all off.

, Unlike a full wig, a hairpiece (or toupee) covers only the particular area where you are missing hair. A well-made hairpiece will blend in with your natural hair to create the look of a full head of hair. Most hairpieces cost between $500 and $1500, and if bonded with glue, can be used while swimming or showering.For the impatient, a hairpiece offers an instant fix.
They also require a lot of maintenance, so if that’s not your thing, consider another option.

, Just like hairpieces, wigs can be bonded to your scalp with glue or tape so that you can wear them swimming or in the shower. Synthetic wigs cost between $30 and $500, while those made with real hair range from $800 to over $3,000. A well-made, well-fitted should be indistinguishable from your real hair.Wigs require regular cleaning, and for long-term use, you will want to have your wig regularly cleaned and styled by a specialist hairdresser, especially if the wig is made from real hair. If you’re not interested in constant maintenance, pick another option.

, If you are not interested in trying to re-grow your hair or nothing has worked, and if transplants or wigs are too expensive or simply not your thing, then you can embrace your hair loss with the right hairstyle. Skip the dreaded comb-over and try one of these instead:Disheveled – If your hair is just starting to thin, cutting it in uneven layers and mussing it about will give you a shaggy look that hides your thinning hair. Just don’t try this for too long. Once patches start showing up in your shaggy look, it’s time to go short.
The Roger Sterling – Named after the dapper “Mad Men” executive, this hairstyle is for those with a receding hairline but plenty of hair on top. It combines a short haircut with a part and short sides blended in with the top.
The Caesar – Inspired by the Roman emperor, this style involves short hair, with the bangs cut on a horizontal fringe and styled forward to help conceal a receding hairline.
Buzz cut – The contrast between long hair in some places and no hair in others is not a good one, so if you've lost a lot of hair, the best option is to keep it short. A buzz works particularly well for receding hairlines or bald patches. Think Jason Statham or Andre Agassi.
Clean-shaven – It works for Michael Jordan and Patrick Stewart. It can work for you. This look shows that you have fully embraced your baldness and makes you stand out. It also offers easy maintenance.

, Keeping the head elevated after the procedure will limit swelling on the scalp. Add an extra few pillows to your bed and sleep on your back. If possible, sleep in a reclining chair so as to limit movement during sleep.

, For a few days after your hair transplant, you’ll experience slight pain, swelling, or redness on or around the scalp.However, if you give yourself an appropriate level of rest and closely follow your surgeon's instructions, these symptoms should go away after a few days. If pain, swelling, or redness increase, you might have an infected graft, and you should call your doctor immediately.


Other signs of infection include feeling feverish, chilled, or running a fever. You might also see a yellowish pus coming out of the graft site or suture line. In any of these cases, call your doctor.

Avoid spicy food before and around the procedure, as it might disrupt the scalp’s ability to heal., Additionally, do not drink alcohol for at least three days post-procedure. If you have headaches or other pain, use an aspirin alternative like acetaminophen, or contact your surgeon for recommendations appropriate for your specific medical history.

, Together, these factors will increase your chances of infection and scarring. Plus, some studies show that smoking limits hair growth, and after getting a hair transplant, you should be doing all you can to encourage your hair to grow.

, Excessive alcohol consumption damages the blood vessels and increases your risk for stroke and stroke-related disease.


Consume no more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day. One drink is defined as 12 oz. (354 ml) of beer, 5 oz. (147 ml) of wine and up to 1 1/2 oz. (44 ml) of liquor.

, Hypertension is one of the major contributing factors to stroke.


If you have been diagnosed with hypertension, follow your doctor's instructions for controlling your blood pressure, including taking your medication and following any dietary advice.
Hypertension is considered the silent killer because it often has no symptoms. Have regular physicals and get regular blood pressure readings.
Normal blood pressure is between 110/70 and 120/80. A reading of 140/90 is considered borderline. Anything over 140/90 is considered hypertension.

, High blood sugar damages your blood vessels and puts you at greater risk for stroke.


If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, follow your doctor's instructions for controlling your blood sugar.

Try to come to terms with your loss.,
Take steps to lessen self-consciousness.,
Learn to love the bald.,
Don’t try to hide it.,
Go for a close-cropped look.,
Shave it off.,
Grow facial hair.",How to Adjust to Hair Loss and Baldness1," Many (probably all) men panic when they first see a thinning patch in their hair. Hair symbolizes vitality, sex appeal, and youth. Men fear going bald because they fear that they are losing these things. However, the truth is that it’s all in the mind. Reconciling yourself to less hair, and being proud of your baldness, could make you happier in the end.It is natural to feel some embarrassment when you first start to lose hair. The key is to neutralize this feeling of shame. You may not love the way you look at first, but you can’t allow yourself to be paralyzed by it.Learn to recognize negative feelings and then consciously let them pass. There is a big difference between thinking “I feel unattractive” and “I AM unattractive.” If you feel silly, tell yourself, “Yes, I feel foolish.” Then, move on with what you are doing without letting the thoughts control you.Some people call this a “mental shrug.” If somebody called you stupid, for instance, you would realize that they are being hostile and would probably not internalize the idea that you are stupid. You can dismiss your embarrassment at baldness in much the same way.Challenge your negative thoughts, as well. One reason you might feel embarrassed is that you agree with the “conventional” view of baldness – that it is somehow undesirable or unattractive. This sort of thinking can lead you to internalize the thoughts.;
, Do away with “conventional” definitions of attractiveness, for one, and try to cultivate a healthier self-image. The media may show the ideal man one way, but there are many ways to be a strong and handsome man. You can adopt a different view.Don’t compare yourself to others. Every individual has a unique makeup. It does no good to look at other men and envy them for their looks or fuller head of hair. The men you see in the movies and in magazines are also not entirely real, in that they have the benefit of things like cosmetic treatments and airbrushing.
Take pride in things other than looks. Looks define you, but so do your talents, your interests, and your relationships. Find things that you like about yourself, like the fact that you have a fine baritone voice or are a great fullback on your soccer team.
Take a break from mirrors. If you find yourself obsessing about your hair, take a break. Stop yourself from constantly checking your hair line in the rear-view mirror or in shop windows. In these moments, remind yourself of one of your great inner qualities., Your goal shouldn’t just be toleration of how you look, but pride and acceptance. Remember that you are not alone. Baldness is a part of being male and there is no reason to let it control your emotions. In fact, one of the most powerful things you can do to combat hair loss is to not just live with it but embrace it – learn to love the bald.


Accept it. 50 million men in the US have some amount of hair loss, and hair loss increases as we age. In fact, about 50% of men have some hair loss by age 50, while 80% experience it by age 70.Remind yourself of famous, powerful, and sexy bald men. What do Sean Connery, Patrick Stewart, Michael Jordan, Bruce Willis, and LL Cool J have in common? They are all bald – and they don’t hide it.Keep in mind that some women find bald men very attractive. What many find especially attractive is confidence, though, whether a guy has hair or no.

, With thinning hair, you might be better shaving it off. According to one study, men with shaved heads were consistently rated as more masculine and dominant than those who tried to conceal hair loss, in addition to being rated as taller and stronger.By embracing baldness, you might actually appear more rather than less manly and attractive. Concealing thinning hair can be a big turn-off, as the concealment looks desperate and lacking in self-assurance., Try a hair style that shows your thinning hair to best advantage. The general rule is that short is better when it comes to balding men, whether you go crew cut or full cue ball.For one thing, close-cropped hairstyles give your hair a sense of added fullness and lift. They also makes existing bald spots less conspicuous and are much less expensive in the long-run than various concealment or treatments.
Shorter lengths like buzz cuts also exude confidence. They say to onlookers, “Yes, I’m balding. So what?”

, The final way to embrace your baldness is to go beyond the close crop and shave everything off. It is conspicuous, it is self-confident, and it is a good option for men with large bald spots.Although you will have to razor your head every now and then, a clean shave on top means that you will never have to bother with washing and styling again. It is the ultimate in low maintenance hair.
For many men with the style, the shaved head has become a signature look. Consider Jordan, consider Captain Picard, consider Andre Agassi.

, You can also grow facial hair as a way to offset the loss up top and to direct attention down from your thinning pate. Adding a mustache, beard, or goatee can help to balance your face.


Full goatees work well with thinning hair, for example, as do thick, handlebar mustaches.
A full, bushy beard and shaved head is another bold look. If done properly, it can be extremely manly.

Get a strategic haircut.,
Try concealing products.,
Don a fashionable hat.",How to Adjust to Hair Loss and Baldness2," If you are still adjusting to new hair loss, you might be able to subtly conceal it with the right haircut. Talk to your barber or stylist and ask for their opinion. Keep in mind that this is not a long-term solution, and that the wrong hairdo can emphasize rather than hide hair loss.Go for a textured crop. This short hair style adds layers and tousle to the top of your head, making for a more substantial look. Think Matthew McConaughey.A more messy style can work also, in that it can both conceal and draw attention away from a thinning pate.
Get a Caesar cut. This very short style creates a vertical fringe for styling the hair forward, which will help to conceal a receding hairline. It was made famous by one of history’s great bald men, Julius Caesar.Avoid long hair. A longer length can actually draw attention to the fact that your hair is thinner.
Beware the comb-over. One of the worst styling mistakes is the comb-over, where the hair is grown longer and combed over the head to hide baldness. The problem is that the comb-over exaggerates hair loss rather than disguises it – the hair loss is too severe for a strategic haircut.

, There are certain non-medical hair products that you can try to hide a bald spot or receding hairline, as well. These too are temporary fixes. Still, they can help in cases of early hair loss.


Some products like Toppik use “electrostatically charged microfibers” made from keratin that intertwine with your own hair, giving a more full appearance. They come in an array of different colors and washes out with shampoo.Other products like DermMatch are designed to color your scalp so that it more closely resembles your hair, which will help to conceal thinness, and also coats the hair for a fuller look.
These products are of course temporary. They do not actually increase the amount of hair on your head or stop the balding process.

, Contrary to popular belief, wearing hats has no effect on balding. They do not cause the hair to fall out by rubbing or “straining” hair follicles.In fact, wearing a hat might be a good choice is you are self-conscious about hair loss while out and about.


According to legend, Frank Sinatra started wearing his trademark fedora to hide his receding hair line. Not only was it the height of cool, but he also angled it to convey different moods. Pushed back conveyed accessibility; tipped forward gave a sense of mystery; and slightly tilted up meant no-nonsense.You can choose any variety of hat, depending on your personal style. A fedora exudes cool, while a homburg is more debonair and a ball cap more casual.

Shop for a hairpiece.,
Experiment with hair growth medicine.,
Try hair transplants.",How to Adjust to Hair Loss and Baldness3," If your baldness is more advanced, or you just feel more self-conscious about it, one option to consider is a hairpiece, sometimes called a toupee. Don’t write toupees off as a joke. A cheap toupee can look terrible, it is true, but a customized hairpiece is worth the money.Although no longer as popular as they once were, top-of-the-line, customized “hair systems” are much better than the “rugs” of old. These weave real human hair into a membrane that looks like scalp, which is then fitted to the client’s head.Adhesive technology has also come a long way. New hypoallergenic glues can bond the toupee to the scalp for as long as six weeks and even allow the wearer to swim.An elite hairpiece will not come cheap, however. Expect to pay out around $1,000 to $3,000.

, Balding men can also look to a number of medications that either slow hair loss or, in some cases, stop and reverse it. Many such products are ineffective – no better than snake oil. However, the last twenty years has seen at least two that are medically tested and proven. Talk to your doctor about these, especially Propecia and Minoxidil.Propecia was approved by the FDA in 1997 and works in a majority of men. About 65% of patients experience a “significant” increase in hair growth.Minoxidil, better known by the brand name Rogaine, is applied topically. While it does sometimes slow or halt hair loss, some physicians do not consider it effective. Users may also start to lose hair again after they stop treatment., Hair replacement therapy is one of the more aggressive ways to combat baldness. A doctor grafts baldness-resistant hair follicles from the back or sides of the head and “transplants” them to thinning patches, so that the new hair will also be resistant to balding.Hair transplants have a success rate of about 60% in 6 to 9 months. Often patients undergo the therapy in conjunction with hair growth topicals or medicine.
Talk to a doctor if you are interested in this procedure. Remember that it is a medical operation. You may experience pain or tenderness in your scalp for several days, and your doctor may prescribe pain meds or a surgical dressing for several days after.Be advised that, if done poorly, hair transplants can look unnatural. They are also expensive. You will need between 600-1000 individual scalp grafts, each costing around $6. That’s about $6,000 to $10,000 for a full head of hair."

Verify that you have the right cuff size.A standard size blood pressure cuff purchased from a drugstore will fit around the arm of most adults.,
Avoid factors that can increase blood pressure.,
Find a quiet place.,
Get comfortable.,
Remove tight sleeves.,
Rest for 5 to 10 minutes.,
Find a comfortable and appropriate location to take your blood pressure.,
Locate your pulse.Place your index and middle fingers over the inside center of your inner elbow.,
Wrap the cuff around your arm.,
Check the tightness of the cuff by slipping two fingertips underneath.,
Slide the head of the stethoscope under the cuff.,
Position the gauge and the pump.,
Inflate the cuff.Rapidly squeeze the pump bulb until you no longer hear the sound of your pulse through the stethoscope.,
Deflate the cuff.,
Listen for the systolic reading.,
Listen for the diastolic reading.,
Rest and repeat the test.,
Know what normal blood pressure should be.For an adult, the systolic blood pressure should be less than 120 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure should be less than 80 mmHg.This range is considered ""normal."",
Catch signs of prehypertension.,
Detect signs of stage 1 hypertension.,
Assess whether you have stage 2 hypertension, also known as high blood pressure.,
Understand that blood pressure can also be too low.,
Consult a physician if you suspect you have any stage of hypertension or low blood pressure.",How to Take Blood Pressure Manually," However, if you have an especially narrow or wide arm, or if you plan to take the blood pressure of a child, you may need a different size.


Check the size of a cuff before buying it. Look at the ""index"" line. This is the range line on the cuff that tells you if it fits.Once it is on the patient's arm it will tell you whether or not the circumference of your arm fits within the ""range"" area of the cuff.
If you do not use the proper cuff size, you may end up with an inaccurate measurement.;
, Certain conditions can cause blood pressure to spike temporarily. In order to get an accurate measurement, you or your patient should avoid these conditions before taking your blood pressure.


Factors that can affect blood pressure include: stress, smoking, exercise, cold temperatures, a full stomach, a full bladder, caffeine, and some medications.
Blood pressure can change throughout the course of the day. If you need to check the patient's blood pressure regularly, try to do so at the same approximate time each day.

, You will need to listen your, or your patient's heartbeat, so a quiet setting is ideal. A quiet room is also a calm room, so someone who rests in a quiet room while checking his or her blood pressure is more likely to feel relaxed, rather than stressed. Therefore you are more likely to get an accurate reading.

, Since physical stress can affect a blood pressure reading, you or the patient whose reading you take, should get comfortable. For example, use the bathroom before you have your blood pressure taken. It's also a good idea to keep yourself warm. Find a warm room, or if the room is chilly, wear an extra layer of clothing to keep warm.


In addition, if you have a headache or body ache, try to reduce or relieve the pain before taking your blood pressure.

, Roll up your left sleeve or, better yet, change into a shirt that exposes your upper arm. Blood pressure should be measured from the left arm, so the sleeve should be removed from the upper left arm.

, Resting will assure that your heart rate and blood pressure have the chance to stabilize before the measurement is taken.

, Sit in a chair next to a table. Rest your left forearm on the table. Position your left arm so that it rests at about heart level. Keep the palm of your hand facing up.


Sit up straight. Your back should be against the back of the chair and your legs should be uncrossed.

, When you press lightly you should be able to feel the pulse of your brachial artery from this position.


If you have difficultly locating your pulse, place the head of the stethoscope (the round piece at the end of the tube) in the same general area and listen until you can hear your heartbeat.

, Tuck the cuff end through the metal loop and slide it onto your upper arm. The cuff should be roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the bend of your elbow and should be evenly tight around your arm.


Make sure that your skin is not pinched by the cuff as you wrap it securely. The cuff should have heavy duty velcro on it, which will hold the cuff closed.

, If you can wiggle the two fingertips under the top edge but cannot wedge your full fingers beneath the cuff, the cuff is tight enough. If you can wedge your full fingers under the cuff then you need to open up the cuff and pull it tighter before closing it again.

, The head should be face down, with the wide part of the chest piece in contact with the skin. It should be positioned directly over the pulse of your brachial artery that you found earlier.


Also place the stethoscope earpieces in your ears. The earpieces should face forward and point toward the tip of your nose.

, The gauge needs to be positioned where you can see it.Hold the gauge lightly in the palm of your left hand if taking your own blood pressure. If taking someone else's blood pressure, you can hold the gauge in whatever position you want as long as you can see the face of the gauge clearly. You should hold the pump in your right hand.


Turn the screw on the pump bulb clockwise to close the airflow valve, if necessary.

, Stop once the gauge reads 30 to 40 mmHg above your normal blood pressure.


If you do not know your normal blood pressure, inflate the cuff until the gauge reads between 160 to 180 mmHg.

, Open the airflow valve by twisting the screw counterclockwise. Let the cuff deflate gradually.


The gauge should fall 2 mm, or two lines on the gauge, per second.

, Note the measurement on your gauge at the precise moment you hear your heartbeat again. This measurement is your systolic reading.


Systolic blood pressure refers to the force your blood exerts against the artery walls as your heart pumps.This is the blood pressure created when your heart contracts.

, Note the measurement on your gauge at the precise moment the sound of your heartbeat disappears. This measurement is your diastolic reading.


Diastolic blood pressure refers to your blood pressure in between heartbeats., Let the cuff completely deflate. After several minutes, follow the same steps to take another measurement. If your blood pressure is still high, consider comparing readings with the other arm.


Mistakes can happen while taking your blood pressure, especially if you are not used to doing it. As such, it is important to double-check your findings by taking a second measurement.

, Healthy behaviors, including diet and exercise, should be maintained in order to maintain this blood pressure range.

, Prehypertension is not necessarily dangerous by itself, but someone with prehypertension is at risk of experiencing hypertension in the future. An adult in a state of prehypertension will have a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 139 mmHG and a diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg.


Talk to a health care professional about making changes to your diet and lifestyle in order to drop your blood pressure.

, During state 1 hypertension, also known simply as high blood pressure, an adult's systolic blood pressure is between 140 ad 159 mmHg. The diastolic blood pressure is between 90 and 99 mmHg.


Hypertension requires professional medical care. Schedule an appointment with your doctor so that he or she may prescribe an appropriate hypertension medication.

, This is a serious condition and requires prompt medical care. If your systolic blood pressure is at or above 160 mmHg and your diastolic blood pressure is at or above 100 mmHG, you have stage 2 hypertension.

, If your systolic blood pressure stays around 85 mmHg and your diastolic blood pressure remains around 55 mmHG, your blood pressure may be too low.Symptoms of low blood pressure include lightheadedness, fainting spells, dehydration, lack of concentration, vision problems, nausea, fatigue, depression, rapid breathing, and clammy skin.


Talk with your doctor to discuss possible reasons behind your drop in blood pressure and possible ways to raise it up to normal levels.

, Your doctor will retest your blood pressure to make sure your readings are accurate. If you do have hypertension, or prehypertension, your doctor will make recommendations for lowering your blood pressure. This will include lifestyle changes, if you have prehypertension, in addition to medication if you have actual hypertension.


The doctor may also test for other conditions that hinder normal blood pressure, especially if the patient is already on medication.
If you are already on medication for your blood pressure, your doctor may suggest therapy or consider testing for additional health problems that prevent the medication from working properly.

Avoid trans fats.,
Limit saturated fats.,
Minimize your sodium intake.,
Limit your consumption of red meat.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Avoid sweetened beverages.",How to Avoid Foods That Are Bad for Your Heart1," There are a variety of foods in the typical American or Western diet that should be limited or avoided due to their link to heart disease. Trans fats in particular are one of the worst foods for your heart.


The majority of trans fats are very processed and are a man-made fat. Very few trans fats occur naturally.They're typically labeled as ""hydrogenated oil"" or ""partially hydrogenated oils"" on the food label.
These fats are considered the worst by health professionals. They raise your LDL (or bad cholesterol) and decrease your HDL (good cholesterol).The most common sources of trans fat are: fried foods, fast foods, baked goods and pastries, creamer and margarine, pre-made cookie dough or biscuit dough, and snack foods like chips, crackers or buttery popcorn.
There is no safe limit for trans fats. You want to avoid them as much as possible.;
, Saturated fat is another type of fat that health professionals typically want limited in your diet. Although not considered as unhealthy as trans fats, it's still important to limit your total saturated fat intake.Unlike trans fats, saturated fats occur naturally. They typically occur in animal products like full-fat dairy products, fatty red meat, skin on poultry and fatty cuts of pork.Saturated fat has been shown to increase your LDL levels (the bad cholesterol); however, it does not affect your HDL levels. Some studies have also shown that high quantities of saturated fat may increase your risk for type 2 diabetes.Health professionals recommend limiting your total saturated fat intake to less than 10% of your total calories. If you're eating 2,000 calories daily, you shouldn't consume more than 22 g of saturated fat daily.

, In addition to limiting saturated fats and cutting out trans fats, it's also important to moderate your total sodium intake. Although sodium doesn't have a direct effect on your heart, other conditions it causes do.


A high sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure and stroke.High blood pressure can severely damage your heart and arteries over time.Reducing salt may reduce blood pressure in normotensive, prehypertensive, and hypertensive individuals.It's recommended to limit your sodium intake to 2,300 mg daily or less.Some of the foods highest in sodium or salt include: breads, restaurant foods (especially fast foods), deli meat, frozen meals, canned goods, processed meats, condiments and sauces, chips, pretzels and pizza.

, A very specific food that has been more recently linked to heart disease is red meat — especially fatty cuts of red meat. Limit your intake of beef as this can lead to heart disease.A recent study showed that when people ate red meat regularly, they showed increased levels of a compound that is directly linked with the development of heart disease.If you currently eat red meat on a regular basis, consider moderating how much you eat and switch to lean cuts. Cut your consumption down to one serving a week or one serving every other week.

, There are many studies that suggest that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol may produce some protective benefits to the heart; however, drinking more alcohol than recommended or on a regular basis can actually cause heart disease.Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol is defined as drinking two or less drinks daily for men and one or less drinks daily for women.Drinking three or more drinks at a time has a direct toxic effect to the heart. Heavier drinking like this can lead to high blood pressure, enlarge the heart muscle and weaken it over time.
Although there are some benefits to very small amounts of alcohol, it's still best to limit your overall consumption and consume a maximum of one to two drinks occasionally, not daily.

, Sweetened beverages have been linked to many adverse health effects like obesity and diabetes and can also lead to heart disease.A recent study that was conducted showed that consuming 2 sweetened beverages daily increased the risk of heart disease and heart failure by 25%.Limit drinks with added sugars or high amounts of sugar like: sodas, fruit juices, fruit juice cocktails, sweetened coffee drinks, sweet tea, sports drinks, energy drinks and punch.
Instead, try aiming for 64 oz of water, sparkling water, unsweetened decaf coffee, tea or a combination of all of these.

Eat appropriate portion sizes and total calories for your body.,
Go for lean protein sources.,
Include a source of healthy fats every day.,
Make half your plate a fruit or vegetable.,
Choose only whole grain foods.,
Drink adequate amounts of clear fluids.",How to Avoid Foods That Are Bad for Your Heart2," Measure portions and be mindful of calories so you can maintain a healthy weight. If you gain weight, are overweight or obese your risk for heart disease increases.If you're looking to avoid foods that could damage your heart, you should also focus on foods and an eating pattern that can protect your heart. Measuring the appropriate portion sizes of foods and counting calories can help keep your weight in check or even help you lose weight.
Your total meal portion size should be between one to two cups total. Use a food scale or measuring cups to keep yourself on track.
You may also want to count calories. You can use an online calculator to figure out how many calories you need daily. In general women need about 1,800 calories daily and men need about 2,200 calories daily., Since trans fats, saturated fats and red meat should either be avoided or minimized in your diet, you'll need to focus on other protein sources instead. Stick to lean protein options to help support your healthy weight and your heart.


Lean proteins are naturally lower in calories and fat - especially the unhealthy types of fat.This makes them a preferable choice for your heart healthy diet.
Leaner protein sources include: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean cuts of beef, lean pork, seafood, tofu and legumes.
Also make sure to measure your protein. Measure out about 3–4 oz or about a 1/2 cup of items like beans or lentils., Although fats like trans fat and saturated fat are things you want to avoid or minimize, there are actually some types of fat that you want to include in your diet. These are typically referred to as ""heart healthy"" fats.


There are two groups of heart healthy fats that you should focus on: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Both offer great benefits to your heart.Monounsaturated fats are found in foods like: olive oil, canola oil, sesame oil and peanut oil. Cook with these oils, use them in salad dressings or drizzle over steamed vegetables.
Polyunsaturated fats include omega-3 fats and are found in foods like: salmon, mackerel, tuna, avocado, nuts and seeds. Include fatty fish a few times a week, add avocados to your salad or top your yogurt with nuts or seeds.

, In addition to including lean protein and healthy fats, you want to aim to make half of your plate a fruit or a vegetable. Both of these food groups are heart healthy foods.


Fruits and vegetables are great for your heart and overall health. They're low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.When you make half of your meals a fruit or vegetable, you help control the overall calories and nutrition of your meal.
The antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables (not antioxidant supplements) have been shown to have a protective effect against your heart.Also measure out the portion sizes for your fruits and vegetables. You should go for 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens and 1/2 cup of fruit., 100% whole grain foods are not only good for your GI system, but also great for your heart and arteries.Make sure when you're choosing to eat a grain, you go for whole grain to reap these great benefits.


100% whole grains are minimally processed and still include all 3 nutritious parts of the grain — the bran, germ and endosperm. These grains are high in fiber, minerals and even protein.Eating appropriate servings of whole grains can help reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and helps maintain a healthy weight.Make sure to measure your grains. Go for about 1 oz or 1/2 cup of cooked grains per serving., You might be surprised that drinking adequate fluids is also important for a healthy heart. Drink up to help maintain good heart health.


If you're dehydrated, it's harder for your heart to pump blood. It's puts a big strain on your heart making it work harder and beat faster. When you're properly hydrated, your heart pumps blood easily to the muscles.To make sure you're getting adequate fluids, aim to consume a minimum for 64 oz or 8 glasses daily. However, many people may need upwards of 13 glasses daily.Stick with sugar-free and decaf beverages like water, sparkling water, flavored water or decaf coffee or tea.

Exercise regularly.,
Quit smoking.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Reduce stress.",How to Avoid Foods That Are Bad for Your Heart3," Getting regular physical activity is an important part to a healthy lifestyle. In addition, regular physical activity is important to maintain heart health.


Health professionals suggest being active at least three to four times a week. This amount of exercise has been shown to help lower your blood pressure, lower your cholesterol and help you maintain a healthy weight.Specifically, it's important to aim for about 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio activity each week. You can walk, jog, dance, use the elliptical or go hiking.In addition to cardio, add in one to two days of strength or resistance training. Try yoga, weight lifting or pilates., Smoking is a well known cause of many chronic and very serious health conditions. There is a direct link to smoking and heart disease.Studies have shown that smoking causes the hardening of arteries and build of plaque as well. This can lead to heart attacks and strokes.Quit smoking as soon as possible. Cold turkey is the quickest way to quit; however, it's also the most difficult.
If you're having difficulty quitting, consider seeing your primary care doctor for help. He or she may be able to provide you with medication to help you quit or refer you to a smoking cessation program.

, Maintaining a healthy weight is important to your general health. It also plays a serious role in the prevention of heart disease.


If you're overweight or obese, you're at a higher risk for high cholesterol, high blood pressure and insulin resistance. These are the same risk factors for heart disease.Determine if your at a healthy weight by figuring out what your BMI is. You can use online calculators to figure out your BMI. If your BMI is between 25.0-29.9 you're considered overweight. If it's above 30.0 you're considered obese.If you've determined you're overweight or obese, consider losing some weight to help you reach a healthier weight.
Talk to your doctor about appropriate weight loss programs or diets to help reduce your weight and your risk for heart disease.

, A more unusual risk of heart disease is stress. Studies have shown that stress can influence your risk for a variety of health conditions including heart disease.Stress is something we must all deal with, but many people choose to overeat, smoke, drink or be physically inactive when they're feeling stressed. These are all behaviors that can increase your risk of heart disease.Talk to friends or family members, go for a walk, listen to calming music, do yoga, meditate or take a hot shower to help reduce your stress.
Chronic stress has been linked to high blood pressure and high cholesterol.Stressful work and demanding jobs have also been linked to high blood pressure. Stress resulting from job loss, too, can affect blood pressure.If you're having difficulty reducing stress, consider talking to a therapist or counselor for additional stress management techniques.

Check for common symptoms.,
Evaluate your risk factors for peripheral edema.,
Be aware of underlying medical causes.",How to Reduce Edema Naturally1," Peripheral edema is characterized by puffiness of the ankles, feet, arms, and hands. The puffiness may cause your skin to appear stretched or shiny.


If you press a finger into the swelling and the indentation (or pit) remains for a while, you may have pitting edema. Pitting edema often occurs after a long period of sitting.;
, Mild or moderate peripheral edema may result from a wide variety of causes, including:Remaining sedentary for long periods of time without movement or exercise,
Eating excessive high-salt foods,
Experiencing hormone changes (including pre-menstrual bloating and changes to estrogen levels),
Being pregnant,
Experiencing a post-surgical injury to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes (common after surgery to remove breast cancer),
Taking certain medications, including steroids, high blood pressure medication, anti-diabetes medication, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

, In addition to the risk factors listed above, edema can result from a variety of systemic diseases. Seek evaluation by a medical professional to check for the following:Congestive Heart Failure,
Liver disease,
Kidney diseases or nephrotic syndrome (a kidney-related disease that involves low blood albumin, an important protein in blood);
Chronic venous insufficiency, such as varicose veins, whereby veins are unable to circulate blood effectively;
Lymphatic insufficiency or damage (which can be caused by chemotherapy, surgery, or another injury).

Reduce your salt intake.,
Improve nutritional balance in your diet.,
Limit meat consumption.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco.,
Get an appropriate amount and type of exercise.,
Avoid excessive sitting.,
Keep your feet up while sitting or relaxing for extended periods.,
Walk around every hour or so.,
Raise your hands.,
Wear compression stockings.",How to Reduce Edema Naturally2," Excess salt in the body attracts water to the tissues, so reducing salt consumption can reduce edema.You may want to consult a nutritionist or dietitian for help with maintaining a low-salt diet, but there are some general tips you can follow to reduce your salt consumption.Do not add table salt to food. It may take some time to adjust to the less salty flavor, but you may find that you enjoy the flavors of the foods themselves more. You can also try adding other herbs or spices like dill, curry powder, pepper, cumin or thyme to add a bit of flavor variety.
Limit your processed food intake. This includes boxed, frozen, and canned items (including soup) that you buy at the store.
Eat whole foods that you cook yourself. If you prepare food yourself, you can be sure there is no added salt. A good approach is to shop around the perimeter of a grocery store, not in the center aisles. The perimeter of a store usually contains all of the produce, meats and seafood, dairy, and bulk products (which often includes beans, legumes, whole grains, and nuts).
Check the organic section of the grocery store. There are sometimes whole-food versions of convenience foods in the organic section. Read the label of any prepared food to check for sodium content.

, The best way to ensure that you are getting a good nutritional balance in your diet is to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables. These foods are naturally low in salt and pack all kinds of healthy nutrients.


Get a variety of fruits and vegetables, including asparagus, parsley, beets, grapes, green beans, leafy greens, pumpkin, pineapple, onion, leeks, and garlic.
Vegetables that have deep, rich colors often have the most nutritional value.It can be beneficial to your edema to include antioxidant foods like blueberries, raspberries, cherries, tomatoes, squash, and bell peppers.

, You should limit the amount of meat you consume. Some meat (such as cured meats, cold cuts, and red meat) is high in sodium.Additionally, excessive fat consumption can interfere with the healthy function of the liver, gallbladder, and digestion, which can worsen edema.

, It may seem counterintuitive to drink more water if you are retaining water. But this is the best way to help flush out your system. Be sure to drink 6-8 8-ounce glasses of water daily.If your doctor has prescribed diuretics (water pills), be sure that you talk to him or her about appropriate water consumption.

, These products can increase peripheral edema and affect your overall health. Alcohol and caffeine can dehydrate you,so if you do consume these beverages, be sure to drink additional water to counteract their effects.

, It is fairly common knowledge that edema can result from not getting enough movement or exercise. Many people don’t know that edema can also result from over exercising. It’s important to talk to your physician about the right amount (and the right kind) of exercise for your particular situation.


If you are not accustomed to a rigorous exercise routine, be sure to implement exercise gradually. If you are recovering from a surgery or medical condition, be sure to be cautious and work with a doctor or physical therapist as you slowly increase your exercise., Spending too much time sitting and not moving is one of the biggest contributors to edema. Walking around causes your leg muscles to expand and contract, which “massages” or stimulates your veins and allows them to push blood back up towards your heart and lungs. Sitting for long periods of time allows that blood to pool in your extremities., If you cannot avoid extended periods of sitting, try to keep your legs elevated to avoid pooling. Prop your feet up on your desk or on a stool or ottoman. You can even make a stack of pillows on which to comfortably rest your feet.

, If you do have to spend a lot of time sitting, getting up for a 5-minute walk every hour should help your edema.Go for a walk around the room, walk to refill your water bottle, or take a stroll around the block outside. It will likely improve your mood and focus as well as your edema.


Many people find that their edema is worse in the evenings. If you are relaxing on the couch after a long day at work, you should still make an effort to get up and walk around once or twice an hour.

, If most of the peripheral edema is in your hands and wrists, try raising your arms and hands high above your head every 30-60 minutes. This will allow gravity to help drain the fluid out of your extremities.


You may find it helpful to gently shake or pulse your hands while they are raised in the air over your head.

, Compression (or support) stockings are tight elastic stockings that keep pressure around your lower leg and ankle to prevent fluid buildup.They can be found at medical device stores and some drug stores.


Many people find the stockings difficult to put on because they are so tight. The best way to put them on is to roll the end of the stocking down to the ankle. Then put your foot inside the stocking and roll the remaining length over your ankle and calf.
Many physicians or physical therapists recommend wearing compression garments while you exercise;be sure to consult your medical professional for her/his recommendations.
Some compression garments need to be specially fitted to your body. For example, some women wear customized arm compression garments after breast surgery.
Occasionally, a compression garment that includes an air-pump that will contract intermittently will be necessary."

Talk to your healthcare provider.,
Drink diuretic teas.,
Take antioxidants.,
Receive acupuncture.,
Go to massage therapy.,
Give yourself a water massage.,
Try lymphatic brushing.",How to Reduce Edema Naturally3," Natural remedies are often very safe, but you should always consult a physician before attempting to treat yourself with natural remedies.

, These teas act as diuretics, increasing the amount of urine you produce and thus removing excess fluids from your body. Be wary of plant allergies and consult your doctor or pharmacist about interactions between these teas and any other medication you are taking. Drink 3-4 cups of tea every day, adding honey, stevia or lemon to taste.Dandelion leaf tea: Be sure to get dandelion leaf tea, not dandelion root tea, which is also available but won’t help edema.

Cardamom tea: Make your own by adding 1 tsp of seeds or dried herb to 1 cup of hot water.

Chamomile tea: This tea can also help you relax and sleep.

Chicory tea: This can be a good substitute for coffee.

Fennel tea: Make your own by adding 1 tsp of fennel seeds or leaves to a cup of water. Fennel also aids digestion and freshens the breath.

Parsley tea: This tea is diuretic and helps with digestion.

Stinging nettle tea: This tea is a diuretic and offers vitamins and minerals as well.

, Antioxidants can provide indirect support for edema because they strengthen the veins. In addition to eating antioxidant foods, you can try taking a supplement such as grape seed extract (360 mg twice daily) or bilberry (80 mg three times daily)., Acupuncture, a common approach to Traditional Chinese Medicine, involves placing needles at specific points on the body. Traditional Chinese Medicine seeks to balance the body and views edema as a sign of imbalance. Acupuncture for edema would seek to re-balance to body so that the fluids all flow appropriately.To find a licensed acupuncturist, search the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine here.

, Massage therapy can stimulate circulation and physically move fluids out of the tissues and back into the blood and the lymphatic system. Lymphedema massage, also known as Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) or Lymph Drainage Therapy (LDT), is a form of massage that helps the body's lymphatic system and supports immune function.Your physician may be able to give you a referral for someone who is specially trained in MLD/LDT.
To find a licensed and trained massage therapist in your area, you can also try the American Massage Therapy Association here and search for “lymphatic drainage”.

, Naturopaths often recommend a “water massage” as a method of stimulating lymphatic flow, which can lessen edema by contracting and dilating the lymphatic vessels and valves, pushing fluid towards your heart and out of your extremities. You can do this at home with a hand-held shower head.


Begin by showering your feet with cold water. Saturate one foot, then the other, then move the spray of water from your feet up your legs towards your heart on each side.
Then spray each hand with the cold water. After your hands are saturated, move the cold water from one hand up your arm towards your heart, then move to the other hand and move up the other arm.
Switch the water to hot. (It should be as hot as you can manage without scalding you).
Repeat the process of saturating both feet, then moving up the legs, then saturating both hands and moving up the arms, with the hot water this time.
Switch the water back to cold and repeat the cold water process once more to finish the procedure.

, Lymphatic brushing (also known as “dry skin brushing” is another approach from Traditional Chinese Medicine. You can do this method at home using a soft-bristled brush with a long handle or a fluffy cotton towel.Your skin and the brush (or towel) should be completely dry before starting this method.
All of your brush strokes should be long sweeping strokes in the direction of your heart. Do not use a rubbing or scrubbing motion.
Brush from your hands up your arms and towards your shoulders.
Brush up your back, from the base of your spine towards your shoulders.
Brush down your neck, from your hairline towards your shoulders.
Brush up your chest, towards your throat.
Brush from your belly button to the center of your chest.
Brush up and around the breasts into the underarm area.
Brush up the legs, beginning with your feet. Then brush from your ankle to your knee, front and back, on both sides. Then brush from the knee to the groin, front and back, on both sides.
Brush from your groin to your belly button.
The lymphatic brushing process should take about 5 minutes, and you should follow it with a warm bath or shower with a cool rinse at the end. You do the lymphatic brushing one or two times per day.

Take it one day at a time.",How to Treat Arrhythmia," A heart-healthy diet includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and lean protein (such as chicken, fish and beans). Avoid fatty foods, including saturated fats, trans-fats, and cholesterol.Include plenty of potassium in your diet. Foods rich in potassium include bananas, apricots, oranges, sweet potatoes, beets, squash and avocado.
Green, leafy vegetables such as kale, collard greens, spinach and parsley are part of a heart-healthy diet, because they are rich in Vitamin K.
Limit your salt intake, as this can increase your blood pressure.;
, Most people with arrhythmia can safely include exercise as a regular part of their healthy lifestyle. Check with your medical provider to establish the kind of exercise that's safe for you. Most exercise carries far more benefits than possible risks.If exercise is new to you, develop an exercise plan that starts with gentle activity and gradually builds into more challenging exercise.
Avoid extreme endurance athletic sports. This is the only type of exercise in which arrhythmia may have negative consequences., The stimulants found in nicotine can trigger arrhythmia. The toxins in cigarettes will cause oxidative stress in the blood vessels, which leads to more damage. Other elements found in cigarette smoke, such as carbon monoxide, may also increase cardiac arrhythmia.For help quitting smoking, consult with your medical provider or public health clinic.
Other tobacco products, such as snuff, chew or dip, also raise risks of arrhythmia.

, Carrying excess weight is a risk factor in arrhythmia because it makes the heart work harder. Being overweight also increases the chances of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, factors in arrhythmia.A healthy weight for most people can be determined by BMI, or Body Mass Indicator. This is a figure determined by a person's weight in relation to his height.
Gradual weight loss is healthier for the heart than sudden weight loss. If you are attempting to lose weight, try to maintain no more than a 3-5% weight loss at a given time.

, All lifestyle suggestions for arrhythmia will also help with high blood pressure, including quitting smoking, including exercise, and eating a heart-healthy diet. In addition, you can lower your blood pressure by avoiding stress. Chronic stress is a contributing factor in high blood pressure.Consider the circumstances that result in your stress. Work, family, finances or illness can all contribute to stress levels.
Make changes in your lifestyle if you can to minimize or eliminate these areas of stress. Relaxation strategies such as yoga, meditation, mindfulness practices and gratitude practices are all part of a heart-healthy way of life.
Learn to take your blood pressure at home, or make regular trips to your public health clinic to have it taken.
Support groups for high blood pressure may be helpful. Talk to your medical care provider about the existence of these groups in your area.

, Drinking a lot over a long time, or even a single occasion of binge drinking, can result in arrhythmia. Alcohol disrupts the nervous system that guides the heart in regular beating, and can temporarily cause the heart to beat too rapidly or irregularly. Two types of alcohol induced arrhythmias are atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia.Some studies suggest that moderate amounts of alcohol may protect against some cardiovascular conditions. This amount is one standard drink for women, and two for men, where a standard drink is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.Chronic drinking actually changes the course of the nervous system that drives the heart's pumping, resulting in cardiac arrhythmia.

, Stimulants, including caffeine, affect the heart rate. It used to be thought that people with heart conditions should avoid caffeine entirely, but this is no longer the case. Moderate caffeine intake (300-400 mg. per day, or 1-2 cups of coffee) is now thought to be okay.Drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine can result in arrhythmia or sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation.
Be aware of caffeine found in chocolate, tea, ""natural energy"" drinks, and sodas.
Stimulants are often hidden in cough and cold medications and herbal or nutritional supplements. Read the label before taking, and ask your doctor or pharmacist what medication would be best for you.

, Sleep apnea, or sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a condition in which one's sleeping breath is interrupted. In central sleep apnea, breathing is interrupted by an involuntary pause in breathing. In obstructive sleep apnea, the passage of air is blocked due to collapse of soft tissues around the upper airway. Sleep apnea is strongly associated with cardiac conditions such as arrhythmia.Obstructive sleep apnea is more common. It's associated with obesity, another factor in arrhythmia.
If you believe you're at risk for sleep apnea, consider taking a sleep study. The study will chart your breath rate throughout the night, and prescribe appropriate treatment.
Sleep apnea is a common problem, with one in five adults experiencing at least a mild form of the condition.

, Heart disease is the most common cause of arrhythmia, but other things can cause it, too. If you have any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention immediately:


Fluttering in your chest
Racing heartbeat
Slow heartbeat
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
Sweating, Your doctor might use a variety of methods to examine your heart. Here are some potential ways that you could be tested for arrhythmia:


Electrocardiogram, where your doctor will attach electrodes to your chest and limbs to measure the electrical activity of your heart
Holter monitor, which you wear to measure heart activity during the day
An Event Recorder, which is worn continuously for up to 30 days. The person wearing it can indicate when they have symptoms. When the analysis is over, doctors will evaluate if the symptoms coincide with any irregular heart rate or pattern.
Echocardiogram, where sound waves are used to look at your heart and its movement
A loop recorder that's implanted under your skin and will find irregular heart rhythms
Stress test, where your heart is monitored while you exercise
Tilt table test, where your heart is monitored while you're tilted from a lying to a standing position
Electro-physiological testing and mapping, where electrodes spread throughout your heart measure electricity, Antiarrhythmic medications can be given intravenously in an emergency situation, or taken orally over a longer period of time as a preventative measure. These medications may help to suppress the abnormal firing of pacemaker tissue, or they minimize the transmission of electrical impulses. Your medical professional can help you decide which antiarrhythmic medications are right for you.The side effects of antiarrhythmic medications can be hard to manage. Ironically, one of the possible side effects of this medication is the increase of arrhythmia, the very condition the medication was intended to address.
Be fully informed of the risks and benefits of recommended medications. Take them only as directed.
Examples of antiarrhythmic medication include: Tambocor (flecainide), Procanbid (procainamide), Cordarone (amiodarone), Betapace (sotalol).

, Blood thinners are often prescribed for people with arrhythmia in order to slow blood clotting and decrease the risk of strokes. Because certain types of arrhythmia are associated with the development of clots (which can lead to strokes), many doctors prescribe blood thinners if the patient also has other risk factors.If you have atrial fibrillation, one type of arrhythmia, you're more likely to form blood clots in the left atrium of the heart. Taking blood thinners reduces the risk of this occurring.
Blood thinners will almost always be prescribed prior to administering cardioversion treatment, in order to minimize the risk of blood clots.
Examples of blood thinners include Warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin., Cardioversion is a procedure, done either through electric shock or medicine, that reverts the heartbeat back to its regular rate. It may be performed as an emergency measure, or it may be scheduled as an elective procedure. For most people, cardioversion is an effective intervention.Cardioversion is different from defibrillation in that it uses more powerful electric shocks to jolt the heart into a more standard rhythmic pulse.
If cardioversion is not successful, you'll probably be advised to consider getting a pacemaker.

, Catheter ablation is a medical procedure in which a small catheter is inserted into an accessible blood vessel and guided into your heart. Energy, either electrical or radio frequency energy, is then sent through the catheter's wires to destroy the tissue that's causing arrhythmia.The success rate for catheter ablation is roughly 90%.
This procedure is generally performed when medication options have not been helpful. A cardiology specialist, called an electro-physiologist, will map out the electrical current and communication pattern of your heart and then determine if this is an option.
Catheter ablation is most often used to treat arrhythmia that involves rapid heartbeat.

, A pacemaker can only be used for certain types of arrhythmia. When the heart rate is too slow, a pacemaker can either help it stay regular or control it completely at a safe rate. Arrhythmia is a condition that results in the body's natural pacemaker no longer functioning properly, so an implanted pacemaker mimics the body's own electrical impulses in controlling the rate of heart beats.Pacemakers can be temporary, used in an emergency situation, or a permanent treatment for chronic arrhythmia.
A pacemaker is implanted just below the collar bone. It runs off battery power, each battery lasting between 5-10 years.
MRI tests and strong security systems such as are often found in airports or courthouses can affect a pacemaker. Make sure you let professionals know if you have a pacemaker in these situations.

, An ICD is a battery-powered device inserted under the skin that keeps track of your heart rate. The ICD is then connected through thin wires to the heart. It then monitors heart rate as well as sending an electric shock to the heart to prompt regular heart rate.Newer model ICD also perform the function of pacemakers.
ICDs are largely recommended as preventative measures for those at high risk of serious complications or death resulting from cardiac arrhythmia.

, The Maze procedure is a treatment developed for atrial fibrillation, a form of arrhythmia. In this procedure, the surgeon creates scar tissue within the heart in order to disrupt the path of abnormal electrical impulses. When these impulses are interrupted, the heart beat is restored to its usual rate.Coronary bypass surgery may be recommended if coronary heart disease is the source of your arrhythmia.
Surgery for arrhythmia may be recommended if surgery for another health condition is occurring.

, If you suspect you might have arrhythmia, or if you've been diagnosed and simply want to be aware of the way it affects you, learn to monitor your pulse. There are a wide variety of heart monitors and apps available for purchase, but it's easy to do on your own as well.Place your second and third fingers of your right hand on your left wrist. Feel for the heart pulse.
Alternatively, with the same fingers, press the soft tissue of the side of your neck beneath the jaw. You should be able to feel your heart beat through the blood vessels found there. Move your fingers around, pressing gently but firmly, until you find the pulse.
There's no need to count your heart beats. You're checking for heart rhythm, not heart rate.
Stethoscopes are inexpensive tools that help keep track of your heart rhythm. You can find these for sale at drug stores or many other retail outlets.

, Lifestyle factors such as high stress or frequent, angry outbursts contribute significantly to the development of arrhythmia. Low potassium levels and low calcium intake are also associated with arrhythmia. To treat your arrhythmia, consider what preventative measures you can take to care for yourself.Regular physical activity can significantly lower stress levels and help with mood regulation.
Find healthy outlets for your intense feelings, and practice self-care routines.
Aging increases the risk of developing arrhythmia.

, Because arrhythmia is invisible, it may be difficult to feel that others understand what you're going through. There are support groups for arrhythmia and other chronic health conditions that may be helpful to you in living with arrhythmia. Follow your doctor's recommendations, and know that treatment is a long term course.Try to manage your stress and anxiety, both of which can lead to your body's natural ""fight or flight"" response and an increased heart rate. Use deep, relaxing breathing to slow the heart rate, manage stress, and quell anxiety.More information about arrhythmia is still being researched. Continue to learn about the condition as more research studies are done.
Keep in touch with your doctor, and ask questions about symptoms that may arise.
If you have questions regarding your treatment, ask your medical provider right away.

Pulmonary edema may cause you to experience shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or chest pain., Central or internal edema is a very serious medical condition. You should not try to reduce the effects of internal edema at home. Go to the doctor and follow the doctor’s instructions for dealing with the edema., Treatment for internal edema may involve medication such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, or corticosteroids. Be sure to consult a physician before pursuing a course of treatment.

People who are having heart attacks often say they feel squeezing, fullness, pressure, tightness, or a sharp sensation in the center or left area of the chest. This feeling may last a few minutes or more, or disappear and return later.Chest pain that stems from a heart attack is not always the crushing, heavy feeling that some people describe - often called the ""Hollywood"" heart attack. It can actually be quite mild, so don't ignore any type of chest pain.""Retrosternal"" chest pain is commonly felt. This refers to a pain behind the breastbone, or sternum. It is easy to confuse this pain with abdominal discomfort, like gas. If you have any doubt about this pain, call a doctor.
Keep in mind that chest pain is not always present when a heart attack is occurring; in fact, over half of heart attack patients don't experience chest pain. Don't rule out the possibility of a heart attack just because you aren't hurting in that area.;
, Sometimes the pain from a heart attack radiates from the chest area outward, causing discomfort in the neck, jaw, abdomen, upper back, and the left arm.The pain in these areas is usually a dull ache. If you haven't recently worked out or done anything that could cause upper body soreness, this type of pain could be a sign you're having a heart attack.,


Like other heart attack symptoms, dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting are also signs of other illnesses, so they are easily overlooked. Don't ignore these symptoms, especially if you are also feeling chest pain.
Women tend to have these symptoms more frequently than men, though not all women experience them.

, Shortness of breath is a subtle heart attack symptom that should not be taken lightly. It is distinct from shortness of breath related to other illnesses because it seems to come out of nowhere. People who have experienced shortness of breath related to a heart attack describe feeling as though they have been exercising heavily even though all they've been doing is sitting and relaxing. Shortness of breath may be your only heart attack symptom. Do not take it lightly! Particularly if you have not done anything that typically causes shortness of breath, seek emergency medical help if you experience this symptom.

, The nausea may also lead to breaking out in a cold sweat, and even vomiting. If you experience these symptoms, especially in conjunction with other symptoms, you may be having a heart attack., Many heart attack patients get extremely anxious and feel what is referred to as a ""sense of impending doom."" This feeling is not to be taken lightly; immediately seek medical attention if you experience this extreme emotion.

, The sooner medical treatment is received, the greater the chance of surviving the attack. Don't risk talking yourself out of it or waiting too long.


One study showed that more than half of people with symptoms of a heart attack waited to seek help for more than 4 hours.Almost half of deaths caused by heart attack occur outside a hospital.Don’t neglect any symptom, no matter how mild a nuisance it might seem. Get emergency help fast.

, Angina is chest pain that can feel like a slight pressure, a burning, or a fullness. It is often mistaken for heartburn. Angina can be a sign of coronary heart disease, which is the most common cause of heart attacks. If you feel any type of pain in your chest, it's best to get it checked out right away.Most angina pain occurs in the chest. However, it may also occur in the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, throat, or back. It may be hard to tell exactly where you’re feeling the pain.Angina pain usually gets better once you’ve rested for a few minutes.If your chest pain lasts for more than a few minutes or doesn’t improve with rest or angina medication, seek emergency medical assistance.Some people experience angina after exercising, and it's not always a sign of disease or a heart attack. A change in normal patterns is the most important thing to watch for.
If you have what you believe to be painful indigestion, you may actually be experiencing angina. Make an appointment with your doctor to determine the cause of the pain.

, Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms, and they're present in at least 90% of people who have heart attacks. If you have a fluttering feeling in your chest or feel like your heart “skipped a beat,” you may have an arrhythmia.See a specialist who can conduct testing to determine the cause of your symptoms.


Arrhythmia may also display more serious symptoms, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, rapid or pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath, and chest pain. If you experience any of these symptoms with arrhythmia, seek emergency medical assistance.Although arrhythmia is very common, especially in older adults, it can be a sign of severe medical issues. Do not simply ignore an arrhythmia. Consult with your physician to be sure you do not have a more serious condition., In older people, these symptoms may actually be a sign of heart problems. Seek medical attention if you experience unexplainable cognitive difficulties.

, Women are more likely than men to experience unusual, sudden, or unexplained fatigue as a symptom of heart attack.This fatigue may start a few days in advance of an actual heart attack.If you experience abrupt, unusual fatigue without having changed your daily activities, talk with your doctor immediately.

, Your emergency medical services may tell you how to help the person experiencing symptoms. Do exactly what the operator instructs. Call for help before doing anything else.Calling 911 (or your emergency services number) will speed up your admittance into the hospital vs. driving to the emergency room yourself. Call an ambulance. Do not drive to the hospital yourself unless you have no other option available. Treatment for heart attacks is most effective if started within 1 hour of the first appearance of symptoms., Sit down and rest. Try to keep calm by breathing evenly as best as you can.Loosen any tight clothing, such as shirt collars and belts.

, If you take prescription medication such as nitroglycerin, take your recommended dose while you wait for emergency services to arrive.Do not take prescription medication that has not been specifically prescribed for your use by a physician. Taking someone else’s medication could harm you., Chewing and swallowing an aspirin can help break up the blood clot or blockage contributing to the heart attack.Do not take aspirin if you’re allergic or have been told by your doctor not to take aspirin., Even if your symptoms improve within five minutes, see your doctor. A heart attack can leave clots in your bloodstream that can cause more health problems, such as a future heart attack or stroke. You need to be evaluated by a medical professional.

, Dyspepsia is also known as “indigestion” or “upset stomach.” It is usually a chronic or recurrent pain that occurs in your upper abdominal area.Dyspepsia can cause mild chest pain or pressure. One or more of the following symptoms will likely coincide with this pain:Heartburn
Feeling bloated or full
Burping
Acid reflux
Stomach pain or “upset stomach”
Loss of appetite

, GERD happens when your esophagus muscles do not close properly, allowing your stomach contents to leak back into your esophagus. This can cause heartburn and a feeling as though food is “stuck” in your chest. You may experience nausea, especially after eating.The symptoms of GERD usually occur after eating. They get worse if you lie down or bend over, or they may worsen at night.

, Asthma can cause feelings of chest pain, pressure, or tightness. These symptoms usually co-occur with coughing and wheezing.Mild asthma attacks usually lessen after a few minutes. If you still have difficulty breathing after a few minutes, seek medical assistance.

, People experiencing a feeling of intense anxiety may suffer a panic attack. The symptoms of a panic attack may initially seem similar to those of a heart attack. You may experience a racing heartbeat, sweating, feeling weak or faint, chest pain, or trouble breathing.The symptoms of a panic attack occur very rapidly and usually disappear rapidly as well. If your symptoms do not improve within 10 minutes, seek medical assistance., Your risk of heart attack increases as you age. Men who are 45 or older, and women who are 55 or older, are more likely to have a heart attack than younger people.People who are older may have different symptoms of heart attack than younger adults. Symptoms to watch for in older individuals include fainting, trouble breathing, nausea, and weakness.
Dementia symptoms, such as incomplete memory, erratic or unusual behavior, and impaired reasoning, may be signs of a “silent” heart attack in elderly people., Being overweight or obese puts you at a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack.A sedentary lifestyle also increases your risk.A diet high in saturated fats increases your risk of coronary artery disease, which may lead to having a heart attack.

, Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke increase your risk of having a heart attack., Your risk of heart attack is greater if you have any of the following medical conditions:High blood pressure
High blood cholesterol
Family or personal history of heart attack or stroke
Diabetes

People with diabetes may experience less dramatic heart attack symptoms. Seek medical attention immediately for any suspected symptoms."
"
Pay attention to any pain in your chest or abdomen.,
Note a decreased appetite.,
Identify a racing heartbeat.,
Pay attention to your tiredness or fatigue.,
Note shortness of breath.,
Check for swelling.,
Inspect your skin for blue coloration.",How to Recognize Pulmonary Hypertension Symptoms1," Pain or discomfort can indicate that you may have pulmonary hypertension. The pain caused by pulmonary hypertension may present in your chest or on the upper right side of your abdomen.


Call you doctor if you are having pain in your chest or upper right side of your abdomen.;
, Losing your appetite can also indicate that you may have pulmonary hypertension. If you have noticed that you are not as hungry as you normally are, then tell your doctor., If your heart is beating faster than normal, then this can also be a symptom of pulmonary hypertension. Note this symptoms along with any others and tell your doctor about it.You can check your heart rate by taking your pulse. Place your index and ring finger on the inside of your wrist and search for a pulse. Then, apply gentle pressure until you can feel the pulse.
Set a timer for 60 seconds and count the number of beats in your pulse. A normal pulse range for adults is between 60 and 100 beats per minute, so anything over 100 may be considered abnormal.

, If you find yourself becoming tired easily or fatigued, then this could be a symptom of pulmonary hypertension. You might notice that you feel tired from routine chores or things that you used to be able to do with ease.For example, doing the dishes might be an easy chore for someone without PH, but someone with PH may become tired after doing the dishes or feel too tired to even finish doing them.
Tell your doctor right away if you find it hard to do routine tasks because this may indicate that the disease is advanced.

, People with PH usually note that their problems breathing begin while they are active (running, exercising, or walking), but after time, you might eventually find yourself struggling for breath while resting.If you find it difficult to do simple activities without losing your breath, call a doctor immediately. The disease may have advanced significantly.
Shortness of breath may also lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting., You may notice swelling in your wrists, ankles, and legs. This is called edema. If untreated, the swelling will spread to your abdomen (a condition known as ascites).To check for edema, press lightly on your ankle or wrist. If an indentation appears where your finger pressed, you may have edema. Your skin may also appear stretched or shiny., You may notice that your lips, gums, nails, and the skin around your eyes appear to have a bluish tint to them. This is called cyanosis.Cyanosis is caused by a lack of oxygen in your blood, which may be caused by PH or by a clot, high altitude, or another lung disease."
"
Examine your existing medical conditions.,
Review your family medical history.,
Determine if you have taken certain diet pills.,
Factor in your age and gender.,
Determine your altitude.",How to Recognize Pulmonary Hypertension Symptoms2," PH may be caused by other existing medical conditions. If you have certain diseases or disorders, you may be at heightened risk for PH. These conditions include:


Connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma and lupus

HIV infection
Congenital heart disease
Chronic liver disease (cirrhosis)
Heart failure or disease
Blood clots in the lungs
Metabolic disorders
Blood disordersObesity
Sleep apnea, In some cases, PH is genetic. Ask your parents, siblings, and other family members to see if there is a history of PH in your family. If there is, you should go to the doctor as soon as possible to check if your symptoms are related to PH., The diet pill “fen-phen"" (also known as dexfenfluramine and phentermine) can cause pulmonary hypertension. Even if you haven’t taken this pill in years, you could still be at risk. Users of fen-phen are 23 times more likely to develop PH than non-users., While PH can occur in anyone at any age, women are twice as likely to develop it as men. Furthermore, young adults are at higher risk for PH than older age groups.Take this into consideration when you are reviewing your symptoms.

, People living in low oxygen conditions are more likely to develop PH. If you live in a high altitude, it is increasingly likely that your symptoms are signs of PH.A high altitude location is defined as a place that is between 8000-14,000 ft (2438-4267 m) above sea level."
"
Check if other heart conditions are the cause.,
Do a physical exam.,
Complete any recommended tests.,
Determine which type of PH you are suffering from.",How to Recognize Pulmonary Hypertension Symptoms3," PH shares many of the same symptoms with other heart and lung diseases. Your doctor may start you on medicine or start an evaluation to check for more common heart or lung conditions, which may reveal that you have PH. If you aren't getting better, further evaluation will be needed to check for PH. To help your doctor, be clear about all of the different symptoms you have experienced., Your doctor will check you for signs of edema and cyanosis. He or she may listen to your heart or lungs for signs of irregular beating.You may even be asked to walk a short six minute circuit to see how well you can move and breathe.After these tests, your doctor will determine what other types of tests you will need.

, Your doctor will schedule any tests he or she thinks you need to have done. This is highly individual, and your doctor will determine what the best course of action is for your unique medical history. Some tests you may be asked to do include:


Blood test
Echocardiogram
Chest x-ray
Chest CT scan
Right heart catheterizationChest MRI
Lung function test, There are many forms of PH that may manifest in sufferers. Working with your doctor, you may be able to determine which form is affecting you. This will help your doctor decide what type of medical treatment is best for you. PH is divided into five classifications:


Group 1 is Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. In this form of PH, the arterial walls of the lungs tighten, causing the heart to overexert itself pumping blood. This can be heritable (caused by genes), associated (caused by another disease such as lupus), or idiopathic (the cause is unknown).Group 2 includes any form of PH caused by left-sided heart disease. For example, this could be caused by mitral valve or aortic valve disease.Group 3 includes any form of PH caused by lung disease, including sleep disorders and high altitude related sicknesses.
Group 4 is Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). This is a type of PH caused by blood clots in the lungs.
Group 5 includes all forms of PH with uncertain or multiple causes. This may include blood or metabolic disorders."
"
Avoid alcoholic drinks, such as beer, wine, and hard liquor.,
Avoid exposure to toxic chemicals.,
Ask your doctor about medications you're taking.,
Get vaccinated.",How to Prevent Low Platelet Count1," Alcohol can damage bone marrow and impair platelet function.It also slows your body's production of new platelets.Heavy drinkers are particularly likely to experience a temporary drop in platelet count.;
, Low platelet count can be caused by exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, arsenic, or benzene, all of which slow platelet production.If your job requires you to work with chemicals such as these, take the necessary safety precautions., Some medications can cause a low platelet count. Even NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as aspirin, naproxen (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can have an effect on your platelet count.NSAIDs may also thin your blood too much, which is a bigger problem if you are also having platelet issues.Do not stop taking any medication you have been prescribed without talking to your doctor first.


Blood thinners such as heparin are the most common causes of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. This type occurs when the medication causes your body to produce too many antibodies, which destroy your platelets.Chemotherapy drugs and anti-seizure medications such as valproic acid may cause drug-induced non-immune thrombocytopenia. This type occurs when your medication keeps your bone marrow from producing enough platelets.Other medications that may interfere with platelet production include: furosemide, gold, penicillin, quinidine and quinine, ranitidine, sulfonamides, linezolid, and other antibiotics., Several viral diseases, such as mumps, measles, rubella, and chickenpox, can affect your platelet count.Getting vaccinated for these diseases can help preserve your health and avoid a low platelet count.You should also talk with your pediatrician about vaccinating your child. Most children are healthy enough for vaccination.

"
"
Visit the doctor at the onset of low platelet symptoms.,
Treat the underlying medical condition.,
Take prescribed medication.,
Store healthy blood with a hospital.",How to Prevent Low Platelet Count2," A doctor will administer a Complete Blood Count (CBC), which will show the health of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In order to be considered normal, platelets should be between 150,000-450,000 per microliter of blood.Symptoms of a low platelet count include excessive or easy bruising, and superficial bleeding that appears as a rash on the skin. Additional warning signs include:Bleeding that will not stop after 5 minutes of pressure
Nose, rectum or gum bleeding
Blood in your urine or bowel movements
Unusually heavy menstrual flow
Feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness
Fatigue
Jaundice

, Because many causes of low platelet count are caused by diseases or medical conditions, your doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment route for you to treat the condition. This is more effective than merely treating the symptoms.For example, if your low platelet count is a reaction to a medication, your doctor may prescribe a different medication to see if this helps bring up your platelet count., Your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which help slow your body's destruction of platelets.This is usually the first-choice treatment drug.Your immune system may also be overfunctioning, and could be suppressing your platelets. In this case, your doctor may prescribe immunosuppressants.Eltrombopag and romiplostim are medications that can help your body produce platelets.Your doctor may also prescribe oprelvekin (brand name Neumega) or another medicine that has been approved to stimulate the production of stem cells (and thereby platelets). Many cancer patients take this drug as a preventative measure because it is easier to prevent low platelets than build them back up.
There's a risk of side effects with this medication, so your doctor will determine whether to prescribe it based on her assessment of your risk of developing a low platelet count. The doctor will also consider whether you have any heart issues, because Neumega's side effects include fluid retention and heart palpitations, which can exacerbate heart conditions. Additional side effects can include diarrhea and other digestive issues., Consider this particularly if you are often anemic or you are going through cancer treatment. Many hospitals help you to give your own blood, to be stored in case you need it to prevent low platelets in the future. Ask your doctor if this is a good preventative measure in your case."

Consult with a doctor or registered dietitian.,
Make any changes to your diet slowly.,
Eat foods containing folate.,
Eat foods containing B12.,
Eat probiotics.,
Eat a balanced diet of fresh food.,
Eliminate processed and sugary foods.",How to Prevent Low Platelet Count3," Before you make any significant changes to your diet, even if you think your changes will be healthy, you should consult with your physician or a registered dietitian.Many health conditions and prescription medications must be taken into account when planning a diet plan, so consulting with a professional will keep you safe and healthy.
A registered dietitian is an expert who has completed education, training, and supervision in the field of nutrition. Dietitians can help you determine a healthy diet and fitness plan that will account for any health conditions you have and medications or supplements you take., Implementing changes to what you're eating on a daily basis in a gradual fashion will help your body adjust appropriately. Sometimes altering your diet can cause unpleasant symptoms as your body adjusts to the new foods and eliminates the remnants of the old foods.Making gradual changes will also ease any cravings you may feel for what you used to eat, such as sugary treats or salty snacks.

, Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin; folic acid and food folate are both sources of folate.Folate deficiency can cause your bone marrow to have difficulty making enough platelets.The recommended daily intake of folate varies, but adults should usually have between 400mcg and 600mcg a day. A full list of recommended daily allowances by age can be found at the National Institutes of Health website here.Beef liver, leafy and dark green vegetables, legumes, fortified cereals, and nuts are good sources of folate., If you don't consume enough vitamin B12, your bone marrow may have difficulty making enough platelets.Vitamin B12 is also essential to red blood cell formation.The recommended daily intake of B12 varies, but adults should usually have between 2.4mcg and 2.8mcg daily. A full list of recommended daily allowances by age can be found at the National Institutes of Health website here.
B12 is commonly found in animal products, so vegetarians and vegans may need a supplement. Good dietary sources of B12 include shellfish, beef liver, fish, fortified cereals, and dairy products., Foods containing probiotics, such as yogurt and fermented foods, may help improve the immune system.Probiotic bacteria may also help regulate the immune system, which may help people with autoimmune disorders (a common cause of low platelet count).Good sources of probiotics include yogurt with live cultures, kefir (fermented milk), kimchi (Korean fermented vegetables), and fermented soy products such as tempeh, miso, and natto., Eat a wide variety of foods, particularly different fruits and vegetables. Eating widely will help your body get all of the nutrients it needs. In addition, try to eat locally; buy produce when it's in season in your local area. Not only will you be getting the freshest produce, but there's also less chance it has any additives or pesticides in order to keep it fresh for transport across long distances.Visit the grocery store often to shop for fresh produce because the nutrient content decreases with time. Instead of doing all of your shopping on one day, plan to go to the store a few times per week.
Always choose fresh varieties over frozen and canned foods. For example, if you have the choice between fresh corn on the cob and canned corn, go for the fresh.

, Replace these foods with whole, unprocessed food. For example, eat whole grain cereals, brown rice, and whole wheat products. Again, read the labels of products as you shop. Reduce the amount of white flour, white rice and processed foods you consume because these have been and ""refined"", or stripped of their nutrient-rich coating.


Be sure as well to reduce the amount of white sugar you consume, as well as other sweeteners, such as fructose, corn syrup and honey. Cut back as well on fruits with lots of sugar, including mangoes, cherries, and grapes, as well as sugary fruit juices.Sugar can contribute to promoting high levels of acidity in the body.

"
Expect that if you do not have a history of heart attack, then your doctor and the doctors at the emergency room will not be sure what is going on when you have symptoms.,
Do not ignore common symptoms.,
Beware: women's symptoms can differ somewhat.,
Never downplay your symptoms.,
Call 9-1-1 immediately.,
Consider contacting someone to come over immediately.,
Chew on aspirin.,
Do not attempt to drive.,
Remain calm.,
Lie down.,
Take deep, steady breaths of fresh air.,
Do not attempt ""cough CPR.,

Check into getting a Personal Emergency Response System (PERS).,
Keep a ""go list"" of meds and emergency contact information.",How to Survive a Heart Attack when Alone," They will depend on you to tell them your symptoms, if you can... They can do a Electro Cardiogram (EKG), listen to you heart, and could do a CT scan. Insist on tests if you feel your symptoms are real and dangerous. (Do not be put off that some people` may have a ""scary panic-attack"", breathing rapidly, feeling faint or ill, and think it is a heart attack. Breath normally as you can/stay calm.)
, The most obvious symptom of a heart attack is chest ache/pain or ""discomfort"", but there are numerous, typical symptoms you should be aware of, too.


Chest discomfort usually occurs in the center of the chest, including:

Heaviness, tightness, pressure, aching, burning, numbness, fullness, or squeezing, and the pain can either last for several minutes, go away and come back repeatedly. Don't overlook or ignore symptoms such as:Unexplained pains in the torso/the upper body, including the arms, left shoulder, back, neck, jaw, or stomach.
Difficulty breathing/feeling out of breath
Sweating or ""cold"" sweating
A feeling of fullness, indigestion, or choking
Nausea or vomiting
Light-headedness, dizziness, feeling you may faint
Unexplained tiredness, weakness, extreme weakness (like you can't do easy tasks), or extreme anxiety reacting to symptoms
Rapid (racing heart/tachycardia) or irregular heartbeats

, Even though women frequently experience the usual chest pains and other common symptoms of heart attack, they are also likely to experience uncommon symptoms, as well.


These additional symptoms can include:

Pain that spreads down the left arm
Unusual fatigue for multiple days
Difficulty sleeping,
Feeling heart palpitations


Women may have at least one common or uncommon symptom, repeatedly, for more than one month prior to their heart attack. Up to 78 percent of female heart attack patients experienced such warnings.

, People often expect heart attacks to be dramatic and instantaneous, but the truth is that many heart attacks are mild and can continue for an hour or longer. Mild heart attacks can be just as serious, though, so if you experience any of the symptoms described here for 5 minutes or longer, you should begin taking steps to ensure your survival.


You should get treatment for your heart attack within the first hour of your initial symptoms. If you wait longer than that, your heart will have more difficulty repairing the damage/cell death in muscles of the heart. The ultimate goal is to have the constricted artery back open within 90 minutes to minimize damage as much as possible.People often wait to seek treatment because the symptoms vary from what they expect or because they think the symptoms are related to other health issues. They may also delay if they are young and skeptical about a heart attack happening in their youth -- or if they are in denial about the seriousness of their symptoms and trying to avoid the embarrassment of going to the hospital for a ""false alarm.""

, The most important thing to do when you suspect that you are having a heart attack is to call emergency medical services.


Always call 9-1-1 before you attempt to contact anyone else. This will almost always be the quickest way to get treatment, and even if you live in an area that an ambulance may have a hard time getting to, the 9-1-1 dispatcher can provide you with instructions on how to minimize the damage.
Emergency help can begin treatment as soon as they arrive, which is another reason why this is a better option than calling a friend or relative for help.

, If you have a trustworthy neighbor or relative who lives nearby, make another phone call asking that person to come meet you. Having another person nearby can be helpful if you suddenly go into cardiac arrest.


You should only do this if the 9-1-1 dispatcher gives you permission to get off the phone or if you have a second line you can call on while the dispatcher stays on the first line.
Do not rely on another person to get you to the hospital unless instructed to do so by the 9-1-1 dispatcher. Wait for emergency paramedics to show up.

, Chew and swallow a single 325-mg non-enteric coated aspirin tablet. This is especially effective if done within 30 minutes of your first symptoms.


Aspirin inhibits platelets, which are a key component in the formation of blood clots. Taking aspirin can delay the formation of blood clots that could further block your arteries during a heart attack.
Do not use enteric coated tablets since these will release too slowly to be of much use.
Chew the aspirin before swallowing it. By chewing the aspirin, you release more of the medicine directly into your stomach and hasten its ability to get into your blood stream.
If you are on a medication that interacts poorly with aspirin or have otherwise been told by your doctor not to take aspirin, do not use this treatment.

, Driving yourself to the hospital is not recommended, and if you begin to experience heart attack symptom while you are behind the wheel, you should immediately pull off to the side of the road.


The only reason you should consider driving yourself to the hospital is if all other options have been completely exhausted and it is, quite literally, the only way for you to get emergency medical treatment.
If you suffer from a cardiac arrest, you will pass out. This is the main reason why driving while suffering from a heart attack is ill-advised.

, As frightening as a heart attack is, rushing around or putting yourself into a state of panic can worsen the problem. Relax as much as possible to keep your heart rate steady and calm.


To calm yourself down, think of a soothing memory and assure yourself that you have familiarized yourself with what you need to do and that help is on the way.
Count as a way of slowing your heartbeat. Make sure that your counts are slow, and use the standard one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand... approach.

, Lie on your back and raise your legs upward. This opens up the diaphragm, making it easier for you to breathe and supply oxygen to your blood.Make the position easier to maintain by propping your legs up on pillows or another object. You could also lie down on the floor with your legs propped up on a couch or chair.
If you cannot immediately lie down or sit, such as working on a ladder or crossing traffic, you make your way carefully, using the horizon and what you see to help keep yourself oriented. If you feel dizzy, or unable to walk properly, watching a fixed object such as the horizon, or a large fixed object, might help calm you and help you control the situation until help arrives.

, Even though your natural instinct might be to take rapid breaths when you experience a heart attack, the best way to maintain a steady supply of oxygen to your blood and your heart is to take slow, deep breaths.


Consider lying down in front of an open window, open door, fan, or air conditioner. Providing yourself with a consistent stream of fresh air can further help supply your heart with oxygen.

,""For quite some time, there was an Internet hoax going around saying that you could survive a heart attack when alone by coughing in a particular manner. This probably won't work, and worse still, attempting this technique may even put you in graver danger.


Cough CPR is used in hospitals on occasion for patients who are about to go into full cardiac arrest. Even then, it should only be done under the strict supervision and instruction of a doctor.
Attempting this procedure on your own can cause you to accidentally work against the rhythm of your heart and make it harder to get oxygen into your blood rather than easier.

, Eating and drinking are probably the last things on your mind when you experience a heart attack, but just in case, you should avoid food and drink even if you want them. Having anything other than aspirin in your system can make it more complicated for paramedics to give you adequate treatment.


If necessary, you can swallow a little water to help you get the aspirin into your system, but even this should be avoided if possible.

, Suffering a heart attack once increases your risk of experiencing a heart attack in the future. When you survive your heart attack this time around, you should talk with your physician to discuss ways of improving your chances of survival if you should suffer from one again.


Doctors prescribe certain medications (meds) for treating cardiac problems.

Nitroglycerin to help widen the blood vessels and lower pressure on the arteries.
Beta blockers will block the hormones responsible for triggering stress responses in the heart and surrounding cardiac tissue.
Blood thinners to lessen chances of blood clots -- and anti-stickiness meds for platelet, both of which help prevent future heart attacks due to blockages of arteries in the heart.


Ask about bottled oxygen for you to inhale should another heart attack occur.
Talk with your doctor about ways to reduce your risks of experiencing further heart disease through diet, exercise/cardiac rehab, and lifestyle.

, A PERS is an electronic device you can wear around your neck or slip into your pocket. You can activate the device when you experience a heart attack or other medical emergency and are unable to reach a phone to call 9-1-1.


Even if you have a PERS, you should still call 9-1-1 when you are able to do so. A PERS is not quite as reliable as calling 9-1-1 directly, and you will probably get treatment faster by calling 9-1-1.
You should also do thorough research before purchasing a PERS to determine which has the best features and the best known reliability.

, Being at risk of a heart attack, you should have a current list of your medications and dosages and up to date emergency contact information in your wallet or bag that can be quickly grabbed on your way to the hospital.


Realize that the hospital will not allow you to furnish or bring your meds into the hospital. They have to control meds that you take. You might keep all you meds in a bag to grab and bring to show to the doctors at the emergency department.
Keep a card with your medical information in your wallet, regardless. Include physicians, medications with dosage times and amounts, and contact info for significant others, kin or caretakers.






Also include a list of doctors and family members to contact in case of emergency.

Eat a balanced diet.,
Beware of saturated and trans-fats.,
Reduce your consumption of salt.,
Moderate your intake of alcohol.",How to Prevent Hardening of the Arteries1," Atherosclerosis may be caused, in part, by high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the body, which damage the lining of the artery wall and trigger plaque accumulation.Doctors therefore recommend eating a healthy and balanced diet as part of a prevention scheme. A good diet will be rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes like beans, chickpeas, and lentils, low-fat dairy products, and fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids like trout and salmon. It will also mean giving up most red meat, sugary foods and beverages, and certain fats like palm and coconut oil., In eating a healthy diet, one of the key things that you can do to prevent hardening arteries is to limit your intake of saturated and trans fats. Saturated fats come from animals products like butter and lard; trans fats are often found in hydrogenated oils like margarine or in prepared foods. These two types of fat raise your blood cholesterol levels more than any other factor. If you are following a heart-healthy diet, no more than 5% of your daily calories should come from them. For example, if you eat 2,000 calories per day, you should not exceed 13 grams of saturated or trans fats.Keep in mind that not all fats are bad. Olive oil, peanut butter, nuts and seeds, and avocados are all very good for your cardiovascular health.

, The medical debate on salt is ongoing. While doctors have long warned that Americans eat too much salt, recent research suggests that the risks may be exaggerated.However, we know that salt raises blood pressure, which is a factor in atherosclerosis. So lowering your intake of salt will help to alleviate high blood pressure and, ideally, act as a preventative against the hardening of arteries. As part of a heart-healthy diet, you should consume no more than 2,400 milligrams of sodium per day. In fact, the lower the better.You might be consuming more salt than you know. Eliminate any prepared foods like canned soups which often contain high amounts of salt added as a preservatives or to enhance flavor. Check the nutritional label under ""sodium"" to find salt content. In California and several other states, restaurants are also required to display nutritional information or provide it on demand. Ask if you can see the sodium content of your order.

, Like sodium, alcohol raises blood pressure when drunk to excess. Recent research seems to link excess drinking, especially binge drinking, and atherosclerosis. However, there is evidence that people who drink moderately experience improved cardiovascular health and lower risk of atherosclerosis - this means no more than one drink per day for a female and two drinks per day for a male, with one ""drink"" being 12 oz. of beer, 5 oz. of wine, or 1.5 oz. of hard liquor. Drinkers who exceed these limits in ""binges"" of more than four drinks on any day for men and more than three for women show much poorer results. Scientists do not yet understand the mechanism, but, as Dr. John Cullen of the University of Rochester notes, “people need to consider not only how much alcohol they drink but the way in which they are drinking it.” Keeping the units of alcohol you consume low is a good idea for optimal artery health."
"
Join a smoking cessation program.,
Know your triggers.,
Ask your doctor to suggest cessation aids.",How to Prevent Hardening of the Arteries2," The chemicals in cigarettes harm your blood cells. They also raise your blood pressure, impair heart function, and damage arteries, increasing your risk of atherosclerosis. Whether your cigarette smoke intake is primary or second hand, regular or occasional, any amount hurts your heart and can lead to the hardening of arteries as well as to clots in the bloodstream. The best thing for you to do is quit entirely, which immediately reduces and eventually reverses your risk for all types of heart disease and stroke.Look for smoking cessation programs. Find out from local newspapers, churches, online, and by word of mouth where programs exist and seek them out. If you can’t find a convenient program, start your own group by encouraging smokers you know to quit along with you.

, Be aware of what things you usually do when smoking. Some people smoke while drinking coffee or alcohol, after meals or while watching television, or while in the company of certain people. Once you identify your triggers, take steps to change your behavior. If you tend to smoke during your favorite shows, for example, watch them at the gym while you work out or cut your television viewing altogether. Another strategy is to change your drinking habits by switching from coffee to hot tea and/or to avoid smokers.It’s important to ask for support from family and friends, especially from those who smoke. Ask them to avoid smoking in your presence. It’s difficult to quit if you see and smell it around you.

, Your doctor can suggest medically tested cessation aids. Over-the-counter nicotine aids like gums, patches, or lozenges give you small doses of nicotine and reduce cravings while you slowly wean yourself. There are also prescription nasal sprays, inhalants, and medicines like Bupropion and Varenicline that are used to treat the addictive and withdrawal effects of nicotine. Ask your doctor about what is best for you."
"
Start an exercise program.,
Go slowly at first.,
Create a routine.",How to Prevent Hardening of the Arteries3," Regular exercise can reduce blood pressure and also reduce blood sugar, “bad” fats, and cholesterol, as well as help you reduce excess weight. – All of these are factors that have been indirectly linked to the hardening of arteries. Regular exercise will also help you to strengthen your heart muscle and improve your overall health. You should aim for at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each week or 1 hour and 15 minutes of intense exercise. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least ten minutes at a time spread throughout the week.Plan to do exercises that will elevate your heart rate and oxygen use but that you can sustain at low or moderate intensity for an extended period. Some exercises that fit this recommendation are walking, running, swimming, cycling, jumping rope, or rowing.Experts also recommend two to three 20-30 minute weight training sessions every week, in addition to cardio. Weight training builds lean muscle mass and is part of a healthy workout regimen., The Mayo Clinic suggests that you go at your own pace. If you are not currently exercising, start gradually by walking and performing other low-impact activities that you feel comfortable doing. Give yourself plenty of time to warm up and then gently increase the intensity. As your stamina increases, gradually lengthen the amount of time that you exercise to 30 to 60 minutes each session. Listen to your body, as well and stop if you feel pain, nausea, dizziness, or shortness of breath., Plan your week in order to fit in exercise. If finding time is hard, try to work exercise into your daily routine. Walk to work or to run errands, for example, take the stairs rather than the elevator, or watch your favorite TV shows while on a treadmill.Exercise partners can hold you accountable and create a more social atmosphere. By joining a group such as aerobics, a sports league, or another structured program you may get more enjoyment out of exercise.

"
"
See a doctor regularly.,
Treat high blood pressure.,
Treat high cholesterol.,
Control your diabetes.",How to Prevent Hardening of the Arteries4," Routine check-ups can catch early arterial problems. You don't necessarily need a yearly check-up. If you are under 30 and otherwise healthy, going to your doctor once every two to three years is enough. A check-up every other year is sufficient for those between 30 and 40 who do not have any medical conditions. Annual physicals should start at around the age of 50, earlier if you are at special risk or have other health problems., As said before, high blood pressure can increase your risk of arterial problems and over time cause arteries to stiffen. It therefore needs to be treated. In addition to lifestyle changes like diet, exercise, coping with stress, and limiting sodium and alcohol, it is also possible, with your doctor, to treat high blood pressure through medication. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are all common medicines which, in different ways, stop or slow body functions that increase blood pressure.It is not uncommon for someone to take more than one medication for high blood pressure. You may also experience side-effects. In that case, do not stop taking the medication but ask your doctor if she can change the dosage or drug.

, As said before, high cholesterol is also an indirect factor in the development of atherosclerosis. Your cholesterol level may be high from your diet and/or from your body making too much cholesterol on its own. Apart from losing weight and reducing your consumption of saturated and trans fats, minding food labels carefully, you may need to ask your doctor for medical help in lowering your cholesterol. Statins, for example, block a substance that your liver needs to make cholesterol, which causes the liver to remove the cholesterol from the blood. Statins not only lower cholesterol levels but help the body absorb existing deposits on artery walls, which can possibly reverse coronary artery disease. Other medications may also protect the arteries by decreasing the inflammation, which is thought to contribute to heart disease., Diabetes can cause hardening of the arteries by leaving severe calcium deposits. People with high levels of calcium in the blood are at greater risk for developing hardening of the arteries, so make sure to manage the disease appropriately if you are diabetic. Check your blood sugar daily. Keep track of your numbers and report these to your doctor. Be familiar with what normal blood sugar levels are and try to keep your readings as close to normal as possible. You can do this through an insulin regimen, medicine, exercise, and a special diabetic diet planned in consultation with a doctor or nutritionist."

Lower your sodium intake.,
Eat six to eight servings of grains per day.,
Load up on fruits and vegetables.,
Add low-fat dairy products.,
Eat lean meat, poultry and fish in moderation.,
Control your fat consumption.,
Supplement your diet with nuts, seeds, and legumes.,
Restrict your sugar consumption.",How to Lower Blood Pressure1," Many people eat as much as 3,500 mg of sodium per day. The DASH diet, which is short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, recommends no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Sodium is in salt, so the best way to reduce your sodium intake is to eat less salt. You can do this by:Not adding table salt to your food. This may also include reducing the amount of salt you use when cooking. Easy ways to do this include not salting meats and not adding salt to the water when you cook rice or pasta.
Avoiding salty snacks and processed food such as chips, pretzels, and salted nuts. They often have large amounts of salt added to them. If you do purchase prepared foods, look to see if you can get a low-salt version. Check the contents of canned food, premixed seasonings, bouillon cubes, canned soups, jerkies, and sports drinks to see if they have salt added to them.;
, Whole grains are better than processed white rice or processed white flour because they have more fiber and nutrients. A serving is a slice of bread or a half a cup of cooked rice or pasta. You can eat more whole grains by:Buying whole wheat flour and pasta instead of white. Many whole wheat bread products will say on the packaging that they are whole wheat.
Oatmeal and brown rice are also excellent sources of nutrients and fiber.

, You should eat four to five servings of fruit and four to five servings of vegetables each day. A serving is a half a cup of leafy vegetables or a ½ cup of cooked vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are great sources of potassium and magnesium which help to lower your blood pressure. Excellent ways to get your fruits and vegetables include:Eating salads with your meals. You can keep them interesting by varying what you put in them. You can add a sweet element by putting apple or orange slices on a salad. Leave on the peels of thin-skinned fruits like apples because they also contain nutrients. You can also go more traditional with fresh greens, carrots, and tomatoes. But go easy on the salad dressings: they often have a lot of salt and fatty oils.
Making vegetables a side dish. Instead of cooking pasta, try putting the main dish over a sweet potato or next to a side of squash.
Snacking on fruits and vegetables between meals. Take an apple, banana, carrot, cucumber or green pepper with you to work or school.
Buying fresh and frozen vegetables. If you are worried about having fresh produce go bad before you eat it, frozen vegetables are an excellent choice. You can put them in the freezer until you need them and when you thaw them, they will still be packed with nutrients.

, Dairy is an important source of calcium and vitamin D, but it is important to choose carefully to avoid eating too much fat and salt. A cup is a serving. Aim for two to three servings per day.Cheese is often high in salt, so eat it sparingly.
When you eat yogurt and drink milk, go for the low-fat or skim varieties. Both are great with whole-grain cereals for breakfast.

, Meats and fish are excellent sources of protein, vitamins, iron and zinc, but some kinds can be high in fat and cholesterol. Since fat and cholesterol can clog your arteries, it is best not to eat too much. Eat no more than six servings per day. A serving is an ounce of meat or an egg.Avoid fatty red meats, and if you do eat them, cut the fat off as much as possible. When you cook, don’t fry your meats. Healthier alternatives include baking, grilling, or roasting.
Salmon, herring and tuna are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Eating these fish can help control your cholesterol, and they are high in protein.

, Fat increases your risk of heart disease. To protect your heart, restrict your fat intake to a maximum of three servings per day. A tablespoon of butter is a serving. Easy ways to reduce your fat intake include:Not spreading butter or mayonnaise on bread. Also, you can reduce the amount of oil you cook with. Substitute skim milk for whole milk and avoid heavy cream, lard, solid shortenings, palm and coconut oils.

, They are relatively high in fat, but they also have magnesium, potassium, fiber, and protein. Because of this, the DASH diet recommends eating only four or five servings per week. A serving is 1/3 of a cup of nuts.


Nuts and seeds make an excellent addition to salads or, when unsalted, a healthy snack.
For vegetarians, tofu is an excellent meat substitute because it is high in protein.

, Processed sugars add calories to your diet without providing you with the nutrients that will make you feel satisfied. Reduce your consumption of sweets to, at most, five per week. A serving is a tablespoon of sugar or jelly.You can use artificial sweeteners like Splenda, NutraSweet, and Equal, but use them sparingly.

Contact a health professional to receive an arterial blood gas test.,
Prepare for the procedure.While the arterial blood gas test is common and quite safe, you will still want to prepare for the procedure.,
Know the risks.,
Have a health professional select the test site.,
Have a health professional take a blood sample.,
Follow post-procedure instructions.In the majority of cases, patients will recover from the minor discomfort of an arterial blood gas test quickly and without issue.,
Have the blood sample sent to a lab.,
Interpret the results.",How to Measure Blood Oxygen1," Your doctor or other medical professional can accurately measure your blood oxygen level using advanced techniques and equipment. You may need to have your blood oxygen level tested prior to surgery or other medical procedures, or if you have certain conditions, such as:Sleep apnea
A heart attack or congestive heart failure
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Anemia
Lung cancer
Asthma
Pneumonia
Cystic fibrosis
A current or possible need for mechanical ventilation to support your breathing;
, Talk to your doctor to make sure you understand the test, and ask questions any questions you may have about it. You can also help by letting your doctor know if:


You have or have had bleeding problems
You take blood thinners, such as aspirin or warfarin (Coumadin)
You are taking any medications
You have any known allergies to medications or anesthetics

, The arterial blood gas test is a routine procedure, and there is little chance of serious issues developing as a result of it.Potential minor risks include:


A small bruise at the site where blood is drawn from the artery. Keeping pressure on the site for at least ten minutes after the needle is removed will lower the chances of bruising.
Feelings of lightheadedness, dizziness, or nausea while blood is being drawn from your artery.
Prolonged bleeding. This is a potential risk if you have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood-thinning medicines such as aspirin or warfarin.
A blocked artery. If the needle damages a nerve or artery, it may cause the artery to become blocked. This is a rare problem.

, To measure blood oxygen with this method, blood must be drawn from an artery. Usually, one in your wrist (the radial artery) is chosen, although blood can also be drawn from an artery in your groin (the femoral artery) or from your arm above the elbow (the brachial artery).A needle will be used to draw the blood for the sample.


You will be able to sit for the procedure, and your arm will be extended and will rest on a comfortable surface.
The health professional will feel your wrist to find your pulse and to check the blood flow of your arteries (a procedure called the Allen test).
If you use an arm for dialysis, or if there is infection or inflammation at the intended test site, another area will be used for the arterial blood gas test.
An artery is chosen for this procedure because it will allow the oxygen to be measured before it enters body tissues, giving a more accurate reading.
If you are currently on oxygen therapy, your doctor may have the oxygen shut off for twenty minutes prior to the test (unless you cannot breathe without the oxygen) to help get an accurate reading of your blood oxygen level.

, Once he or she has selected a test site, your health professional will prepare the site and use a needle to take a blood sample.First, the skin on the test site will be cleaned with alcohol. You may be given a local anesthetic (by injection) to numb the area first.
The needle will be puncture your skin, and blood will fill the syringe. Make sure that you breathe normally while the blood is being drawn. If you were not given a local anesthetic, you may feel some slight pain during this step.
Once the syringe is full, the needle will be removed and gauze or a cotton ball will be put over the puncture site.
A bandage will be put over the puncture site. You should apply pressure to the site for five to ten minutes in order to stop any bleeding. If you are on any blood thinning medications or have bleeding problems, your health professional may instruct you to apply pressure for a longer time.

, However, you should be gentle at first with the arm or leg used for the blood draw. Avoid lifting or carrying objects for about twenty for hours after the test.


Contact your doctor if you have prolonged bleeding from the site, or any other unexpected issue.

, Once the sample is collected, your health professional will send the sample to a lab to complete the test. When the sample arrives at a lab, technicians can use special equipment to measure the blood oxygen level of your sample.The amount of time that passes before receiving the results of your arterial blood gas test will depend on which lab your sample is sent to. Your health professional will be able to give you this information.
In emergency situations, particularly if you are in a hospital, the results may be available within a few minutes. Ask your healthcare provider how long you can expect to wait to receive your results.

, The arterial blood gas test gives a reading of partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood, which is more specific and useful to healthcare professionals than the percentages produced by pulse oximetry. Normal oxygen results are between 75-100mmHg (a unit used to measure pressure); normal carbon dioxide results are between 38-42mmHg.Your doctor will discuss the implications of your test results with you, including how your “normal” level may vary based on a number of factors, including:


Your elevation above sea level
The particular lab your sample was sent to
Your age
If you have a fever or low body temperature
If you have certain conditions, such as anemia
If you smoke just prior to the test

"
"
Exercise.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.,
Don’t smoke or chew tobacco.,
Evaluate your medications and don’t use street drugs.,
Reduce your stress.",How to Lower Blood Pressure2," Being physically active can lower your blood pressure by helping to control your weight and manage stress.For the best results try to do 75–150 minutes of physical activity per week. You can choose what you like to do best. Great options include walking, running, dancing, biking, swimming, and playing sports such as basketball or soccer.
Do strength training, such as weight lifting, twice a week to maintain bone density and build muscle.

, Alcohol abuse is bad for your heart. Also, alcoholic beverages are high in calories and make you more prone to obesity. You can lower your blood pressure by quitting drinking or drinking only in moderation.Men over 65 and women should limit themselves to, at most, one drink per day.
Men under 65 should have no more than two drinks per day.
A 12 oz beer, 5 oz glass of wine, or 1.5 oz of hard liquor qualifies as a drink.

, Using tobacco can harden your arteries and cause them to become narrower, which will increase your blood pressure. Secondhand smoke also causes these effects. There are many resources available to help you quit smoking:Talking to your doctor or seeing a counselor
Joining support groups or calling hotlines
Using medications or nicotine replacement therapy

, If you think your medications might be causing high blood pressure, consult your doctor. Your doctor may be able to help you find a medication that is more suitable for you. Don’t stop taking your medications without clearing it with your doctor first. The following substances and medications may increase blood pressure:Cocaine, crystal methamphetamines, and amphetamines
Some birth control pills
Some decongestants and cold medications
Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Ibuprofen and others)

, While stress is an unavoidable part of life, you can use relaxation techniques to help you deal with it better. Common techniques include:Yoga
Meditation

Music or art therapy

Deep Breathing
Visualizing calming images
Progressively tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body

Call emergency medical responders if you think you might be having a heart attack or stroke.,
Go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of high blood pressure.,
Take medications if your doctor feels it is needed.",How to Lower Blood Pressure3," Both are emergencies and every minute counts.


Signs of a heart attack include pressure or pain the chest, pain in one or both arms, neck, back, jaw, or abdomen, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or dizziness. In some, sudden onset reflux symptoms or pain just below the sternum may be experienced. Both men and women are vulnerable to heart attacks.Symptoms of a stroke include: drooping face, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, numbness or weakness in an arm, leg, or the face, confusion, vision problems in one or both eyes, dizziness, loss of coordination, headache, , Most people do not have symptoms, so the best way to find out is to get your blood pressure checked every year at your annual checkup. That being said, when people show symptoms, they may include:Headaches that don’t go away
Blurred vision or seeing double
Frequent nosebleeds
Shortness of breath

, It is imperative to take the medications following your doctor’s instructions. If you skip doses or don’t take them correctly, they may not be effective. Your doctor may prescribe:ACE inhibitors. ACE stands for Angiotensin-converting enzyme. This medication relaxes your blood vessels. It may give you a cough as a side effect. It can interact with other medications, including over-the-counter medications. Don’t take any other medications, including over-the-counter medications, supplements, and herbal remedies without consulting your doctor first.
Calcium channel blockers. This medication widens your arteries. Ask your doctor about side effects and interactions.
Diuretics. These medications reduce your salt levels by causing you to urinate.
Beta-blockers. These medications slow your heartbeat and make it less forceful. This is generally a last resort for when other medications and lifestyle changes have not been sufficient.

Contact a health professional to receive a pulse oximetry test.,
Prepare for the procedure.,
Know the risks.,
Have your health professional prepare the sensor.,
Have your health professional attach the sensor to your body.,
Let the sensor perform a reading.,
Remove the probe.,
Follow post-procedure instructions.,
Interpret the results.",How to Measure Blood Oxygen2," A pulse oximetry test can give the saturation of oxygen in your blood by transmitting light through your tissues. It You may need to have your blood oxygen level tested prior to surgery or other medical procedures, or if you have certain conditions, such as:Sleep apnea
A heart attack or congestive heart failure
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Anemia
Lung cancer
Asthma
Pneumonia
Cystic fibrosis
A current or possible need for mechanical ventilation to support your breathing

, The pulse oximetry method of measuring blood oxygen level is non-invasive, so there is usually little you need to do to prepare for the test.However, your doctor will still discuss the test with you and answer any questions you may have.


You may be asked to remove fingernail polish, if applicable.
Your doctor may give you other specific instructions for preparation, based on your medical condition and history.

, There are very few risks associated with pulse oximetry.These are minimal, but include:


Skin irritation at the application site. This may occur with prolonged or repeated application of the probe sensor.
Inaccurate readings in cases of smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation.
Your doctor can let you know if there are any additional risks, based on your specific medical condition.

, The sensor used to measure the oxygen level of blood by pulse oximetry is a clip-like device called a probe.The probe sensor contains a light source, a light detector, and a microprocessor. The light emitted from the source on one side of the clip passes through your skin and reaches the detector on the other side of the clip. The microprocessor does calculations based on the information received from the detector in order to calculate the oxygen level of your blood with a very small margin of error.

, Usually, a finger, ear, or nose is chosen as the site to attach the sensor.The sensor will then use light to measure the oxygen level of your blood.


This method has the advantage of being painless and noninvasive, since no needles are involved.However, it is not as accurate as an arterial blood gas test, so in some cases, both tests may need to be performed.Your health professional cannot attach the sensor to an area with excessive movement or tremor, or with bruising.For example, if you have a dark bruise under your fingernail, your health professional may place the sensor on your ear instead.

, The sensor’s microprocessor will compare the transmission of two wavelengths of light, red and infrared, as they pass through the relatively thin skin of your finger, ear or other site.Hemoglobin in your blood that has absorbed oxygen absorbs more infrared light, while hemoglobin lacking oxygen absorbs more red light. The sensor calculates the difference between these two values to provide information for deriving your blood oxygen level., If you are having your blood oxygen level measured for a one-time reading, then once the sensor has taken the necessary measurements and completed its calculations, the probe can be removed.In some cases (such as for certain congenital heart conditions), however, your doctor may require you to wear the probe for continuous monitoring.If you are asked to do this, remove the probe sensor only when your doctor tells you to.

, Most of the time, there are no special restrictions following the pulse oximetry test, and you can immediately return to normal activities. Depending on your individual medical condition, however, your doctor may give you special post-procedure instructions.

, Once your doctor has the results of your pulse oximetry test, he or she will review them with you.An oxygen saturation level of about 95% is described as normal.Your doctor will discuss the implications of your test results with you, including how certain factors may alter the results of the test, including:


Decreased peripheral blood flow
Light shining on the oximetry probe
Movement of the test site area
Anemia
Abnormal warmth or coolness at the test site area
Sweating at the test site area
Recent injection of contrast dye
Smoking tobacco

Participate in regular exercise at least 3 days a week.,
Take stretch breaks.,
Elevate your legs.,
Try compression stockings.If you find that your lower legs swell over the course of the day, poor circulatory return may be the cause of your problems.,
Go for a massage.",How to Increase Blood Flow1," Get into the habit of finding activities you enjoy doing. Any type of physical activity that gets your blood pumping is ideal. Try activities like walking, jogging, running or aerobics to get you moving. Walking at a mall may be convenient., Especially if you are working in an office, or sitting in the same position for long periods at a time, taking a stretch break every hour of so can help to increase blood flow. Whether it's touching your toes with your hands, or getting up to take a quick walk and just moving your body, moving your muscles will encourage the blood to flow faster through the tissues, which will in turn help you to feel more energized and alive.

, If you find that you have poor circulation to the extremities (and many people find that their lower legs and feet are most significantly affected), try elevating your legs above the level of your heart. Try putting your legs up on an ottoman or another chair that is higher as the one you are sitting on. You can use a couple of pillows to ensure that your legs are high enough.

, In this case, ask your doctor whether he or she recommends ""compression stockings,"" and ask about where you can get them. They help to return the blood from your extremities back to your heart, which can contribute to improved blood flow.

, Massage can help not only to increase blood flow in the areas being massaged, but also to clear out any toxins that may be lingering from having had insufficient blood flow to that area. You can also ask your massage therapist about essential oils such as rosemary that may help to improve blood circulation.


If you cannot see a professional massage therapist, try doing it yourself. Massage areas of your body that are tight or tense. Inflammation from these muscles can block the pathways that oxygen uses to travel within the body. This often interferes with blood circulation and blood flow. By massaging these muscles, you will release natural occurring toxins within the body and achieve better blood circulation.You can also try using a foam roller as a form of self-massage. Use a foam roller by placing it on the ground and then pressing any sore muscles against it and ""rolling."" For instance, if a certain part of your leg is tight or sore, such as your IT band or your hamstrings, rest this part of your leg over the foam roller and then roll back and forth to provide a massage to that particular muscle. This can help to stimulate increased blood flow to the area being ""massaged"" with the foam roller.

Improve your diet.,
Eat spicy foods.,
Stay well-hydrated.",How to Increase Blood Flow2," Having a healthy diet is key to optimizing your blood flow.This is because, over time, a less healthy diet (containing, for instance, high amounts of processed foods, and one that is high in fat, sugar, and/or salt) can contribute to clogged arteries and overall diminished blood flow. On the other hand, you can improve the health of your arteries and your blood flow by incorporating healthy options like:


Vegetables
Lean meats
Whole grains
Healthy fats (such as those found naturally in avocado, fish oil, nuts and seeds).

, Spicy foods contain capsaicin from hot peppers in them. This chemical increases blood flow throughout the body. This is why many people become flushed when they eat certain spicy foods., Most experts recommend 8-12 cups of water per day, and more if and when you are exercising (to compensate for lost fluid during exertion). Consuming enough water is key to keeping your blood volume up, which in turn helps to improve circulation.


Also avoid too much caffeine and alcohol, as both contribute to dehydration.
However, if you notice swelling in your lower legs throughout the day, this is one indication not to consume too much fluid.If this is the case for you, speak to your doctor about appropriate fluid recommendations to maintain a healthy level of hydration. Keep in mind that there are many potential causes of swelling, so it is important to get a diagnosis and follow your doctor's recommendations.

Quit smoking.The use of nicotine is a leading cause behind circulation problems.,
Have a hot bath.,
Try medication.If you have circulation problems caused by a medical problem such as peripheral artery disease, your doctor can prescribe a variety of medications that help with the overall health of your arteries.,
Opt for surgery.",How to Increase Blood Flow3," Nicotine constricts your blood vessels and reduces blood flow, which is necessary to help nourish your muscles and organs. Quitting smoking will help to increase the availability of oxygen and other important nutrients to the body. Therefore, if you want to improve your circulation, quitting smoking is an important step to take - not only to improve it right here and now, but to prevent your problems from getting worse down the road.

, Fill the bathtub with steaming hot water, and check the water before attempting to get in. The water should be hot, but should not be scalding hot. Hot water helps to relax tense muscles, and to increase blood circulation.This is because heat vasodilates your vessels (makes them open up more), which will allow for increased blood flow throughout your body.

, There are even specialty drugs such as Cilostazol (Pletal) that function specifically to increase blood flow to the limbs., In severe cases of impaired blood flow to the limbs, surgery may be used as a last resort.Surgery can help to remove clots or other blockages from the blood vessels that may be diminishing circulation to the point of being dangerous or damaging.

Be aware of emerging science.,
Boost your intake of foods that contain Omega-3 fatty acids.,
Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that you consume each day.,
Opt for whole grains and cut back on carbs.,
Keep your portion sizes under control.",How to Prevent Heart Disease1," It has been a long-held belief that certain things, such as saturated fats, should be banned from your diet; however, new studies are showing that saturated fats may not increase cardiovascular mortality.In fact, a low-fat diet may actually increase your risk of heart disease, because the fat is replaced by carbohydrates.If you are concerned about eating for a healthy heart, stay abreast of the most current dietary information.


It still stands that trans-fat is very bad for your heart heath and is linked to a host of negative side effects. Decrease the amount of foods you eat that contain trans fats, such as fried foods, packaged foods, margarine, and processed baked goods.;
, Omega-3s are a healthy type of polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3 fatty acids offer protection from heart disease and can be found in foods such as salmon, mackerel, flaxseed, and walnuts and in certain vitamin and mineral supplements.Try to incorporate wild-caught fish into your diet twice per week (farmed fish are often not as high in Omega 3's)., Set a goal of 10 servings of fresh or frozen produce per day. The healthy plant substances found in fruits and vegetables can help prevent heart disease., They are an excellent source of fiber and contain several healthy nutrients that can help regulate blood pressure and improve overall heart health. Though whole grains are much better than refined grains, a diet that is low in carbohydrates been shown to improve cardiovascular health.Replace refined grain products with whole grain products.
Choose whole-wheat flours, 100% whole grain bread, high-fiber cereal, whole grain pasta, steel-cut oats, brown rice and barley.
Stay away from white or refined flours, white bread, frozen waffles, biscuits, corn bread, egg noodles, granola bars, high-fat snacks, quick breads, cakes, pies, donuts and buttered popcorn.

, Although what you eat is important for heart health, how much you eat is also a factor in improving overall heart health. Refrain from overeating, which can lead to excess fat, cholesterol and calorie intake.Keeping portion sizes under control is essential to healthy eating. Use measuring cups and spoons and weight scales to measure your portion sizes until you become familiar enough to recognize them by sight only. Some ways to remember appropriate portion sizes include:


3 oz. of lean meat is about the size of a smart phone.
¼ cup of nuts is about the size of a golf ball.
1 cup of vegetables is about the size of a baseball.

Lose weight if you are overweight.,
Exercise for 30 minutes five days per week.,
Manage stress.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Prevent Heart Disease2," Carrying extra weight puts a strain on your heart which can cause heart disease later in life. You are at an even higher risk if you carry excess weight around your waist. Strive to maintain a healthy weight to avoid complications of being overweight now or later in life.Check your BMI using the American Heart Association's BMI calculator: here


, Getting 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five days per week will help you to protect yourself from heart disease. Developing good exercise habits from a young age and maintaining those habits for your lifetime will improve your chances of staying in shape and reaping the benefits of exercise for your heart.Aim for five 30 minute moderate exercise sessions five days per week, but keep in mind that you can divide these sessions into smaller ones throughout the day. For example, you could exercise for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, or do three 10 minute sessions spread throughout the day.
As an alternative, you can do 25 minutes of vigorous activity three days per week and some kind of moderate to high intensity muscle training twice per week.

, Stress causes damage to your arteries which may lead to heart disease, so it is important to develop techniques for managing stress.Try yoga, deep breathing exercises, meditation, or another relaxation technique to help control your stress levels.


One study showed that meditation effectively lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 4.7 and 3.2 mm Hg., Not getting enough sleep can lead to all kinds of health problems including obesity, high blood pressure, and even heart attack. Take measures to improve your sleep quality and ensure that you get seven to eight hours of sleep each night.


Limit caffeine consumption and cut out all caffeine after 2pm.
Try to go to sleep at the same time every night to regulate your sleep-wake cycle.
Exercise regularly to boost serotonin levels.
Refrain from watching television or using a laptop while in bed.

Request regular health screening tests from your doctor.,
Ask about metabolic syndrome.,
Talk to your doctor about the role of inflammation.,
Get help to quit smoking.,
Talk to your doctor for advice about moderating alcohol use.,
Make your doctor aware of your other concerns.",How to Prevent Heart Disease3," Keeping tabs on your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar can help to keep you in good health. Blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar are major factors in the development of heart disease, but you can keep them under control by having them checked often.Blood Pressure. Have your blood pressure checked every two years. You may need to get checked more often if your numbers are high or if you are at risk of high blood pressure.

Cholesterol. The information about cholesterol has become more detailed and is based more on smaller lipoproteins than on overall cholesterol. Therefore, ask your doctor to check your CRP, or C-reactive protein, levels. Elevated CRP levels are linked to inflammation of the arteries, which is linked to heart disease.A simple blood test can check your CRP levels.

Diabetes. The recommended age to begin screening for diabetes is 45, but you should ask your doctor when you should started having screenings based on your medical history and risk factors. Even prediabetes is now being treated by doctors as a risk factor for the development of diabetes and for cardiovascular disease as well., Metabolic syndrome — which refers to a cluster of risk factors that increase your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes — is becoming more common as more people live a sedentary lifestyle.Risk factors include excess fat around the waistline, a high triglyceride level, high blood sugar, or high blood pressure.Combat metabolic syndrome by tackling any risk factors you may have. Exercise and change your diet to lose weight if you have abdominal obesity. Limit alcohol, manage stress, and follow other guidelines for a heart-healthy lifestyle., Recent studies are showing that inflammation is a hugely overlooked risk factor for atherosclerosis. The best way to currently test for inflammation is to have your doctor check your CRP levels.Inflammation may be caused by loss of muscle mass, cancer, inflammatory diseases (like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus), metabolic syndrome, and injuries to the artery wall, often caused by oxidized LDL cholesterol, smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar., Smoking is a major contributor to the development of heart disease and it is the leading cause of preventable deaths. If you smoke, do everything that you can to quit. Ask your doctor about smoking cessation programs and medications that may help make quitting easier.One study showed that smoking for two years increases one’s risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 36%., Drinking alcohol in moderation may offer some benefits to your heart, but drinking too much can harm your heart health. You should have no more than one drink a day if you are a woman and no more than two drinks if you are a man. (Men over the age of 65 should only have one drink per day as well.) Any more alcohol than this can increase your risk of developing heart disease.


If you often struggle to stop at just one drink, discuss your options with your doctor.

, If you have a history of heart disease in your family, then you should make sure that your doctor knows about it. Your doctor may recommend extra precautions to help prevent you from developing heart disease and to help you maintain good cardiovascular health.

Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Choose whole grains.,
Lower your salt intake.,
Find healthy proteins.,
Drink eight to ten 8-ounce glasses of water daily.,
Eat more foods containing potassium.,
Avoid sugar.",How to Prevent Hypertension1," Fresh produce generally has a low calorie density, meaning you can eat a lot of them and fill up without ingesting too many calories. Have four to five servings of vegetables each day. One serving is 1 cup of leafy greens, ½ cup of cooked veggies, or 6 ounces of vegetable juice. In addition, eat four to five servings of fruit a day.


Fresh produce is always best, but you can also have frozen fruit and veggies or even dried fruit (just watch for added sugar).
Try veggie chips instead of regular potato chips. You can make your own at home with just a baking sheet and a little olive oil. Kale chips are an excellent choice, and much cheaper to make yourself than to purchase.
Add fresh fruit to your oatmeal or cereal in the mornings. Or make a smoothie with frozen fruit and yogurt or milk. If you have more time to cook, try an omelet with your favorite sliced veggies.
Double the amount of vegetables in recipes for soups, salads, and casseroles.;
, White flour is basically sugar when digested. Instead of white bread and pasta, choose whole grain versions made with wheat, oats, brown rice, barley or rye. Whole grains offer nutrients that aren’t found in most fruits and vegetables, and eating three servings daily can substantially reduce your risk of heart disease.Try brown or wild rice instead of white rice. It’s better for you and adds a lot of flavor.
Choose whole-grain cereals for breakfast, or switch to oatmeal some days.Read packages to look for foods with a whole grain as the first ingredient, or at least 8 g of whole grain content per serving.Cooking pasta al dente is a better health option as it takes longer to digest and functions as a good source of fiber in the diet., Eating too much sodium can cause high blood pressure and damage arteries. You should have no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day.Buy fresh meats instead of packaged ones, like lunch meat. These typically have a lot of added sodium.
Choose plain frozen vegetables instead of those with sauces or seasonings, and add your own flavors when you cook them.
When eating out, request dishes to be prepared without added salt.

, Choose skinless chicken or turkey and ground beef that is at least 90% lean. Seafood and fish are great choices for protein, often easy to prepare, and leaner than meats. Vegans should include legumes, peas, nuts and seeds in their diet for adequate protein intake, and vegetarians can eat more eggs, too.


Try quinoa in soups, tossed with vegetables or in salads.Make sure you prepare them in healthy ways, too, like grilling, poaching, baking or roasting, instead of frying in oil.One serving of meat is 3 to 4 ounces, and you should have two or less each day.Red meat is ok to eat on occasion, but not everyday. Skinless poultry or fish are less fatty and generally healthier for people with hypertension.

, Dehydration can contribute to hypertension because it makes the body retain sodium.Drinking plenty of fluids also helps flush toxins from the body. Drink more than this if you live in a hot climate and when you exercise.


The amount of water each person needs is very individual. Elderly people generally need less than eight glasses a day, while overweight people need more water to help digestion and flushing toxins. Add one extra glass for each 25 lbs over your ideal body weight.Drink when you are thirsty and drink until you are not anymore, and you are probably getting enough.
Increase your water intake gradually if you do not currently drink much. This will prevent placing high stress on your kidneys.
When exercising, you need more. Drink 2 cups of fluid two hours before exercising, and water every 15 minutes while exercising.

, The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet recommends getting 150% more potassium than the typical American diet. Potassium is naturally found in potatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, kidney beans, bananas, avocadoes, fish, and milk.Eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day will provide enough potassium to help lower your blood pressure.





Avoid potassium supplements if you have kidney disease or take blood pressure medicines. Increasing your potassium intake sharply could be harmful in these cases, so ask your doctor for advice on how to add more to your diet naturally and safely.

, One tablespoon of sugar or jam and 8 ounces of sugary beverage both count as one serving. Don’t have more than five servings per week.Start reading packages to look for added sugars and choose regular versions of snacks instead of low-fat versions, which often have even more sugar to make up for less taste.


Drink flavored sparkling water instead of soda. There are many brands and flavors available and often they are calorie-free. Or, add some fresh fruit, herbs, and/or vegetables to regular drinking water to make it more fun. Mint and cucumber taste great together, as do watermelon and basil.
Eat fruit with a spoonful of whipped cream for dessert instead of ice cream or pies. The natural sugar in fruit is much better for you and digests slower in your body. This is also an easy way to increase your intake of fresh produce, but make sure to leave skins on since they contain most of the plant’s fiber.
There are 56 different names for sugars used in lists of ingredients (including dextrose, lactose, malt, sucrose, sorbitol, cane juice, rice syrup, molasses maple syrup, corn syrup, and glucose). If one is the first ingredient, or more than one type of sugar is included, choose something else. Manufacturers used various names to hide the total amount of sugar used so that it isn’t the first ingredient listed."

Check your blood pressure regularly.,
Exercise at least 2 ½ hours each week.Exercise not only firms, tones and helps weight loss, but it also relieves stress and tension that can be harmful and contribute to hypertension.,
Lose weight, if needed.,
Increase your overall physical activity.",How to Prevent Hypertension2," You should have it checked at the doctor’s office every two years starting at age 20 if it is below 120/80. If it is higher than that, your doctor may recommend coming in more often.If you have high blood pressure at the doctor’s office, you can buy a blood pressure monitor to use at home from most drug stores and pharmacies. Daily monitoring can help your doctor know if treatments or lifestyle changes are working.Chart your blood pressure readings to look for changes or patterns.
Don’t rely solely on a home monitor. These are made to be used in conjunction with screenings by your health care provider.
Do not adjust or stop taking prescribed medicines even if your home monitor shows a decrease in blood pressure without discussing it with your doctor first.
Pregnant women and the elderly should always monitor their blood pressure at home in addition to visiting their doctor regularly.

,


Walking is an excellent way to start an exercise program, as you can start out slowly. If you're a beginner exerciser or haven't exercised in a while, try walking for 10 minutes at a time. Slowly build up to walking for longer periods of time, from 30 to 50 minutes.
If walking is painful, try low-impact exercises like swimming or using a stationary bicycle.
Enroll in an aerobic or Pilates class to firm and tone your muscles.
Try kickboxing or Krav Maga to learn self defense while becoming more fit.
Include strength training two to three times weekly, as this can help build muscle and stability.

, People who are overweight have a higher risk of being diagnosed with hypertension, and even losing ten pounds can take some strain off your heart.Eat a healthy diet by following standard nutritional guidelines and exercise most days of the week to lose weight gradually and safely.


You may need to count calories everyday to make sure your intake is less than your caloric output, but ask your doctor before drastically restricting calorie intake. Eating just 500 calories less daily can help you lose one pound a week.Avoid crash diets and severe calorie or food group restrictions, since such diets cause added stress to the body instead of relieving physical stresses associated with being overweight.
Overweight individuals that used hypertension medication to control their blood pressure reported they were either able to stop taking or reduce the dosage after losing weight and decreasing sodium intake.If you aren’t sure if you are over a healthy weight, ask your doctor, or use an online Body Mass Index calculator.

, Do housework and lawn work yourself instead of paying someone else to do it. Park at the back of lots when you run errands to make yourself walk more. Take the stairs instead of an elevator. Stand up while on the phone and pace the room.Tracking your steps and activity is a great motivator and way to reach your goals Consider a pedometer, using your smartphone, or buying a device that tracks more details electronically, such as a Fitbit.

Limit alcohol intake.,
Stop smoking.,
Manage your stress.",How to Prevent Hypertension3," Drinking more than three servings in a single sitting will raise your blood pressure temporarily, but binge drinking regularly can cause serious long-term effects on your cardiovascular system. Alcohol may also interact with any medications you take and adds calories to your diet that could contribute to weight gain or inability to lose weight.Men under 65 should have two or less drinks per day and those over 65 should limit themselves to just one drink daily.Women should not have more than one drink per day.If you are a heavy drinker, taper down over a period of one to two weeks to avoid a severe rise in blood pressure often associated with sudden avoidance of alcohol.
One drink is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor.

, Nicotine raises your blood pressure, lowers HDL cholesterol, reduces oxygen levels in the body, and can cause blood clots. All of these factors can lead to serious heart disease, but quitting now can reduce your risk of heart disease by half after a year.Using a nicotine replacement product in addition to joining a smoking cessation program doubles your chances of quitting, according to the American Lung Association.
E-cigarettes help some people quit over time. Use them to taper off your consumption or to take a puff when you feel you can’t resist it, instead of buying a whole pack of smokes. Note that they are not a safer version of cigarettes, however.
Make notecards listing all the reasons you want to quit and keep them with you at all times. When the urge is strong, use them to remind you why quitting is worth the effort.
Keep your hands busy at times you used to have a cigarette. For example, you can still join your friends or co-workers on a “smoke break,” but take an apple to eat so you aren’t tempted.

, Regular exercise will help reduce overall stress, as will getting adequate sleep every night (seven to nine hours for most people). Consider adding another activity specifically to address stress management, like meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, or a low-stress hobby.Practice deep breathing exercises daily so that when you are in a high stress situation you can use these exercises to calm yourself down.
Meditation is a method for practicing mindfulness, which helps you focus on the moment and not think about everything that is stressing you out. If you aren’t comfortable with the idea of meditation, simply add mindfulness to your regular activities, like washing dishes or cooking dinner. Pay attention to what you are doing and the sights, sounds and smells you notice.
Pick up a fun hobby, like coloring in an adult coloring book, for a quick activity you can stop and do whenever you start to feel stressed. Try not to make it a competitive or difficult activity where you have to learn new skills, to avoid causing more stress.

Consider surgery.",How to Straighten Your Spine," Maintaining good posture while you sit, walk and sleep is probably the most important thing you can do for the health of your spine.Many people have sedentary jobs where they sit for most of the day, so the height, comfort and support of chairs are crucial. Make sure your office chair is adjustable (so you can customize it to your dimensions) and try to get one with lumbar support for your low back. At home, use cushions to support your back and prop your legs up while watching television.


Try not to cross your legs or feet when you sit because it makes your hips unlevel and puts a strain on your lower back.
Make sure your computer screen is at eye level and centred in front of your chair, otherwise, you'll strain your neck and possible develop an abnormal curvature.;
, Your feet are crucial for good posture because they are the foundation for your entire body. As such, wear sturdy shoes with good arch support, a slightly raised heel (1/2 – 3/4 of an inch) and plenty of room for your toes. In contrast, avoid regularly wearing high-heeled shoes because they affect the body’s center of gravity and induce compensatory alignment of the entire body — they can cause too much extension (called hyperlordosis) in the lumbar spine.If you are really heavy, have flat feet or a short leg, then consider getting orthotics (custom-made shoe inserts) of heel lifts. Orthotics promote a healthy spine by supporting the arches and allowing better biomechanics when running or walking.
Orthotics are made by podiatrists, medical specialists and some chiropractors.

, You likely spend at least 1/3 of your life in your bed, so pay a little more attention to the quality of your mattress and how you sleep on it. For most people, firm mattresses are the best strategy in order to provide the necessary support for their spine. Memory foam top covers may also be helpful. You should consider changing mattresses every eight to 10 years. The thickness of your pillow should match the distance from the side of your head to the tip of your shoulder — a good rule of thumb to keep your neck aligned while sleeping.


The best sleeping position for your spine is laying on your side, with your hips and knees slightly bent, and with a small pillow wedged between your thighs, which helps to keep your hips aligned also.Try not to prop your head up with too many pillows while in bed reading because it will strain your neck and possibly reverse its normal lordosis (curve).

, Even if you are only carrying the weight from class to class, or from school back home, the weight of a heavy backpack can have serious consequences on your spinal health, as it compresses your spine. It can cause spine curvature and may even prevent you from reaching your full height!Even worse, if you carry your backpack on only one shoulder or wear a bag that puts all the weight on one shoulder, such as a messenger-style bag, your spine can begin to curve.When carrying a bag or backpack, make sure the weight is always evenly distributed between your shoulders. If you are carrying a very heavy suitcase or briefcase, make sure you don't always carry it on the same side.
Consider a rolling backpack or briefcase.
Try to make more trips to your locker throughout the day and swapping out textbooks instead of carrying them all with you. If your locker is far away and the passing periods are short, see if you can get a note from your doctor that will allow you a little extra time to go to your locker between classes.

, Moderate exercise has many health benefits, including weight loss and increased muscle strength, which both positively impact the spine.Carrying too much weight puts excessive pressure on spinal joints, making them more susceptible to wearing out and becoming misaligned. In addition, stronger muscles keep bones and joints within their normal positions. Weight training is a great way to build stronger muscles, but be careful not to overwork certain muscle groups while ignoring their counterparts because that can lead to poor posture. Consult with a personal trainer if you're unsure of how to train properly.


Every morning when you wake up, turn on your back and slowly do ""snow angels"" with your arms and legs for three to five minutes. The motions are great for warming up and lightly stretching many muscles important for keeping your spine aligned.
Using the rowing machine at the gym will strengthen the muscles between your shoulder blades and promote better upper body posture.
Pilates and yoga are other exercises that stretch and balance your body, especially the core muscles (abdomen, pelvis, low back), which form the foundation of good posture.

, To maintain strong, straight and healthy bones, certain nutrients are needed. Minerals such as calcium, magnesium and boron form the mineral matrix of bone and a deficiency of these can lead to bones that are too brittle and susceptible to fractures (known as osteoporosis). Vitamin D is also essential for bone health, and a lack of it leads to bones that are too soft and easily deformable (known as rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults).


Vitamin D is produced by your skin when it's exposed to intense summer sunshine.
The recommended dietary intake for calcium is 1,000 – 1,200 mg daily, depending on your age. The best natural sources of calcium are collards, kale, spinach, sardines, tofu, almonds and sesame seeds., Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, usually in the thoracic region (area between your shoulder blades), that can lead to back pain and restricted movement.For unknown reasons, some people are born with scoliosis, while others develop it during adolescence. Screenings are usually done in middle school by nurses, but most health professionals are qualified to examine you for scoliosis. Screening usually involves bending forward at the hips and seeing if one shoulder blade sticks up more than the other.


Scoliosis screening is more important for kids than adults because some treatments (bracing or implantation of metal rods) can slow down or stop the progression of the condition while the spine is still developing.
Girls have a greater risk of developing scoliosis and a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment., If you have a positive scoliosis screening or have reason to believe your spine is somehow abnormal, then see a medical specialist. An orthopedic surgeon will carefully examine your spine and likely take X-rays to better understand your problem. The specialist will look for relatively common spinal pathologies such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and herniated discs — all of which can lead to abnormal spinal curvature and biomechanics.Specialists may also use CT scans, MRI, bone scans or more sophisticated X-rays to further diagnose your spinal condition.
Surgery is rarely used to treat or cure spinal diseases or abnormalities.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who rely on more natural methods to treat the spine and other parts of the body, and don't rely on pharmaceuticals or use invasive methods such as surgery. They can evaluate your spine for any abnormalities including unusual curves, restricted motion or tight muscles.


Although some forward curvature in the thoracic spine or mid-back is normal, too much leads to a hyper-kyphosis or hunchback.The most common causes of a hyper-kyphosis are osteoporosis, arthritis, tumors and bad (slouching) posture.
The thoracic spine can also be completely straight, which is actually considered abnormal and sometimes referred to as ""military spine.""

, Your pelvis is made up of two bones which are fused with ligaments. If one of these bones is smaller than the other, then it can cause you to sit or stand while tilting to toward the smaller bone.This can lead to a curved spine in addition to many other health and posture problems. If you find that you often sit with your body tilted toward one side, ask your doctor about small hemipelvis.


To correct small hemipelvis, you can get inserts for your shoes and carry around a book or magazine to sit on so you don't lean to one side., Regular treatments (perhaps monthly) from a chiropractor or osteopath is not only effective for spinal pain, but it may also keep you better aligned.Chiropractors use a type of physical manipulation called spinal adjustments, which attempts to realign or unjam the small facet joints of the spine. Spinal adjusting can't reverse a scoliosis, but it can be important for maintaining normal spinal curvatures — especially following significant spinal trauma such as whiplash from a car accident.


Adjustment of a spinal joint may result in a popping sound — the same as when you “crack” your knuckles. The noise is caused by the change of pressure within the joint, which results in gas bubbles being released.
There is usually minimal, if any, discomfort involved with spinal adjustments.

, Get a back, shoulder, and/or neck massage from someone qualified to do so. Massage reduces muscle tension, which may be helpful for spinal alignment if you have tight muscles surrounding or attached to your spinal column and pulling on it. Massage is also effective for reducing stress, which is often a factor in developing poor posture, especially of the upper body.


Massage can squeeze lactic acid, toxins and compounds that cause inflammation out of muscles and other soft tissues and into your bloodstream, so always drinks lots of water in order to flush them out of your body.
Some massage therapists practice reflexology, which is the stimulation of parts of the foot to improve health. Ask your therapist to stimulate the points that are related to spinal health.

, A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your spine, and if need be, treat your spinal muscles with electrotherapy such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation. Exercises targeting the back extensors, neck flexors and pelvic muscles are crucial for good posture.


Progressive resistance training with weights can halt or reverse bone loss in some cases, which can help with spinal health and alignment.
If your muscles are sore following exercise or massage, then take an Epsom salt bath. The magnesium within the salt is great for relaxing tense muscles and dissolving pain.

, If you have osteoporosis or low bone density within your spine and fear fractures or deformity, then ask your doctor about medications that promote stronger bones, such as the numerous bisphosphonates that are on the market (Boniva, Reclast, Fosamax). Hormone-based medications that can help build bone density include raloxifene, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone.Bisphosphonates can increase the risk of rare fractures and cause bone, joint or muscle pain.
Teriparatide, a form of parathyroid hormone, increases the rate of bone formation and s the FIRST FDA approved drug for the treatment of osteoporosis and new bone formation.

, Surgery of the spine should be considered a last resort for most people who have spinal problems, but sometimes it's the first choice for a child whose scoliosis is rapidly deforming their spine. The operation for scoliosis is a spinal fusion — essentially a ""welding"" process.The basic idea is to realign and fuse together the curved vertebrae so that they heal into a single, solid bone. All spinal fusions use a bone graft, which are small pieces of bone that are placed into the spaces between the vertebrae to be fused. The bones then grow together, similar to when a broken bone heals.


Metal rods are typically used to hold the spine in place until fusion happens. The rods are attached to the spine by screws, hooks, and/or wires and then usually removed at a later time.
Possible complications from surgery include infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage and chronic swelling / pain.

Keep good form while sitting.,
Stand up straight.,
Check your posture.",How to Stop Slouching1," Your body has natural curves in it, and good posture helps promote that. To have good posture while you sit, you need to keep your shoulders back, your chest open, and your back straight and tall. To keep your shoulders back, you need to move your shoulders back and push your chest out more. You should feel your head move back as well. This should open up your chest and tuck in your abdomen muscles.


Your back should straighten naturally as you push your shoulders back and open your chestMake sure you keep your shoulders straight and relaxed. They should not be elevated, rounded, or pulled too far backward.;
, Now that you have your shoulders and chest aligned, it is time to learn to stand and walk with better posture. Start with your shoulders aligned with the rest of the spine and your abdomen pulled in. Keep your feet hip distance apart and balance your weight easily on the balls both feet. Relax your knees and hang your arms to the side.


Imagine there is a string from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head, keeping your body aligned and balanced., To check your posture, you need to stand against the wall. Your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks should touch the wall and your heels should be 2-4 inches away from the wall. Take your arm and run the palm of your hand along the wall along the space at your lower back. If you are standing with correct posture, your hand should just fit in the area.


If there is more than a hand's width worth of space, you are pushing your stomach and hips out too much. You should contract your abs and pull your back toward the wall more.
If your hand cannot fit, you are hunched too far forward and you need to push your shoulders back."
"
Know what good posture looks like.,
Recognize pain and discomfort.,
See if you have “over-pronated” feet.,
Evaluate your mood.",How to Straighten Your Back1," The first step to improving your posture is simply knowing what to look for in yourself. Make sure your shoulders are back, your stomach is in, and your chest is out. Stand sideways in a mirror and see if you can draw a straight line from your earlobe down through your shoulder, hip, knee, and ending at the middle of your ankle.


Head and neck: Make sure that your head extends straight up from your shoulders. Many people tend to lean their head forward. If your ears line up with the front of your chest, you need to pull your head back.Shoulders, arms, and hands: Your arms and hands should fall on the side of your body. If so, your shoulders are exhibiting good posture. If your arms fall towards the front of your chest, then pull your shoulders back.Hips: Find a happy middle position between rolling your hips far forward or backward.;
, The most obvious sign of bad posture is back, shoulder, and neck pain. Poor posture causes your chest muscles to tighten, which forces your upper back muscles to compensate. This results in weaker back muscles in general, which produces pain and discomfort. Since all of your muscles work together, when one muscle set isn’t functioning properly, the others are affected.Not all people with poor posture feel pain or discomfort. Our bodies are fairly capable of adjusting and compensating.

, This is when the arch of your foot is almost completely flat. It is also often called a “fallen arch”. Our feet are the lowest balancing mechanism of our bodies. If you have poor posture, you are forcing your feet to work harder to maintain balance. This causes your feet to gradually “flatten” so as to provide a sturdier foundation. If you improve your posture, your weight should rest nearly entirely on top of your heels, freeing up the remainder of your foot to have an arch.While “fallen arches” are themselves a sign of poor posture, you may also experience pain in your feet, ankle, calf, knee, hip, and lower leg area in general., A study conducted at San Francisco State University asked students to walk down a hall in a slouched position or to stand upright and skip. The slouchers reported increased feelings of depression and general lethargy. While this may seem strange, think about it. Your body language often indicates your mood in general.You sit crouched in a corner with your arms crossed when you are angry or sad. You perk up when you are happy. So why can’t your moods tell you something about your body posture? If you've been down in the dumps, consider improving your posture."
"
Have better posture at work.,
Sit in a better position.,
Check yourself in the mirror.,
Stretch when you get up.,
Check your sleep posture.,
Balance the weight you carry.,
Make a lower back pad.,
Try relaxation techniques.",How to Stop Slouching2," Many people have jobs where they work at a desk. This is one of the main places where slouching can be at its worst. As you work throughout the day, you lean toward your computer or over your desk as you work on documents. If you sit too far forward, you put pressure on your pubic bone. If you sit too far back, you put pressure on your tailbone. In order to stop this trend, you should lean back in your chair, keeping your back flush with the chair's support.


If you feel too far away from your desk or computer, pull your chair closer or move your monitor closer to you on the desk.Adjust your computer screen such that the middle of the screen is at eye level. This can help you keep proper posture and prevent back pain.If you find yourself still slouching, try setting an alarm on your phone to remind you every hour to sit up straighter. This will help you get into the habit and you'll eventually not need the reminder., In all aspects of your life, you should sit properly to avoid muscle and back problems. You need to find a comfortable middle range where everything is aligned naturally. Sit with your feet flat on the floor and center your weight between your buttocks and pubic bone.


This goes for every place you sit. For example, make sure you are comfortable and sit straight in the car, especially if you have a long commute. Use a pillow or adjust your seat to get your back and spine aligned and centered while you drive., To assess how your posture normally is, you need to evaluate how you stand. Turn facing a mirror and stand like you normally do. If your palms face your thighs with your thumbs pointing ahead of you, you have good posture. If your hands rest ahead of your thighs or behind your thighs, or if your palms back backwards, then your posture is wrong.


If you find that your posture is off, pull back your head and pull your shoulders down and back. This will realign your spine and get your posture toward the right angle.
If you feel like your chest is popping out, you are standing correctly., Your muscles become fatigued when you still for long periods of time. Strive to get up and stretch for at least 1-2 minutes for every half hour of sitting. Stand and stretch, placing your hands against your lower back with fingers facing down. Lean back as far as you can and hold for a few seconds. Repeat a few times to get the kinks out of your back.


If you are at home, you can also lie flat on the floor with your weight on your elbows. Push your chest up, stretching out your lower back and spine.
Only do these exercises to the extent that your muscles are comfortable. Do not overextend your muscles because you don't want to cause injury., When you sleep, you can have poor posture that reflects in your normal, waking posture. If you sleep on your side, try putting a pillow between your knees to help lessen the pull on your lower back. If you sleep on your back, you can put a pillow underneath your knees to help release the tension placed on your lower back while you sleep.


Whether you sleep on you back or your side, placing a rolled up towel under your neck will allow your head and shoulders proper alignment.You should not sleep on your stomach. This position places too much strain on your neck as you sleep., There are times when you might have to carry a large load, such as a large purse, a backpack, or luggage. When you have to deal with these kinds of loads, you should try to balance the weight around as much as possible to keep strain off of your muscles and joints. If the weight is balanced, you will also be able to keep your normal, straight posture while you walk.


To help balance your loads, you should use bags that distribute the weight evenly, such as backpacks or rolling luggage., When you are at work, at home, or in the car, you can sit for too long and start to feel pain in your lower back. To help prevent this, you can make yourself a pad to place along your lower back to help keep your posture straighter. Take a towel and fold it in half and then in half again. From the long rectangle, roll it into a cylinder, making a cushy pillow to put in your chair.


If a bath towel is too big, you can try a hand towel instead. Just fold it in half once and roll it into a small pillow for your back., Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, massage therapy and yoga, can restore tired muscles. They also calm the central nervous system and combat the fatigue that invites slouching. Whether you join a new yoga class around the corner from your office or simply sit up and take a few deep, cleansing breaths, make time in your day for some relaxation to decrease muscle tension."

Strengthen your core.,
Increase your neck flexibility.,
Try the superman stretch.,
Try the T and W exercises.,
Do a corner stretch.,
Perform the doorway stretch.,
Try shoulder dislocations.,
Attempt thoracic extensions.,
Explore chiropractic.",How to Stop Slouching3," The muscles in your core stretch from the area around your rib cage to around mid-thigh. These muscles work together to help you stand tall and regulate your posture. You should do exercises that strengthen these muscles in order to improve your posture and overall health.


Try exercises that work all of the muscles in this group. For example, lie flat on the ground with your legs bent above you, as if your feet were flat against the wall. Engage your abs and extend one leg down almost to the floor, straightening it as you go. Hold for a second just above the floor before you bring it back up. Repeat on the other leg. Do 20 sets of this exercise., A lack of flexibility causes muscle imbalance and poor body alignment. You should increase stretches that help with the flexibility of your back, arms, and core. You should also incorporate this into your daily routine at work, where you stretch periodically throughout the day to increase your muscle flexibility even while stationary.


Try easy neck and back flexibility stretches. Stand or sit straight up. Pull your head back and center it over your spine. Pull your shoulders back and down and bend your arms, moving them down as if you are trying to put your elbows in your back pockets. Push your palms outward and hold for at least 6 seconds.
Repeat a few times during the day to increase flexibility., To keep up your posture, you need to exercise the muscles in your back. To do the superman stretch, lie face down on the floor and extend both your arms over your head. Turn your thumbs toward the ceiling. Squeeze your glutes, contract your core, and lift your arms, head, and legs about 4 inches off the ground. Hold this position for 2 seconds, then lower your limbs back down to the floor.


You should repeat this move 15 times to help strengthen your shoulders and activate the muscles that strengthen your spine., One great way to improve your posture is to increase the strength in your back. To do the T exercise, lie face down on the floor and extend your arms to the side, make a large T with your body. Turn your thumbs to the ceiling as you contract your abs and glutes. Pull your shoulder blades together and lift your arms toward the ceiling as far as you can comfortably go. Hold this position for 2 seconds, and then lower your arms. Repeat 15 times.


To do the W exercise, lie face down with your upper arms straight across at the shoulder. Bend your arms so that your forearms are parallel to your neck, turning your thumbs toward the ceiling and making a W. Contract your abs and glutes, pulling your shoulder blades together and lift your arms toward the ceilings. Hold this position for 2 seconds. Repeat 15 times.
These exercises work the muscles that connect your shoulder blades to your spine, strengthening your spine alignment and improving your posture., Your chest muscles can aid in your posture. To stretch them out, find a corner and face it. Bring your bent arms up, placing your forearms on the wall with your palms placed slightly below shoulder height. Slowly squeeze your shoulder blades together, leaning into the corner.


Hold this stretch for 3 seconds. Repeat 12 times., The looseness and strength of your chest plays a role in how much you slouch. To build flexibility and strength in these muscles, stand in a doorway and hold your arm at your side at a 90 degree angle. Hold your elbow even with your shoulder and place your arm on the door jamb. Slowly lean forward, pushing out from the doorway and pulling your arm back against the jamb. Hold for 30 seconds and release.


Repeat with the opposite arm. You can also repeat this exercise multiple times a day.
To stretch your upper and lower chest muscles, repeat this exercise with your arm lower on the door jamb and higher as well., Although this exercise might sounds dangerous, it does not cause shoulder dislocations. It helps make your shoulders more flexible, which will help you keep your chest up and back straight. To perform this exercise, you need a broomstick or PVC pipe that is about 5 feet long. Hold the stick in front of you with both hands, resting against your thighs. Slowly lift the stick off of your thighs, lifting your arms over your head, down around your body, until it rests on the back of your legs. Next, slowly bring your arms back around.


Do 3 sets of 10 reps, where one rep is a complete rotation of your arms.
You should start wide and bring your arms closer together if it feels like you can. The closer your hands are to each other on the stick, the deeper the stretch.
Make sure you do this slowly. You do not want to injure yourself by doing it too quickly., The thoracic spine is middle section of your spine. You need to keep it loose so it doesn't become hunched and immobile. For this exercise, you need a foam roller. Place the foam roller under your upper back with your feet and bottom on the floor. Place your hands behind your head and your elbows as close to your ears as possible. Let your head drop back, curling your back around the foam roller. Hold for a 15 seconds and come back up.


You can stretch out your whole back as well. When you are leaned back, use your feet to roll yourself up and down the foam roller. If you feel a particularly tense spot, stop and pull your head up, leaning back into the roller., A talented chiropractor can restore balance to your body by manipulating your spine and finding areas out of alignment. If your posture problem persists despite the exercises above, seek out a licensed professional in your area to improve your range of motion and reduce any pain that your slouching is causing. Most chiropractors will do a comprehensive intake examination to tailor your therapy to your body and particular discomfort."

Remind yourself to stand up straight.,
Practice Yoga.,
Do other exercises and stretches to improve your posture.",How to Straighten Your Back2," Set your phone or computer to alert you to check your posture. Place notes for yourself around your house, car, and office. Sometimes all it takes to keep good posture is constant reminders and reinforcement. You need to reprogram your habits just as much as you need to strengthen your back muscles., Yoga is specifically good for improving your posture. Some of the best exercises include:



The cobra. Lie on your stomach with your hands under your shoulders. Make sure you point your fingers forward. Then, keeping your elbows close to your sides, try to touch your shoulder blades together. Be sure to stabilize your back by tightening your abdominal muscles. Then, slowly lift your chest to the ceiling, making sure to keep your neck long. Use your arms for support, but your back muscles to pull you up. Hold for 10 breaths, then lower yourself. Repeat 3 times. Child's pose: Stand on your knees with your arms above your head. Palms should be facing each other. Then, exhale and slowly move forward. Lower your forehead to the floor and stretch your arms out in front of you, pressing your palms into the floor. Hold, and then return to the starting position. Repeat six times. Mountain Pose. Stand straight with your feet on the ground, heels slightly apart. Be sure your weight is evenly distributed between your two feet. Lift the insides of your ankles so that your feet seem cupped. Then, extend your shoulder blades and try to touch them. Slowly release. Finally, raise your arms to the ceiling and gaze forward., These techniques should specifically focus on your abdominal and back muscles as these are the muscles that will help support your spine. Squeeze your shoulder blades together. Pretend you're holding a ball between your shoulder blades.Try to squeeze the ball by bringing your shoulder blades together. Hold for 10 seconds. This will help stretch the front of your shoulders, which will likely be tight from poor posture.
Roll your shoulders. Roll one shoulder forwards, upwards, backwards, then back down. Imagine that you are sliding your shoulder blade down your spine. Then, repeat on the other side. This will help settle your shoulders farther back than they usually settle.
Stretch your chest. Find a rolled up towel or piece of fabric and stand with your legs shoulder width apart. Grip the fabric so that it is taut and your hands are also shoulder width apart. Inhale and lift your arms to shoulder height. Then, exhale and pull your arms up and back as far as you can. Hold for two inhales and exhales, then lower your arms and repeat."

Choose an appropriate bag.,
Choose supportive shoes.,
Learn how to sit at your desk.,
Adjust your sleeping habits.,
Practice proper lifting techniques.",How to Straighten Your Back3," Choose a purse, book bag, or backpack that will help evenly distribute weight throughout your back. Choose something that has broad, padded straps that can be positioned on both shoulders. , Consistently wearing high heels or flimsy slip ons will put extra strain on your back. Look for shoes with a supportive sole, square toes, and a less than one inch heel. Larger heels force more of your weight forward, which will encourage you to slouch or to overcorrect, which is equally bad for your back., Your feet should touch the floor, your back should be straight, and your neck should be in a neutral position. This will help alleviate back pain as well as straighten your back. You can also buy ergonomic chairs that will encourage you to sit up straight in order to be comfortable. , Consider sleeping on your side, with your hips flexed about 30˚. Bend your knees at about 30˚ as well. Finally, move your neck slightly forward on the pillow to help elongate your spine.


If you sleep on your back, consider putting a pillow under your knees and a rolled towel under your back. This will help relieve pressure on the back, alleviating back pain and encouraging back lengthening.
If you sleep on your side, consider putting a pillow in between your knees to help keep your hips aligned.
Avoid sleeping on your stomach. Sleeping face down puts unnecessary strain on the spine, and can lead to spinal degradation. It can also lead to chronic neck pain and lower back pain in the future., Lifting and carrying heavy objects incorrectly can lead to serious back pain. If you consistently do lots of heavy lifting, consider wearing a back support belt, which will help you maintain good posture while lifting. In addition, be sure to maintain proper form:


Bend at the knees, not the waist. Your leg and stomach muscles are designed to help you carry and lift things, but your back muscles are not. When you go to lift something, be sure to bend completely at the knees instead of bending over to avoid straining your lower back.
Keep the objects close to your chest. The closer the object is to your chest, the less work your back will have to do to hold it up. "

Visit your doctor.,
See an egoscue practitioner.,
Consult a chiropractor.,
Get regular massages.",How to Straighten Your Back4," If you have a severely curved back or spine and you find it difficult to stand up straight, consider talking to your doctor. You may have scoliosis or a number of other spinal-related issues.Your doctor may ask you to wear a back brace. Only in the most extreme cases will the doctor recommend spinal surgery. There are many other methods of improving back pain., Egoscue professionals specialize in posture therapy. He will focus on your symptoms (if any), your posture, your gait, and a range of other issues. He’ll teach you how to stretch your back — focusing on your problem areas. He’ll then create an exercise and stretching regiment that you can do at home.Most of these exercises will be geared towards increasing your range of motion in your hips and elongating your spine, releasing any tension compacted along your spinal column.If your problem is less severe, consider just working with a personal trainer. Tell your trainer that you want to focus on those muscles that lead to better posture (primarily your lateral muscles). They’ll show you sets of general exercises and stretches to improve your posture., He’ll take a series of x-ray images of your back and spine. Afterwards, he’ll be able to measure the exact curvature of your spine to indicate if you have a serious issue. Your chiropractor may also be able to examine your individual vertebrae for malformations, slips, or misalignments. Many of these issues can be treated in office, but if your chiropractor discovers a more serious issue, he’ll refer to you a specialist., Stress and constant tension can lead to tight back muscles, and therefore a hunched back. If you lead a stressful life, consider working regular massages into your daily life.Alternatively, sitting in a massage chair regularly will relieve stress, but it won’t be able to give you the specialized tension in those areas that require it most like a trained masseuse would be able to do.

Enter the car hips first.,
Tuck your bottom into the seat.,
Remove things from your back pockets.,
Avoid reaching across the car.",How to Sit in a Car Without Back Pain1," Try not to just jump in and out of your car. Bring your hips into the car first, sit on the seat, then rotate your knees to bring them in front of you. When you exit, rotate your knees out of the car, then step up and lift yourself out of the seat.If you have an SUV, truck, or other automobile with a high step, see if you can add an extra step or running board to make it easier to get in and out of your seat.# Sit up straight while driving your car. Sit in a neutral position with your chest out, shoulders back, and lumbar spine, or lower back, slightly curved toward the steering column. You should have enough headroom to hold your head up high and straight without bumping it when you pass over a pothole.Slumping in a non-neutral position puts strain on your back over extended periods of time.;
, Push your bottom as far back into the seat as possible. Rest your shoulders on the backrest so your body is tilted backward at an angle of about 110 degrees. Try to make sure the seat supports as much of your thighs as possible., Take your wallet, keys, and other items out of your back pocket before sitting in the car. A packed wallet and other pocket-fillers can throw your pelvis out of alignment, which could cause or aggravate back pain., While driving or riding in a car, try to stay in a neutral, ergonomic seated position. Do your best to avoid reaching for the passenger side or back seat to look for something or soothe a fussy youngster.Reaching or overextending while seated in a car can hurt your back. If possible, pull over when you need to find some paperwork or grab something for your little one in the back seat.

Push your hips as far back as they can go in the chair.,
Keep your shoulders back and your back straight.,
Adjust the seat height to fit your body.,
Adjust the back of the chair to a 100°-110° reclined angle.,
Make sure that your upper and lower back are supported.,
Adjust the armrests.,
Sit in an active sitting chair if one is available.,
Position your keyboard correctly.,
Adjust the monitor and source documents properly.,
Consider using an ergonomic mouse.,
Take periodic breaks.,
Stay as active as possible at work.",How to Sit," In office chairs, the best way to sit is to let the shaped back support your back and shoulders by scooting your hips back as far as they go, then adjusting the other components of the chair to offer support.If you're sitting in a straight, hard-backed chair, scoot your bottom up to the edge of the chair and sit without slouching into the back of that chair. Sit with your back and shoulders as straight as if they were supported by the chair back. Over time, this is a more comfortable position for your back, neck, and shoulders.
If you're sitting in a lounge chair or a couch, it's important to keep your feet flat on the floor and your back straight. Your shoulders should be back and you should be as far forward on the couch as possible.;
, Wherever and however you're sitting, it's important to keep your shoulders back to avoid slouching or hunching your back as you sit. Over time, this can strain your neck and shoulders, leading to chronic pain and headaches.


Don't lean your chair backward or slouch yourself forward while you're sitting, or you can strain your sciatic nerve and your shoulder muscles. This serves to keep you off-balance.
It is good to rock gently, if possible, if you're going to be sitting for a longer time. This helps to keep the body active and balanced.

, The seat of your chair should be high enough so that your feet are flat on the floor and your knees are even with your hips, or slightly lower. If you sit too low in the chair, you can end up straining your neck, while if you sit too high, your shoulders can get tired over time.

, Ideally, the back of a passive reclining chair shouldn't be perfectly straight, but angled backward gently beyond the 90 degree mark. This is much more comfortable a supportive for your back than a perfectly straight back., Good passive office chairs should offer some lumbar support, protruding slightly in the lower back to support your spin on both sides, keeping you comfortable and upright. If you don't have this kind of support, however, you have to make do yourself.


If necessary, use inflatable cushions or small pillows, just above your hips, between the back of the chair and your spine. This should be a lot more comfortable.
When your chair has an active back mechanism use it to make frequent position changes, gently adjusting it and rocking backward and forward as you sit and work, keeping your back from staying sedentary.

, Ideally, your armrests should be adjusted so that your shoulders are relaxed and your wrists are even with your keyboard, if you're typing. Read the next section for more specific suggestions about sitting at the computer.


Alternatively, you can remove the armrests completely if you find that they are in your way. Armrests aren't necessary for support.

, Increasingly, research reveals that sitting for long periods of time in an office setting comes with severe health concerns, including back and shoulder strain, as well as increased risk of heart disease.For this reason, active sitting methods are more popular than ever, and might be a good option for you.


Active sitting devices include things like standing desks, treadmill desks, kneeling chairs, and other ergonomic alternatives that force your body to hold itself upright, rather than providing it a resting place.
Passive sitting chairs, even ergonomic ones, can have a tendency to force your spine into uncomfortable upright positions.

, Adjust the keyboard height so that your shoulders are relaxed, your elbows are in a slightly open position, just out from your body, and your wrists and hands are straight.


Use the keyboard tray mechanism, or keyboard feet, to adjust the tilt so that the keyboard is comfortable. If you sit in a forward or upright position, try tilting your keyboard away from you, but if you are slightly reclined, then a slight forward tilt will help to maintain a straight wrist position.
Ergonomic keyboards are bent in the middle, to allow a more natural wrist alignment, letting your type with your thumbs pointing toward the ceiling, rather than lining your palms up with the floor. Consider investing in one if you struggle with wrist pain.

, Ideally, you want your neck in a neutral, relaxed position, so you don't have to crane around to see what you're working on. Center the monitor directly in front of you, above your keyboard.


Position the top of the monitor approximately 2-3” above your seated eye level.
If you wear bifocals, lower the monitor to a comfortable reading level., An ergonomic mouse allows your wrist to remain parallel to your body, it's natural resting state, rather than parallel with the floor, which can lead to carpal tunnel over many repetitions.


The track pad on most laptops and the traditional mouse do the same thing traditional keyboards do: force your wrists into an unnatural position. Over time, this can cause carpal tunnel issues and chronic pain.

, Every 30-60 minutes, you need to take a short break from sitting and move around the office. Even just taking a short break to walk to the bathroom, or get a refill of water can help to break up the monotony and relieve pain. While you might feel silly, close your office door and try the following short exercises to get the blood flowing:


Do 5-10 shoulder raises or shrugs
Do 20 calf raises
Do 5-10 lunges
Touch your toes 20 times

, If you work at an office, it's essential to get up and move around periodically to avoid stress pains and long-term damage to your arms, neck, shoulders, and back. Check out these articles for other tips and tricks about staying active at work:

Bring your seat forward so your elbow and knees are slightly bent.,
Set your seat as high as possible.,
Position the headrest so it’s in line with the top of your head.,
Set your mirrors while you’re in an ergonomic position.",How to Sit in a Car Without Back Pain2," You should be close enough to the steering column that you can steer with your elbows slightly bent and access the pedals with slightly bent knees. Grabbing the wheel with fully extended elbows can cause back and arm pain.The steering wheel should be 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) away from the driver’s chest.
If your seat has adjustable lumbar support set it to a comfortable position. Your lower back should be slightly curved toward the steering column while making complete contact with the seat.

, The seat should be set as high as possible so that your legs are relaxed and slightly bent. You should be able to see out of the car with ease and without obstruction.Make sure you still have enough headroom that you won’t bump your head.

, The top of the headrest should be level with the top of your head. While sitting the car, your head should lie comfortably against the headrest or be held within two to three inches of it.A headrest must be positioned high enough to protect from whiplash injuries in the event of an accident.

, The best time to adjust mirrors and other instruments is when you’ve put yourself in a comfortable, ergonomic driving position. Set your mirrors so that they’re positioned for a non-slumping vantage point.If, while driving, your mirrors seem like they need to be readjusted, you’ll know that you’re starting to slouch and need to sit up straight.

Roll a small blanket or towel to create a lumbar support.,
Get a seat cushion if your seat is too deep.,
Ask your doctor about supports and long-term solutions.",How to Sit in a Car Without Back Pain3," If your car doesn’t have a built-in adjustable lumbar support, you can make your own. Roll up a towel, blanket, or tee shirt and place it at the base of the seat’s back rest. This should support your lower back’s natural curves and help keep you from slouching., Sitting on a pillow or cushion might be your best option if your seat is on the highest adjustment but you still have trouble reaching the wheel or seeing your mirrors. If you’re tall and your knees bend above your hips when you sit in the car, a seat cushion could also help you maintain a more ergonomic position.Your knees and hips should be on approximately the same plane, with your slightly bent knees resting at a height just higher than your hips. You should make an adjustment if, when you sit in the car, your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle and their tops are at a much greater height than your hips.

, If you haven’t had much luck with rolling towels or sitting on pillows, you might want to invest in a support or cushion specially designed to prevent and relieve back pain due to driving.Ask your doctor to recommend a product that will address your specific back issues.

If you consistently experience back pain, ask if they can refer you to a spinal specialist or help you come up with a long-term management plan.

Take it easy and rest your strained muscle.,
Apply something cold if the muscle injury is acute.,
Apply moist heat if the injury is chronic.,
Take anti-inflammatory medicine.,
Try some light stretching.,
Go for a deep massage.,
Get therapeutic ultrasound treatments.,
Consider muscle stimulation treatments.,
Consider infrared therapy.",How to Recover from a Strained or Pulled Muscle," Most muscle pulls occur from either lifting too much weight, doing something too often (repetition), moving awkwardly or experiencing trauma (car accident, sports injury).The first step with any muscle strain (and most musculoskeletal injuries in general) is to rest it. This may require taking a few days off work or away from the team, but muscles recover quicker if they are given the appropriate time to rest. If your muscle pull takes longer than a few weeks to recover, then either a significant proportion of the muscle fibers are torn or there's involvement of a related joint and ligaments.


Dull, achy pain is usually indicative of a muscle strain, whereas sharp and/or shooting pain with movement is often caused by joint / ligament sprains.
A moderate-to severe muscle strain will usually cause a bruise to form pretty quickly, which indicates some blood vessels that feed the muscle are damaged and leaking.;
, If your muscle strain is acute (within a few days old), then inflammation is likely an issue and should be addressed.When the muscle fibers tear, the immune system sends lots of fluid containing white blood cells. White blood cells clean up the debris from the damaged cells and connective tissue and lay the framework for a healing response; however, too much inflammation creates pressure, which causes more pain. As such, using cold therapy (ice or a frozen gel pack wrapped in a thin towel) should be applied to muscle strains as soon as possible because it constricts local blood vessels and reduces the inflammation response.Cold therapy should be applied for 10-20 minutes every hour (the larger or deeper the affected muscle, the longer the time), then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.
Compressing the ice against the muscle pull with the help of an elasticized bandage will help to further impede the swelling, as will elevating the affected area.

, If your muscle strain has lingered on and become chronic (longer than a month old), then inflammation control is not such a pressing issue. Instead, the muscle is likely weakened, too tight and lacking in normal blood flow, which translates into inadequate nutrients (oxygen, glucose, minerals). The application of moist heat can decrease muscle tension and spasm, increase blood flow and promote healing in chronically strained muscle tissue.Use a microwavable heat pack and apply it to your sore muscle(s) for 15 – 20 minutes at a time, three to five times per day, until the tension and stiffness fade away. Herbal bags usually contain bulgur wheat or rice, as well as soothing herbs and/or essential oils such as lavender.
Alternatively, soak your chronically strained muscle in a warm Epsom salt bath for 20 – 30 minutes because it can significantly reduce pain and swelling in muscles.The magnesium in the salt is thought to help the muscle fibers relax and the warm water promotes circulation.
Don't use dry heat, such as heating pads, on your chronically strained muscles because you risk dehydrating the tissue and making the issue worse.

, As mentioned, inflammation is a major contributor to the symptoms associated with acute musculoskeletal injuries such as strains, so taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pills during the initial stages of the injury is also a good strategy.Common anti-inflammatories include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) and aspirin, but they tend to be hard on the stomach, so limit your use to less than two weeks. Anti-inflammatories are for symptomatic relief only and don't stimulate healing, but they can certainly allow you to resume work or other activities (when it's appropriate) in more comfort.


Ibuprofen is not appropriate for young children, so always consult your doctor before taking any medications or giving them to your kids.
For more chronic muscle issues, consider taking a muscle relaxant (such as cyclobenzaprine) to reduce muscle tightness and/or spasms.

, Muscle stretching is mainly thought of as an injury prevention strategy, but it can be used during injuries also (albeit with caution and common sense).Once the initial pain of the acute injury settles down after a few days, consider doing some light stretching just to keep the muscle pliable and prevent spasm. Start with two to three times daily and hold the stretches for 15 – 20 seconds while taking deep breaths. Chronic muscle strains are likely even more in need of stretching, so increase to three to five times daily and hold for about 30 seconds until the discomfort fades away.


If you stretch properly, you should not have more muscle soreness the following day. If you do, then it may be an indication you've overstretched and need to go easier by reducing the intensity of the stretches.
A common cause of ""overstretching"" is doing stretches while the muscles are cold. As such, make sure to get your blood flowing or apply moist heat to any muscle before you attempt to stretch it.

, If your home remedies don't seem to be impacting your recovery as well as you hoped, or if you just want to augment what you're doing, then consider seeing a professional massage therapist for a deep tissue rub down. A deep massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute session and allow the masseuse to go as deep as you can tolerate it without wincing. Your therapist may also do trigger point therapy that focuses in on the injured muscle fibers.


Always keep well hydrated after a massage in order to flush inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. If you don't, you may experience a mild headache or nausea.
If your budget doesn't allow for professional massage therapy, then consider using a tennis ball or foam roller as a substitute. Depending on where the strain is, use your body weight to roll over the tennis ball or foam roller until you feel the tension and pain start to dissipate.

, Therapeutic ultrasound machines produce high frequency sounds waves (not audible to people) by vibrating crystal material, which then has a therapeutic impact on soft tissue and bone. Although it's been used for over 50 years by physicians, physiotherapists and chiropractors for a variety of musculoskeletal injuries, the exact ways it impacts tissue is still not entirely understood. It produces a thermal effect (heat) on certain settings, which is of benefit to chronic muscle strains, but it also seems to reduce inflammation and promote healing on entirely different (pulsed) settings, which can help with acute injury.Ultrasound frequency can be altered so that it penetrates the body either superficially (on the surface) or much deeper, which is great for shoulder and low back strains.


Ultrasound treatment is painless and lasts from three to 10 minutes depending on the location and if the injury is acute or chronic. Treatments may be repeated one to two times daily for acute injuries, or less frequently in chronic cases.
Although a single ultrasound treatment can sometimes provide substantial relief to a strained muscle, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.

, Another type of treatment that can be effective for both acute and chronic muscle strains is electronic muscle stimulation.Electronic muscle stimulation involves the placement of electrodes over injured muscle tissue in order to transmit electrical currents and cause contraction. For acute strains, muscle stimulation devices (depending on the settings) can help pump out inflammation, reduce pain and desensitize nerve fibers. For chronic strains, electronic muscle stimulation also has the ability to strengthen muscle and ""re-educate"" the fibers (allow them to more efficiently contract in unison).


Health professionals most likely to use electronic muscle stimulation include physiotherapists, chiropractors and sports physicians.
Electronic muscle stimulation devices can be readily purchased from medical supply and rehabilitation stores, as well as online. They are much more affordable than ultrasound devices, but they should only be used under the supervision or advice of a healthcare professional.

, Also in the realm of frequency therapy is infrared radiation. The use of low-energy light waves (infrared) is able to speed up wound healing, reduce pain and decrease inflammation, particularity in chronic injuries.Use of infrared therapy (via a hand-held device or within an infrared-emitting sauna) is thought to penetrate deep into the body and improve circulation because it creates heat and dilates blood vessels. Treatment times vary from 10 – 45 minutes depending on the injury and whether it's acute or chronic.


In some cases, significant pain reduction occurs within hours after the first infrared treatment, but your results may vary.
Pain reduction is typically long lasting — weeks or sometimes even months.
Healthcare professionals most likely to use infrared therapy include chiropractors, osteopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists.

Ask questions.,
Discuss alternatives.,
Know the members of your team.,
Do further research.",How to Prepare for Back Surgery1," There are many different types of back surgeries. If your doctor suggests that you need an operation, take care to find out precisely what he recommends. You can also ask for a referral to a surgeon who specializes in that type of back surgery.One of the most common types of back surgery is spinal fusion. During this surgery, weak spines are supported, usually by steel rods.
Your doctor might recommend a discectomy. Part of a disc is removed to take pressure off of other parts of the back.
A corpectomy is also common. This is when part of a vertebrae is removed.;
, If your doctor recommends back surgery, you might have concerns. Before scheduling the surgery, make sure to have several thorough discussions with your doctor. You will want to talk to both your regular doctor and the potential surgeon.Make sure you understand the terms. When your doctor talks about your back and potential surgeries, you might not understand all of the medical jargon.
Ask your doctor for clear explanations. You can say, ""I'm not sure what you mean by 'lumbar disc herniation'. Can you explain that to me in different terms?""
Take notes. Write down what your doctor says. This will help you remember the important details after you've left the office.

, Back surgeries can be extremely effective in treating a lot of ailments. But it is normal to feel scared or reluctant. Ask your doctor if there are other options.When your doctor brings up surgery, ask if there are alternatives. You can say, ""I understand that surgery can help. But are there other things we can try first?""
Depending on the severity of your problem, there might be other regimens that could work. For example, you could ask about physical therapy.
Take a friend or family member to your appointment with you. It can be helpful to have someone else listening and asking questions.

, There will be several professionals involved in your spinal surgery. When you are planning for the surgery, it might be useful to meet as many of these people as possible. Ask your surgeon who will be responsible for your care.Get to know your surgeon. You want to make sure that you feel comfortable with this person.
There will be several other people caring for you while you are in the hospital. For example, there will be an anesthesiologist, several nurses, and a case manager.
While you are in the hospital, you will most likely begin the recovery process. Find out in advance if you will be working with a physical therapist or occupational therapist while you are in the hospital. Also, ask your surgeon if you will need to go to a rehab facility after you leave the hospital.

, One of the best ways to prepare for surgery is is to rely on the knowledge of your medical team. However, you might find that you are interested in learning more about your condition and solutions. You can also do some outside research.Ask your doctor for reading materials. He can likely give you some pamphlets or direct you towards useful websites.
Find an online forum. There are many online communities that can be useful to you. Look for one where people discuss back surgery and the recovery process.

Plan your pain control regimen.,
Take care of your body.,
Make your house recovery friendly.,
Adhere to pre-op guidelines.,
Prepare a ""day of surgery"" checklist.",How to Prepare for Back Surgery2," Once you have decided to have back surgery, it's time to get ready. There are several things you can do to prepare your body and your physical environment. First, you will want to figure out a pain management plan.Talk to your doctor about what kind of pain you can expect. Try to assess the severity and how long it will last.
Be proactive in planning your pain control. Tell your doctor that you would like to figure out a regimen before surgery, not after.
Many people report that better pain control management helped them have a faster recovery. You can discuss this issue with both your primary care physician and your doctor.

, There are several things you can do to help increase your chances of a smooth surgery and effective recovery. Remember that your overall physical health impacts the health of your back. Take steps to improve your general health.Eat a healthy diet. This will help your immune system, which can in turn help wounds heal faster.
Pay attention to your nutrition. Eat a balanced diet of fruits and veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins.
If possible, get some physical exercise before your surgery. It can be helpful to strengthen your muscles. Talk to your doctor about any limitations you might have.
If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your risk of complications during any type of surgical procedure., Recovering from back surgery can be a lengthy process. Be proactive and get your house in order before the surgery. You can do several helpful things ahead of time.Your range of motion may be quite limited. Move the things you need most often, such as clothes, food, and medications, to waist level.
Move any potential hazards. Temporarily move things like rugs, cords, or pet toys, so that you won't trip over them.
Get a non-skid bath mat. You may also need to get a raised toilet seat.

, Your doctor will issue several instructions for you to follow. It is important that you follow all of the directions carefully. If you have questions about any of them, make sure to clarify.For example, your doctor might instruct you to stop taking some of your current medications. You will need to do this in the week leading up to your surgery. Bring a list of your medications to your doctor, and ask which one you should continue to take, and which ones you should stop taking. Make sure that you find out how soon before surgery your should stop taking certain medications and when you can resume them.
The night before surgery, you might be instructed to take a ""pre-op"" shower. Your doctor's office will provide you with instructions on what products to use.
You will likely need to fast. Do not eat or drink after midnight. Remember, your doctor might give you different instructions, depending on your particular situation.

, Write down a list of things you will need to do on the day of your surgery. This can help calm any nerves you have. It will also ensure that you don't forget something important.Make sure you take a bag with you to the hospital. It should include items such as comfortable clothing, glasses, dentures, cell phone, cell phone charger, and reading materials. Do not bring any jewelry.
Also, remember to bring your driver's license for identification and your insurance card.Take any necessary medications with a small sip of water. You can brush your teeth but don't swallow the water or toothpaste.
Leave instructions for anyone who is caring for your pets or children. Thorough instructions will give you peace of mind during your hospital stay.

Fight the negative thoughts.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Plan your recovery process.,
Find a support system.",How to Prepare for Back Surgery3," In addition to getting your body and home ready, you can also prepare mentally and emotionally for back surgery. Try to put yourself in a positive frame of mind. The power of positive thinking can actually help.It is common to have a wide range of emotions before back surgery. You might experience a lot of different types of negative thoughts.
For example, it is normal to ""catastrophize"", which means imagining the worst case scenario. To fight these thoughts, try to do the opposite. You can think, ""This surgery is going to change my life for the better.""
It is also common to overgeneralize. You might find yourself thinking, ""This surgery means I'll never play tennis again."" Instead, try to think, ""Maybe my game will improve once my pain is gone.""

, In the days before your surgery, you might be nervous. It is normal to feel anxiety. Surgery is a major event. You can practice relaxation techniques to help calm your fears.Try breathing exercises. Breathe in through your nose for four counts and exhale through your mouth for four counts.
Repeat this pattern until you feel more calm. Focusing on your breathing can distract you from your fears.
Breathing exercises and other relaxation techniques can also help you to manage your pain. For some people, they can also lower your heart rate and blood pressure.

, You will likely have a lot on your mind as you prepare for back surgery. If you can anticipate your needs during your recovery process, you will feel more calm and prepared. Make a list of all the things you will need.Take time off from work. Talk to your boss about the time you will need to be completely off, and when you might be able to work from home.
Anticipate the financial costs. If you are going to miss out on income, make a modified budget for your recovery period.
Find out what equipment you will need. For example, you may need things like a brace or possibly a walker.

, Recovering from back surgery can be difficult. It can become even more complicated if you don't have help. Before your surgery, make sure that you have a support system in place.Ask a family member or friend to help you out. If you live alone, ask someone to stay with you for a few days.
Explain your needs. You can say, ""Will you be able to go to the pharmacy and grocery store for me? I won't be able to drive for a while.""
Choose someone you trust. You will need reliable emotional support in addition to help doing everyday tasks.

Find your knots.,
Massage the knot by applying pressure along the knot.,
Enlist the help of a tennis ball.,
Get a foam roller.,
Extend your reach.",How to Get Rid of Knots in Your Back1," Most knots occur in your upper back and shoulder area.They tend to feel tighter and denser than the surrounding muscles, much like a knot in a rope (hence the name).Although knots can feel tight and denser, there are times that the most painful knots don't feel tight at all. Focus more on the fact that pressing into a knot produces pain, rather than looking for a ""tight"" muscle.


If you press on a knot, it may cause pain to radiate outward. This suggests that it is a trigger point. “Tender spots” do not usually cause pain in other areas of your body.;
, Gently rub the knot in a circular motion using your fingertips. Apply light pressure, but not so much that it hurts. This may help release tense muscle fibers.You may also find that simply pressing on the knot helps relieve the pain. Apply firm pressure to the knot and hold it for about a minute.If it is difficult or impossible for you to massage the knot yourself, ask a friend to help you.

, You can do this either leaning against the wall or lying down. Either way, put the tennis ball between you and the hard surface. Line it up on top of the point where you feel the most pressure. You may feel discomfort at first, but it should subside as you continue to apply pressure.Pin the tennis ball between the knot and the hard surface until the pain ceases. Take breaks as necessary. At the beginning, you may find that you can only hold it there for a few seconds. As you continue this exercise, that time will increase.
You can use other types of balls, but firmer balls such as racquetballs may apply too much pressure, at least at first.

, Foam rollers operate on the same principle as the tennis ball across a wider area. They can help release tense and tight muscles. They’re usually a couple of feet long and look like thick pool noodles.Go slowly at first. Spending too much time on a sore spot can actually cause increased damage to your muscles, especially if you’re unfamiliar with foam rolling techniques. Spend 15–30 seconds on a knot before moving on.Place the foam roller on the ground horizontally. Lie on it perpendicular to the roller. Find your sore areas and roll yourself slowly across them. Don’t use a foam roller for more than three minutes at a time.Do not use a foam roller on your lower back, as you could cause nerve damage.Above all, never use a foam roller while lying flat on your back. This can hyperextend the low back and cause joint damage and pain.

, Using an umbrella with a curved handle or a specially designed massage implement such as the “Body Back Buddy” can help you massage harder-to-reach areas.


If you have a knot on top of your shoulder, simply place the end of the handle on top of the knot. Then press down, holding it down. Just as with the tennis ball, hold it there until the knot seems to dissipate.
To target these trigger points hands-free and to avoid tension in the arms, you can use hands-free products such as the ""Muscle Wizard.""

, These exercises, also known as shrugs, can help release tension in your neck and shoulder area, a common place for knots in your back to form.Sit upright in a chair, preferably one with a straight back. You can also sit on the floor or stand, but make sure to maintain good posture.
Bring your shoulders up to your ears. Roll them forward and then down in a clockwise motion.
Repeat this exercise in the opposite direction: up, backward, down (counter-clockwise).
Do two to four reps several times a day.

, This stretch will help blood flow into your shoulder blade area, which is a common site for knots.Begin by placing your hands palms-down on your shoulders. The right hand goes on the right shoulder and the left hand on the left shoulder.
Bring your elbows together, keeping your hands on your shoulder. You should feel a good stretch in your shoulder and upper back area.

Sit on the floor with your legs tucked into your chest.
Hold on to your legs and roll back and forth to stretch the lower back.

, This stretch will help release tension in your lower back. If it causes additional back pain, do not do this exercise.Lie on your back on the floor. You can use a yoga mat for cushioning.

, Pilates movements can help you stretch out the tense muscles in your back that are causing knots. One particular combination of movements goes from Prayer to Cat to Camel, and is very good at releasing tense muscles.Begin on all fours. Inhale, and lean back on your heels as you exhale. Extend your arms in front of you and lower your head to the ground. This is Prayer pose. You should feel a stretch in your lower back.
Move from Prayer back to all fours, inhaling as you go. Arch your back upward toward the ceiling. Tuck your head and abdominal muscles in. This is Cat pose. You should feel a stretch across your back muscles.
Exhale and arch your back toward the floor, lifting your hips and chin toward the ceiling. This is Camel Pose. You should feel a stretch in your upper back.

Apply cold to the area.,
Apply heat to the area to loosen the muscles.,
Monitor your posture.,
Take up yoga.,
Get aerobic exercise.,
Try an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever.,
Talk to your doctor about chronic back pain.,
Seek emergency medical attention when necessary.",How to Get Rid of Knots in Your Back3," If the knot is a result of an injury, cold should be applied first. Wrap the cold pack in a towel or cloth and apply it to the knot for 15–20 minutes at least three times a day. Do this for the first two or three days after the injury.You can make a cold pack with 3 cups water and 1 cup of rubbing alcohol. Mix and pour into a resealable bag. Make sure to squeeze all the air out before you freeze it.
You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables. Choose ones that are small and uniform in size, such as peas or corn. Note that once you've used these veggies as a cold pack, you won't want to eat them (it's not a good idea to allow frozen food to defrost and then re-freeze it).

, For frequent or chronic pain, heat works better than ice.Use a heating pad, a hot bath or a shower to do this.


Apply heat for no more than 15–20 minutes at a time, up to three times a day.
If moist heat is preferred, you can warm a damp towel for thirty seconds in the microwave. Do not heat the towel too much, or you could burn yourself. Be careful of steam in particular, as steam can cause severe burns.

, Poor posture, especially while sitting for long periods of time, can cause back pain and knots.Try to be conscious of slouching — that's putting constant pressure on the same muscles.


If you work at a desk, take time to get up and walk around (and stretch) every hour or so.
Keep your head from slumping forward when you stand or sit. Slumping can put strain on your shoulders and back and contribute to knots.If you lift weights, monitor your form. Putting weights down too quickly causes the muscles to forcibly contract, jarring them.

, When it comes to exercises that can strengthen your back, yoga is certainly up there. It can relieve back soreness in addition to strengthening your muscles and increasing your flexibility. Here are a few positions to try:The downward-facing dog will help your lower back. It targets your back extensors — those muscles that help you stand and lift objects. Start on all fours. Make sure your knees are directly below your hips and your hands are just slightly in front of your shoulders. As you exhale, press your knees up toward the ceiling, stretching out your legs. Stretch your heels toward the floor. Straighten your legs, but do not lock your knees. Your body will form a sort of arch.The child's pose will elongate your back muscles. Begin on all fours. Sit back until your buttocks touch your heels. Stretch your arms forward and lower your head to the ground.The pigeon pose stretches your hip rotators and flexors. Sometimes we forget that our whole body is connected — poor hip alignment can totally ruin an otherwise healthy back. Lie on your back with your knees bent. Cross your left ankle onto your right thigh. Place your hands around the back of your right thigh and pull your right knee toward your chest. Keep your upper body relaxed as you hold this position. Repeat on the other side.The triangle pose will strengthen your back and legs and stretch the sides of your torso and hip muscles. Stand on a yoga mat with your feet about 4 feet apart. Turn your right foot outward so it is parallel with the long edge of the mat. Align your heels so they form a straight line. Bring your arms out to your sides so that your body forms a “t” shape. Fold down and bend to the right, stretching your right arm down to your right foot. Hold the pose as long as is comfortable. Repeat on the other side., Getting regular, moderate aerobic exercise will help keep knots at bay. Try an exercise, such as swimming, elliptical machines, or even jumping jacks, that engages your arms as well as your legs.Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a day.

, Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the best to start with, as it tends to cause fewer side effects than other pain relievers. If this does not work, try an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin.Never exceed the recommended dosage on the packaging. NSAIDs and acetaminophen can both cause serious side effects when used improperly.
If your back pain continues for more than a week when you use OTC pain relievers, see your doctor. It is not safe to use most OTC pain relievers long-term. Your doctor may need to prescribe a stronger medication.

, If your back pain lasts more than a few weeks, or if back pain has been a staple of everyday life since you can remember, talk to your doctor. You may require stronger treatment or medication.


Physical therapy will most likely be recommended first. Physical therapists can recommend exercises and techniques to relieve pain and promote better back health. Some are also trained in techniques such as dry needling, which can relieve back pain by stimulating trigger points.Your doctor may prescribe muscle relaxants if your back pain continues or does not improve. These can be addictive, so use them only as prescribed by your doctor.Injections are used as last resorts and only when pain is radiating through different parts of your body. Your doctor may inject cortisone into your epidural space (around your spinal cord). The relief from this injection usually only lasts a few months.
If your back pain is not due to knots but in fact connected to a more serious condition, your doctor may consider surgery.

, Sometimes, back pain is the sign of another medical condition that requires emergency care. Call 911 or get to your emergency room if you experience any of the following:Back pain accompanied by other symptoms, such as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or sweating. These may be signs of a heart attack.Back pain after a trauma, such as a car crash, fall, or athletic injury
Back pain accompanied by difficulties with your bowels or bladder
Back pain accompanied by fever and/or night sweats

In addition, your hips should be in direct alignment with your shoulders, meaning you need to stand up straighter if they're not. Adjusting your posture can help reduce neck pain over time.Also, make sure you draw your arms in close to your body when you're sitting at the computer or a table.
It also helps to move your limbs so they are parallel to the floor when you're sitting. That is, your arms and wrists, as well as your thighs, should be parallel to the floor, not angled up or down.;
, To improve your sitting posture, you can adjust your chair and the way you sit. Adjusting your sitting posture can help reduce the likelihood of developing neck pain.For instance, make sure your chair is at the right height. As noted, your thighs should be parallel to the floor. You may need to move your office chair up or down to be in the right position.
In addition, you should have a couple of inches of space between the back of the knees and your chair. If you don't have that, adjust the back of the chair if possible or even add a pillow to shift yourself forward.
Move the arms to support your arms. Your arms should rest comfortably on the arms of the chair. You should not be bending over or feel like your arms are hanging down, or you may tense up your shoulders as a result and end up with neck pain.
Try to pick a chair with a bit of back support. It should be slightly curved but not overly curved. Check to make sure it's comfortable.

, Whether you're on the computer or just reading or watching a movie, tensing up your shoulders can cause neck pain. When you feel yourself tensing, consciously relax your shoulders., That is, don't do things like hold the phone in the crook of your shoulder. Also, don't try to hold things under your chin. These movements can put strain on your neck.In addition, putting strain on your shoulders can also cause you neck pain. For instance, carrying a very heavy bag slung over your shoulder can cause neck pain.

, It can be easy to strain your neck while on your computer. However, it's also easy to make adjustments and improve your posture. No matter what kind of computer you're using, it should be at a good viewing angle. In other words, you should adjust it so you don't need to bend your neck out of alignment to see the screen. The screen should be at eye level without you having to bend your neck up or down.One way to raise your computer monitor is to put large books underneath it. You can also by small shelves for your desk to raise the height.
When sitting on the couch, consider using a pillow or lap desk to raise your laptop up.

, Just like when you're using a computer, you need to raise any reading material up when you're reading it. It should be at eye level. You don't want to bend your neck down to read it, as that can cause strain over time., Like most people, you're probably attached to your smartphone most of the time. One problem that can come with this habit is neck pain, as you are hunched over looking at your phone. You can take a few steps to remedy the problem, though.Like your books and computers, make sure to hold it at a good viewing angle. It should be at eye level. You can even download an app to make sure you get it at the right angle. One to try is the Text Neck Indicator.
It can help to use a docking station to hold the phone at the right viewing angle.
Take breaks every 20 minutes to give yourself a chance to stretch.

, Your sleeping posture can affect your neck just as much as your daytime posture. Therefore, you need to make sure you're sleeping in the best position to relieve your neck pain.Start by picking a good pillow. You want one that molds to the shape of your neck and head and that it doesn't push your head up too much, pushing your neck out of alignment. Memory foam pillows work well for this purpose. Feather pillows are also a good option, but if you get one, remember to replace it once a year.
When on your side, you should use a pillow that pushes your neck higher than your head to keep your neck in alignment. However, make sure it's not too high, as that can push your spine out of alignment, too. A pillow that is too stiff can cause issues, too.
Skip sleeping on your stomach, as it's hard on your back and neck. It's better to sleep on your side or back if possible.
Try to get enough sleep. Most adults require about seven to eight hours of sleep. Not getting enough sleep can lead to more back and neck problems.

, You can use this exercise anywhere to stretch out your neck, whether your standing or sitting. Simply turn your head to the left side, until your chin is over or nearly over your left shoulder. Hold it for about 20 seconds, then move to the right side and hold it for the same amount of time.Do about four sets of this exercise.
To stretch your neck deeper, you can use your hand to gently push your head over.

, You can also do head tilts standing or sitting. Simply bend your head to the right towards your shoulder. Hold it for 20 seconds, then bend it towards the left shoulder and hold. Do about four sets of this exercise., Stand up for this exercise. Roll your shoulders back and then up and over in a forward circle. Keep rolling them forward for about 30 seconds. Move in circles the other direction, too., Start by sitting with your spine tall and straight. Begin by rolling your neck to your right. Roll it back towards the middle then over to the left. Finally, roll it back until you're looking at the ceiling.Make sure not to jerk with this exercise. Instead, do it in one fluid motion.
Do it three times on each side.

, For this exercise, you need to be laying down flat on your back. With your shoulders flat on the floor, lift up your head. Lower it back down to the floor. Repeat three to four times, then do the same on each side, lifting your head up to the side., You, of course, know that smoking is detrimental to your health, from causing lung cancer to heart disease. You may not know that smoking can also lead to neck pain. If you have chronic neck pain, consider putting the cigarettes down.One way to help yourself quit is to tell your friends and family that you want to quit. They can help stop you when you start to light up without thinking. Telling them can also help them be more understanding with you while you're trying to quit.
Try a medication. Nicotine patches or gum help many people to quit smoking., Bifocals and trifocals can be very convenient. However, they can also put strain on your neck if you're leaning your head back to use them. A better option is switching to reading glasses when you need them so that you have your full range of vision.In addition, make sure to visit your eye doctor at least once a year to check up on your prescription. Otherwise, you may find yourself leaning over to read because your prescription is not current., If you are constantly holding your neck in a certain position, it can be strain on your neck. Therefore, it's important to take breaks to move around and stretch your neck, shoulders, and back. Try to take a break at least once an hour."

Talk to your doctor about more invasive options.",How to Get Rid of Shoulder Ache," In most cases, the cause of an achy shoulder is overuse or overexertion — in other words, repetitive shoulder motions or lifting things that are too heavy. If this sounds like the cause of your shoulder problem, then stop the irritating activity for a few days or so. If your shoulder injury is work related, then ask your boss if you can temporarily switch activities (to something less repetitive or demanding) or change work stations. If your shoulder injury is related to working out, then you may be lifting weights that are too heavy or training with bad form — talk to a personal trainer for advice.


Resting your shoulder is a good idea, but completely immobilizing it in a sling is not recommended for minor shoulder injuries — it can promote the development of ""frozen"" shoulder. At least some gentle shoulder movement is needed to encourage blood flow and stimulate healing.Achy pain is usually indicative of a muscle pull, whereas sharp pain with movement is often caused by joint / ligament injuries.
Bursitis and tendon pain in the shoulder is usually worse at night while in bed.;
, If your achy shoulder looks or feels swollen, then apply an icepack (or something cold) to the most tender area in order to reduce the inflammation and numb the pain.Ice therapy is best for acute injuries that involve inflammation. Apply the icepack for about 15 minutes every couple of hours until the symptoms in your shoulder subside or go away.


Compressing the icepack against your shoulder with a Tensor or Ace bandage is even more effective at reducing inflammation.
Always wrap ice in a thin towel before you apply it to any injury — it prevents skin irritation and frostbite.
If you don't have ice cubes, then consider using a frozen gel pack or bag of veggies from the freezer.

, If your achy shoulder is chronic (long term) and feels particularly stiff first thing in the morning or prior to exercise, then apply moist heat to it instead of ice. Moist heat warms up the soft tissues (muscles, tendons and ligaments) and increases blood flow to the area, which can be helpful for achiness caused by osteoarthritis (the wear and tear type) or old sports injuries.Good sources of moist heat are microwavable bags filled with grains (usually wheat or rice), herbs and/or essential oils. Apply the heat for 15-20 minutes first thing in the morning or before exercise.


Taking a warm bath also provides moist heat. Add some Epsom salt for even more muscle relaxing and soothing potential.
Avoid dry heat from traditional heating pads because it can dehydrate soft tissues and increase the risk of injury.

, If your shoulder ache is too much to bear and isn't impacted significantly by the application of either cold therapy or moist heat, then consider taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatories or painkillers. Anti-inflammatories are most appropriate for significant shoulder swelling (such bursitis and tendonitis) and include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). Painkillers (analgesics) are most appropriate for nondescript pain not caused by inflammation and include acetaminophen (Tylenol and Paracetamol). Remember that these medications are short-term solutions for shoulder pain and not meant for daily use beyond a few weeks due to their negative impact on the liver, kidneys and stomach.Alternatively, you can try muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your shoulder ache, but never take them together with other medications.
Ibuprofen is not appropriate for very young children, whereas acetaminophen is not recommended for those under the age of 18 due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

, Your shoulder ache may be caused by stiff and tight muscles, possibly due to poor posture or lack of use. As long as you don't feel sharp, electric or stabbing pain with shoulder movements, then light shoulder stretches are likely of benefit. Sore and tight muscles respond well to stretching because it reduces muscle tension, promotes blood flow and improves flexibility.Shoulder flexibility is important because it has the most range of motion of any joint in the body for a reason. Hold shoulder stretches for about 30 seconds while deeply breathing and do them 3-5x daily until the achiness diminishes.


While you're standing or sitting up, reach around the front of your torso and grab underneath the opposite elbow. Pull on the back of your flexed elbow across your torso until you feel a nice stretch in the corresponding shoulder.
Also while standing straight or sitting up, reach behind your back and up towards your shoulder blade and interlock with your other hand. Slowly pull down on the hand attached to the achy shoulder until you feel a stretch.

, Your achy shoulder might be caused by a poorly designed work station. If your computer, desk and/or chair isn't positioned properly for your height and body type, it can put strain on your shoulders, neck and mid-back. As such, when sitting at your desk and looking straight ahead: your eyes should be looking at the top 1/3 of the monitor; your forearms should be roughly parallel with the floor when typing and supported by arm rests; your elbows should be within a few inches from your sides; and your feet should be positioned flat on the floor.If you work standing up, make sure your body isn't constantly rotated or twisted — maintaining symmetry and balance is the key.
To prevent shoulder injury, minimize overhead work by using a taller ladder or getting closer to your task.

, If your shoulder ache is lingering longer than you'd anticipated, then consider a deep tissue massage from a qualified massage therapist. Deep tissue massage targets chronic muscle tightness and tension, which limits movement, reduces flexibility, hampers blood circulation and promotes inflammation.Massage is most helpful for mild-to-moderate muscle strains, but it's not recommended for more serious joint injuries.


Start with a 30 minute session focusing on your afflicted shoulder, but also including your lower neck and mid-back between your shoulder blades.
Allow the massage therapist to go as deep as you can take it without wincing — there are many muscle layers in your shoulder that the therapist needs to access.

, If your achy shoulder is caused by overexertion or overuse, then consider making your shoulders stronger and more able to take the abuse with strength-building exercises. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored strengthening exercises for your shoulders (utilizing machines, free weights, rubber bands and/or exercise balls) that will allow them to handle your work environment or better perform while exercising or playing sports.Furthermore, physical therapists are also trained to treat your achy muscles with therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation, if need be.


Physical therapy is typically needed 2-3x per week for 4-6 weeks to positively impact shoulder problems.
If your achy shoulder is caused by a joint sprain, then your physical therapist can help relieve the pain by taping the area with medical-grade tape.
Good strengthening activities for your shoulder include rowing, swimming, bowling and archery.

, If your achy pain is in someway joint related, a shoulder joint or spinal joint, then see an osteopath or chiropractor for a physical examination. Osteopaths and chiropractors are basically joint specialists who focus on establishing normal range of motion and function within the spine and peripheral joints, such as those that make up the shoulder. Shoulder pain can obviously be caused by the underlying joints (glenohumeral and/or acromioclavicular), but the perceived pain can also be referred from dysfunction or injury in the lower cervical spine (neck) or thoracic spine (mid-back). If need be, the involved joints can be unstuck or slightly repositioned by a manual adjustment, which usually creates a ""popping"" or ""cracking"" sound.


Although a single joint adjustment can sometimes significantly impact a musculoskeletal problem, more than likely it will take a few treatments to settle the area down.
Osteopaths and chiropractors can also use manual joint maneuvers to set a dislocated shoulder.

, Acupuncture is a form of treatment developed many centuries ago, primarily in ancient China, designed mainly to reduce pain and stimulate healing.It involves sticking thin needles into the skin at specific points (sometimes close to the injured area, but often in distant areas of the body) for between 20-60 minutes at a time, which causes pain-reducing compounds to be released in the body. Acupuncture is not very well established by scientific studies to be able to help relieve most causes of shoulder pain, but there are many anecdotal reports that claim it can be very effective.Given it's excellent safety record, it may be worth a try if you can afford the out-of-pocket expense.


Acupuncture is practiced by a wide variety of medical people including some physicians, chiropractors and physiotherapists — whoever you decide on should be NCCAOM certified.
One acupuncture treatment may not make a significant impact on your shoulder pain, so consider at least 3 treatments before your render judgement on its effectiveness.

, If your achy shoulder does not respond to home remedies or other more conservative therapies, then talk to your family physician about more invasive treatments, such as corticosteroid injections and/or surgical options. A corticosteroid injection (such as prednisolone) into a swollen shoulder can quickly reduce the inflammation and pain, allowing for greater range of motion and function.Injections are most appropriate for severe tendonitis and bursitis. Surgery, on the other hand, is reserved for mending severed tendons, fractures, severe arthritis, blood clots, or draining accumulated fluid. Your doctor may need to refer you to a specialist for treatment, who may take an x-ray, bone scan, MRI or nerve conductance study to better understand your shoulder problem.


Possible complications of steroid injections include tendon / muscle atrophy and weakening, nerve damage and reduced immune function.
Possible complications from shoulder surgery include local infection, excessive bleeding, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage, paralysis, reduced movement from scar tissue and chronic swelling / pain.
You may also consider a newer treatment, platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Platelets are found in your blood and have proteins which are essential to heal injuries.During this treatment, your blood will be drawn and the platelets separated, their concentration increased.The platelets will then be injected into the area where you are experiencing pain.

Use moist heat on your neck.,
Place a hot towel over your neck.,
Try an ice pack to soothe your neck.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck1," Heat helps tightened muscles relax, and moist heat is better than dry heat, as it can penetrate into the neck more effectively.Apply heat to the back or neck area for at least 20 minutes at a time, three times daily.


A moist heating pad (available at drug stores) is the best choice for applying heat to your neck, as the temperature can be controlled and applied for longer periods of time. Alternately, use a hot water bottle or take a hot shower or bath.;
, Place a hand towel in a bowl full of hot water, or pour the hot water all over the towel. Alternatively, put the towel in the dryer for 5-7 minutes. Dry out the towel just enough so that it is not dripping, but still has its warmth. Drape the towel over your neck when your neck is stiff or sore. After that is done  wait about 20 minutes a do it again. Keep doing this about three times.

, Cold dulls local pain and limits the buildup of lactic acid, which can cause soreness.Use an ice pack and place it on the part of your neck that feels stiff (usually the back of your neck at your hairline). Hold the pack there for 10-15 minutes every 2 hours.You can also try a more comfortable position to ice your neck. Sit in a comfortable chair and rest your head back. Place the pack between your shoulders and the bottom of your head. Lean back against it so your neck gets the full benefit of the cool temperature.
Some experts feel that ice will contribute to increased stiffness in the neck because the cold will contract your muscles.Try what feels good to your neck.
Use a cold treatment for acute pain in the first 48-72 hours, and then switch to heat."

Nod your head forward and backward.,
Tilt your head from side to side.,
Turn your head from left to right.,
Reduce heavy physical activity.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck2," In most cases, a stiff neck can be relieved immediately by performing a series of exercises to relieve tension caused by tight or strained neck muscles. Stretch the muscles in the front and back of your neck by tilting your chin toward your chest. Then bring your chin up toward the sky. Repeat for several minutes.


If this exercise feels painful, don't tilt your head too far forward or backward. Just try enough movement to feel a little stretch.

, Stretch the muscles in the sides of your neck by tilting your head toward one shoulder and then toward the other. Continue doing so until the pain eases a bit and the muscles feel less tense.

, This is often the most painful motion you can make when you have a stiff neck, so ease into it slowly. Keep turning your head from left to right for several minutes.

, For the first few days after you start getting a stiff neck, it’s a good idea to decrease the amount of physical activity.This will help reduce symptoms and relieve some of the inflammation you may be experiencing. Avoid the following sports or exercises for the first 2 to 3 weeks after the stiff neck appears:


Football, rugby, hockey, or any other high-contact sports
Golf
Running or jogging
Weightlifting
Ballet
Sit-ups and leg lifts

See a doctor if you have pain that won't go away.,
Check your anxiety level.,
Get medical attention if you notice severe symptoms.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck3," Sometimes a stiff neck is a symptom of a deeper problem, just as a slipped disc in your spine or a pinched nerve. This type of injury may not go away on its own. If you have been experiencing stiffness for more than a few days, call the doctor to find out if you need medical attention.Your doctor might administer an anti-inflammatory injection. Cortisone injections can be given directly at the site of the stiffness and they will reduce inflammation of the neck, which may be contributing to stiffness., A stiff neck can be caused by extreme tension in the body, often as a result of the buildup of anxiety. If you think your anxiety is contributing to a stiff neck, you might want to visit a doctor or counselor to talk about treating anxiety., Having a stiff neck is one of the primary symptoms of meningitis, a serious bacterial illness that causes swelling around the brain.A stiff neck may also indicate that you are having a heart attack.Get immediate medical attention if you experience the following symptoms:


A fever.
Vomiting and nausea.
Difficulty touching your chin to your chest.
Chest pain or pain in the left arm.
Dizziness.
If you have trouble sitting up, standing, or walking, see a doctor immediately.

Apply a topical analgesic.,
Take ibuprofen or aspirin.,
Try a muscle relaxant.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck4," Immediate relief can also be provided by balms that contain menthol or another ingredient that soothe skin and muscles. Some popular types of balms include Icy Hot, Bengay and Aspercreme.


You can also make your own analgesic. Melt 2 tablespoons coconut oil with 1 tablespoon beeswax in a small pot over medium heat. Add 5 drops of peppermint oil and 5 drops of eucalyptus oil. Pour the mixture into a container with a lid, such as a small glass mason jar. When it cools, apply it to your neck and the surrounding area.

, NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin provide effective pain relief and are available over the counter. Be sure to take no more than the recommended dosage.

, Muscle relaxants are useful in relaxing muscles and providing relief from a stiff or sore neck. They should only be used as short-term relievers, and they are best taken right before you plan to go to sleep.Use a muscle relaxant if other methods like stretching and heat or cold therapy are not working.


Muscle relaxants may contain other medicines. Read the directions carefully to take the proper dosage.

Choose a pillow that gives you support.,
Replace feather pillows after a year.,
Try sleeping without a pillow.,
Make sure your mattress is firm enough.,
Avoid sleeping on your stomach.,
Try to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck5," If you wake up with a stiff neck every once in a while, your pillow may be at fault. Depending on how you sleep, choose a pillow that will minimize neck stiffness.Memory foam pillows are a good choice, as they give consistent support so that your neck can fully relax during sleep.


Side sleepers should find a pillow that keeps the head horizontal, rather than slumping down toward the mattress.
Back sleepers should use a pillow that keeps the head horizontal and that doesn’t bring the chin toward the chest.

, Pillows filled with feathers can offer excellent support for the neck, but they do lose their fluffiness after about a year. If you have had your pillow for this long and you are experiencing a stiff neck, consider getting a new pillow., Many doctors recommend sleeping without a pillow for a few nights after you tweak your neck.This may help relieve symptoms and prevent stiffness caused by sleeping in the wrong position.

, Your mattress may not be providing enough support for your spine and neck. If it has been many years since you've bought a new mattress, it may be time for a new one.


You could also try flipping your mattress, which should be done occasionally to make sure the mattress doesn't get misshapen. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's care instructions, as some types of mattresses (e.g., pillow top mattresses) usually should not flipped.

, Sleeping on your stomach can be rough on the spine and neck, since your neck will be turned to one side all night. Try to fall asleep on your side or back. Even if you end up turning onto your stomach while you sleep, you will have spent less time on your stomach than if you started out sleeping that way., Getting enough rest will allow your body to restore itself. Sleep disturbances, such as waking up in the middle of the night or having trouble falling asleep, can exacerbate neck pain, since your body isn’t getting enough relaxed time to heal itself. Aim to get a full night’s sleep every night."

Massage your neck.,
Visit a massage therapist.,
Try acupuncture.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck6," Massage therapy is one of the best ways to relieve a stiff neck. If you're massaging your own neck, use this technique:


Warm up the back of your neck by rubbing up and down with your hands.
With gentle pressure, use your fingertips to rub in a circular motion on your neck. Focus on the areas that are most stiff, but rub your entire neck for relief.Repeat this motion up and down your neck for several minutes.

, A massage therapist will work with you to figure out where your body is holding tension. While your neck may be stiff, you may actually have tension in other parts of your back or shoulders that builds in your neck.


Check with your health insurance to see if massage is covered by your health plan.

, Acupuncture is the Chinese treatment of pain and other ailments by penetrating various strategic points of the skin with tiny needles. Although some question acupuncture’s effectiveness, many chronic neck-pain sufferers swear by this treatment.See an acupuncture therapist for a consultation and ask them specifically about treating neck stiffness or neck pain.

Take magnesium supplements.,
Try Epsom salts in a warm water bath.,
Try Chinese skin scraping, or Gua Sha.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck7," Although it hasn't been scientifically proven to help with stiff or sore neck, magnesium has been thought of as an effective relaxation technique for many suffering from debilitating muscle soreness. Try taking magnesium supplements.


The recommended daily allowance of magnesium supplement is anywhere from 310 milligrams to 420 milligrams, depending on age and gender.Do not exceed the recommended daily dosage.

, Epsom salts, or magnesium sulphate, is a common addition to many hot water baths, although science shows that Epsom salts have no effect on improving sore muscles., A very popular practice in China and Vietnam, skin scraping uses a dull spoon to scrape the back in order to produce bruising. This action is supposed to promote blood flow to the area as well as remove toxins or other unhealthy elements from the area. Gua Sha is beginning to be tested by the wider scientific community, sometimes with positive results.Gua Sha is not without controversy. Because it produces light bruising, it often looks unappealing, and it may not feel soothing or produce results for some patients.
Gua Sha treatment should be approached with caution; communicate to your practitioner when the scraping doesn't feel good or is rough on your skin. You don't want to leave the session with irritated skin and no comfort.

Set up your workspace to be ergonomic.,
Don’t sit too long.,
Don't look down at your phone frequently.,
Don't wear a heavy book bag on only one shoulder.,
Use the proper workout technique.",How to Get Rid of a Stiff Neck8," Many people suffer from a stiff neck because their work setup is not ergonomic. Position your chair so that you sit with your feet flat on the floor and your arms rest on your desk.


If you have a computer monitor, make sure it is at eye level.

, If you sit at a desk all day or you spend a lot of time in the car, take a lot of short breaks. Moving around gives your muscles a chance to stretch out instead of remaining rigid for hours on end.

, Craning your neck downwards constantly can slowly harm your neck. Instead, try holding your phone or tablet up in front of you at eye level.

, Carrying a lot of weight on one shoulder will disproportionately strain one side of your body over the other. Your neck and back will compensate for the weight and this can result in a stiff neck. Instead, choose a backpack or a small rolling suitcase.

, Lifting weights improperly is a common cause of stiff necks. You can strain your muscles or pinch a nerve if you don't use a safe technique. Work with an instructor to make sure you're using the right form.


Don't try to lift more weight than you can handle. Lifting shouldn't be easy, but you also shouldn't feel like you're going to topple forward. Find the appropriate weight for your body type and strength level.
Don't lift too many times per week. Your muscles need time to repair between workout sessions. You can overstrain yourself if you work out too often.

Warm up and ease into your workout.,
Stretch properly.,
Stay hydrated.,
Ice up.,
Heat up.,
Keep moving.,
Get a massage.,
Invest in a foam roller.,
Take pain medication.,
Know when soreness is normal and when it signals a problem.,
Plan a proper diet, including keeping hydrated.,
Consider taking vitamins, antioxidants, and other supplements.,
Try tart cherry juice.",How to Make Sore Muscles Feel Good," For your muscles to be limber and avoid injury during intense exercise, you must ease into your routine which gives them time to become warm and pliable. Avoid jumping right into a heavy or intense workout routine.


Start with light exercises and gradually increase the intensity.For example, if you are weightlifting, don't start with your heavy weights: begin with easy repetitions of light hand weights before you begin intense bench presses.;
, Stretching at the start and end of your workout will also help to get the lactic acid out of your muscles. Waiting hours after a strenuous workout before stretching is not the best. Stretch soon after activity that may cause soreness to prevent becoming stiff.


Be sure that you stretch after warming up, as your muscles will be more limber and less likely to become injured by stretching. Check out this helpful wikiHow article for advice on how to stretch properly to increase flexibility and reduce your risk of injury.

, Dehydration at the start of an exercise routine or sport is dangerous not only because it can cause you to become light-headed and faint, but also because it can lead to muscle soreness afterwards. Proper hydration during intense physical exercise increases oxygen to your muscles, which gives your muscles more stamina and also aids in their recovery as you work out.Try not to load up on water directly before you exercise, which can cause bloating and cramping. Instead, stay well-hydrated all the time, but especially in the 24 to 48 hours leading up to an intense workout.The rule of thumb for drinking water is to drink half of your body weight in fluid ounces, or about 3% of your body weight, of water per day.So, if you weigh 128 lbs, you should consume 64 fluid ounces (8 cups) of water per day. If you weigh 100 kg, you should consume 3 litres of water per day.
Be sure to stay well hydrated during your exercise routine: a good rule of thumb is to drink one cup (8 oz, 250 ml) of water for every 15 minutes of intense exercise., Ice-cold water immediately after an intense muscle workout has been shown to reduce muscle soreness more than any other single treatment.It reduces muscle inflammation and prevents much of the soreness from lingering in your muscles. If you are a professional or college athlete or workout at an elite gym, you might have an ice bath there that you can utilise to help reduce muscle soreness. If not, try these strategies instead:


Jump into a cold shower or bath. The colder, the better: professional athletes use ice water, but if you can't stand it, just use cold tap water with no hot water added. It won't work as well as ice water, but it will be better than warm or lukewarm water.
If you're an athlete, consider investing in a five-gallon bucket. For soreness of the arms (like from baseball practice), a five-gallon bucket filled with ice water will allow you to ice the whole arm at one time. This method will also work for feet.
When icing a muscle or muscle group (rather than your whole body), make sure wrap an ice pack in some sort of buffer before applying the ice. This will keep the extreme cold from injuring your skin. Try putting crushed ice in a plastic bag, then wrapping it in a tea towel or washcloth before applying to the affected muscles.Use plastic wrap to secure ice to limbs or the body. If you need to be moving around (cooking, cleaning, etc.) while using ice, plastic wrap can help secure ice onto a muscle while you move.
Ice your muscles for 10 – 20 minutes.

, While the first step should always be ice, a few hours later it’s a good idea to apply heat to the affected muscles to help stimulate blood flow to your muscles and help them to remain limber instead of tight.Apply heat for about 20 minutes.


Take a hot shower or bath. The water will relax your muscles as you soak.
Adding Epsom salts to your bathwater is an effective home remedy for sore muscles. Epsom salts are made of magnesium, which is absorbed into the skin and works as a natural muscle relaxant. Add two to four heaped tablespoons to a full bathtub and stir a little to dissolve. Enjoy your bath. You should feel some relief immediately after you finish your bath.For stiff neck, take uncooked rice and fill a tube sock and tie off the end. Microwave for 1.5 minutes and use as a heat wrap. It is reusable.
For isolated sore muscles, you can apply peel-and-stick heating pads directly to the skin and wear them under your clothes for hours. These can be purchased at most pharmacies., While it's tempting to completely relax your muscles as you recover, studies show that light activity that uses your sore muscles can reduce the length of time that you're sore. It's important to give your muscles time to recover, though, so be sure that you don't overdo it.Exercise helps muscle soreness by increasing blood flow to the affected muscles, which helps them to eliminate waste more quickly and keep muscles from becoming stiff.
Consider the intensity level of the workout that made you sore, and then do a lighter version of that activity the next day (similar to the intensity of a warm-up).For example, if running five miles has you sore, take a brisk walk for a half a mile to a mile.

, When you exercise to exhaustion, tiny tears occur in muscle fibers. The body's natural response to these tears is inflammation. Massage helps reduce the amount of cytokines the body produces, which play a role in inflammation.Massage also seems to increase the amount of mitochondria in your muscle, which enhances the muscles' ability to extract oxygen.Massage also helps move lactic acid, lymph, and other stagnant toxins from the muscles.
Seek out a massage therapist and allow him to work on your sore muscles. Massage therapy is relaxing, meditative, and healing.
Massage the muscles yourself. Depending on the location of the soreness, you can try to give yourself a massage. Use a combination of your thumbs, knuckles and palms to work deep into the muscle tissue. You can also use a lacrosse or tennis ball to really work into knots and take the pressure off your hands.
If you are massaging a sore muscle, don't focus on the middle of the sore muscle. Focus more on the connections at each end. This will help the muscle to relax more quickly.So if your wrist is sore, massage your forearm.

, These handy devices make it possible to give yourself a soothing deep-tissue massage both before and after working out, which can loosen up your muscles and help prevent soreness as well as treating muscles and knots that are already sore. These are very useful for sore thigh and leg muscles but can also be used on the back, chest, and buttocks. Press the roller into the sore muscle and rub it up and down. The action helps relieve tension and stress.


Known as ""self-myofascial release,"" this method of massage was once only used by professional athletes and therapists but is becoming mainstream for anyone who participates in sports or fitness activities.You can purchase a foam roller at any athletic store or online.
Check out this helpful wikiHow article for advice on how to use your foam roller to best soothe sore muscles.
If you don't want to spend the $20 – $50 on a foam roller, you can use a lacrosse ball or tennis ball to roll under your body.

, If you need immediate relief, try acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (also known as NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin.If you are under the age of 18, or if the person you're caring for is under the age of 18, avoid the use of aspirin. Aspirin in children under 18 has been linked to a dangerous disease called Reye's syndrome, which results in acute brain damage.Try to avoid using NSAIDs on a regular basis. NSAIDs might reduce your muscles' ability to repair themselves naturally if you take them too frequently. It's best to find more natural ways of treating muscle pain if you can., The feeling of muscle soreness after an intense workout or when you exercise muscles that have not seen much action lately is usually normal, but there are some signs to watch out for that might indicate a more serious condition.


Normal muscle soreness after working out usually hits a day after your exercise routine, especially if you change your workout routine, increased your intensity, or worked muscles that you're not used to working. This muscle soreness typically peaks on day two and then gradually subsides.Pay attention to any sudden shooting pains that happen while working out, which can signal a torn muscle. Also, watch for pain in your joints which might signal damage to a ligament or meniscus, or could be a sign of osteoarthritis.Call your doctor if you experience any muscle pain that comes on suddenly or does not respond to the use of over-the-counter pain medication, or if the pain does not start to resolve after a few days., If your muscles are sore from intense activities such as weightlifting, your muscles are rebuilding themselves, needing water and lots of protein. For optimal muscle growth, consume 1 gram (0.035 oz) of protein per day for every pound of lean body mass that you have, or, consume 0.22% of your lean body mass in protein.


For example, a man who weighs 150 pounds (68 kg) with 20% body fat, has 120 pounds (54 kg) of lean mass, and should consume 120 grams (4.2 oz) of protein per day. This will speed up recovery times considerably, as well as prevent muscle loss from poor nutrition. Eat Protein 15 to 45 minutes after workout for best results.
Drink lots of water while you workout and throughout the day. Your muscles need water to function at their peak, and your body needs water to repair your muscles. Don't forget to drink water.
Eating carbohydrates before and after your workout aids in muscle recovery and gives you the fuel necessary to power through your routine., Muscles need particular vitamins and minerals to repair properly as you work out, so prepping the body with the right supplements will help prepare it for strenuous exercise.


Vitamin C and antioxidants, in particular, have been effective in helping to prevent muscle soreness.Blueberries, artichokes, and green tea are antioxidant-rich,while chili peppers, guavas, and citrus fruits are all high in vitamin C.Look into supplementing with branched-chain amino acids (bcaa: L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine) and others before exercise — such as l-glutamine, l-arginine, betaine, and taurine -- may help prepare to clear waste products from your muscles. This also may promote recovery and protein turnover, rebuilding muscle.
Consider adding a protein supplement. Protein helps rebuild the muscles. You can try eating more natural sources of protein (like eggs, yoghurt, or chicken) or consider adding a scoop of protein powder in your post-workout smoothie.Consider adding creatine to your diet. Creatine is an amino acid that occurs naturally in the body, but adding more creatine to your diet can help your muscles repair themselves more quickly after an intense workout. Creatine supplements are available at health food stores., Sour cherry juice is quickly becoming recognized as a superfood, known for its antioxidants and other benefits. In one study, scientists found that tart cherry juice provided relief for mild to moderate muscle soreness.You can find 100% tart cherry juice at most major grocery stores or health food stores. Look for a brand that does not mix the juice with another type (for instance, cherry-apple juice), as those brands tend to put in a minimum amount of cherry. Also, be sure that the juice does not contain any added sugar or other ingredients.
Try using tart cherry juice as the basis for a post-workout smoothie, or drink it on its own. It's great straight out of the freezer or place a plastic cup of cherry juice in the freezer for about 45 minutes to create a delicious cherry slushie.

Focus on your calves.",How to Improve Your Posture1," Always imagine that a string coming from the top of your head is pulling you gently up towards the ceiling. Visualization techniques like this one can guide your sense of proper position and height effectively.;
, Then put a straight line of tape across your shoulders closing the top of the X. Wear this during the day, to help retrain your back. This works really well if you hold shoulders back before taping, use wide non stretch tape and ideally change tape each day.








, Be sure to try to walk as if you had a book balancing on your head.








, If you need help remembering to keep your posture, think of a unique object or color. Every time you think of that object, check your posture.








, Let your posture and balance rely more on your calves. Try to feel an at ease attitude, and put a bounce in your step. You'll find that it will free up the rest of your upper body to relax and assume a more upright posture that takes pressure from your back, shoulders and neck, and works on your ab muscles. This is awesome, since strong calves and abs rock!

Move your neck slowly back and forth. Stop the movement if and when you begin to feel any pain. Your range of motion should improve the more you flex your neck back and forth.
Move your neck from side to side. Stop the movement if and when you begin to feel any pain. As in the first exercise, your range of motion should improve the more you flex your neck.
Move your neck in a figure-8 pattern. This means moving it side-to-side while you simultaneously move it up and down. Do this slowly and stop if you feel any pain.;
, These drugs should help relieve pain in the neck. Do not, however, give aspirin to children below the age of 18, as aspirin in children has been linked to Reye's syndrome, which causes severe swelling of the brain.








, Let the lukewarm to hot water run over your neck for at least four or five minutes. Keep your neck straight as you do this, and do not turn it.








, Bath salts can help improve circulation, relieve muscle tension, and reduce stress. Experiment with different bath salt additives for added pain relief.









Epsom salts may be used in a warm bath. Epsom salts are made of magnesium and sulfate, and offer a go-to remedy for many health ailments in addition to relaxing the mind. Magnesium helps regulate the activity of numerous enzymes, as well as raising serotonin levels in the brain.

, Apply a heating pad for a couple of minutes to help to stimulate blood flow in your neck.








, Apply an ice pack, or something from the freezer wrapped in a towel to the affected area. Ice will dull the pain better than heat will.








, Balms come with many different applications; they can be herbal, analgesic (pain relief), or rubefacient (increase circulation). Know which kind of balm you are using.









Balms such as IcyHot or Namman Muay (an herbal balm from Thailand) help heat or simulate heat on the skin. IcyHot purports to dull the pain with cold, after which it heats the ache away. Massage or rub these or similar balms into the neck area for mild pain relief.

, Only use a brace if you feel your neck is unstable and the pain is severe. To do this at home, roll up a bath towel and wrap around your neck so that your base of your skull rests on top of the towel. Sit in a comfortable position.









If pain is severe seek help. If you have been in an accident, are experiencing illness, or think you might have whiplash, see your doctor about getting a proper medical neck brace.

, Consult with your doctor before getting a massage if the pain has been persistent for a long period. Go get a massage at your local spa. Massages are costly, but shop around for good service.










Acupuncture may be effective for chronic neck pain. Although, tests in the past decade have shown acupuncture to be no more effective than a placebo treatment.Acupuncture and massage both offer intense pressure inside muscles, but acupuncture may be better suited to offering a higher intensity pressure inside the muscle.Hydrotherapy, or water therapy, may also be effective.Hydrotherapy may be done at home in the shower, and offers a different kind of massage. Target the neck with warm water for three to four minutes. Turn the water to its cold setting and target the neck for 30 seconds to a minute. Repeat as many times as necessary.
Get a massage with different essential oils or rubbing alcohol. Essential oils such as lavender, tea tree, or citronella oils can impart healing properties in addition to stimulating the sense of smell. Rubbing alcohol starts off cold and gradually gets warmer, offering the same effect as some balms.

, If you've woken up and experienced torticollis, or pain in the neck from sleeping awkwardly, you're like millions of other people. Try these tips for avoiding torticollis in the future.









Sleep with the window closed, as warm as it is outside. During the summer especially, many people open their bedroom window in order to go to sleep. Then, in the middle of the night, when the temperature drops precipitously, the cold air causes the neck muscles to stiffen and cramp. Use a fan instead of opening your window next time!
Sleep with enough, but not too many, pillows. People who like to sleep on their stomachs should sleep with at least one pillow — torticollis can happen when the person turns his/her head 90 degrees to grab air.

People who sleep on their backs should not sleep with too many pillows, as this can create a sharp, uncomfortable angle between the neck and the shoulders during the night.


Take precautions after an unusual activity. Many people report having a pain in their necks after doing something that they don't normally do, such as garden, a new exercise, or packing and moving. If you know you've done something that puts you a risk at torticollis, massage your neck, flex it with different exercises, and take a warm bath before bed.

, If you work long hours at a desk, you may want to make sure that your work environment is set up to be optimally relaxing. If you put in the time up front to ensure that your muscles are being treated right, you might not have to deal with any fallout later on.









Keep your feet flat on the floor. This will often depend on how high your chair is, so don't be afraid to tinker with it to achieve good results.
Change your posture regularly. Sitting in one position for long periods of time is not healthy. So switch it up. Sit upright for most of the time. Sit reclined for some of the time. Sit declined for a little bit.
Find time to stand. Every hour, take a 5 minute break if you can and walk around. Inspect the sky. Talk to a coworker. Figure out the 15th decimal of pi. Whatever it is, break up the monotony of being seated for hours on end.

Consider using a standing workstation. Check out standing desks, or think about the feasibility of a treadmill desk.



, Try to meditate, focusing your attention away from your hectic, busy life, and toward your inner states. You may find it helpful in giving you perspective in addition to warding off neck pain that's caused by emotional stress. The following exercise takes three minutes, and can be done by anyone.









For one minute, focus your awareness on what is happening to you at this very moment; look at your thoughts and emotions, inspecting them.
For one minute after that, collect your attention and focus it on breathing. Notice what part of your body is most aware of your breathing.
For the the final minute, spend your time expanding your awareness outside of your immediate consciousness: from your head to your fingers, toes, hairs, and eventually outside your body, if possible.

, Emotional stress can have a strange effect on your physical health, and some even say that emotional stress can cause physical pain. Find natural, healthy ways to relieve stress in your life:









Exercise regularly. Find something — swimming, running, cycling, climbing — that makes you excited and feel alive. Make it into a routine. Your body will feel better and your mind will feel more relaxed.
Don't get into negative reinforcement cycles. Don't punish yourself for hurting yourself. Realize what is happening, take control, and start finding reasons to love yourself.

Sit up straight!,
Take standing breaks.",How to Improve Your Posture2," How often did your mother tell you that? For many people, this suggestion got filed right next to ""eat your peas,"" or ""your eyes will stick that way."" Mom was right, though–—at least about your posture. Now, especially, when so many of us sit at a desk all day, it's important to follow these basic guidelines, both for your posture and for your health.









If you work long hours at a desk and have the option, use a chair that's ergonomically designed for proper support and designed for your height and weight. If this is not an option, try using a small pillow for lumbar support.
Align your back with the back of the office chair. This will help you avoid slouching or leaning forward, which you may find yourself doing after sitting too long at your desk.
If you work on computers at an office, position the monitor on an angle a bit more upwards than you would if you were in more of a slouching position. This will force you to sit upright to see the screen better.
As with standing posture, keep your shoulders straight and squared, your head is upright, and your neck, back, and heels are all aligned.
Keep both feet on the ground or footrest (if your legs don't reach all the way to the ground).
Adjust your chair and your position so that your arms are flexed, not straight out. Aim for roughly a 75- to 90-degree angle at the elbows. If they are too straight, you're too far back, and if they are more than 90 degrees, you're either sitting too close, or you're slouching.

, Even if you're using perfect posture while sitting in the best chair in the world (and it's debatable whether there is such a thing), you need to stand up and stretch, walk around, do a little exercise, or just stand there for a few minutes. Your body was not designed to sit all day, and recent studies from the University of Sydney have found that ""rolonged sitting is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, independent of physical activity."" Keep moving!

Sleep soundly.",How to Improve Your Posture4," While you will not be able to consciously maintain a particular posture while sleeping, how you sleep can have an effect on your waking posture.









Using a firmer mattress will help by maintaining proper back support.
Sleeping on your back will help keep your shoulders straight, and it is usually more comfortable for the back than sleeping on the stomach.
If you prefer sleeping on your side, try slipping a small, flat pillow between your knees to help keep your spine aligned and straight.
Use a pillow to provide proper support and alignment for the head and shoulders. Don't overdo the pillows—–too many, and your head can be bent in an unnatural position; this will hurt your posture and you'll wake up feeling stiff, sore, and groggy.

Start with good sitting posture.,
Adjust the head rest.",How to Improve Your Posture5," Not only is good posture recommended simply for good posture's sake, it's also important for more practical safety concerns. Your car's seating and protective systems were designed for people sitting in the seat properly, and can actually have an impact on safety in the event of a collision.









Keep your back against the seat and head rest.
Adjust your seat to maintain a proper distance from the pedals and steering wheel. If you're leaning forward, pointing your toes, or reaching for the wheel, you're too far away. If you are bunched up with your chin on top of the steering wheel, you're too close.

, The head rest should be adjusted so that the middle of your head rests against it. Tilt the head rest as needed, to maintain a distance of no more than four inches (10cm) between the back of your head and the head rest.

Stay in shape.",How to Improve Your Posture6," To keep your entire musculoskeletal system in tune to support your posture, it's important to keep yourself in shape. Try these tips:









Lie on your back, with your legs bent to about 90 degrees at the knee, and your feet on the floor.
Pull your belly-button towards your spine and holding it at the end. This is a different type of contraction than crunches (crunches feel like they are more at the front of your stomach, while this feels like it is more inwards and towards your back).
Hold for ten seconds, repeat eight times. Repeat it daily.
Maintain the proper posture even if you are getting tired and are not using other muscles like your back or butt muscles.
Breathe normally during this exercise, as you are training your core to be able to maintain this position during normal activities in daily life.

Alternate cold and warm packs.,
Rest your neck.,
Keep your neck supported.,
Gently stretch your neck.,
Carefully massage your neck.,
Mind your posture.",How to Get a Crick Out of Your Neck1," Possible options include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.Anti-inflammatory medications like these reduce the swelling and ultimately relieve the pain.
Before taking an over-the-counter medication, make sure that you are not on any prescription medications that could interact negatively with the drug. Moreover, you should also make sure that you do not have any medical conditions that prevent you from taking one or all of these drugs. For instance, someone with an ulcer should avoid taking aspirin.
Note that over-the-counter medications only provide temporary relief. Do not let the immediate lack of pain lull you into a false sense of security, since you can still worsen the strain by overworking it.;
, Both cold and warmth can help with a crick in the neck, but for best results, you should consider alternating them.

Begin by applying an ice pack for 7 to 20 minutes. The cold reduces inflammation, and it must be applied first. A bag of frozen vegetables or ice wrapped in a towel will work, too, but you should never apply ice directly to the skin.
Take a warm shower, use a hot water bottle, or use a heating pad, set to low, on the back of your neck. Apply heat in 10- to 15-minute segments or less.Heat soothes sore muscles, but it can make inflammation worse if applied too often.
Give your neck a break from both. You can alternate between cold and warmth throughout the day as necessary, but you should give the muscles in your neck 30 minutes or more in between treatments so that your neck has a chance to stabilize itself.

, Lie down on your back several times throughout the day so that your neck has a break from the strain of holding your head up.

Do not lie on your stomach, since you will need to twist your neck when you do so. Your neck should be straight as you lie down.
If the crick is not severe enough to warrant lying down, you should still reduce your activity for a few days. Do not do any heavy lifting or twisting for the first 2 or 3 weeks at minimum. Avoid jogging, football, golf, ballet, weightlifting, or other strenuous exercise.Do not rest too much, however. If you do nothing but lie around all day, the muscles in your neck will become weak. As a result, when you are forced to resume your usual activities, you are more likely to hurt your neck again. Alternate periods of rest with periods of non-strenuous activity during the day.

, Wear a scarf or turtle-neck sweater to provide gentle support throughout the day. Alternatively, you could also position a neck pillow behind your head as you work.

Usually, stiff support is not necessary. If you are unaccustomed to it, stiff support may actually aggravate the problem or cause you to experience pain in other areas of your body, like your back. Soft support is often sufficient.

, Slowly move your neck from side to side, holding it in place for 30 seconds with each rotation.

Focus on stretching your neck to the side and to the front, but avoid bending it too far back, since this often aggravates a crick in the neck.
Only stretch as far as the pain will allow. Do not try to ""push"" your way past the pain and do not perform these exercises too quickly.

, Use your fingers to gently rub the back of your neck, near the crick, for up to 3 minutes.

Do not apply firm pressure and stop immediately if mild pressure makes your neck hurt more.
If you are unable to bend your arms back due to the pain, ask a friend or family member to gently rub the area for you.

, Your neck should be fairly straight as you sit and lie down, but do not hold your neck stiffly in an effort to maintain the position.

This treatment is more long-term than short-term, since good posture is essential to preventing neck cricks from coming back.
Lie down on your back or side as you sleep. Do not sleep on your stomach, since doing so twists your neck in awkward positions. Make sure that your pillows are not so high that they cause you to bend your neck, but also make sure that they are not so low that they offer no support.
Avoid sitting too long with your head bent down or leaning forward. Take breaks throughout the day to stretch and move around.

Find your center.,
Teach your body what it feels like.",How to Improve Your Posture7," Proper standing posture is about alignment and balance. It also lends an air of confidence. Here are some tips for achieving the correct upright posture:









Place your feet about shoulder width apart, the same stance you would use for working out or many other physical activities.
Stand up straight. This is, of course, the key to good standing posture, and bears repeating. As you develop good posture habits, this will become second nature.
Keep your weight on the balls of your feet. When you rest on your heels, your natural tendency will be to slouch. Instead, stand up, and make an effort to stand on the balls of your feet. Notice how the rest of your body follows. Now rock back so that your weight is on your heels. Notice the way your entire body shifts into a ""slouchy"" posture with this single motion.
Keep your shoulders squared. It may feel unnatural at first, if you have not developed good posture habits. Like standing up straight, however, this will become second nature.
Pull your head back and up. Picture yourself reaching for the ceiling with the top of your head. Keep your head square on top of the neck and spine as you do this. Not only will this improve your posture, you will look taller and leaner, too. Try it!

, Stand with your back against a door or wall, with the back of your head, your shoulders, and your butt just touching it. If it feels awkward and uncomfortable, don't worry—–as you develop good posture habits and train your body, it will feel uncomfortable to not stand this way.

Identify good posture.,
Train your muscles to do the work.,
Be a penguin.,
Do stretches.,
Practice yoga.",How to Improve Your Posture8," Good posture is nothing more than keeping your body in alignment. Good posture while standing is a straight back, squared shoulders, chin up, chest out, stomach in, feet forward, your hips and knees in a neutral position. If you can draw a straight line from your earlobe through your shoulder, hip, knee, to the middle of your ankle—–you've got it. To find yours:









Using a mirror, align your ears, shoulders, and hips. Proper alignment places your ears loosely above your shoulders and above your hips. Again, these points make a straight line, but the spine itself curves in a slight 'S'. You'll find that this doesn't hurt at all. If you do experience pain, look at your side view in a mirror to see if you're forcing your back into an unnatural position. If you do not have pain, then posture should not be altered, because this could cause other problems.
The spine has two natural curves that you need to maintain called the 'double C' or 'S' curves. These curves of the back are also called lordotic and kyphotic. A lordotic curve is a curve in the lumbar spine, and when there is a increases angle this is called lordosis of the lumbar spine.A kyphotic curve is present in the thoracic spine, but when this curve exceeds 50 degrees it is called kyphosis of the thoracic spine.These are the curves found from the base of your head to your shoulders and the curve from the upper back to the base of the spine. When standing straight up, make sure that your weight is evenly distributed on your feet. You should feel comfortable in this position in order to correctly asses your posture.

, Exercises that strengthen the muscles across your upper back and shoulders will help you to maintain good posture. You don't need to develop a body builder physique—–it's more important to build ""muscle memory"" so that you unconsciously and naturally maintain correct posture without fatigue. When you lift weights, you should exercise the agonist and antagonist muscles evenly. This means that you should exercise your hamstrings as much as your quadriceps, chest as much as your back, and so on. This will help with correct posture. Try the following, with or without hand weights:










Exercise One

Square your posture, head upright, so that your ears are aligned over your shoulders.
Raise both arms straight out, alongside your ears, palms up.
Bend forearms in and back, toward shoulders, in an effort to touch your shoulder blades with your fingertips.
Do ten repetitions with both arms, then alternate ten reps for each arm singularly.



Exercise Two

Align ears with shoulders as in Exercise One.
Raise both arms out to sides at shoulder height, and hold for a slow count of ten.
Slowly lower arms to sides, counting ten as you lower.
Slowly raise arms back to shoulder height, counting to ten as you raise arms.
Do ten reps, constantly checking your alignment with each rep. If ten reps are too many to start, do as many as you can. You should at least feel a slight fatigue in the shoulder muscles.



, While you wait for a web page to load or the bread to toast, place your elbows at your side, and touch your shoulders with your hands.









Keeping your hands on your shoulders and your ears aligned, raise both elbows (count one, two) and lower them back down (count one, two). Do as many reps as your wait allows. You'll be surprised how much exercise fits into 30 seconds.

, This can greatly help if you find that you have a sore back or neck. It's also good to do during the day, if your job requires you to sit for long periods.









Tilt or stretch your head in all four directions over your shoulders (forward, back, left, right), and gently massage your neck. Avoid rolling in a circle, as it may cause further strain.
On your hands and knees, curl your back upwards, like a cat, and then do the opposite. Think about being able to place a bowl in the hollow of your back.
Repeat the exercises a few times each day. Doing them in the morning helps your body stretch out the muscle lethargy of sleep. Done periodically throughout the day, it will help to raise your energy level like that of a heavy workout.

, Yoga is excellent for posture, and for your health in general. It can also improve your balance. Yoga works your core muscles, making them stronger and helping you to keep a proper body alignment.









Yoga will also help by teaching you how to hold an erect posture while sitting, standing, and walking. Look for classes in your area, or scout YouTube for instructional videos.

Avoid unintentional back injury.",How to Improve Your Posture9," Lifting and carrying presents extra loads and balance problems that are not part of your normal, everyday physical structure. Lifting or carrying objects without regard to your physiology can cause discomfort, pain, or in some cases, real injury. Here are some guidelines for proper load-bearing posture:









When you're lifting something off the ground any heavier than your cat, always bend at the knees, not the waist. Your back muscles are not designed for taking the weight, but your large leg and stomach muscles are. Use them well.
If you do a lot of heavy lifting, either as part of weight training or as part of your job, consider wearing a supportive belt. This can help you maintain good posture while lifting.
Keep it tight. The closer you keep large or heavy objects to your chest, the less you use your lower back when carrying them. Instead, the work is done with your arms, chest, and upper back.

Try holding a five pound (2.26kg) sack of flour, and hold it far out in front of you. Now, slowly pull it closer and closer to your chest and feel the different muscle groups come into play as you do this.


Balance your load to prevent stress and fatigue. If you're carrying a heavy suitcase, for example, change arms frequently. You'll know when.

Chiropractic treatment to the neck is a safe and effective way to remove the cause of the crick in the neck, and can also be used to fix the cause of a pinched nerve. Most chiropractors also incorporate physical therapy and massage into their practice.

, If the pain does not respond to over-the-counter medication after several days, your doctor may prescribe a muscle relaxant or tricyclic antidepressant.
/images/thumb/5/52/Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-9-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-9-Version-5.jpg

Muscle relaxants reduce the strain and discomfort caused by overworked neck muscles.
Some antidepressants increase neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, thereby reducing pain signals sent to the brain., Physician-prescribed neck exercises and traction can provide immediate relief while strengthening the muscles, helping to prevent future cricks in the neck.
/images/thumb/0/00/Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-10-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-10-Version-5.jpg

A physical therapist can lead you in performing specific neck exercises and stretches that can aid in your long-term recovery. The therapist will likely ask that you perform the treatments at his or her office initially, but most of these can eventually be done at home.
Traction is a specific type of therapy that relies on a system of weights and pulleys to stretch your neck out. It is always done under professional supervision, and it works best when the crick is linked to nerve root irritation., These collars provide stiff support for your neck and help to relieve pain by reducing the amount of pressure on your neck muscles.
/images/thumb/a/a0/Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-11-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-11-Version-5.jpg

You should wear such a collar for no longer than two weeks, though, since wearing it past this time can actually cause the muscles in your neck to weaken.

, The doctor injects corticosteroid at the nerve root and into the joints or muscles of your neck.

This is an especially helpful treatment for cricks in the neck caused by arthritis.
Similarly, the doctor may inject a numbing medication like lidocaine into the neck.

, Surgery is usually involved in severe cases where the nerve roots or spinal cord are the cause of the problem./images/thumb/5/55/Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Get-a-Crick-Out-of-Your-Neck-Step-13-Version-5.jpg

Protect your head.,
Turn as you fall.,
Keep arms and legs bent.,
Stay loose.,
Roll out of the impact.,
Spread out the force of the fall.",How to Fall Safely1," The most important body part that you need to protect in a fall is your head. Head injuries can be very serious, even deadly. Make sure you prioritize protecting your head as you fall by properly positioning it.Tuck your your chin down, lowering your head.
If falling down, face first, turn your head to the side.
Bring your arms up to head level for additional protection. Put them in front of your head if falling forwards or behind your head if falling backwards.
If you are taking anticoagulants or blood thinners and fall and hit your head, this may result in a dangerous and life threatening bleed inside your skull. Call your doctor, who may tell you to go to the hospital for a CT scan.;
, If you are falling either straight forward or straight backwards, try to turn your body so you land on your side. Falling directly on your back can cause serious injury to it. A frontal fall can cause damage to the head, face, and arms. By landing on your side you can reduce the chance of injury from high distances (for example, one way vertical paths)., It may be tempting to try and catch yourself fully as you fall with your arms. However, landing with your arms straight out and absorbing the full force of the fall with them can cause injury. Try keeping both arms and legs slightly bent as you fall.Landing fully on your arms in an attempt to catch yourself can break both your wrists and arms.

, Tensing up during a fall can increase the chances of sustaining an injury. The tension in your body won't allow for the absorption of force from the fall. Instead of spreading the impact out over a flexible body, the parts that were kept taught are more likely to break instead of going with the motion.You can try breathing out as you fall to help keep your body relaxed.

, If you are able, a good technique to dissipate the force of a fall is to roll into it. By rolling, you send the energy of the fall into the roll, rather than having your body absorb the impact. Since the technique is difficult, you may want to practice falling and rolling at a gym or somewhere with padded and cushioned floors.Start in a low squat position.
Lean forward and place your palms flat on the ground in front of you.
Push off the ground with your legs and move your weight forwards.
Your legs will go over your head.
Keep your back rounded and gently try to land on a shoulder.
Let the momentum carry you through the roll and back up onto your feet.

, A big part of falling safely is to spread out the force of the impact over a large area of your body. Falling on a single point will result in that area taking most of the damage. By spreading out the impact, you reduce the chance of serious injury to a single part of the body."

Be aware of medications that might affect your balance.",How to Fall Safely2," If you work or walk in an environment where slipping hazards are present, you will want to wear slip-resistant shoes. These shoes are specially designed to grip surfaces and prevent falls, even if those surfaces are slick or wet.Most footwear of this type will be labeled as “slip-resistant.”

, As you walk, pay careful attention to the speed at which you are walking and where you're stepping. The faster you walk or run, the more likely you are to fall, especially if the ground is suddenly or surprisingly uneven. By slowing down and being aware of the environment, you can lower the chances of falling.Be careful walking or running in any areas where the ground may be uneven.
Pay attention when taking the stairs and always use the hand rail.

, If you are performing any task that requires the use of a ladder or similar device, always practice proper safety. Read over any operation manual or safety instructions to make sure you are using the device properly.Always check to make sure any ladder or step stool is secure and is in good working order.
Never ride on a vehicle unsafely. Always enter or mount a vehicle slowly and carefully.

, Whether at work or at home, take a few steps to create a safe environment that removes the most common tripping hazards. Making frequently used rooms and spaces safe from trip hazards can greatly reduce your chances of falling. Review the following list for some helpful tips:Always close drawers after you are done with them.
Don't leave cords or wires in walkways.
Keep the area well lit.
Walk slowly over slippery or dangerous areas, taking small controlled steps.
Consider relocating if you live somewhere with steep stairs and falling is a concern. Otherwise, make sure you have handrails or a banister.
Use non-slip bath mats in the tub and bathroom and consider installing a grab bar in the tub.
Remove small throw rugs or use double-sided tape to make sure they don't flip up or slip.

, Weak legs and muscles can increase your chance of falling. Gentle exercises like Tai Chi can improve strength and balance, making falls less likely., Some medications can cause dizziness or drowsiness, which could increase your chances of a fall.Talk to your doctor about your medications (sometimes the interaction of several medications might lead to these side effects). She may be able to prescribe you something else.

Take fish oil.",How to Get Rid of Arthritis Pain1," You can take over the counter analgesics, such as acetaminophen or tramadol, to help relieve your pain. These medications help with pain, but they do not help with inflammation. Popular over the counter brands include Tylenol and Ultram.


If the pain is severe, you may want to contact a pain clinic and ask about prescription analgesics, such as narcotics with oxycodone or hydrocodone. Popular prescriptions include Percocet, Oxycontin, and Vicodin.;
, To help with the pain of arthritis, you can take over the counter NSAIDs. These drugs, such as Ibuprofen and naproxen, can be used to relieve occasional pain that comes with arthritis or overworking muscles that leads to joint and muscle pain. They also help reduce inflammation, which is a major component of arthritis pain.Talk to your doctor if you find yourself using these medications too regularly. You don't want to over treat yourself, which can cause more problems, including damage to your kidneys and liver.
Try a common brand of of ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin, and of naproxen, such as Aleve., There are some over the counter topical creams that you can buy that might help with arthritis pain. These creams contain menthol or capsaicin, which, when applied to the skin over a painful joint, can help relieve pain. They may also interfere with the transmission of pain signals from the painful joint.


In studies, capsaicin has been shown to reduce pain by 50% after three weeks of use.You can also get some NSAIDs that can be applied as a cream.You can take these with or without oral medications., You can take prescription corticosteroids to help reduce severe arthritis pain and swelling. Your doctor can give these to you in the form of a shot or a pill. Injections can provide you with quick relief, but they can only be used a few times a year. This is because they break down bone and cartilage.


Any form of corticosteroids you are prescribed will be monitored by your doctor because there are some potentially negative side effects, such as the loss of vitamin D that leads to bone deterioration., It also affects neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which helps to reduce pain perception.


Multiple studies have shown that SAM-e relieves arthritis symptoms just as effectively as NSAIDs, but has fewer side effects., ASU is a supplement that blocks chemicals in the body that cause inflammation. It also prevents the deterioration of the cells that line joints and may help regenerate joint connective tissue.This supplement is a combination of 1/3 avocado oil and 2/3 soybean oil.


This supplement is available as a soft gel. You should take one 300mg pill daily., Also known as Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, fish oil is a supplement that has been extensively studied. The Omega-3s help block inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins and also are converted by the body into anti-inflammatory chemicals.


It also helps decrease joint tenderness and stiffness. In studies, it has also been shown to reduce or eliminate the use of NSAIDs.You can also take omega 6 fatty acids, known as gamma linolenic acid (GLA), to help reduce joint inflammation."

With osteoarthritis, the pain is caused by use of the joints. The type of arthritis you have may influence which treatments are most appropriate for you.


Rheumatoid arthritis can begin at any age, while osteoarthritis usually occurs later in life, since it is associated with joint usage. The symptoms will often present rapidly instead of appearing gradually over the years.A major sign that you have rheumatoid arthritis and not osteoarthritis is the presence of other symptoms, such as fatigue and a persistent feeling of being sick.Pain resulting from rheumatoid arthritis affects joints big and small and usually occurs on both sides of the body. Morning pain will last longer than an hour.If you have osteoarthritis, you may experience morning pain, but you are more likely to feel it after using the affected joints., Being overweight can cause or increase complications associated with arthritis. It can also contribute to arthritis pain. You should try to slowly make changes in your life to lose weight, such as exercising more and eating better.You need to build muscles around your joints, but you don't want to damage the joints themselves.


You should focus on stretching and range of motion exercises that will gradually increase your strength. Avoid running, jumping, tennis, and high-impact aerobics.Try to exercise later in the day. This will help you feel less stiff when you wake up in the morning.
These should be permanent lifestyle changes, so you can continue to maintain your weight over time. This will help you increase your overall health and reduce your arthritis pain for a long time.Losing weight will help with the degenerative changes seen with aging and wear and tear.

Identify if you are at risk.,
Notice any difficulty breathing.,
Look for a cough.,
Check for overall poor health.",How to Diagnose Silicosis1," Silicosis affects specific groups of people. People who have an occupation where they have been exposed to silica (quartz dust) that they have inhaled are at a high risk of developing this condition.People particularly affected are those who work in mines, foundries, or quarries, cut stones or blast rock and sand, or use sand blasters. Glass makers, ceramic and gemstone workers, and potters are also at risk.This condition usually occurs in people over the age of 40 because it happens after prolonged exposure.;
, Silicosis affects the lungs. This results in problems breathing. You may notice the problems when you are exercising or performing physical activity, such as climbing stairs or walking long distances.You may also experience shortness of breath when you are sitting or have not been engaged in physical activity.
This may develop rapidly or gradually.

, Silicosis often produces a chronic cough that might not respond to usual treatments. This cough may be dry and produce nothing when you cough. Often, the cough produces phlegm.No matter if it is dry or wet, the cough will be severe.


Chest pains often accompany the cough., People who suffer from acute silicosis may feel weak, fatigued, or lethargic. This can lead to decreased vitality and quality of life. Silicosis may also result in weight loss and a decreased appetite.You may experience a fever.

"
"
Go see your doctor.,
Explain your medical and personal history.,
Get a physical examination.",How to Diagnose Silicosis2," When you suspect you have silicosis, you must make an appointment with your doctor. Diagnosing this condition can be a long and grueling process. You may have to go to the doctor multiple times and undergo multiple tests as they try and diagnose this condition.Simple chronic silicosis doesn't present many symptoms or lung damage. Silicosis can also mimic other lung diseases, such as emphysema. This can make diagnosis difficult.

, Part of the diagnostic process for silicosis is a thorough medication history and discussion about your occupation. Your doctor will ask you about your previous jobs. Be as truthful and honest as you can about where you worked, what type of work you did, and what you were exposed to.The first diagnostic test for your doctor to suspect silicosis is your work at a high-risk job.

, After speaking with you, your doctor will give you a physical exam. Your doctor will check your overall health, but the main thing they will do is to listen to your lungs. They will use a stethoscope and have you breathe while they listen.They will listen from your chest and back. They may ask you to breathe at different speeds and breathe multiple times.
The doctor will probably test for tuberculosis and other lung infections. They may give you an inhaler for other chronic lung diseases to see how your body responds.
Your doctor may refer you to a specialist if they suspect silicosis.

"
"
Get a chest x-ray.,
Undergo a breathing test.,
Have a CT scan done.,
Get a lung tissue sample taken.",How to Diagnose Silicosis3," After your doctor has determined that your occupation and symptoms fit with silicosis, they will order a chest X-ray. This x-ray is the first test ordered when diagnosing silicosis.The chest x-ray may be clean or show significant scarring of the lung tissue.

, Your doctor may order a breathing test. This will test how your lungs are functioning. You will be asked to breathe into a spirometer, which is a machine that will figure out how well your lungs work by measuring airflow and air volume.If you have simple silicosis, your lung function may not be negatively affected. However, silicosis leads to declined lung function as the disease advances., Another diagnostic tool for silicosis is a CT scan. This can give the doctor a better image of your lungs by showing them changes, thickening of the tissue, and any lesions. The doctor looks for a pattern of distinctive scarring that is reflective of silicosis.This may be done even if you have a chest x-ray, especially if the chest x-ray was inconclusive or clear.

, Chest x-rays and CT scans may be inconclusive. If they cannot tell if there is scarring on the lungs, or if the images come back clear, the doctor may order a lung tissue sample be taken. This will help to confirm whether or not it’s silicosis.To do this, the doctor will perform a bronchoscopy by placing a narrow flexible scope into your lungs. This scope will take samples of the lung fluid and tissue.

"
"
Treat silicosis.,
Get vaccinated against lung infections.,
Prevent silicosis.,
Identify the different types.",How to Diagnose Silicosis4," There is no cure for silicosis. Your doctor will use the different diagnostic tests to figure out the amount of damage to your lungs. The severity of the condition influences the treatment.You may need oxygen to help you breath if you have a severe case.
You may be given medication to help decrease phlegm or relax your air tubes.
Stay away from silica, smoke, allergens, and pollution.
In severe cases, you may need a lung transplant.

, A lung infection can be very serious and difficult to treat when you have damaged lungs. Anyone with silicosis should get vaccinated every year to help prevent flu and pneumonia. Every ten years, get a tetanus booster that includes protection against pertussis (whooping cough)., Silicosis occurs when you inhale silica or quartz dust for an extended period of time. This generally happens because of your occupation. Silica dust should be controlled in the workplace so as not to put the workers at risk.Many occupations are unable to control the silica dust. If this is the case, you should wear protective gear like masks or hoods that filter the air you breath.
Choose to use abrasives and materials that do not contain silica. They will be safer to inhale.
If you work in this environment, you should have chest x-rays often to detect any early signs of silicosis. The earlier you detect it, the more likely you are to treat and manage it.
Stop smoking, especially if you have a high-risk occupation.

, There are different types of silicosis. Each type refers to the degree of severity. Knowing which type of silicosis you have helps your doctor know which treatment is best and to what degree your lungs are damaged.Acute silicosis occurs after intense, concentrated exposure. This can cause shortness of breath, a bluish tint to the skin, fever, and severe cough.
Chronic silicosis is the most common and occurs due to long-term exposure. It takes decades to develop and is usually diagnosed after age 40.
Simple silicosis is the first stage of chronic silicosis. You may experience no symptoms and no decrease in lung function. It may be hard to diagnose because it may present like emphysema or bronchitis.
Complicated silicosis is a more advanced stage of chronic silicosis. You may experience weight loss and fatigue at this stage.
Accelerated silicosis happens in under 10 years of exposure due to large amounts of inhaled silica dust. Symptoms progress faster in this stage.

Hydrate with liquids.,

Stay indoors and keep yourself cool with an air conditioner or fan.,

Wear loose clothing.,

Don't look at the sky.,

Call your doctor if any issues with breathing or other symptoms arise.,
Keep medication handy.,
Evacuate if told or needed.",How to Cope with Vog," Always keep a water bottle or a rehydrate drink with you at all times. Avoid any caffeine, for example hot coffee or sodas that would dehydrate your body fast.
, If you're sensitive to unknown or unnecessary smoke or fumes (like firework smoke), limit your outdoor activities or make fast, short errand trips. Use newspaper or your hands to create a ""fan"" to keep you cool., In most events, the vog creates more humidity in the air; making it more hot and uneasy. Light colors, such as white, doesn't emit heat as much as wearing a dark color., This may sound funny or stupid, but looking up and seeing a hazy, glossy sky or mountain will make you feel depressed. This reaction sometimes occurs during a rainy day., If it's after hours, don't be afraid to speak with an advice consultant about the problems., Even if it's an over-the-counter medicine to reduce headaches, always be prepared. Only take medicines when you need it, never to avoid a possible one. Relax your body or take a nap after the medication., If the vog gets worse or to an extreme level, you may be told to evacuate to a safer place."

Identify symptoms of pneumonia.,
Go to the doctor if you think you have pneumonia.,
Describe your symptoms to your doctor.,
Let the doctor listen to your lungs.,
Get additional tests if your doctor recommends it.",How to Determine if You Have Pneumonia1," If you think you might have pneumonia, it is important to treat it promptly before it gets worse. The symptoms may worsen gradually over several days or suddenly be very severe from the onset. Signs of pneumonia include:Fever
Sweating and shivering
Discomfort in your chest when you cough or breathe, particularly breathing when breathing deeply
Fast, shallow breathing. This may occur only when you are physically active.
Fatigue
Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. These are common symptoms in infants.
Coughing. You may even cough up yellow, green, rust-colored, or pink and bloody mucus.
Headache
Lack of hunger
White fingernails
Confusion. This commonly occurs in elderly people who have pneumonia.
A lower body temperature than normal. This is most likely to occur in the elderly or people with weakened immune systems.
Joint pain, rib pain, upper abdominal pain, or back pain
Accelerated heartbeat;
, All people who think they may have pneumonia should go immediately to the doctor. Pneumonia can be deadly if left untreated. You are particularly likely to be vulnerably to rapidly developing a severe infection if you belong to one of the following high risk groups:Children younger than two
People over 65
People with other health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, heart, or lung problems
People getting chemotherapy
People taking medications which suppress their immune systems

, This will help him understand how long you have been sick and how severe your infection might be. Your doctor may want to know:If you feel out of breath or breathe rapidly even when you are resting
How long you have been coughing and whether it is getting worse
If you are coughing up mucus that is yellow, green, or pink
If your chest hurts when you inhale or exhale

, The doctor may ask you to lift up or remove your shirt so he or she can use a stethoscope to listen to your lungs. This doesn't hurt, and the only discomfort you may feel is because the stethoscope often feels cold when it touches the bare skin. The doctor will ask you to take deep breaths while he or she listens to the front and back of your chest.If your lungs rattle or crackle, this is a sign of an infection.
Your doctor may tap on your chest while listening. This can help detect lungs that are filled with fluid.

, There are several things the doctor can do to identify if you have a lung infection and what exactly might be causing it. Possible tests include:A chest X-ray. This will help the doctor to see if you have an infection in your lungs and if so, which side it is in and how widespread it is. This test does not hurt. The doctor will use X-rays to create an image of your lungs. You may be asked to wear a lead apron to protect your reproductive organs. If you think you might be pregnant, tell your doctor, because X-rays may be dangerous for your baby.Blood or sputum cultures. During this test, the doctor will either take blood or ask you to cough sputum into a vial. The blood or sputum will be tested in the lab to determine exactly what pathogen is causing the infection.
If you are already in the hospital and/or your health is severely compromised, other tests may be done. This could include a test of your arterial blood gases to determine if your lungs are supplying your blood with enough oxygen, a CT scan if you are in the ER, or thoracentesis, during which a highly trained specialist uses a needle to go through the skin and muscles of your chest and remove a small amount of fluid for testing.

Take antibiotics.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Control your fever.,
Ask your doctor about cough medicines.,
Get a bronchoscopy if you have aspiration pneumonia.,
Go to the hospital if home-care isn’t helping.,
Bring a child to the hospital if they are not improving.",How to Determine if You Have Pneumonia2," It takes a few days for testing to reveal effective antibiotic, in the interim a more broad spectrum antibiotic may be prescribed to initiate therapy. Similarly, there are times when pneumonia testing reveals no bugs — inadequate sputum or no septicemia (leading to a negative blood culture). Once treatment is determined, your symptoms should improve within a few days or weeks. You may still feel fatigued for over a month.Most people on antibiotics for pneumonia can be treated at home. If your symptoms do not improve after two days or worsen, contact your doctor immediately. That is a sign that you need a different medication.
You may continue coughing for two to three weeks after finishing the antibiotics. If this occurs, consult your doctor.
Antibiotics will not work for viral pneumonia. Your immune system will have to fight it off.

, If you have a high fever, sweating, and chills, you are probably losing a lot of water. It is important to stay hydrated so your body can fight off the infection. For severe cases of dehydration, you may need to be hospitalized. If you feel thirsty or have any of the following symptoms you need to drink more water:Exhaustion, headaches, infrequent urination, passing dark or cloudy urine, If your doctor says it is ok, you may be able to reduce your fever with over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB and others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol and others).


Do not take ibuprofen if you are allergic to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, have asthma, kidney problems, or stomach ulcers.Do not give medications containing aspirin to children or teenagers.
Consult with your doctor before starting these medications to make sure that they will not interact with any other over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, herbal remedies, or supplements you may be on.
Do not take these medications if you are pregnant, nursing, or treating a child without first talking to your doctor.

, Your doctor may suggest cough medicines if you are coughing so much that you can’t sleep.However, coughing removes the mucus from your lungs and can be important in helping you heal and recover. For that reason, your doctor may advise against cough medications.An alternative to cough medicine is a cup of warm water with lemon and honey in it. This can help soothe the pain caused by coughing.
If you do take cough medicines, even over-the-counter medications, read the ingredients and make sure that it they are not the same as those in any other medications you are taking. If so talk to your doctor to make sure that you will not accidentally overdose.

, This occurs when people choke on and accidentally inhale a small object into their lungs. If this occurs, you may need to have it removed.The doctor will put a small scope through your nose or mouth and into your lungs to remove the object. You will probably receive medication to numb your nose, mouth, and airways. You may also be put under general anesthesia or take a medication that will help you relax. Removing the object will enable you to heal.

, You may need to be admitted to the hospital for more intensive care if you are unable to fight off the infection at home and your symptoms are worsening. You may need to stay in the hospital until you stabilize if:You are over 65
You are suffering from confusion
You are vomiting and cannot take your medications
Your breathing is rapid and you need to be placed on a ventilator
Your temperature is lower than normal
Your pulse is abnormally fast (over 100) or abnormally low (under 50)

, Newborns and children under two are most likely to need hospitalization. Severe symptoms in children that indicate that they need emergency care even after starting treatment include:Having trouble staying awake
Breathing difficulties
Insufficient oxygen in the blood
Dehydration
A low body temperature

Be cautious around the holiday season.",How to Cope With Scent Sensitivity," It can be helpful to know what kind of scents bother you. If a particular brand of perfume or laundry detergent causes an adverse reaction, you should know so you can avoid that brand in the future. Keep a journal chronicling when and where you have a bad reaction to a smell.


It may be hard to identify the precise trigger every time, but try to notice when symptoms arise. Jot down any probable cause, from scents from outdoors to household products.
Take your journal with you to work or social events. Such places can sometimes be ripe with unwanted scents that may trigger a reaction.
Keeping your journal in a ""notes"" section on your smartphone can make it easy to;
, There are certain events where you may be exposed to a lot of unwanted scents. During formal parties, for example, many people may be wearing perfumes or colognes. Prepare as much as you can before these events. If you find such events are particularly harsh on your sensitivity, consider sitting them out.


If you're on any medications that help with your sensitivity, bring these to parties.
You may want to stay close any open windows during these kinds of events.
Try occasionally stepping outside if a smell is bothering you.

, One of the best means to minimize reactions is to keep your exposure low. This is especially important if your reactions are intense. Try to stay away from scents that bother you.Avoid stores where there are heavy odors, such as department stores that use a lot of chemical cleaners.
If you notice a product you use at home, like a cleaner, is bothering your sensitivity, cease use immediately.
Ask your household members to minimize their own use of scented products.

, Scent sensitivity is sometimes caused by an allergic reaction. If your body is in a weakened state due to illness, your allergies will be more acute. It's a good idea to get a flu shot during cold and flu season.Talk to your doctor before getting a flu shot to make sure the shot is safe for you given your medical history and any existing medical conditions.

, A fan or an air purifier may help rid your home of unwanted scents. You can purchase such items online or at a local department store. See if symptoms improve by placing some fans and air purifiers in your home.

, If you suffer from scent sensitivity, it's a good idea to talk to a doctor. Scent sensitivity is not just an inconvenience. It's a legitimate medical condition. It's well-documented that many people react with allergic reactions such as rashes in response to certain fragrance. While most people must have direct physical contact with a fragrance containing substance, some people's scent sensitivity is so severe they may break out into rashes just from inhaling a smell.Part of your medical evaluation may include blood work, urinalysis, pulmonary function testing, and evaluation for mood disorders (such as depression and/or anxiety).
A simple patch test can be used to diagnose an allergy to a specific scent. Patches containing a potential irritant will be placed on your skin. After 48 hours, your doctor will remove such patches and examine your skin for a reaction.
If you do have an allergy, your doctor can help you come up with an action plan for treatment. They may recommend medications or lifestyle changes that help you cope with scent sensitivity.

, Perfumes, scented lotions, and scented laundry detergents are popular with many. People who use such products, however, may not realize the effect certain scents have on others. Work to educate friends, family members, and co-workers on scent sensitivity. Let them know what they can do to help you deal.Be courteous as you talk to others about your sensitivity. Many people have not heard or scent sensitivity, and may be confused as to what it is. Have patience and explain yourself slowly.
If you have an official doctor's diagnosis, it can be helpful to let people know what precise condition is causing your sensitivity. For example, you may have an allergy to a particular chemical that's commonly used in scented products.
You can also refer people to outside resources. If you know a website that discusses scent sensitivity, advise people to check out that site.

, Scent sensitivity can be a real problem at work, school, or elsewhere. If you live or work with others who use a lot of scented products, politely talk to them about your issues. You can respectfully request that they minimize use of certain products near you.Try to approach people in a friendly fashion. People don't want to feel like they're being scolded. For example, you can approach a co-worker and say something like, ""Clara, I wanted to ask you about something. As you know, I have a scent sensitivity. If you could leave your scented lotion at home, I would really appreciate that as the smell can trigger asthma attacks. I don't want you to feel bad, and I'm sorry if it's an inconvenience, but I just want to be able to work effectively.""
If unwanted scents are a major issue at work, talk to your boss. There may be a policy in place in your office regarding the use of potential allergens.

, Many people will take your request to cut back on scented products as a personal judgment. A significant other may, for example, think you dislike the smell of their perfume and are trying to be polite. Calmly explain the issue is not personal, but it's a medical concern.


Make sure the other person knows it's about the scent's effect on you. You can say something like, ""It has nothing to do with you. I get allergy attacks walking by Bath and Body Works in the mall sometimes.""
Reassure the other person there are no hard feelings. You simply do not want to be routinely exposed to an allergen.

, If your scent sensitivity is causing problems at work, talk to your boss. You may be able to get them to accommodate your needs with a better work environment. You could request an air purifier in your office, for example, or a cubicle near a window.

, A more flexible schedule can also help you cope with scent sensitivity. Schedule a meeting with your boss and explain the issue you're having. Ask him or her if a flexible schedule would be possible to accommodate your needs.There are a variety of ways a flexible schedule can help you cope with scent sensitivity. You could work from home certain days or Skype into meetings.
You could also come into work earlier or later some days, minimizing the time you spend with other coworkers who may use products that trigger your sensitivity.

, If you have a scent sensitivity, it's a good idea to use lotions, laundry detergents, and other products that are fragrance-free; however, be careful when choosing products. You want to make sure you are getting a product that truly lacks the chemicals that can trigger allergic reactions for people with a scent sensitivity.If a product is labeled ""fragrance-free,"" this means it does not contain any chemicals or compounds known to trigger allergic reactions.
If a product is labeled ""unscented,"" it may contain compounds and chemicals that contain potential allergens even if the product itself lacks a smell.

, Certain chemicals are likely to affect scent sensitivity. When purchasing a product, scan the label for the following chemicals:Acetone
Alpha-Pinene
Alpha-Terpineol
Benzyl Acetate
Benzyl Alcohol
Benzaldehyde
Camphor
Ethanol
Ethyl Acetate
g-Terpinine
Limonene
Linalool

, Scented candles are best avoided if you have a scent sensitivity. They often contain chemicals that can trigger an allergic reaction. Do not use scented candles in your home, or air fresheners that contain similar chemicals. If you want to freshen up the smell of your house, try bringing flowers in from outdoors. Natural scents may be less likely to bother your sensitivity., Smells can be a huge problem around the holiday season. Artificial scents and natural scents are present during this time of year. Work on minimizing your exposure to cope.It may be better to use an artificial tree, as pollen from natural trees can cause allergic reactions. Go for a tree that is fragrance-free.
If you're invited to parties, politely let the hosts know that you have a scent sensitivity. Inform them what they can do to help, such as avoiding lighting scented candles.
Take precautions when going shopping around Christmas, as stores may use a lot of artificial scents during the Christmas season. You may want to bring any medication a doctor has prescribed for your sensitivity with you when shopping.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Immobilize your arm.,
Ice your shoulder.,
Take pain medications.,
Relocate your shoulder only in emergency situations.,
Ask for help in an emergency situation.,
Lay on your back and abduct your arm.,
See a doctor as soon as you can.,
Prepare yourself for the possibility of surgery.,
Rehabilitate your shoulder.",How to Fix a Dislocated Shoulder," A dislocated shoulder is usually caused by either falling onto an outstretched arm or the shoulder being impacted from behind. The injury causes sudden and severe pain, preceded by a popping feeling and/or sound. The shoulder will look visibly deformed or out-of-place, and swelling and bruising appear quickly.Moving the shoulder is not possible until it is relocated.


A dislocated shoulder hangs lower than the uninjured side and you can usually see a depression or groove in the lateral (deltoid) muscle of the shoulder.
A shoulder dislocation may also cause numbness, tingling and/or weakness down the arm and into the hand. If blood vessels are damaged, the lower arm and hand on the injured side will feel cold and turn a bluish color.
About 25% of first-time shoulder dislocations involve fractures of the upper arm (humerus) or shoulder girdle.;
, While you're waiting to get medical attention, it's important to not move (or attempt to move) a dislocated shoulder because you may make the injury worse. A bone fracture, damaged nerve or ripped blood vessel may be involved, so any movement could have dire consequences. Instead, bend your elbow, wrap your forearm around your stomach area and hold it in position with a sling.If you don't have access to a ready-made sling, then make one from a pillow case or article of clothing. Put the sling under your elbow/forearm and tie the ends around your neck. Slings immobilize and protect the shoulder from further injury, and often greatly reduce the degree of pain.
About 95% of shoulder dislocations are in the anterior direction, which means the upper arm bone (humerus) is pushed forward out of its socket., Getting ice or something cold onto a dislocated shoulder joint as soon as possible is important in order to inhibit inflammation, which usually translates into less pain.Ice causes small blood vessels to constrict (narrow), which limits the amount of blood and inflammation that can flow into and around the injured area. Apply the crushed ice to the shoulder for about 15 – 20 minutes at a time (or until the area feels numb) every hour or so.


Always wrap ice in a thin cloth, towel or plastic bag before applying it to bare skin — it'll help prevent frostbite or skin irritation.
If you don't have access to crushed ice or ice cubes, then use some frozen veggies from the freezer or a frozen gel pack.

, Once the dislocated shoulder is immobilized and covered in a bag of ice, consider taking some over-the-counter medication to further combat the inflammation and pain. The pain from a dislocated shoulder is often described as almost unbearable due to all the stretched and/or torn ligaments, tendons and muscles that occur, in addition to potential bone fractures and cracked cartilage. Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) are likely the best choices because they are strong anti-inflammatories, although acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be helpful for pain control also.For a dislocated shoulder that also involves significant internal bleeding (you'll see lots of bruising), avoid ibuprofen and naproxen because they tend to ""thin"" the blood and reduce its clotting ability.
A muscle relaxant medication might also be indicated if the muscles around the dislocated joint are spasming. However, never mix different types of drugs concurrently — pick one or the other.

, Under most situations, waiting for professional medical help is the best idea and certainly the safest way to go, but sometimes that's not possible. If you're in an isolated situation far from medical attention (camping, mountain climbing, traveling abroad), the potential risks of fixing your own shoulder — or that of a friend or family member — may not outweigh the benefits of experiencing immediate pain relief and increased arm/shoulder mobility.


As a general rule of thumb, if you can get medical assistance within 12 hours, then wait patiently and try to reduce the discomfort with ice, painkillers and a sling. If a much longer waiting time is apparent, particularly if you need some mobility in your shoulder to get to a hospital, then relocating your shoulder might be considered.
The main complications related to trying to relocate your own shoulder are: further tearing muscles, ligaments and tendons; damaging nerves and blood vessels; life-threatening bleeding; severe pain that results in loss of consciousness., If you're forced to consider relocating your own shoulder in an emergency situation, then realize that putting it back in without assistance is nearly impossible. As such, ask for help or offer to help someone else if in an emergency situation. People may be reluctant to help you because they don't want to cause you more pain or risk injuring your shoulder more, so try to reassure them and release them from any liability.


If you're needed to help someone else relocate his shoulder, make sure to get his consent and tell him clearly about your lack of medical training (if applicable). You don't want to face any litigation for trying to be helpful if things go wrong.If you have a phone and can make a call, try contacting emergency services for advice and support. Even if they can't send medical personnel to you right away, they may be able to offer helpful instructions.

, Probably the easiest way for non-professionals to relocate your shoulder joint is if you lay flat on your back with your injured arm away from your body at a 90 degree angle. Then get your friend or a bystander to firmly grab your hand or wrist and slowly (but firmly) pull on your arm, which will create traction. The person may have to position her feet against your torso for additional leverage. Pulling the arm at that angle allows the head of the humerus to slide under the bone of your shoulder blade and back into its socket with relative ease.Remember to use a slow, steady pull (without any fast or jerky movements) directly away from the body until the shoulder re-articulates. If it successful, you will hear a ""clunk"" and feel the shoulder get back into position.
As soon as the shoulder relocates, the level of pain associated with the injury will reduce significantly. However, the shoulder will still be unstable, so make a sling and immobilize the arm if possible.

, Getting to a doctor (or an appropriately trained medical professional) quickly is important when dealing with a dislocated shoulder because when the muscles, tendons and ligaments around the injury tighten up, the head of the humerus becomes very difficult to relocate without surgical intervention. Most doctors will likely want to x-ray your shoulder area before doing anything else in order to rule out a fracture.If nothing is broken or badly torn, then the doctor can perform a closed reduction maneuver on the shoulder joint, although you may need a sedative, strong muscle relaxant or general anesthetic before the physical manipulation can be done due to the severe pain.
A common reduction method for the shoulder joint is called the Hennepin maneuver, which utilizes external rotation of the shoulder.While laying flat, the doctor will flex your elbow to 90 degrees and gradually rotate your shoulder outward (external rotation). Some gentle pushing while in this position is usually enough for the joint to relocate.
There are a handful of other reduction techniques that doctors use — it depends on what they feel comfortable with.

, If your shoulder is regularly dislocating (due to a bone deformity or ligament laxity), or if any bones are fractured or nerves and/or blood vessels ripped, then you'll need surgery to repair the damage and have the shoulder joint reduced openly.Surgery is sometimes the best option because it can fix internal damage and stabilize the joint, which greatly reduces the risk of dislocation in the future.


There are many different surgical procedures that are performed, so it depends on the extent of the damage and the patient's lifestyle/activity level as to which technique is used.
Some studies suggest that surgical ""open"" reduction may be the best course of action for active adults younger than 30 years due to lower recurrence rates and better quality of life outcomes., Regardless if you get a closed manual reduction or an open surgical reduction, you should get a referral for physiotherapy and strengthen your shoulder joint.Physical therapists, chiropractors and/or athletic therapists can show you specific stretches to regain full mobility and range of motion in your shoulder, as well as exercises that strengthen and tighten the joint so that it's unlikely to dislocate in the future.


It often takes two to four weeks of recovery before a referral to physical therapy is appropriate. Wearing a sling, applying ice and taking over-the-counter medications is all part of the recovery phase.The total time to rehabilitate and recover from a shoulder dislocation ranges from three to six months, depending on the severity of injury and if the patient is an athlete or not."

Liquid can help soften mucus, making it easier to expel from the body.Try to drink about eight glasses of water daily. If you're struggling with a sore throat, you may want to increase your water intake slightly. Seltzer water may help with a scratchy throat.Try to stay away from fruit juices and soda. The added sugar can cause additional throat irritation. If you want something other than water to drink, go for sports drinks or fresh squeezed juices that use only natural sugar.There is a belief that milk and dairy products increase phlegm production, but there is no scientific evidence that this is true.They may cause the phlegm to be thicker and more irritating to your throat, but frozen dairy products can also be soothing and a good source of calories when you may not be eating because it is difficult to swallow.;
, Honey and lemon both help soothe the throat. Try adding a squeeze of lemon juice and a teaspoon to a glass of ice water or tea. Not only can this help clear phlegm, it may also ease any pain or irritation you are experiencing.

, Spicy foods can sometimes result in phlegm loosening. This can make it easier to remove via blowing your nose, coughing, and sneezing. Chile, peppers, wasabi, horseradish, and other spicy foods can help clear your throat., Some people find herbal teas help soothe the throat. Try a variety of teas and see if you notice any effect on your throat.


Chamomile, ginger, and lemon teas are most frequently cited as helping with congestion.Some people find green tea is soothing for your throat. Try adding honey or lemon to green tea for added effect., Certain foods are good for the voice and help promote a clear throat. Whole grains, fruit, and vegetables contain vitamins A, E, and C which help keep the throat free of mucus. If you have a sore or strained throat, try eating softer foods until the irritation clears., Mucus thinning medications like guaifenesin (Mucinex) can help reduce phlegm that causes coughing and throat irritation. If you're looking to clear your throat, look for such medications at your local supermarket or pharmacy. Take the meds as directed on the container. If you're concerned about over-the-counter medication interacting with any prescription meds you're on, talk to your doctor or pharmacist., Saline sprays and nasal drips can be purchased over-the-counter at your local drug store. They tend to be fairly effective in clearing out phlegm and other irritants that cause throat irritation.If you're using a spray or drops, use as directed on the container. Ask a doctor or pharmacist if you have any additional questions.If you're using a nasal irrigation system that requires squirting water into the nose, always use sterile water. Microorganism found in tap water can get into the brain through the nose, causing health problems and even death., Over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen can ease pain caused by a sore throat. This can reduce symptoms like coughing and wheezing, which can make a clogged throat worse. As always, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about the medication., If you smoke, you should make an effort to quit. Smoking is bad for your overall health. It can make you more susceptible to throat infections such as bronchitis and strep throat. It can also cause overall damage to the throat and vocal cords, resulting in discomfort and congestion. Talk to your doctor about quitting smoking.Smoking also predisposes a person to carcinogens which can lead cancer.

, Oftentimes, a dry environment can result in throat irritation. Consider purchasing a humidifier if you live in a dry area. Turning a humidifier on during the day or overnight can increase moisture in your home, reducing throat irritation., If you're prone to frequent throat irritation, evaluate how you speak. Straining your voice can cause a sore throat, resulting in the build up of phlegm.If you have throat irritation, try to avoid coughing. Too much coughing can actually make an infection worse. If necessary, take over-the-counter cough suppressants or lozenges to ease irritation that leads to coughing.Avoid screaming, shouting, or cheering. If you work in a field that requires you to talk loudly, make an effort to rest your voice at the end of the day. Speak softly and try not to raise your voice., Coughing, wheezing, and otherwise attempting to clear your throat can sometimes provide momentary relief. However, if you engage in these behaviors too frequently when you have a sore throat this can cause irritation. This could potentially increase the duration of symptoms. If you feel tempted to clear your throat, consider purchasing over-the-counter cough drops or lozenges at the drugstore to provide some relief.

, Alcohol and caffeine can both increase dehydration, leading to a dry and irritated throat. Try to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages or alcohol in excess. For men, limit your alcohol intake to two drinks a night. For women, try to stay around one drink., A sore or congested throat is not usually a medical concern and should clear up on its own. However, if you remain congested for more than two weeks see your doctor to rule out an underlying medical condition.


Keep in mind that a sore throat and congestion are two separate symptoms that can result in worsening of each individual symptom. Congestion refers to nasal areas and sinus swelling increasing stuffy sensation, while a sore throat refers to pain in the throat. Post nasal drip and cough can worsen sore throats.

This is because symptoms of COPD often don’t appear until significant lung damage has already occurred.The best course of action is to seek medical care if you are a long-term smoker or in a high risk group.


COPD symptoms are often ignored because they start gradually and progress over time. COPD sufferers also tend to modify their lifestyle, such as becoming less active, to minimize and disguise shortness of breath instead of getting diagnosed.
You should seek immediate medical attention if you are in a high risk group and are also experiencing symptoms such as chronic cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.;
, Once you know if you are at risk for COPD, you can start looking for the symptoms. They start out mild but increase in severity as the disease progresses. Watch for excessive coughing, which is usually worse in the mornings, which may persist for months or years. It may produce a small of amount of clear or yellow mucus. COPD leads to increased mucus production.


Smoking paralyzes the cilia, or small hairs, in the airways. This reduces the amount of mucus that is cleared from the lungs and causes further coughing as a mechanism to clear this increased mucus. The sticky and thick consistency of mucus also makes it harder to clear., Another major symptom of COPD is shortness of breath, especially during physical activities. Shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing (dyspnea), may be the most significant symptom of COPD. This is because coughing can be caused by many other things while shortness of breath is a rarer symptom. It presents itself as a kind of air hunger, or gasping, that worsens as the disease progresses.


You may also start to notice a shortness of breath at rest or without much activity. In these cases, supplemental oxygen may be needed as the disease progresses., As part of COPD, you may experience wheezing. Wheezing is when you make high-pitched, whistling sounds while breathing. It occurs in some people with COPD, particularly during physical exertion or when there are episodes of worsened symptoms. These abnormal breath sounds are heard best during exhalations, or when breathing out.


Bronchoconstriction, a decrease in the diameter of or mucus blockage in the airways, produces this characteristic lung sound., As COPD progresses, you may develop a barrel chest. A barrel chest may be evident upon visual examination of the chest. It represents the over-inflation of the lungs, which cause the ribs to expand to accommodate the excess air and leads to the chest resembling the shape of a barrel.


You may also experience chest tightness, which includes any type of pain or discomfort occurring between the upper belly and lower neck areas. Although it can signal multiple disorders, chest tightness in combination with cough and wheezing is indicative of COPD. , There are a few physical changes that you may recognize as COPD progresses. You may develop cyanosis, which refers to the blue discoloration of the lips or fingernail beds. It represents low levels of oxygen in the blood, which is referred to as hypoxemia. Hypoxemia may be a late consequence of COPD and usually requires treatment with supplemental oxygen.


You also may notice unintended weight loss, which is usually present only in advanced stages of COPD. As COPD progresses, it requires larger and larger amounts of energy to breathe. COPD robs the body of vital calories that should be going toward the maintenance of the body. You may also have swelling of your feet and legs or the veins in your neck if you have had COPD for a long time.

, When you see your doctor for diagnosis, he will start with a lung function test. Spirometry, the most common lung function test, is a simple, non-invasive test that measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. Spirometry has the ability to detect COPD before the development of lung symptoms, can be used to track disease progression, and can monitor the effectiveness of your treatment.Spirometry can be used to stage, or measure of the extent, of COPD. Stage 1 is mild COPD, where Forced Expired Volume in 1 second (FEV1) >80% of predicted. At this stage, the individual may not be aware that lung function is abnormal.
Stage 2, which is moderate COPD, has a FEV1 of 50-79%. This is the stage at which most seek medical attention for their symptoms.
Stage 3, which is severe COPD, has a FEV1 of 30-49%. The final stage, stage 4, is very severe COPD and has a FEV1 <30%. At this stage, quality of life is very impaired and symptom episodes may be life-threatening.
These staging systems have limited value in predicting death from COPD.In addition, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as blood tests, cultures of your sputum, pulse oximetry, tests of your heart, or a test of your lung function while walking.

, Your doctor may also perform a CXR. These are usually abnormal in severe COPD, but may not show changes in up to 50% of those with a moderate form of the disease. Characteristic findings from CXR include hyperinflation of the lungs, flattening of the domes of the diaphragm, and tapering of the pulmonary vessels as they move to the periphery of the lung fields.CXR can document emphysema and can also be utilized to rule out other lung problems or heart failure., Another method of diagnosis of COPD is a CT scan of your chest. A CT scan may be helpful in detecting emphysema and may also be helpful in determining if you would benefit from surgery for COPD. Doctors also use CT scans as a method of lung cancer screening, though it has not been uniformly adopted in medicine.A CT scan of the chest should not be used routinely to diagnose COPD unless other methods are used as well., Your doctor may want to analyze your ABG levels. An ABG analysis is a blood test that measures the oxygen level in your blood using a sample of blood taken from an artery. The results of this test can show the severity of your COPD and how it is affecting you.


ABG analysis can also be used to determine if you need oxygen therapy., COPD includes two main conditions: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. There is a short-term type of bronchitis, but chronic bronchitis is one of the major diseases that make up COPD. Chronic bronchitis is noted by the documentation of a productive cough being present for at least three months out of a year for two consecutive years. Chronic bronchitis causes inflammation and increased mucus production in the bronchial tubes, or the airways that carry air to our lungs. The process can block airways and make it difficult to breathe.Emphysema, the other major disease under the COPD term, is characterized by an enlargement of alveoli, or air sacs, in the lungs and the destruction of the walls of these air sacs. This disease will eventually lead to decreased gas exchange in the lungs, making it harder to breathe., COPD is caused by long-term exposure to irritants that damage the lungs. Smoking tobacco is by far the most common cause of COPD. Breathing in secondhand smoke and air pollution can also contribute to the development of COPD.


Cigar, pipe, and marijuana smokers are also at increased risk of developing COPD.
Secondhand smoke represents the smoke in the air as a result of other people smoking.People with asthma, especially if they smoke, are at higher risk of developing COPD.
There are other rare medical conditions, especially connective tissue disorders, that are associated with COPD. This includes an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a specific protein that protects the lungs, as well as several others such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. , You are at risk of COPD if you have had excessive occupational exposure to dust and chemical fumes and gases. Long-term exposure to these in the workplace can irritate and inflame the lungs. Dust from materials such as wood, cotton, coal, asbestos, silica, talc, cereal grains, coffee, pesticides, drug or enzyme powders, metals, and fiberglass can damage the lungs and lead to an increased risk of COPD.


Fumes from metals and other substances can also increase risk of developing COPD. These jobs include welding, smelting, furnace work, pottery making, plastics manufacture, and rubber operations.
Exposure to gases such as formaldehyde, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen oxide can also increase risk of developing COPD."

Quit smoking.,
Avoid all contact with secondhand smoke.,
Avoid exposure to outdoor air pollution.,
Eliminate exposure to indoor air pollution.,
Eliminate occupational exposure to carcinogens and pollutants.,
Avoid inhaling other irritants.",How to Take Good Care of Your Lungs1," The single best thing you can do for your lungs is to quit smoking or (better yet) never start. Cigarette smoking in particular is a major cause of lung cancer and COPD. Smokers have a 20 times higher risk of developing lung cancer and COPD than non-smokers.Lung cancer is when cells grow out of control and form tumors in the lungs. These tumors interfere with normal lung functioning, such as breathing. If the cancer metastasizes, then it may affect other organs and tissues, such as the breasts.COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) causes excess mucus, difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. This disease worsens over time.While cigarette smoking receives the most negative attention, keep in mind that no form of smoking is safe. You should also avoid pipes, cigars, marijuana smoking, etc.;
, While not smoking is a great start, you should also avoid all contact with sources or secondhand smoke, such as in bars, casinos, and other socially acceptable environments for smoking. Nonsmokers who frequently inhale secondhand smoke have a 20 percent higher risk of developing lung cancer than nonsmokers who never encounter it.Though studies are new, many experts believe that people, especially babies and children, should also stay away from third hand smoke. This is the residual toxins and chemical compounds that stick to clothing, hair, carpet, walls, etc. even after a cigarette has been extinguished.The lingering smell of a cigarette even after cigarette smoke has dissipated is the telltale sign of secondhand smoke.

, While avoiding all exposure to carbon dioxide and other common air pollutants is virtually impossible, you can take steps to reduce your exposure. AirNow is a government-run website that provides realtime updates regarding air quality all across the United States.You can check this to determine the air quality in your city before planning to spend time outside.


Ozone is another common air pollutant, and stagnant summertime weather systems can often trap ozone and other pollutants around a city. Be especially aware of the air quality in your area from late spring into the warmest summer months due to this phenomenon., Air pollution isn’t just an outdoor concern. Fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, pet dander, and mold are all common sources of indoor air pollution.By eliminating these sources, cleaning regularly, and changing the air filters in your home often, you can reduce indoor air pollution considerably.


Consider getting an air purifier for your home to help filter out indoor air pollution, such as smoke, mold, and pet dander.
Chemicals from home cleaning supplies, paint, and other common household items can also irritate your lungs or trigger conditions such as asthma. Always carefully read and follow the instructions for using these products in areas with proper ventilation.
You can find more information on improving the indoor air quality in your home via the EPA.
Radon is a naturally occurring element present in some homes that effects indoor air quality. It is associated with increased risks of lung cancer.You can find radon detectors at most home improvement stores if you want to test the levels present in your own home.

, Many of those who work in mining, labs, or industrial settings commonly come into contact with large quantities of carcinogenic (cancer-causing) chemicals and other pollutants. Always take the proper workplace precautions in situations that call for respirators, fume hoods, and other safety devices.


Asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium are just a few of the workplace chemicals associated with lung cancer and other lung complications.Lung cancer and COPD may also develop as a result of exposure to these substances.

, Human lungs simply aren’t meant to inhale a wide array of substances. Cover your mouth and nose whenever you’re working with or in the same space as any small particles you may potentially inhale. Additionally, never suppress a cough in the presence of a foreign substance since this is your body’s way of expelling it. These particles include:


Talcum or baby powder: these have microscopic crushed rocks that become trapped in your lungs. Use a corn starch-based baby powder instead.
Fiberglass: Fiberglass can make tiny cuts in your lungs if inhaled.

Breathe deeply more often.,
Laugh more.,
Get regular cardio.,
Make dietary changes.,
Breathe through your nose.,
Keep your nose clear.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take medication if you have a lung condition.,
Stay current on your vaccinations.",How to Take Good Care of Your Lungs2," The act of breathing supplies oxygen to your entire body. Breathing deeply uses the entire capacity of your lungs to oxygenate blood. Though normal breathing levels aren’t unhealthy, deep breathing reaches the peak level of oxygen flowing through your body.Pay special attention to your diaphragm while slowly inhaling and exhaling full deep breaths. Feel your diaphragm lowering while you inhale and exhale fully until you feel your stomach muscles tighten and your diaphragm lift., Like deep breathing, laughing forces more air out of your lungs, which leads to a greater inhalation of fresh air and a higher supply of oxygenated blood.Laughing also works abdominal muscles and increases lung capacity.

, Aerobic exercise doesn’t necessarily make your lungs stronger on its own. However, great cardio-respiratory fitness makes it easier for your lungs to supply your heart and muscles with oxygen.This puts less strain on your lungs, allowing them to function properly with less work.


The American Heart Association recommends at least thirty minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise five days a week or more in order to maintain good cardiovascular health., Studies have shown that diets rich in fresh fruit and fish are associated with benefits to lung health.This is especially the case with those who experience asthma, COPD, and other common lung diseases.A 2010 study also showed that a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, bok choy) can decrease the risk of lung cancer., The hairs in your nose act as a filter and only let extremely fine particles through. Your nose can filter particles as small as a single grain of pollen with 100 percent efficiency.This makes breathing through your nose a much better option than breathing through your mouth.

, Sickness, allergies, and other conditions can all lead to common nasal congestion. A plugged nose means you’re pulling 100 percent of germs and pollution directly into your lungs by breathing through your mouth.This can exacerbate conditions such as asthma and other lung complications or even cause them in those who don’t already suffer from them.Treat common allergies with antihistamines or other decongestants to help keep your nose clear.Additionally, overly dry nasal passages that can accompany sickness make nose hairs less effective at filtering air. Consider using a humidifier or even an over-the-counter nasal mist to keep your nasal passage moist and properly filtering the air you breathe., In addition to its myriad other positive effects, drinking plenty of water is good for your lungs. You lungs have a mucosal lining, and staying hydrated keep the lining thin, which helps your lungs function more efficiently., If you have asthma or another respiratory condition, ensure you see your doctor for regular exams to help control the condition. Albuterol, a prescription bronchodilator, works well to help with asthma symptoms, for instance.

, Yearly flu vaccines and pneumococcal vaccinations can help lower the risk of respiratory infections.This also means less risk of developing associated lung complications such as pneumonia.


Smokers between the ages of 19 and 65 should get a pneumococcus vaccination. Also, anyone with chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, alcoholism, chronic liver disease, or who is over the age of 65 should get the pneumococcus vaccination.

Buy houseplants.,
Use an air purifier.,
Avoid high traffic areas.",How to Take Good Care of Your Lungs3," Houseplants are one of the easiest ways to improve indoor air quality. In addition to converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, studies have also shown that houseplants can reduce the indoor concentration of ozone, which is another harmful pollutant.Three common houseplants that studies have proven beneficial include snake plants, spider plants, and golden pothos., A filter purifier for the air in your home can help remove dust, smoke, and other pollutants. Air filters, electronic particle cleaners, and ionizers are all common forms of indoor air purification systems.Beware of brands that claim they create ozone in order to purify indoor air. Ozone a leading pollutant, especially during calm summer months, and these models can create harmful amounts of ozone while cleaning other particles from indoor air., Especially for those who live in big cities, it’s common to run or bike along busy, congested streets while exercising. The abundance of vehicle exhaust and other pollutants in these areas can damage your lungs, especially given that you tend to breathe through your mouth during vigorous exercise, which bypasses the natural filtration you get through your nostrils.You can also check the EPA’s nationwide air pollution forecast for your area here to determine the air quality in your area.

Practice controlled breathing.,
Use a controlled coughing technique.,
Have someone pat your back firmly.",How to Clear Your Lungs Before Running1," Controlled breathing, as the name suggests, is when you deepen your breathing in order to clear out any phlegm that may be in your lungs.To perform controlled breathing:


Take two to three big breaths. Try to inhale as much air as you possibly can, and then exhale as much as you possibly can. Taking these deep breaths will help to get air behind the phlegm so that you can spit it out later.
Take four or five regular breaths, and then two or three more deep breaths. Repeat this step once more, switching between regular breaths and then deep breaths.
After your last set of deep breaths, begin making huffing motions, as if you are trying to clear your lungs (which you are).
Take two to three regular breaths, and then try to cough up the rest of the phlegm.
Repeat this whole procedure as needed or until you feel your lungs are cleared.;
, Coughing is the body’s natural way of eliminating secretions from the lungs.You can still easily perform this coughing technique when you are already running. To perform controlled coughs:


Find a chair or bench where you can sit. Lean forward with your arms placed across your stomach. Leaning forward promotes maximum lung expansion.
Take one deep breath and hold it for three seconds. As you breathe in, you should feel your stomach getting bigger against your arms.
Open your mouth slightly and make short and sharp coughs. While doing this, exert pressure on your diaphragm by pushing your arms against your stomach in an upward motion.
Inhale through your nose in a gentle and slow manner. Inhaling in this way will help to keep secretions from going back into your lungs.
Spit out the secretion.

, When someone pats your back, it can help to loosen up the phlegm in your lungs. Ask someone to perform the following:


Have the person place his hands in a cup shape. Have him tap your back while his hands are in the cup shape. Start from the middle of the back and move upwards.
This motion can help loosen the phlegm and cause it to be excreted through the mouth.

Ask your doctor how much it will hurt.,
Plan to eat cold, tasty treats afterwards.,
Plan quiet activities for afterwards.,
Talk to your parents about your worries.,
Use relaxation techniques.",How to Cope Before Having Your Tonsils Taken Out1," Many children have their tonsils out to prevent them from getting infected. While it is scary and uncomfortable, after you heal you will probably be sick much less often.Your doctor will tell you and your parents about what medications you will get to make you sleep during the operation. When you wake up it will be over.
You will also get medications to prevent it from hurting a lot afterwards while it heals.;
, After the surgery eating cold, soft foods will help soothe the wound as it heals. You can ask your parents to stock up on things like:Ice cream
Popsicles
Pudding
Applesauce
Juice
Yogurt

, Most people who get their tonsils out do not need to stay overnight in the hospital. But even when you are at home, you should stay in bed for a few days. After that you will need to play quietly for about two weeks. Activities to plan include:Getting movies to watch
Finding new books to read
Playing computer games
Doing arts and crafts

, If you have things you are afraid of, they will be able to help explain what the doctor said. They will be able to comfort you and tell you that they will be waiting for you when you wake up after the surgery.


Many adults also had their tonsils out when they were children. Ask your parents what their experiences were.

, These procedures help you get control of your thoughts. This can help you to stop worrying and feeling panicky. These are some easy methods that you can use when you have a few quiet minutes:Deep breathing. During this technique you focus on breathing slowly and deeply. This makes you slow down and fully inflate your lungs. Focusing on it will help you to clear your mind. It is also sometimes called belly breathing because your belly moves as you breathe. When you breathe shallowly, your chest moves.

Meditation. To meditate, you sit in a comfortable position in a peaceful location. You can also do it while lying in your bed at night. Then try to clear your mind so that you are not thinking or worrying about anything. Sometimes it can help to repeat a word or phrase to yourself over and over again until you feel yourself relaxing.

Visualizing calming images. This is another meditation technique in which you image a calm place like a beach. In your mind you explore the beach and experience it with all your senses including how sounds, what it feels like, and what it smells like. As you focus on this, you should start to feel calmer.

Use peppermint to clear your lungs before you go running.,
Drink plenty of water before and after running.,
Up your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C is known to prevent lung spasms associated with coughing and can also help to improve lung function.,
Consume vitamin A.",How to Clear Your Lungs Before Running2," Rub peppermint oil or vapor onto your chest to help loosen the phlegm in your lungs. Peppermint is effective against phlegm because it contains menthol, which acts as a decongestant.Peppermint is also considered a ketone, which helps to dissolve mucus.You can also drink peppermint tea, or inhale steam that is infused with peppermint oil.

, Rehydrate yourself to liquefy sputum or secretions.Water can also help to reduce the stickiness of the secretions in your lungs, making them easier to cough up.


Try to take sips of water frequently throughout the day. The amount of water each person needs to stay hydrated differs from person to person. However, an average adult male generally needs 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water, while the average adult female generally needs 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water.
Drink very cold water if you are experiencing an unproductive cough (where no phlegm is coughed up). The cold water can help to calm your cough. When you have an unproductive cough, the cough can irritate your throat, rather than helping to clear your lungs.

, Lime is a good source of vitamin C. Add lime juice to the water that you drink.


Other foods that contain vitamin C are peppers, guava, dark leafy vegetables, kiwi, broccoli, berries, citrus fruits, tomatoes, peas and papaya.

, One of the functions of vitamin A is to help repair and rebuild your internal mucous membrane, which in turn can help to strengthen your lungs. Carrot juice is rich in beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in your body.


Other foods that are high in Vitamin A are sweet potatoes, dark leafy vegetables, squash, lettuce, dried apricots, cantaloupe melons, red peppers, tuna fish, oysters and mangoes.

Know when to contact your doctor.",How to Clear Your Lungs Before Running3," This type of drug will help loosen the congestion in your lungs, chest and throat.This helps to facilitate easy elimination of the secretions in your lungs.


The most common generic expectorant is guaifenesin. You can take this drug as part of your running preparation.
The immediate release formulation dosage is 200 to 400 mg by mouth every four hours, or as needed. If you take the sustained release formulation, take 600 to 1200 mg by mouth every 12 hours., This is another type of drug that will help you to eliminate the secretions that have built up in your lungs.The main action of this medication is to thin your mucus secretions so that your body can more easily get rid of them. However, this medication can be challenging to take with you on runs, as you need a nebulizer (or inhaler) to take the drug.


Use the nebulizer to inhale 5 to 10 ml of acetylcysteine every four to six hours., Albuterol is inhaled to help increase air flow to the lungs.If you have asthma or exercise-induced asthma, which is triggered by strenuous exercise, your doctor can prescribe you an inhaler. Make sure you aways have this medication with you, especially if you are going for a run or participating in other exercise.Albuterol relaxes the muscles in your airway, which becomes restricted during an attack, and allows air to travel to your lungs as normal., If you experience a constant obstruction in your lungs that affects your ability to run, or other parts of your daily life, you should contact your doctor. Other situations in which you should seek medical help include:


If you cough up blood. This can be a sign of internal bleeding in your respiratory tract. If the blood is bright red, you may have a problem with your upper respiratory tract, while coffee brown blood could mean damage has been down to your lower respiratory tract.
If you are having night sweats or your cough is accompanied by fever for one week. This can be a sign of tuberculosis and other serious medical conditions.
If you have been dealing with this cough for more than six months. This can be a sign of chronic bronchitis.

Your doctor may recommend having them removed if:Your tonsils get infected often. For example, you may need to have them out if you have had more than seven infections in the last year, more than five infections in each of the past two years, or more than three infections in each of the past three years.
Your tonsils are infected and resistant to treatment with antibiotics.
Your tonsils are abscessed. The doctor may first try to drain them, but if that doesn’t work, they may have to be removed.
Your tonsils have become so enlarged that they make it difficult for you to swallow or breathe, particularly while you are sleeping.
You have cancer in your tonsils.
You have frequent bleeding from your tonsils.

, It is important that your doctor know your complete medical history so that he or she can plan your procedure and after-care. Give your doctor a complete list of any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, vitamins, and supplements that you take so the doctor can check to make sure they won’t interact with the anesthesia. You should discuss the following risks with your doctor:A bad reaction to anesthesia. Tell your doctor if you have previously had anesthesia and reacted badly to it. Common reactions include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and sore muscles. Knowing your previous reactions will help the doctor to plan your surgery and make any adjustments necessary to avoid it from happening again.
Swelling. Your tongue and the roof of your mouth may swell after the surgery. If you are worried about this, ask your doctor how you will be monitored during your recovery and how you will be able to notify someone if the swelling is so severe it makes it difficult to breathe.
Bleeding. Occasionally people have significant bleeding during the procedure or after if the scab comes off before it has finished healing. Tell your doctor if you are taking any medications that may thin your blood. This includes over-the-counter medications containing aspirin, which can interfere with your blood's ability to clot. Your doctor will also want to know if you have any bleeding disorders or if any run in your family.
Infections are rare, but they can occur. Ask your doctor what the follow-up procedures will be to verify that you are healing properly. Tell your doctor if you have any allergies to medications, particularly antibiotics.

, Most of the time tonsillectomies are outpatient procedures. This means that you probably won’t need to spend the night in the hospital. You will receive general anesthesia so you won’t be awake during the operation. The doctor will either cut the tonsils out or use an instrument that uses heat, cold, lasers, or sound waves to remove them. The wound will usually be allowed to heal without stitches. Make sure you understand your doctor’s instructions on how to prepare. Your doctor may tell you to:Avoid taking any medications with aspirin for 14 days or more before the operation. Aspirin can increase your risk of bleeding.
Not eat anything after midnight the day before the operation. It is important that you have an empty stomach for the anesthesia.

, Most people require 10 to 14 days to recover. Make sure you give yourself enough time, particularly if you are an adult. Adults recover more slowly than children. There are several things you can organize ahead of time to make your recovery as easy as possible.Arrange ahead of time to have someone drive you to and from the hospital. This is important because beforehand you may be too nervous to drive safely and afterwards you will still be recovering.
Ask your doctor what pain medications you will be able to take. Many people experience pain in their throat, ears, jaw, or neck. Buy a stock of the medications and put them where you can find them easily.
Buy bland, soft foods. Make sure your refrigerator is stocked with things like applesauce, broth, ice cream, and pudding. These foods are less likely to hurt as you swallow them. Avoid crunchy, hard, acidic, or spicy foods which may irritate your wound or injure the sensitive areas as they heal.
Purchase ice pops and store them in the freezer. Getting enough fluids is important, even when it is uncomfortable to swallow. If drinking water is uncomfortable, you may find it easier to suck on ice cubes or popsicles. The cold may help numb your throat.
Clear your schedule. Give yourself time to sleep as much as you can afterwards. Give yourself the space to avoid going near people who are sick, because you are more vulnerable to infections while you are recovering. Don’t go back to work or school until you can eat a normal diet, sleep through the night and are not taking pain medications. Don’t do athletic activities like basketball, soccer, jogging, or biking for 14 days afterwards.

, Your doctor will likely tell you that you should get emergency medical care if you develop any of the following symptoms:Bleeding. Do not worry if you have tiny dried specks of blood in your nose or mouth. If you have fresh bright red blood that indicates active bleeding, go to the emergency room.
A fever of 102°F (38.9°C) or higher.
Dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration include urinating less often, feeling thirsty, feeling weak, having a headache, nausea, dizziness, passing dark or cloudy urine. Children may be dehydrated if they urinate less than three times a day or produce no tears when they cry.
Difficulty breathing. If you snore or breathe loudly, that is ok. But if you struggle to breath, call emergency responders.

, Being sleep deprived makes you less able to withstand stress and more vulnerable to worrying. Getting enough sleep will also help your immune system to be at its most effective.Adults need between seven to nine hours of sleep per night.If you are under stress, you may find you need more.
Try to get extra sleep the night before the surgery so you will be well rested.

, They will provide you with love, distraction, and an ear when you need it. Surgery is a time when you will benefit a lot from getting help from loved ones.If your family and closest friends live far away, you can stay connected with them by email, phone, letters, Skype calls, and social media.

, These methods are designed to help you control your emotions and give you a mental break from the things that are worrying you. Try these different techniques until you find one that works best for you.Self massage

Find a place to position your radon kit.,
Leave the radon-sensitive material in place.,
Collect the test material and mail it away.,
Use an electronic radon monitor instead.,
Hire a professional to test your home.,
Understand the results.,
Do another short-term test if levels are high.,
Get a long-term test done if levels are still high.",How to Test Your Home for Radon (USA)," There are numerous kinds of low-cost “do-it-yourself” radon test kits that you can either buy from a local hardware or home improvement store, or order online.Depending on where you live, you may qualify for reduced price or free kits from state public health department. Be aware that there are two categories of radon air tests: short-term and long-term.


Short-term radon tests are the most common and convenient. They measure radon levels for between two to seven days, depending on the device. Homeowners should use use short-term testing.
Long-term tests measure radon levels for 90 days to one year. These radon tests give results more reflective of seasonal or year-round average radon levels in your home.Long-term testing should be done by professionals.
Whatever radon test kit you get, make sure it meets the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) requirements.;
, Before you can get an accurate sample of the air in your home, you'll need to close all of your exterior doors and all of your windows. Close them at least 12 hours prior to and throughout the testing period, which can be up to seven days with some short-term radon tests.Heating and A/C systems, as well as fans that re-circulate air in your home may be operated while radon testing.However, don't operate fans or other machines that bring in air from the outside — it can contaminate your results.
You shouldn't conduct short-term radon testing during unusually severe storms or when it's really windy outside. Wait for calm weather.

, Your radon test kit should be placed in the lowest level of your home that you spend a significant amount of time in.This could mean the basement level if you frequently use it, or the first floor if you don't use or don't have an underground basement.


Choose a room that you use regularly, such as the living room, playroom, office or bedroom.
Don't set the testing kit up in your kitchen or bathrooms, because humidity and various fumes can affect or contaminate the results.
Whatever room you choose, position the testing kit at least 20 inches (.5 meters) above the floor — use a small sturdy table if need be. Make sure it's away from drafts, high heat, humidity and exterior walls., After reading the instructions, take out the material that's radon sensitive and position it properly for the specified time frame — typically between two to seven days for most short-term kits. Short-term test kits use either special charcoal canisters, liquid scintillation vials or continuous radon monitors that are electronic.Whichever type of material your kit contains, take it out of the package, remove the top(s) to expose it to the air and place it on the table.
If your kit has the liquid scintillation vials, place the two vials about 6 inches (15 cm) apart on the table for best results.

, After the specified time frame is up, put the tops back on either the charcoal canisters or liquid scintillation vials, place them back into their original packaging and reseal it tightly.Once safely resealed, send it via registered mail to the lab specified on the package for analysis.


Make sure to send in your package to the lab shortly after the testing period has ended for the most accurate results. Don't wait much more than a day or two.
You should receive your radon test results from the lab within a few weeks, both by regular mail and via email. With most labs, you can check your results online.
The results may look complicated, but remember that radon in the air is measured in picoCuries per liter of air or pCi/L (see below).

, As noted above, using an electronic radon monitor in your house is an alternative, although they're typically used by testing professionals — and the price reflects this. Electronic radon monitors are placed face-up on a stable table or any flat surface where the ventilation slots on the device are not blocked.Electronic detectors provide a continuous reading of radon levels in your home, which can be easily seen from a digital display.


An advantage of using an electronic radon monitor is you'll be able to read the results immediately after the testing period has expired. No need to send it away to a lab for analysis.
The main disadvantage is the price. Some units cost upwards of $1,000, although they're marketed for professional use.
In most cases, electronic radon detectors are used in conjunction with charcoal and vial methods — it's not meant to replace the more traditional methods.

, As an alternative to doing it yourself, you can hire a qualified radon tester to do the testing for you. Contact your state radon office or email an online training program about getting a list of qualified testers. It will be more expensive than doing it yourself, but you'll have the peace of mind that it's being done correctly and the results interpreted properly.


Long-term radon testing should always be done or monitored by a qualified radon measurement professional.
An advantage of getting your home professionally monitored for radon gas is that the testing team can recommend (or in some cases provide) an experienced crew to fix the problem.
Some radon reduction systems can reduce levels in your home by 99% — even very high levels can be reduced to much safer levels., The amount of radon in the air is measured in picoCuries per liter of air or pCi/L. The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L, whereas about 0.4 pCi/L of radon is typically found in the outside air.According to most health authorities, 4 pCi/L of radon is the cutoff point between acceptable and unsafe.


Short-term testing can be less definitive about whether your home is above 4 pCi/L or not if it's close to that amount — there is a margin of testing error.
Thus, any reading over 3.5 pCi/L should be considered fairly high and reason to do more testing.
It's important to remember that radon isn't safe at any level, so readings below 4 pCi/L still pose some risk of lung cancer and other lung diseases.

, If the results from your initial test are close to or over 4 pCi/L, then that's an indication to take action.The first step you should take it is to do another short-term test in your home, preferably one that's made by another manufacturer. Alternatively, use a different testing medium — switch from liquid scintillation vials to charcoal canisters, for example.


There is some degree of error with radon testing, so change the variables and see if you get similar results.
If the average of your two short-term test results is around 4.1 pCi/L, then there is about a 50% chance that the year-round average in your home is actually below 4 pCi/L., If radon levels in your home still appear to be high (4 pCi/L or above), then you should get a long-term test done.Long-term radon testing can be done by homeowners, but getting a qualified professional involved is likely a much better idea due to what's at stake (your health and/or the cost of fixing the problem).


Remember that radon levels in your home can change from month to month, and season to season, so a long-term test is the most definitive way of knowing your health risks.
If the long-term radon test shows that levels are 4 pCi/L or higher, then you should make a plan to fix your home.
Fixing a radon problem is sometimes recommended if it's found to be over 2 pCi/L.
Although it's not an inexpensive fix, most modern homes can be reduced to a radon level of 2 pCi/L or below."

Beware of areas that leave you vulnerable to TB.If you live in or have traveled to these areas, or even if you come into contact with someone else who has, you could be at risk.,
Examine your working and living conditions.Overcrowded conditions and places with poor ventilation allow the bacteria to spread easily from one person to another.,
Consider your own immune health.Having a medical condition that lowers your immune system's natural defenses can be problematic.,
Determine whether drugs might interfere with immune function.Any drug abuse, including alcohol, tobacco, and IV substances, can lower your body's natural defenses.,
Notice any unusual coughing.TB usually infects the lungs, breaking down the tissue there.,
Look for discharge when coughing.Have you noticed any sputum (sticky discharge) when coughing?,
Pay attention to chest pain.Chest pain can suggest a wide variety of issues, but when taken together with other symptoms, they can point to TB.,
Take note of unintentional weight loss and lack of appetite.,
Do not ignore fever, chills and night sweats.,
Beware of latent TB infection.,
Be able to distinguish TB from other respiratory infections.There are many other conditions that TB could be mistaken for.,
Know when to seek immediate medical attention.Certain signs and symptoms require immediate help.,
Arrange for latent TB infection screening if called for.Even if you don't suspect you have tuberculosis, there are cases in which you may have to be screened for latent TB anyway.,
Ask for a purified protein derivative (PPD) test.This test is also referred to as tuberculin skin test (TST) or Mantoux test.,
Understand how to interpret the results.For different categories of people, there is a maximum induration size considered negative for screening.,
Request an IGRA blood test as an alternate to a PPD.IGRA stands for ""interferon gamma release assay,"" and this blood test is more accurate and quick than a PPD.,
Follow up on test results.A positive result in either the skin or blood test indicates, at minimum, a latent TB infection.,
Follow your doctor's advice after diagnosis.,
Consider getting the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine.",How to Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis," In many parts of the world, the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of TB is a challenge due to health care policy, financial/resource constraints, or overpopulation. This allows TB to go undetected and untreated, causing it to spread. Traveling on an airplane to and from these areas can also harbor the bacteria due to isolated ventilation.


Sub-Saharan Africa
India
China
Russia
Pakistan
Southeast Asia
South America;
, A bad situation can be made even worse if the people around you have poor health background checks or screenings. Conditions to be wary of include:


Prisons
Immigration offices
Retirement/nursing homes
Hospitals/clinics
Refugee camps
Shelters

, If your immune system can't function properly, you're vulnerable to all sorts of infections, including TB. Such conditions include:


HIV/AIDS
Diabetes
End-stage kidney disease
Cancers
Malnutrition
Age (the very young lack developed immune systems, and the aged may have less than optimal immune health)

, While some cancers put you at higher risk for TB, so too does the chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Long-term use of steroids, as well as drugs to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs can also affect immune function. So too can drugs used to treat autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis), and psoriasis.

, Our body's natural response is to remove the irritant by coughing. Figure out how long you've been coughing; TB usually lasts for more than 3 weeks and may include such worrisome signs as bloody sputum.


Consider how long you've taken over the counter cold/flu medications or antibiotics for a respiratory infection with no relief. TB needs very specific antibacterial drugs, and to start therapy requires screening and confirming TB.

, If it smells and is dark, it can be any type of bacterial infection. If it's clear and odorless, it can be a viral infection. Take notice if there's been any blood when coughing into your hands or tissues. When TB cavities and nodules form, nearby blood vessels may get destroyed, leading to hemoptysis — coughing up blood.


You should always seek expert medical advice when you cough up blood. He or she will be able to advise you on how to proceed., If you feel a sharp pain, it can you point to a specific, localized area. Note particularly if it hurts when you apply pressure to that area, or if it hurts when you breath in and out or when you cough.


TB forms hard cavities and nodules against the lungs/chest wall. When we breath, these hard masses cause damage to the area, leading to inflammation at the site. Pain tends to be sharp, localized to a specific area, and reproducible when we put pressure on it.

, The body has a complex response to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria that results in poor nutrient absorption and altered protein metabolism.These changes might persist for months without your noticing them.


Look in the mirror and note any changes to your body. If you can see the outline of your bones, this indicates you don't have enough muscle mass due to lack of protein and fat.
Measure your weight on a scale. Use a previous but recent weight from when you were feeling healthy as a comparison. Weight changes vary, but you should address any drastic changes with your healthcare provider.
Note whether your clothes feel looser
Keep track of how often you've been eating and compare it to when you last felt healthy.

, Bacteria usually reproduce at around normal body temperature (98.6 F). The brain and immune system respond by raising the body's temperature to stop the bug from reproducing. The rest of the body detects this change, then attempts to adjust to this new temperature by contracting muscles (shivers), making you feel chills. TB also causes specific inflammatory proteins that aid in fever production to be produced., A latent TB infection is dormant and not infectious. The bacteria simply resides in body with no harm. Reactivation can occur in those with reduced immunity, as listed above. It can also occur with increased age due to weakening of the immune system. Reactivation sometimes also occurs for other, unknown reasons., You don't want to wait out a simple cold virus only to find out that you have something more serious on your hands. To differentiate between TB and other conditions, ask yourself the following questions:


Is there clear mucus liquid dripping from my nose? A cold will cause congestion/inflammation of the nose and lungs that leads to mucus dripping or running out from the nose. TB will not present with a runny nose.
What is being produced by my coughing? Viral infections and the flu tend to have a dry cough or produce a white mucus. Bacterial infections found in the lower respiratory tract produce brownish sputum. TB, though, typically produces a cough over 3 weeks and can produce a hallmark bloody sputum.
Am I sneezing? TB does not cause sneezing. This is usually a sign of the cold or flu.
Do I have a fever? TB can cause a fever of all levels, but those who have the flu typically have fevers of more than 100.4°.
Do my eyes appear watery/itchy? The cold typically presents with these symptoms, but not TB.
Do I have a headache? The flu typically presents with headaches.
Do I have joint and/or body aches? The cold and flu can cause this but it is more severe with the flu.
Do I have a sore throat?Look inside your throat and see if it appears red, swollen and painful when swallowing. This is seen mainly with cold but can appear with the flu as well.

, Even if these TB symptoms don't result in a TB diagnosis, they might point to other severe illness. Many conditions, both harmless and dangerous, can cause chest pain, but you should always report it and allow a doctor to perform an EKG exam.


Consistent weight loss might indicate malnutrition or cancer.
When combined with bloody cough, weight loss can more specifically suggest lung cancer.
High fever and chills can also be caused by an underlying blood infection or sepsis, though this usually causes a drop in blood pressure, dizziness, delirium and high heart rate.If left untreated, it can be potentially deadly, or lead to severe dysfunction.
The doctors will order IV antibiotics and blood work looking at the white blood cells (immune cells that fight infection).

, Those starting work in a healthcare environment require a test followed by yearly screening. If you're traveling to or returning from at-risk countries, have decreased immunity, or work or live in crowded, poorly ventilated conditions, you should also get screened. Simply make an appointment with your primary care doctor to get tested for TB.


A latent TB infection will not cause any symptoms or sickness, and cannot be spread to other people. However, five to ten percent of people with a latent TB infection will eventually develop TB., The doctor will clean the area with a cotton swab and water, then inject you with a purified protein derivative (PPD) near the top of your skin. A small bump will appear from the liquid injection. Do not cover the location with a bandage as this may alter the liquid in place. Instead, give the liquid a few hours to be absorbed.


If you have antibodies to TB, it will react to the PPD and form an ""induration"" (thickening or swelling around the area).
Note that it is not the redness that gets measured but the size of the induration. After 48 to 72 hours you will return to the doctor for measurement of the induration.

, However, any induration over that size indicates that the patient has TB. If you have no risk factors for TB, an induration of up to 15mm (0.59 inches) is considered a negative result. However, if you have any of the risk factors listed earlier in this article, an induration of up to 10 mm (0.39 inches) is considered negative for screening. If any of the following describes you, an induration of up to 5 mm is considered a negative result:


Immunosuppressive drugs like chemotherapy
Chronic steroid use
HIV infection
Close contact with a TB-positive individual
Organ transplant patients
Those who show fibrotic changes on a chest x-ray

, However, it does cost more to perform. If your doctor opts for this test, he will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab for analysis. Your results should be ready within 24 hours, and a subsequent appointment will be made to go over test results. A high level of interferon (determined by a preset normal range by the lab) is a positive result that indicates you have TB.

, To determine whether you have active TB, your healthcare provider will order a chest x-ray. A patient with a normal chest x-ray will be diagnosed with a latent TB infection and given preventive treatment. An abnormal chest x-ray on top of a positive skin or blood test indicates active TB.


The doctor will also order a sputum culture. A negative result indicates latent TB infection, and a positive result indicates TB.
Note that sputum can be difficult to collect from infants and young children, and diagnosis is often made without it for children., If the x-ray and sputum cultures confirm active tuberculosis, your doctor will prescribe a multi-drug regimen.However, if the x-ray is negative, patients are considered to have latent TB. Follow your doctor's treatment directions carefully to prevent latent TV from becoming active. TB is an infection that is reported to the CDC, and treatment may include Directly Observed Therapy (DOT), which consists of a healthcare worker observing a patient take each dose.

, The BCG vaccine may decrease the risk of infection, but does not eliminate it. BCG vaccination causes a false-positive PPD test, so individuals who have been vaccinated should be screened for TB with the IGRA blood test.


The BCG vaccine is not recommended in the US, which has a low incidence of TB, because of its interference with PPD screening. However, individuals from other, less developed countries are commonly vaccinated.

Be careful traveling to areas where MERS is prevalent.Countries that have had higher rates of MERS include Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Yemen, Lebanon, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Refrain from touching your face.One of the fastest way to pick up a bug and catch a virus (such as MERS) is to touch your hands to your face — including your eyes, your nose, and/or your mouth — after it has been in contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person.",How to Avoid MERS1," If you live in one of these areas, you will inherently be at higher risk; however, if you live elsewhere and can avoid traveling to these places, you will diminish your risk and hopefully avoid contracting MERS.


Cases have also been reported in the following countries (in people who traveled to high risk areas in the Middle East): Algeria, Austria, Thailand, South Korea, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
If you are in a high-risk area in the Middle East, avoid contact with camels as they may also transmit the disease (transmission from camels to humans is possible).This includes avoiding eating camel meat, or consuming camel urine (which is considered a medicinal practice in certain areas of the world).
There are currently no travel restrictions to Middle Eastern countries where MERS is more prevalent; however, if you do travel there, practicing good hygiene and reporting any possible symptoms of MERS to a physician is important.;
, This is a general, hygienic precaution that should especially be followed by anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or places where animals are present. Wash your hands before and after touching animals and do not touch any sick animals.Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 – 30 seconds. Be sure to scrub the full surface area of your hand, including between your fingers.
If warm water and soap are not readily available for you during the day, another option is to carry an alcohol-based sanitizer in your pocket or in your purse.
While hand washing should always be practiced, it is important to note that MERS is spread by a respiratory droplet, as from someone coughing. It is highly unlikely you would catch MERS from touching a contaminated object, but rather from being in direct contact with fluids from an infected person., If you have been in contact with a sick person who coughed or sneezed on you and got a droplet on your hand, then putting your hands to your face can transfers the germs and increases your chances of catching the infection.

Familiarize yourself with the risk factors for malabsorption.,
Identify potential symptoms.,
Observe your bodily functions.,
Pay attention to structural weakness.,
See your doctor.,
Describe your symptoms to your doctor.,
Get tests and a diagnosis.,
Provide a stool sample.,
Have your blood or urine tested.,
Prepare to have imaging tests.,
Consider hydrogen breath tests.,
Collect cell samples from a biopsy.,
Get treatment.,
Replace the nutrients previously lost.,
Work with your doctor to treat the underlying condition.",How to Diagnose Malabsorption," Any person can experience malabsorption, but certain factors can increase your risk of having problems with this condition. Being aware of your risk can help you recognize and treat it effectively.If your body doesn’t produce certain digestive enzymes, you may be at risk for developing malabsorption.Congenital and/or structural defects and diseases of the intestinal tract, pancreas, gallbladder, and liver may increase your risk for malabsorption.Inflammation, infection and injury to your intestinal tract may increase your risk for malabsorption. Removal of portions of your intestine may also contribute to the condition.Radiation therapy can put you at risk for malabsorption.Certain conditions and diseases such as HIV, cancer, chronic liver disease, Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease can put you at greater risk for malabsorption.The use of certain antibiotics, including tetracycline and cholestyramine, and drugs such as laxatives can increase your risk for malabsorption.If you have recently traveled to Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, India, or other countries that commonly face intestinal parasite problems, you may have been infected by a parasite that causes malabsorption.;
, Malabsorption has many different symptoms that can range from mild to severe and are different depending on what nutrients your body has failed to absorb. Identifying potential symptoms that you have can help you get effective treatment as soon as possible.Gastrointestinal issues such as chronic diarrhea, bloating, cramping, and flatulence are the most common symptoms.There may also be excessive fat in your stools, causing them to change in color and become more bulky.
Changes in weight, especially weight loss, is a common symptom.Fatigue and weakness may accompany malabsorption.Anemia or excess bleeding are symptoms of malabsorption. Anemia can be a result of lack of vitamin B12, folate or iron. Insufficient vitamin K may cause excessive bleeding.Dermatitis and night blindness can indicate inadequate absorption of vitamin A.Cardiac arrhythmias, or irregular heart rhythms, may be present due to inadequate levels of potassium and other electrolytes., Watching your bodily functions closely if you suspect you have malabsorption. This can help you not only help you more easily identify symptoms, but may help you diagnose the condition and get proper treatment in a timely manner.Pay attention to stools that are light in color, soft, bulky, and abnormally foul-smelling. These stools may also be difficult to flush or may stick to the sides of the toilet bowl.Notice if your belly swells or you have flatulence after eating certain foods.You may experience edema, a swelling of the legs, ankles, or feet caused by fluid retention., Malabsorption can keep your body from thriving. This can occur in adults but is most common in children. Children who are at risk are often smaller and weigh less than children the same age and sex. Structural weaknesses such as brittle bones and weak muscles can occur from the condition. Paying attention to changes in your bones, muscles, or even hair can help you diagnose and get treatment for malabsorption.


The child's hair may become abnormally dry and they may lose more of it than normal.You may notice that the child is not growing or that their muscles are not developing. You may even notice that their muscles are getting weaker.Pain in the child's bones or muscles, or even neuropathy (numbness in the extremities), can be a sign of certain types of malabsorption., If you observe or experience any of the signs or symptoms of malabsorption in yourself or your child, and/or are at risk for the condition, see your doctor as soon as possible. Early diagnosis is critical to help treat the condition and prevent long-term damage, especially in children.Your doctor may be able to diagnose malabsorption based on a detailed patient history.Your doctor may also use a variety of tests to help diagnose malabsorption., It’s important to recognize your specific symptoms and write them down before you see your doctor. Not only will this help you best explain the symptoms you’re experiencing and how you’re feeling, but will also ensure that you don’t forget potentially important information.Tell your doctor about the symptoms you experience and how they feel. For example, if you’re experiencing bloating and cramping, use descriptive words like severe, dull, or strong. You can use these kinds of terms to describe many physical symptoms.Mention how long you’ve had your symptoms. The more specific date you can pinpoint, the easier it may be for your doctor to figure out what is causing your symptoms.Note how frequently you have or notice symptoms. This information can also help your doctor figure out what’s causing your symptoms. For example, you could say “I have flatulence and bulky stools every day,” or “I have edema in my feet occasionally.”
Let your doctor know about any changes in your life, such as increased stress.Provide your doctor a list of your medications, which may also exacerbate asthma., If your doctor suspects that you have malabsorption, they may order tests after conducting your physical exam, asking a series of questions about your symptoms, and ruling out other causes. These tests can help confirm a diagnosis of malabsorption., It’s likely you will need to provide a stool sample for testing when your doctors suspects malabsorption. This can help confirm the diagnosis and help formulate an effective treatment plan.The stool sample will be tested for excess fat since many malabsorption cases result in the poor absorption of fat.Your doctor may suggest ingesting excess fat over one to three days, and samples will be collected throughout this period of time.The sample may also be tested for bacteria and parasites., Your doctor may order urine or blood tests if they suspect malabsorption. These tests analyze and can spot specific nutrient deficiencies, including anemia, low protein levels, vitamin deficiencies, and mineral deficiencies.Your doctor will likely look at your plasma viscosity, vitamin B12 levels, red cell folate levels, iron status, clotting abilities, calcium levels, antibodies, and serum magnesium levels., Your doctor may want to examine the extent of damage caused by malabsorption. They may order that you get an X-ray, ultrasound or CT scan to see your intestines more closely.X-rays and CT scans make images of the inside of your abdomen it easier for your doctor to identify not only if you have malabsorption, but also exactly where the problem area(s) of the condition are. This can help them better formulate a treatment plan.Your doctor may order an X-ray, which will require you to sit still while a technician makes images of your small bowel. This can help better see damage in this lower section of your intestine.Your doctor may order a CT scan, which will require you to lie inside of a large scanner for a few minutes. A CT scan can show how severe the damage is to your intestines and help assess the type of treatment needed.An abdominal ultrasound might be used to diagnose problems with the gallbladder, liver, pancreas, intestinal wall, or lymph nodes.You might be asked to drink a barium solution that will allow technicians to view structural abnormalities more clearly., Your doctor may suggest using a diagnostic breath hydrogen test. This can detect lactose intolerance and similar sugar-based malabsorption conditions and can help your doctor formulate a treatment plan.During the test, you will be be asked to breathe into a special collection container.You will then be instructed to drink a lactose, glucose, or other sugar solution. Additional samples of your breath will be collected at 30-minute intervals and checked for bacterial overgrowth and hydrogen. Abnormal levels of hydrogen indicate an abnormality., Less invasive tests could indicate a potential problem in your bowel lining due to malabsorption, and your doctor may order a biopsy the intestinal lining for further laboratory analysis.The biopsy sample is usually taken during an endoscopy or colonoscopy., Your doctor may prescribe a course of treatment for a diagnosed case of malabsorption based on the severity of your case. There are different options that range from taking vitamins to hospitalization for severe cases.Be aware that even with early treatment, it may take a while to heal your body from malabsorption., Once your doctor can diagnose which nutrients are not being absorbed by your body, they may prescribe taking vitamin and nutrient supplements and fluids to replace those lost.Mild to moderate cases might be treated with oral supplements or a short dosage of nutrient-rich IV fluids.Your doctor may recommend a nutrient-dense diet for you to follow.The nutrients you're currently lacking will likely be increased in this diet plan., Some causes of malabsorption are treatable by healing underlying causes. The exact treatment you need will vary based on the underlying condition causing your malabsorption, however, so work with your doctor to determine the best treatment for your particular circumstances.


Infections and parasites can usually be eliminated with medication, which may cure the malabsorption completely.Celiac disease requires you to remove gluten from your diet.Malabsorption from lactose intolerance may require avoiding dairy products.Pancreatic insufficiency may require the long-term usage of oral enzymes.Vitamin deficiencies may require the long-term use of vitamin supplements.
Some causes, like blockages and blind loop syndrome, can require surgical intervention."

Avoid close personal contact.If you are caring for a loved one with MERS, it is key to avoid cuddling, kissing, and/or sharing cups and utensils.,
Clean common areas of the house.If you are living under the same roof as someone with MERS, it is best to take hygiene precautions and to clean any shared areas of the house that may serve as a means for germ transmission.,
Ask the infected person to cover their nose and mouth when they cough or sneeze.Since MERS is spread via respiratory secretions, asking the infected person to cover their nose and mouth when they cough or sneeze traps most of the infectious particles and prevents them from spreading through the air to others who may be around.",How to Avoid MERS2," MERS is transmitted via respiratory secretions, so being in close contact with someone puts you at high risk for contracting the virus.


Refraining from close personal contact until your loved one recovers is your best bet, if you want to avoid becoming infected yourself.
The person who is sick should avoid contact with others as much as possible. Staying in a separate room and using a separate bathroom is ideal if the house is big enough.People other than the caregiver should stay out of the room in which the sick person is staying.

, Be sure to clean surfaces such as doorknobs, countertops, dishes and cooking items, towels and other bathroom surfaces. Minimize shared items if possible until the infected person recovers.

, This will certainly help you (and anyone else in the house) to avoid catching MERS.


The sick person should wear a facemask to prevent transmitting the virus through respiratory secretions. If the sick person cannot wear a facemask, then caregivers should wear them when in the same room."
"
See a physician if you notice signs or symptoms suspicious of MERS.If you have recently been in an area where the MERS virus is prevalent (one of the Middle Eastern countries listed above), or if you have been in close contact caring for an affected individual, you will want to monitor yourself for any signs or symptoms that may be suspicious of MERS.These symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as a cough, a fever, respiratory issues such as shortness of breath, and sometimes diarrhea.Most people develop symptoms of MERS five or six days after exposure to the virus, but can range from two to 14 days.

,
Use extra caution if you have other medical conditions.,
Call your doctor ahead of time to let them know that you are worried you may have MERS.",How to Avoid MERS3,", It is especially important to see your doctor if you have symptoms suspicious of MERS alongside other chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, or ongoing respiratory disease. This is because your risk of contracting MERS is higher when you have these conditions.In addition, if you have an underlying medical condition and contract MERS, the disease is more likely to be fatal., This way, your doctor can arrange to see you separately from other patients so that you do not risk passing the infection on to others.MERS is an infection that is being tracked by public health so, if you are diagnosed with it, it needs to be reported.

Complete a barium swallow test if necessary.,
Quit smoking.,
Eat healthy.,
Lose weight.,
Elevate your head when you sleep.,
Consider surgery if your LPR is severe.,
Educate yourself about laryngopharyngeal reflux.",How to Diagnose Laryngopharyngeal Reflux," Hoarseness is a relatively common symptom of LPR. Hoarseness and related symptoms occur because your stomach contents reflux up into your larynx (voice box). This irritates your throat and larynx, resulting in a loss of voice.You might have a weak or shaky voice. For instance, your voice may sound lower than normal.
You might also experience a lumpy feeling in your throat.;
, A sore throat is the most common symptom of LPR. Ultimately, like with hoarseness, your throat becomes sore because it is irritated by the reflux of your stomach contents. Your sore throat may be accompanied by:Problems swallowing
A persistent cough

, Your reflux may be exacerbated by consumption of particular foods. After consuming these foods, you’ll likely exhibit common symptoms of LPR. Some foods that might produce a negative reaction are:Spicy and fatty foods. This could include foods with pepper or fried foods.
Alcohol. Even a small amount of alcohol, like one glass of red wine, may aggravate your LPR.
Caffeinated beverages like tea, coffee, or soda.
Chocolate.

, Many people who suffer LPR notice serious reflux when they lay down. This is because lying down allows your stomach contents to move up into your esophagus. This may be a problem if:You feel as if you are throwing up when you lay down.
You experience common symptoms, like sore throat, after a long period of sleep.

, LPR has many similarities to another condition, gastroesophageal reflux, or GERD. The notable difference is that GERD causes heartburn, which feels like a burning in your chest behind your breastbone. If you are experiencing the above signs and symptoms and also experience heartburn, then you likely have GERD and not LPR., As with other conditions, certain groups are at higher risk for developing reflux. While certain factors do not necessary cause reflux, they are associated with it. Some factors include:Old age — people over the age of 50 are at a higher risk of developing LPR
Being overweight — talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reach or maintain a healthy weight
Having a diet that is high in fatty or greasy foods
Excess stress

, Your doctor will be able to evaluate your symptoms and conditions and help you arrive at a proper diagnosis. If necessary, your doctor can refer you to an otorhinolaryngologist or ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctor) to help accurately determine if you have LPR or another condition.

, When meeting with your doctor, they will ask you to describe your symptoms. Make sure to describe them in full and to explain anything you think is relevant. Often people can be diagnosed based on a description of symptoms alone.Answer questions with as much detail as you can. For example, if you feel your stomach contents moving up your throat, explain how it feels. Say “when I lay down, it feels as if food is moving up my throat back into my mouth.”
List all your symptoms. If you have a cough and sore throat, tell your doctor.
Be proactive and ask them questions if you have any.

, A laryngoscopy is a procedure your doctor may perform so they can see the inside of your upper digestive tract. This will help them determine if you have LPR. Note that it is very unlikely this procedure will be necessary, as most cases of LPR can be diagnosed by your description of symptoms.


The doctor will use a small camera called a laryngoscope.
They may perform a biopsy if they find any abnormal tissue in your upper digestive track.

, If the upper endoscopy does not provide enough information to complete a diagnosis, your physician might run a barium swallow test to see how substances move through your digestive system. This is very unlikely, and your doctor will determine if this is a necessary step.They will ask you to drink a liquid containing barium, which is easily tracked by X-ray tests. The doctor will take X-rays to see where the barium has traveled in your digestive system.
The barium swallow test is often used if a physician is unable to navigate the endoscope in your upper digestive tract.

, Smoking aggravates LPR because it irritates your esophagus and increases the amount of acid in your stomach. By quitting smoking, you'll take an important step to controlling your LPR.Plan to quit smoking in the very near future. For example, enroll in a plan or club like Smokers Anonymous.
Consult your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches.

, A healthy diet may decrease the severity of your reflux. This is because a healthy diet will improve your digestive health and limit the production of stomach acid. Focus on:Foods high in fiber
Fresh vegetables
Fresh fruits
Lean meats, like chicken or fish

, Obesity is associated with LPR because it undermines the body's ability to digest food efficiently. Thus, by losing weight you can decrease the severity of your LPR.Talk to your doctor about a healthy weight target.
Try to track the severity of your LPR over time as it relates to your weight. You may notice that the more you weigh, the worse your LPR.

, People with GERD or LPR often have stomach valves or esophageal sphincters that don't function as they should. As a result, food backs up out of the stomach when they lay down.Put an extra pillow or two under your head when you sleep.
Sleep reclining in a chair, if possible.
Use a bed that elevates or can be adjusted instead of a normal coil mattress.

, Under rare circumstances, your doctor will recommend surgery to treat your LPR. This occurs only when other treatments -- such as diet change and medications — have not been effective.Your doctor will recommend surgery if your LPR is causing other medical problems or threatening your overall health.
During surgery for LPR, your surgeon will try to tighten the valve that connects the stomach and esophagus.
Your doctor may or may not try to implant a medical device to help tighten your valve.

, LPR is a digestive condition that allows food and stomach material to move out of the stomach into the esophagus, throat, and even your nasal cavity. The movement of this material upward is called “reflux.”LRP commonly occurs in people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is also referred to as “heartburn” — a “burning” feeling that occurs in the chest after eating.
If untreated, LRP could develop into cancer of the esophagus or voice box.

Pay attention to abdominal cramps.,
Watch out for weight loss or an inability to gain weight.,
Monitor your stools.",How to Diagnose Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency1," Painful abdominal cramps are a common symptom of EPI, and can be a sign that your body is not properly producing digestive enzymes or properly absorbing nutrients. If you experience chronic abdominal pain, plan to schedule an appointment with your doctor and inquire about EPI.EPI is particularly associated with epigastric abdominal pain, which is pain in the upper abdomen between your sternum (breast bone) and navel. This pain may radiate to your back.
EPI is often difficult to diagnose, since its symptoms—including abdominal cramps—are shared by several other abdominal and digestive disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, bowel inflammation, gallbladder diseases, and peptic ulcer disease.;
, Since EPI diminishes healthy digestive enzymes in your body and reduces your body’s ability to digest and absorb healthy fats and vitamins from food, it’s common for individuals with EPI to lose weight, sometimes at a rapid pace. As another side effect of inadequate digestion, individuals with EPI can experience frequent tiredness or fatigue.Inability to gain weight is a common symptom of EPI in children. Since children weigh relatively little to begin with, an inability to gain weight should be taken seriously when first noticed., Since EPI is a condition of the digestive system, it can have a significant on the frequency and consistency of stool. Nearly all individuals with EPI suffer from diarrhea, which in the case of EPI is known as “steatohhrea.” This stool characterized as greasy, bulky, pale, watery, and very foul-smelling.Steatohhrea is higher in fats than healthy stool, since EPI prevents the body from fully digesting all of the fats that would normally be absorbed into the bloodstream. This condition puts you at high risk for losing important fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamins A, D, E and K, and may result in vitamin deficiencies.The stool may contain oily droplets, and may float to the surface of the water in the toilet bowl, making it difficult to flush at times.

Monitor for abdominal pain.,
Determine if you feel sick after eating.,
Check for digestion issues.,
Look for other symptoms.,
Identify the risk factors.",How to Diagnose Chronic Pancreatitis1," The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is recurrent episodes of abdominal pain. This pain can occur in the upper, middle, or left side of the abdomen. This pain may subside and then come back, and it may become more frequent as the pancreatitis gets worse.The pain may also be felt in the back area. The pain may happen all the time and affect your mobility and everyday life.Some people have no pain at all. Some experience pain that lasts for a duration of a few days or weeks before the pain just goes away. The pain then returns again.;
, Another symptom of chronic pancreatitis is digestive problems. You may experience pain when you eat or drink anything. After eating, you may feel nauseous and even vomit.Those digestive problems can occur when you eat, but they may also occur randomly when you haven’t eaten anything.

, Another symptom of chronic pancreatitis is digestion problems. When the pancreas doesn’t work properly, the body doesn’t have what it needs to digest things like fats and proteins. This may affect your digestion and give you diarrhea.Because the fat isn’t digested, it becomes part of the feces. This can make the feces be loose or oily, have an abnormally bad odor, and be pale in color. The feces may be difficult to flush.
You may also experience weight loss because of the problems digesting food.

, Other symptoms that may occur with chronic pancreatitis are jaundice and signs of diabetes. Jaundice occurs when your eyes and skin start to turn a yellow color.Diabetes symptoms include frequent hunger (polyphagia), frequent thirst (polydipsia), and an increased need to urinate (polyuria). You may also feel very tired.

, The exact causes of chronic pancreatitis are unknown. However, medical professionals have identified risk factors that can lead to chronic pancreatitis. If any of these risk factors apply to you, you may want to go to the doctor for a screening. The risk factors include:

Heavy alcohol consumption
History of smoking
Renal failure
Autoimmune diseases
Cystic fibrosis genetic mutations
Blocked pancreatic duct or common bile duct
Family history of pancreatitis

Ask your doctor about blood work.,
Give a stool sample for a fecal elastase test.,
Give a stool sample for a 3-day fecal test.",How to Diagnose Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency2," Blood testing is a common initial step in testing for EPI, although the blood-test results can only confirm problems symptomatic of EPI; results from bloodwork alone cannot be used to fully diagnose EPI. When your blood is submitted to a lab, its red-blood count will be determined, since anemia (low red-blood cell count) is a common condition in patients suffering from EPI.The lab work will also test your blood for an unusually high presence of nutrients that would usually be absorbed by a body producing healthy levels of pancreatic enzymes. These nutrients include iron, vitamin B12, and folate.

, Since the digestive tract is the bodily system most effected by EPI, evaluating a stool sample is an effective way to gauge a body’s digestive health. For an elastase test, you’ll need to provide your doctor with a single solid stool sample, which will be sent to a lab and evaluated for an enzyme known as “elastase.”This enzyme plays an important role in breaking down food during the digestive process. Individuals with EPI tend to have uncommonly low levels of elastase.

, In addition (or instead of) the stool sample for the elastase test, your physician may ask you to provide a stool sample for a 3-day fecal test. To produce the required sample, you’ll need to collect samples of your stool over a 3-day period and deliver them to your doctor. Similarly to a fecal elastase test, a 3-day test will also be sent to a lab, where the amount of fat that the stool contains will be tested.Excessively fatty stool is a sign of EPI, since it indicates that the digestive tract is not adequately absorbing fat from digested foods, and consequently that enzymes produced in the pancreas are not present in normal quantities.

"
"
Ask your doctor for a direct pancreatic function test.,
Undergo an endoscopic ultrasound.,
Talk to your doctor about getting a CT scan.",How to Diagnose Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency3," This is one of the most accurate means of testing for EPI. In a function test, a small needle is inserted directly into your small intestine and used to withdraw pancreatic enzyme secretions. These fluids are then tested to determine if they contain healthy or unhealthy levels of enzymes.Despite its efficiency, this test is relatively limited and is only performed at certain medical centers or labs.
If your primary care physician is unable to perform a direct pancreatic function test, ask if they can refer you to a nearby clinic that can do the test.

, An endoscopic ultrasound will allow your doctor to look at your pancreas itself (and other internal organs) to see if internal damage or inflammation is causing EPI or EPI-like symptoms. This test will likely need to be given in a hospital: a doctor will snake a thin, specialized tube down your throat, through your stomach, and into the top of your small intestine. The tip of the specialized tube will contain an ultrasound probe that produces sound waves and will produce an image of your internal abdomen, which will help doctors tell if your pancreas is damaged.An endoscopic ultrasound is an outpatient procedure and should take less than 45 minutes. The test can be performed with the patient either conscious or unconscious; if you’re conscious, the medical staff will give you medication to reduce the discomfort.

, A CT scan is usually not necessary for diagnosing EPI, but in some cases it may be helpful. If your doctor decides that a CT scan is needed in helping to diagnose your EPI, you’ll be referred to a clinic with a CT machine. For the scanning procedure, you’ll need to lie on your back in the large donut-shaped CT machine; you’ll be slid into the machine as it scans your abdomen.A CT scan will provide X-ray images of your abdominal region, and will help doctors detect signs of chronic pancreatitis, one of the most common causes of EPI.In some cases, you’ll be asked to drink a tea-like mixture called a “contrast” in order to highlight different parts of your internal abdominal structure and make it easier for the doctors to read the CT scan results.Depending upon your doctor’s preference and the medical equipment available, you may be given an MRI scan or an MRCP scan in the place of a CT scan. All three serve largely the same purpose and will be similarly helpful in allowing doctors to diagnose chronic pancreatitis.

"
"
See your doctor.,
Undergo imaging tests.,
Get blood tests.,
Provide a stool sample.",How to Diagnose Chronic Pancreatitis2," If you are experiencing any abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, or abnormal stools, you should make an appointment to see your doctor. Getting treatment before the condition worsens may help the condition from progressing and can help you sustain a healthier quality of life. If the pain has gone away, you should still go to the doctor, because it is common for pain to come and go with chronic pancreatitis. The absence of pain does not mean that your condition is cured or even better.
If you have extreme pain that makes it difficult to move or that you can’t handle, call emergency services or seek immediate medical attention.

, There are multiple types of imaging tests that your doctor may do to get a picture of your pancreas. These test are mostly noninvasive and don’t require the doctor to make any incisions. These tests may require you to fast or not ingest certain things before they are done, so make sure to ask your doctor what you should do to prepare for these tests.

During a transabdominal ultrasound, a handheld device is moved over your abdomen. It releases sound waves that help create an image of the pancreas and related organs.
When you have an endoscopic ultrasound, the doctor places a thin tube with a light on the end down your throat after numbing it. The tube releases sound waves that create a picture of the pancreas.
During magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), you are injected with dye and then given an MRI, which creates images of the organs in the body.
A computerized tomography (CT) scan is a 3D x-ray of the organs.

, Some doctors may start testing you for pancreas problems by ordering a blood test. In a blood test, your doctor will use a needle syringe to draw blood. The lab will test the blood to check how the kidney and liver are functioning, and look at levels of pancreatic enzymes. Blood tests are not common for diagnosing pancreatitis.The blood test will also check for diabetes. Diabetes often occurs due to chronic pancreatitis.
Blood tests may also check for autoimmune problems that lead to pancreatitis.

, Your doctor may require you to give a stool sample, especially if one of your symptoms is abnormal feces. Using a stool sample, the doctor will test the levels of fat in the feces. High levels of fat may indicate that your body isn’t absorbing the way it should."
"
Receive treatment in the hospital.,
Make dietary changes.,
Stop drinking alcohol and smoking.,
Manage the pain.",How to Diagnose Chronic Pancreatitis3," If your condition is too severe, you may need to stay in the hospital. Your doctor can work on reducing the inflammation of the pancreas. You may need to fast or be fed through a tube to give your pancreas time to rest and recovery before you start eating by mouth again.You may also be given pain medication to help with severe pain.
Your doctor also might recommend surgery that will remove stones that are blocking your pancreatic or common bile duct.
There are also other surgical options, including draining fluid from the pancreas as well as pancreatic resection, which involves removing the diseased part of your pancreas., One way you can help manage your chronic pancreatitis is to change your diet. You should eat a diet low in fat since your body has trouble absorbing and digesting fat. Instead, you can eat a high-protein and high-calorie diet.You should also start eating smaller meals more frequently through the day. Try four to five meals each day instead of three larger ones.Try to limit your daily fat intake. Many doctors recommend eating less than 10 grams of fat with each meal. To do this, eat skinless chicken breast and fish. You may also replace meat with tofu. This also provides high protein content.
Choose cooking sprays over oils.Avoid fatty meats, fried foods, nuts and seeds, and whole milk or full-fat dairy products. Avoid eating packaged baked goods, which contain high levels of fat, especially trans-fat. Avoid all foods with trans-fat, such as margarine.
Take extra caution when eating out. Fast food is full of fat and trans-fat, and even healthy looking foods, like salads, may contain high levels of fat in the dressings.
Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. These provide vitamins and nutrients you may be deficient in.
You may be given vitamin or pancreatic enzyme supplements to help improve digestion and fight against malnutrition.

, If you have chronic pancreatitis, you should stop drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco products. Alcohol and tobacco damages the pancreas and causes more inflammation and pain. Continued alcohol consumption can lead to extreme pain, complications, and even death.If you have pancreatitis due to alcoholism, you should seek treatment to quit drinking. Talk with your doctor about getting help for your addiction, seek out a group like Alcoholics Anonymous, or go to an addiction treatment center.

Talk to your doctor about quitting smoking. There are many medications and programs you can use to help you stop smoking.

, You may need to manage the pain of your chronic pancreatitis. This may begin with over-the-counter pain medication, like NSAIDs, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. You may be prescribed stronger pain medication if over-the-counter medication does not help.You may be sent to a pain specialist to help you learn how to manage chronic pain.
Your doctor may suggest a surgery where your nerves are blocked that send pain from the pancreas."

Talk to your doctor.",How to Dine Out with IBS," Driving your own car to restaurants may not seem useful if you're worried about dining out with IBS. However, having the ability to leave whenever you need to is a good idea.


One marker of IBS symptoms is that they can hit at anytime. It might not be right after you eat something. It could be something that you ate earlier in the day that caused a delayed response.Consider driving yourself to the restaurant. Offer to meet friends, family members or a date at the restaurant instead of carpooling together.
If you're going with close friends or family, let them know that it's not that you want to avoid them, but it makes you feel more comfortable to have a way out.;
, Certain foods will encourage more mucus production in your intestines. This mucus production exacerbates IBS and also prevents you from the uptake of nutrients. Look out for these foods, and try to avoid or limit them:


Dairy products
Fried foods
Ice cream
Chocolate
Junk food
Margarine
Citrus fruits
Nuts
Processed foods
Smoked meats
Seeds
Spicy foods
Sugar
Wheat bran
Wheat products
Pastries
Caffeine
Carbonated beverages
Alcohol
Candies or gum with sorbitol

, Specific foods will trigger your symptoms of IBS. To prevent symptoms, make sure you thoroughly read the entire menu to look for foods that are ""safe"" and foods that you should avoid.


Everyone with IBS will have a specific set of foods that will trigger symptoms. Make sure you're aware of what your trigger foods are to help you pick them out from menu descriptions.
Spend a few minutes when you sit down at the restaurant to read the whole menu. This will allow you to have the most options of what to order.
Narrow down your choices after reviewing everything. Then, when you're ready to order you have a list of a few things to choose from.

, There are many foods that are still good to eat if you have IBS. These foods should be boiled or steamed, without the addition of MSG or spices. Here are some good foods to look out for:


Brown rice
Oatmeal
Barley
Pasta
Polenta
Brown rice pasta
Corn tortillas
Carrots
Squash
Avocado
Banana
Steamed fish
Chicken
Turkey
Vegetable and chicken broths

, When you do go out to eat and are looking for something to order, choose a smaller item. This can help minimize any symptoms and ease your fears about eating out.


If you eat a large meal, this can aggravate IBS symptoms more compared to a smaller meal. Big meals can cause cramping and diarrhea since it's an overload to your system.Look for items that are automatically small. You can have an appetizer for your main meal or order two side dishes.
Also ask those you're with if they'd like to split a meal with you or ask the server if you can do a half portion.
Worst comes to worst, order a regular meal, eat 1/3 or 1/2 and take the rest home for another day.

, Although everyone has different trigger foods with IBS, one very common food that causes symptoms is fat. Whether it's fried foods, creamy sauces or fatty cuts of meat, try to minimize these foods at your meal out.Fat is hard to digest and takes a long time to digest as well. In addition, it stimulates your GI system which can cause cramping, diarrhea and gas with those suffering with IBS.
Foods to be wary are include: fried foods, fast food, creamy/high fat sauces, fatty cuts of meat (like sausage, bacon or a ribeye steak) or mashed potatoes.
If you do want some of these foods, have a very, very small serving. Enough for a taste, but to keep you safe during dinner.

, Some beverages, such as sodas, coffee, and ice cold water, can irritate your GI symptoms and cause a flare up of your IBS. However, don't think you're only stuck with room temperature water.


Both alcohol and caffeine are known GI irritants and stimulants. Stick to decaf drinks, like herbal tea.
Stay away from alcohol.
Exclude soda from your diet completely. The carbonation can increase the sensation of bloating, and the sugar or artificial sweeteners in these beverages can also cause symptoms.
Try to stick to water without ice, herbal tea, and 100% fruit juice (but avoid citrus and apple juices).

, Dairy based products can also be the source of IBS symptoms. They contain fat which could irritate your GI system, but also lactose which is additional irritant.


Many people with IBS do not tolerate dairy products well. Whether this is only IBS or associated lactose intolerance, dairy products may not be something you want to try when you're out to eat.Dairy products include things made with cheese, butter, milk or heavy cream.
Avoid high fat dairy products like heavy cream sauces, butter-based sauces, adding butter to potatoes or rolls, and foods with a lot of cheese (like pizza).

, Know your trigger symptoms; keep track of them in a food journal of what you eat and your symptoms. When you know you have a dinner out later with family or friends, make sure you mind your diet during the day. This can help make sure you're feeling good and symptom free.You don't want to go into a dinner out not feeling your best. If you had a bigger lunch or something that was a little bit higher in fat, your stomach and GI system may already feel upset.
Instead, eat smaller, more frequent meals during the day. Try to avoid all trigger foods - even in small amounts. This will help you be stress-free and relaxed going into dinner.
Plus, some foods can cause symptoms a few hours after you eat them. You don't want to show up to dinner and experience any delayed symptoms.

, One trigger that many sufferers of IBS share is stress. Instead of worrying about your dinner out, try relaxing and working on staying calm during the day.


Those with IBS generally experience increased occurrence of symptoms and increased intensity of symptoms in times of stress.Going out to dinner may be exciting and relaxing for some, but with those with IBS this could actually be a cause of additional stress.
If you're feeling nervous about going out to eat, try to engage in relaxing and calming activities during the day. Try taking a long hot shower or bath, reading a good book, listening to your favorite music or talking to a friend.
Make time for some exercise during the day.

, To help you feel more confident and secure when you do go out to dinner, spend some time doing research before you go. This can help you come up with a plan.It can be annoying to have to find options of what to eat before you go out. However, if you review the menu ahead of time, you can plan your order before you go.
This can help save time when you're at the restaurant. You'll have a few options to choose from and to ask more in-depth questions when you get there.
You can also give the restaurant a call ahead to ask the chef or manager more questions about the ingredients in certain foods.

, Since IBS does come with a variety of symptoms, you may want to bring medications with you to help alleviate any possible side effects.


If you're going out for a long night or want to be able to hang out a little longer, consider packing some medications with you.
If you notice any symptoms or side effects (especially mild ones), you can take some medications to start feeling better and allow you to stay out longer.
The most common symptoms of IBS are gas, diarrhea and cramping. Consider bringing an anti-diarrheal medication, such as loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate; antispasmodic agents, such as dicyclomine hydrochloride, for cramps; and simethecone or charcoal tablets (available in health food stores) to relieve gas., Another trick when you're dining out with IBS is to try to locate the restrooms. You may even want to choose to sit a little closer to the bathroom.Although you might not want to sit right next to the bathroom, consider asking for a table a little closer. If an emergency arises, you'll be able to make a quick break for it.
If you don't want to sit right next to the bathroom, at least scope it out so you know exactly where it is. There won't be a need to postpone an emergency by having to ask where the bathroom is.

, It can be difficult to dine out when you have IBS. You might feel nervous or stressed when everyone else is enjoying the night out. Try to focus on having fun instead of a potential issue.Even though it can be difficult, focus on relaxing and having fun. Going out to eat should be an enjoyable and sociable event for everyone.
At your meal, make it a point to do some deep breathing. If you sit there and only focus on possible symptoms, you'll be missing out.
The more often you go out, the more you can practice focusing on your friends, family and conversation instead of possible symptoms of IBS.

, If you're not too sure that you want to go out to eat with co-workers or acquaintances, go with close friends and family members instead.


The added pressure of being out to dinner with someone or multiple people you don't know very well can cause unnecessary stress.
Instead, just go out to eat with people who you're comfortable with. They understand you and your symptoms and can help you deal with any issues that arise at a restaurant.

, If you need to, stick with things that you know. Whether it's a specific type of food or restaurant, this can help minimize the stress.


You shouldn't feel pressured (by yourself or other people) to try new foods. If you feel comfortable only consuming a certain type of foods or certain dishes that's OK.
The same goes for the actual restaurant. If you feel more comfortable going to a certain restaurant, especially if you've eaten there before, that's OK.
Try new things or new restaurants in moderation. Make sure to prep and enjoy smaller servings of foods you haven't tried yet.

, Lastly, if you are having difficulty managing your IBS symptoms, consider talking to your doctor. He can help you work through your issues.


Make an appointment or give your doctor a call. Ask to talk more about your IBS symptoms and if they have any tips or medications they can give you to better manage symptoms.
Ask what you can take with you to social gatherings that can help prevent symptoms from occurring or can relieve them if they're triggered.
Share your typical diet and ask if they can help you pinpoint any specific foods that could be potential trigger foods.

Look for feeding difficulties.,
Monitor your appetite.,
Determine if you have difficulty swallowing foods.",How to Diagnose Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGID)1," In children, especially toddler and infants, EGID often manifests as feeding difficulties.For instance, when children are normally able to consume solid foods (usually at about six months old), a child with EGID might cough up, gag on, or make hacking sounds when given solid foods. This behavior could lead you to puree foods or limit the amount of solid food in your child’s diet.For instance, if your child hacks up rice every time you feed it to them, they might have EGID. Make a note of behavior patterns with certain foods to discuss with your doctor. In the meantime, you can mix the rice with water and blending it into a slurry to make it more digestible. Alternatively, you could feed your child something else entirely like baby food or mashed potatoes.
Difficulties of this sort might also occur in older individuals.;
, People with EGID often have a poor appetite. If you find that you eat far less than you used to, or eat much less than others of a similar age and body type, you might have EGID. A secondary effect related to the small appetite in EGID patients is a marked weight loss or failure to gain weight when you should.For example, if you used to eat an apple, a waffle, and a cup of juice for breakfast, but now can only manage to consume the cup of juice because you are worried about choking or experiencing nausea after eating, you might have EGID.
In children with EGID, they might not grow as fast as their peers because they do not eat as much as they should., Difficulty swallowing food (dysphagia) is a typical symptom in individuals with EGID. If you cannot easily swallow food, or find that you need to wash down each bite with a drink of water, you might have EGID.One of the common manifestations of dysphagia is food impaction.Food impaction occurs when food – typically something tough or thick like bones of meat or fish – becomes lodged in the esophagus. If your esophagus is consistently clogged and you find yourself choking on your food frequently, this may be due to EGID.

Get to a hospital immediately.,
Be prepared to receive an antitoxin.,
Expect respiratory treatment.,
Anticipate vomiting and bowel movements.,
Undergo wound cleansing and debridement.",How to Detoxify from Botulism1," Botulism in all its forms is a serious life threatening illness and requires immediate medical treatment. The sooner you get medical attention, the better your recovery. Call emergency services by calling 911 in North America.
Symptoms of foodborne botulism present 12 to 36 hours after eating contaminated food and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, blurred or double vision, slurred speech, drooping eyelids, dry mouth or difficulty swallowing or talking, sudden facial muscle weakness, trouble breathing, and paralysis. Foodborne botulism comes from environments with little oxygen, such as canned and bottled foods and foods fresh from the soil.Symptoms of infant botulism begin with constipation, floppy movements, drooping eyelids, weak cries, drooling and difficulty sucking or feeding, and paralysis. Infants contract botulism via spores that get into the intestinal tract and convert to toxins inside the body. Infants who develop botulism are typically between two to eight months of age and have ingested honey or soil.Symptoms of wound botulism are the same as in foodborne, except you will not have nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps. Spores can convert to toxins inside open wounds and are commonly found in cuts you haven’t noticed and intravenous drug users’ injection sites.Botulism does not increase blood pressure or heart rate or cause confusion. You may have a fever if you have wound botulism.;
, Antitoxin is one of the first lines of early defense in fighting botulism. Antitoxin cannot reverse damage already done but can reduce the risk of further complications and nerve damage. Antitoxin is delivered via a slow intravenous infusion.
Antitoxin is derived from horse serum so a skin sensitivity test will be done before administration.

, Because the toxin in botulism weakens muscles to the point of paralysis, you can stop breathing. Medical treatment for botulism therefore usually includes time on a ventilator to help you breathe until the effects of the toxin have cleared your system. This could take several weeks., Medical treatment for foodborne botulism usually involves induced or forced vomiting and medications to cause bowel movements. The goal is to clear the food substance out of your system., Wound debridement is the removal of dead or infected tissue, thereby removing toxins in the wound if you have wound botulism."
"
Look for common gastrointestinal symptoms.,
Check for any changes in appetite or unusual weight loss.,
See a doctor if you have severe symptoms.",How to Detect Helicobacter Pylori1," These can include nausea, excessive burping, bloating, and abdominal pain that worsens on an empty stomach. Together these can be indicators that you might have H. pylori. However, most people don’t experience any symptoms from H. pylori.If you don’t have symptoms, you shouldn’t worry about H. pylori.Keep in mind that common gastrointestinal symptoms can also indicate dyspepsia, gastritis, or GERD. Your doctor may recommend medication and diet changes first. If you do not get better from these measures, then your doctor may order a test for H. pylori.;
, If you haven’t been trying to lose weight and you notice a significant weight loss (5% of your weight in a 6-12 month period), you should contact your doctor in any case. It could be H. pylori, but it could also be quite a few more serious conditions. A severe loss of appetite can also be a significant indicator of something wrong., These can include severe abdominal pain, trouble swallowing, bloody or black stools, or bloody or black vomit. You should see a doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms. They can help assess what’s wrong and if you do indeed have H. pylori.If you notice vomit that looks like coffee grounds, then seek immediate medical assistance. This can indicate that there is a severe problem.

Monitor your stool at all times.,
Look for reflux.,
Determine if you feel nauseous.Nausea is a feeling of cramping or pain in your gut.,
Identify other allergic responses.,
Get examined by a doctor.",How to Diagnose Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGID)2," In some cases, people with EGID have diarrhea, or bloody stool (hematochezia).You might also experience constipation, or the inability to defecate.This indicates that EGID is affecting your intestinal tract in addition to (or instead of) your esophagus, stomach, or duodenum.Contact your physician if your stool is different from your normal situation, or if your stool characteristics vary widely.

, Reflux is the emergence of gastrointestinal acid from the gut into the throat or mouth. In advanced cases, reflux leads to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).This includes the added symptom of heartburn, a feeling of pain or burning in the chest just behind the heart.If you have EGID, your reflux will not respond to anti-acid medication, which is the common solution for individuals with reflux.Even if you don’t experience reflux, you might experience some degree of chest or abdominal pain.

, If you regularly feel sick to your stomach after eating, you might have EGID. You might retch or actually throw up., People with EGID often have other allergy-related disorders such as asthma or eczema, often related to food sensitivity.If you know you have these disorders, or if certain substances cause breathing difficulties, a tight chest, or skin rashes, you are more likely to have EGID. EGID can also directly cause a body-wide inflammatory response in some people. If this happens, you might feel pain in your legs, feet, and ankles in addition to your chest and trunk. You might also get headaches, migraines, or flu-like symptoms (including fevers, general aches, and pain)., If you have any of the primary EGID symptoms, see a doctor immediately. You cannot and should not definitively diagnose yourself. Instead, you must consult a doctor who can schedule you for a medical test (endoscopy and/or colonoscopy) and produce conclusive evidence that you have EGID.The doctor will typically examine your digestive tract with a long, flexible tube equipped with a camera. This is called an endoscopy when examining the esophagus, or a colonoscopy when examining the colon. The doctor may biopsy the tissue (remove a small tissue sample) and examine it under the microscope to help with diagnosis.
Before the procedure, you’ll probably have to fast for four to eight hours, and you might have to stop taking certain medications that thin the blood or produce other undesired effects. Your doctor will provide you with more information about how you can prepare.The doctor may also give you a sedative or anesthetic before the procedure.

"
"
Go on an elimination diet.,
Adopt an elemental diet.An elemental diet is a special diet that requires ingesting an “elemental formula” containing crucial amino acids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals in carefully calculated proportions.,
Get medication.,
Reduce environmental allergens.Certain environmental allergens like mold, pollen grains, biogenic waste, and occupational allergens (dust or shredded grass, for instance) might contribute to the development of some forms of EGID.",How to Diagnose Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGID)3," In an elimination diet, you stop eating certain foods to determine whether they are contributing to your EGID.Typically, you’ll begin by removing the most common allergens (milk, soy, egg, wheat, peanuts/other nuts, and shellfish/fish) one by one. For instance, you might eliminate all soy from your diet for two weeks and observe the results. If your symptoms improve, you must continue to avoid consuming soy in order to prevent the EGID symptoms from recurring.Research shows that egg, milk, and soy are the ingredient most closely associated with EGID of the esophagus.
You might also get a skin prick testing to determine if you’re allergic to anything, though EGID patients often produces a negative result even if someone does have an allergy to a given food.If you adopt a new diet permanently, you may need supplements to ensure you are getting all the nutrients you need. Talk to an allergist or gastroenterologist if you want to continue the diet for longer than two to four weeks, or if you need help with further testing.

, This liquid diet helps reduce chances of impaction and irritation in the gut and esophagus while ensuring you receive all the proteins and other nutrients you need to stay healthy.For instance, you might be put on an elemental diet of Neocate Infant, Neocate Junior, Neocate Nutra, EO28 Splash, Elecare, or Elecare Jr. These elemental diet formulae are available in various flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, and tropical.Typically, a patient will remain on an elemental diet for about six weeks so that the esophagus and affected areas have time to heal. Then, normal food will begin to be reintroduced.
Your doctor will let you know if and when you can transition back to normal food.
Elemental formulas are allergen-free.

, Your doctor might prescribe medication to ease your symptoms. While this will not cure your EGID, it will help alleviate chest and abdominal pain, reflux, and other symptoms. Your medication will likely be a spray that you squirt toward the back of your throat or a liquid mixture. Your doctor will decide if medication might be useful in your case.Medical solutions tend to be the last resort, and are used when dietary adjustments are impossible or do not produce a positive result.They are also not a preferred treatment method because of the number of negative side effects that they can produce.Common medications prescribed include corticosteroids like prednisone and budesonide.Immunosuppressive drugs like azathioprine, and topical steroids are sometimes prescribed when low doses of corticosteroids are not sufficient.Always use medication as directed.

, The best way to combat these allergens is to dust regularly, wash clothes and bedding frequently, and install an air purifier (or two) in the main areas of your residence.Wear a facemask if you are exposed to occupational dust or mold (for instance, as a housing renovator or construction specialist).

"
"
Take antibiotics as directed.,
Use charcoal tablets or liquid only as recommended by a doctor.,
Try milk thistle.,
Do a fibre bulk cleanse.,
Take goldenseal extract.",How to Detoxify from Botulism2," Once you have been discharged from the hospital, continue to take any antibiotics prescribed to you. You may be given medications such as penicillin for wound botulism. These antibiotics are generally taken for a period of seven to 14 days.Make sure you take antibiotics for the full course of treatment, even if you are feeling better after just a few days. The full treatment is still necessary.
Antibiotics are not prescribed for other types of botulism because they may speed up the release of toxins., Activated charcoal helps rid the body of toxins by preventing absorption in the stomach by binding to the poison.Activated charcoal can react with many medications in your system so be sure to take it only on the advice of a physician.
Do not take other medications within two hours of taking charcoal, as the charcoal may prevent your other medication from being absorbed.
Liquid activated charcoal may settle in the bottle so it must be shaken well before use.
The usual adult dose is 50 grams of charcoal every four hours.

, There is some evidence to suggest that milk thistle aids in healing liver damage due to toxins.160 to 800 milligrams per day of milk thistle has been taken in treating liver damage due to toxins., Use psyllium fibre as a gentle laxative cleanse to help remove any remaining toxins in your colon. Products such as Metamucil feature psyllium, which bulks up when mixed with water and forms a gel-like substance in the colon to help transport waste through the intestines.Speak with a physician before doing a cleanse. Some individuals may not be able to tolerate the treatment.
Take 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of psyllium in one cup of warm water and drink immediately after mixing.
Drink psyllium mixtures before bed for gentle overnight action.

, Goldenseal is an herb said to kill bacteria in the digestive tract. It contains berberine, a chemical that kills bacteria in test tubes and may also do so in humans.Goldenseal may also boost white blood cells which fight off infections.
Try taking one drop of goldenseal extract in water every six hours for one day to help reboot your digestive system.
Goldenseal can have significant interactions with many medications, so check with your doctor before taking this herb.

"
"
Ensure you’re getting your vitamin E. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that stimulates and enhances your immune cells and aids with circulating oxygen.Take up to 400 milligrams a day in supplement form.,
Get your vitamin C. This antioxidant boosts your white blood cells, antibodies, and interferon, all to improve your immune system.Try to get at least 200 milligrams of vitamin C a day by eating six servings of fruits and vegetables such as citrus fruits, strawberries, raspberries, broccoli, spinach, and bell peppers.

,
Eat garlic.",How to Detoxify from Botulism3," It can be hard to get enough vitamin E through your diet but it is naturally found in avocadoes, seeds, vegetable oils, and grains.

,, Garlic contains allicin and sulphur compounds that provide you with antibacterial and detoxification properties.Eating a clove of garlic a day may help you recover faster.

"
Clean your surfaces.,
Detoxify jars and bottles.,
Wash your clothes.,
Cook safely.",How to Detoxify from Botulism4," To decontaminate surfaces that may have come in contact with suspected foods or liquids, use one part chlorine bleach to five parts water as a cleanser.Wear gloves during cleaning. Spray surfaces and let the cleanser sit for 30 minutes before wiping with paper towels. Dispose of paper towels immediately.
Repeat this process again.
Discard gloves at end of cleaning process.
If not cleaned, clostridium botulinum on household surfaces will take days to fully denature.

, Place jars and lids in a large pot, fully immersed in water. Put a lid on the pot and boil the contents for 30 minutes.Cool, then discard all items safely.

, Any clothing exposed to the botulism toxin should be washed immediately in a machine with hot water and soap.

, Heating food to an internal temperature of 85 °C or 185 °F for at least five minutes will destroy botulism.

"
"
Get a blood test.,
Get a stool test.,
Get a breath test.",How to Detect Helicobacter Pylori2," There are blood tests that can show whether you have or have previously had H. pylori. Though they can be a useful diagnostic tool, other tests are typically more accurate for H. pylori. In any case, if you have a blood test, and your doctor thinks you might have or have had H. pylori, she might follow it up with a breath or stool test.You could get the results by the next day.One advantage of the blood test is that its results won't be affected by a recent course of antibiotics., If you have this test, you’ll give a stool sample to the lab. They’ll look for H. Pylori antigens. This test is more accurate than the blood test. Pepto-bismol and other drugs can interfere with this test.Your doctor will provide you with a plastic stool collection container. Make sure you follow all of the instructions accompanying the container.You will need to collect at least 20mm or 5 grams of stool for this test.Keep the stool sample refrigerated if you are going to return to the doctor within 72 hours. If not, freeze it., In this test you’ll swallow something that has carbon molecules.This could be a pudding or a pill. You’ll then breath into a bag, and your doctor will check for carbon molecules. Certain drugs such as Pepto-Bismol and antibiotics can interfere with the accuracy of this test. You may have to discontinue taking them a week or so before the test.You'll first breath into a bag, consume the carbon-containing molecules, and then wait 15 minutes. After that time, you'll be asked to breath into the bag again."
"
Ask your doctor whether you need an endoscopy.,
Stop eating and drinking 4-8 hours before the procedure.,
Discontinue certain medications before surgery.,
Get someone to drive you home.,
Wait for results.",How to Detect Helicobacter Pylori3," An endoscopy is not usually used to diagnose H. pylori, as it is so much more invasive. It is typically used to determine the cause of upper digestive conditions or to diagnose H. pylori ulcers. In any case, unnecessary surgery should be avoided., This will ensure you have an empty stomach for the test. It will also help your doctor to see what is going on. Eating before surgery can make complications worse if they develop.It is also to prevent pulmonary aspiration., You may need to talk to your doctor about specific necessary medications (for diabetes, heart conditions, etc.). However, you should typically stop taking blood thinners. This is to protect you from complications that can occur with medications during surgery., You will need, as is usually the case, someone to drive you home after surgery. Your judgment will be impaired and you will need someone to help you get home safely. Don’t try to drive home yourself., Ulcer results may be available right after the procedure. But the results for the biopsy looking for H. pylori will likely take a bit longer. Once you have your answer, you can proceed with treatment options."

Identify the symptoms of acid reflux disease.,
Inform your doctor of your medical history.,
Provide a complete list of your medications.,
Familiarize yourself with the different characterizations of acid reflux.,
Take your symptoms seriously.,
Be aware of the common methods to diagnose acid reflux.,
Have an upper GI endoscopy.,
Prepare for an upper GI endoscopy.,
Know what to expect during the procedure and immediately after.,
Have a manometry study done.,
Prepare for a manometry study.,
Know what to expect before and immediately following the procedure.,
Consider optional procedures.,
Have a 24 hour pH probe exam.,
Have an upper GI series performed.",How to Diagnose Acid Reflux," The common signs of acid reflux disease include heartburn, chest pain, trouble swallowing, a chronic dry cough or hoarseness, sore throat, a sour taste in your mouth, regurgitation of food or sour tasting stomach juices, and a sensation of a lump in your throat.”Heartburn” is a term that is commonly used to describe some of these symptoms grouped together. The accepted definition of heartburn is indigestion involving a burning sensation in your mid chest area that can spread into your throat, often accompanied by a bitter taste.
Less common symptoms of acid reflux include nausea, vomiting, wheezing, ear pain, laryngitis, persistent need to clear the throat, and erosion of tooth enamel and other dental problems.
Acid reflux is responsible for as many as 50% of non-cardiac chest pain cases.Many people go to the emergency room or urgent care treatment center due to chest pain, thinking they may be having a heart attack.
Always seek medical attention when sudden or potentially life-threatening symptoms occur. If no evidence of cardiac problems are found, follow up with your regular doctor to see if you may be experiencing acid reflux.;
, Provide as much detail as possible about your medical history. Treating your acid reflux effectively may depend on your doctor’s knowledge of other diseases or problems.This includes a complete history of any digestive problems you have had in the past, persistent sore throats, coughing, hoarseness or laryngitis, stomach pain, and any history of stomach ulcers or other GI disorders.
Tell your doctor about any allergies you may have, especially since you may need to follow-up with testing procedures that use uncommon medications and contrast media.
Include all medical conditions in the information you provide to your doctor, as well as any other doctors like radiologists and anesthesiologists that may be part of your healthcare team. Be sure to let them know if you think you may be pregnant.

, The list should include all prescription medications you are taking, plus over-the counter products, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Always let each of your doctors know when a new medicine is added, you start something new that is over-the-counter, or an existing medication is changed or discontinued.


Sometimes over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements, and vitamins that you may think are harmless, can be the primary cause of your stomach problem.
Follow you doctor’s instructions on how to safely stop and re-start you medications as you proceed with testing procedures.

, Acid reflux generally falls into three categories. The categories are important to understand since they guide your doctor in determining the next step in confirming your diagnosis of acid reflux disease.The first category is called functional or physiologic GERD.
This category includes people that do not have risk factors for acid reflux or any medical conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
People in this group are often treated with lifestyle changes or milder forms of medications. Diagnostic testing may not be needed to start treatment as long as no other medical conditions or risk factors are present. It is up to your doctor.
The second category is called pathological reflux disease. People in this category develop acid reflux symptoms and possible complications due to more severe and lingering symptoms and sometimes have co-existing medical conditions that make their acid reflux worse.
Persistent acid reflux that has not been treated for an extended period of time falls in this category.
The third category is called secondary GERD. This means that another underlying medical condition may be causing or contributing to the development of acid reflux.
For example, people that have a gastrointestinal disorder that causes problems with stomach emptying may develop acid reflux due to that condition.

, Once you know you have acid reflux, follow the treatment suggestions provided by your doctor. If the treatment options provided do not seem to be working, then let your doctor know. Serious complications from acid reflux disease are possible.The most common complication from acid reflux is called esophagitis. This means the esophagus becomes inflamed, irritated, or has areas of ulceration.
This condition can get much worse over time if the acid reflux is not effective treated.
Stricture is a complication that often develops in advanced forms of esophagitis. Stricture is commonly caused by continued exposure of the esophagus to stomach acid. Localized inflammation, scar tissue, or other tissue damage to the esophagus, cause it to become rigid and/or tight which makes it difficult for food to pass and difficult to swallow.
People with a stricture from prolonged acid reflux disease often have trouble with vomiting undigested foods or difficulty swallowing solid food. In many cases, this requires surgery to repair.
Another complication that may arise is called Barrett esophagus and occurs in approximately eight to 15% of people with acid reflux. Long-term exposure of the esophagus to stomach acid causes changes at the cellular level leading to dysplasia.
Dysplasia is a change that is observed in tissues during the early development of cancer.
The development of Barrett esophagus can lead to a type of cancer called adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of esophageal cancer.This is the most serious complication associated with GERD.

, Doctors rely heavily on symptoms and response to treatment for diagnosis. The doctor must rule out alternative diagnoses that may masquerade as GERD: functional heartburn, atypical cases of achalasia, or distal esophageal spasm. Based on your symptoms, you will likely be prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). These block the acid production in the stomach.If there is no response to these medications, your doctor may try additional tests. The specific tests as suggested below are usually only used if there is unclear diagnosis for GERD, or if there are more serious symptoms.


Some testing, such as esophageal manometry, is recommended for preoperative evaluation.
Endoscopy is recommended in the presence of alarm symptoms and for screening of patients at high risk for complications.

, An upper GI endoscopy procedure helps to evaluate the overall anatomy and identify any structural problems or complications from the disease. This test confirms the presence of acid reflux disease and is useful determining the extent of damage to the esophagus. Other upper GI conditions are also diagnosed by this method.Examples of other conditions diagnosed by doing an upper GI endoscopy include anemia, unexplained nausea and vomiting, ulcers, bleeding, and precancerous abnormalities.
An upper GI is done by inserting an endoscope, which is a long and flexible tube with a camera on the end, down the throat and into the esophagus. This allows the examiner to see the lining of your upper GI areas including your esophagus.

, Your doctor will give you clear instructions to follow prior to the procedure. Follow the directions provided by your doctor. The items listed here are provided for information only, and may differ from those provided by your doctor.Do not eat or drink anything for at least eight hours before the procedure. In order for the doctor to clearly see the lining of your esophagus and stomach area, your stomach needs to be empty.
This includes smoking, eating any food, drinking any beverages including water, and chewing gum.
Upper GI endoscopies are usually done in a hospital or outpatient surgical center since mild sedation is provided.
Be sure you have a ride home. You will be given a mild form of anesthesia so you will not be allowed to drive immediately after.
Some doctors will perform this procedure without using sedation, but this is not commonly done.

, You may be asked to gargle with, or spray, a liquid anesthetic on the back of your throat. This helps to stop the gag reflex as the tube is inserted.You will lie on your side on an exam table during the procedure. An IV will be started in your arm or hand so you can be given the medication for sedation. Nurses or other doctors will be with you to monitor your vital signs throughout the procedure.
The examiner will insert a long, thin, tube with a camera on the end into your mouth and gently push it through your esophagus and into your stomach area. This allows the examiner to look closely at the tissues in your upper GI tract and stomach area.
If necessary, the doctor may take a biopsy of tissues during the examination. This is done by using an instrument carefully inserted through the tube that has been passed into your upper GI area. You will not feel any pain from the biopsy.
Sometimes air is pumped into the stomach and duodenum, which is the uppermost part of your intestine. This helps the examiner to see all the tissues and linings to better determine the cause of the problem.
The entire procedure usually takes between 15 and 30 minutes. In many cases, the doctor can give you immediate feedback on what was found. Tissue biopsies take several days to get the results.
You will stay at the hospital or center for several hours after the procedure to allow time for you to wake up from the sedatives used, and to be sure there are no problems as a result of the procedure.
Many people feel bloated and nauseous for a few hours and have a sore throat for one or two days following the procedure. You can expect to rest at home for the rest of the day and possibly the following day. Resume your normal diet once your sore throat has subsided and you do not have any trouble swallowing.

, Manometry studies are done to provide detailed information on people that may be surgical candidates. The procedure allows the doctor to evaluate how well the esophagus is functioning and if there is are problems that can be corrected with surgery.Manometry is a procedure that provides important information about the overall function of the esophagus and the sphincter at the bottom that normally tightens or closes once food has passed through.
During the manometry, the doctor will be able to measure the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter, check for problems with motility, evaluate the contraction and relaxation of the esophagus, and identify other problems that may be related to swallowing.

, Your doctor will provide specific instructions for you to follow to prepare for your manometry study. Follow the guidelines exactly as your doctor outlined.You will likely be told not to eat or drink anything for at least eight hours before the test is to be done. If it is scheduled for first thing in the morning, then you should not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before.

, You will not be sedated during the test but medication is used to make the procedure more comfortable.Medications that numb your throat area and nasal passages are used just before the procedure starts. The medication makes the insertion of the tube more comfortable.
The procedure involves passing a thin, pressure-sensitive tube through your nose, down your throat and esophagus, an into your stomach. You will likely be sitting upright when the tube is inserted.
You may feel a gagging sensation and some discomfort as the tube is passed through your nose and throat.
The tube is pulled back slightly once it reaches the stomach to be sure it is in your esophagus. You may remain seated or be asked to recline on your back for the rest of the procedure.
Once the tube is in the proper place, you will be asked to swallow small sips of water. The catheter, or tube, is connected to a computer and can take important readings as you swallow.
Breathe slowly and regularly, remain as still as possible, and swallow only when asked to do so.
The computer readings can determine if the sphincter muscles in your esophagus are normal. The procedure also checks the overall function of the esophagus with regards to proper contraction, relaxation, and motility.
You may have a slight nosebleed, watery eyes, and sore throat, during and following the procedure. It is possible, but very rare, for your esophagus to be damaged during the procedure.
Your doctor will advise you when you can resume normal eating and drinking, which is normally immediately after the procedure is completed.
The entire procedure takes about 30 minutes to an hour. It is usually done in a hospital or surgical center setting.
Expect several days for the final test results to be available.

, Your doctor may need additional information about your condition to properly treat your acid reflux. Other tests are sometimes done to evaluate people with acid reflux and related problems, in addition to the mandatory diagnostic testing. The two most common tests done to confirm a diagnosis of acid reflux, or to explore problems with similar symptoms, include a 24 hour pH probe exam and an upper GI series.
These procedures are helpful in diagnosing related conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease, and in monitoring the progress of treatment interventions.
Once treatment has been started for acid reflux, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. Often this can be done by monitoring symptoms, but sometimes repeating a procedure to compare the results is the most effective way.

, The 24 hour pH probe exam is used to confirm the diagnosis of acid reflux disease in people that have acid reflux symptoms that are not the most common ones, and if the results of the endoscopy were not conclusive.It is also used to determine the effectiveness of some treatments, and to find the cause of other problems like nighttime coughing or hoarseness.
The test measures the pH of the esophagus over a 24 hour period. This helps your doctor to know if acid is in the esophagus when it shouldn’t be.
Your doctor will provide you with complete instructions on how to prepare for the test. Commonly instructions recommend no food or water for 2 hours before the procedure.
During the procedure, a numbing medication will be placed in your nasal passages to make the insertion of the tube more comfortable. Once the tube is in place, it will be taped down against your face and nose to keep it in place.
A small carrying case/backpack that contains a recording unit is attached to the tube. You will also be given a diary to record specific details of symptoms, when you eat or drink, and other information you doctor needs to know.
The recording unit collects data for 24 hours. This information will be correlated with your diary entries to determine if there are problems with abnormal acid levels in your esophagus. After 18 to 24 hours, you will return to the hospital or clinic and the tube will be removed.
Maintain your normal routines as much as possible to provide accurate readings and information.

, An upper GI series uses fluoroscopy, or constant and real-time x-rays, to create images of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. The procedure is non-invasive and uses a barium contrast material to look for problems in your upper gastrointestinal tract. Many possible medical conditions, including acid reflux, can be diagnosed or confirmed using an upper GI series.Your doctor will provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. Most of the time, you will be asked not to chew gum, or eat or drink anything, including your routine medications, for several hours before the procedure.
The procedure will be done in a hospital, clinic, or surgical center. You will be monitored by a radiologist since fluoroscopy is involved. Fluoroscopy is a form of x-ray.
Jewelry, some dental appliances, eye glasses, and other metal objects will need to be removed before the procedure begins. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown for the procedure.
You will be asked to drink some form of contrast media, such as barium. Next you will be asked to lie down on a special table that is part of the fluoroscopy equipment. This makes your organs visible to the equipment so the radiologist can see how they are working in real-time.
Pictures are taken as the contrast medium travels through your upper GI tract. The table may tilt or move during the procedure so the images can be as thorough as possible. The entire exam takes about 20 to 30 minutes.
During and after the exam, you may feel bloated if certain types of gas-producing materials were used.
In most cases, you can resume your normal diet and regular medications immediately following the exam. The barium may cause your stools to be gray or white and you may feel constipated for two to three days following the procedure. Drink extra fluids if needed to help your body resume a regular schedule.
The radiologist will review the results of your study and send a full report to your doctor. Your doctor will talk with you about the results of the procedure.

Avoid certain foods.,
Eat foods that help your body detox.,
Eliminate all food allergies and intolerances.,
Eat foods rich in chlorophyll to reduce toxins.,
Take probiotics.,
Drink more water: Your body needs lots of water to help flush toxins.",How to Detox Your Colon1," The best way to start detoxing your colon is to eliminate the foods that are causing problems. Start to eliminate all the foods that are a burden to your liver and your colon. This includes coffee, white sugar, white flour, dairy, and alcohol.


Stop eating processed sweets, which are full of white sugar and flour. Also avoid excess amounts of cheese or ice cream.;
, There are certain foods that will help you detox your body. These include vegetables in the Brassica family, such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. These vegetables contain many nutrients and specific complexes called sulforaphanes that are very important in helping your body detox. Also make sure to eat plenty of fiber, because fiber-rich foods scrub the walls of the colon and push food through the intestines quickly. Some great high-fiber foods are green vegetables, apples, berries, and brown rice.High fiber consumption can improve colon health by helping remnants inside the colon pass through.

, If you have never been tested for food intolerances, you may want to visit a doctor or natural doctor to have this done. Eating foods that your body has an intolerance to slows down colon functioning and increases the likelihood of bowel toxicity.

, There are certain foods that will help reduce the toxins in your blood. Studies have shown that chlorophyll reduces the absorption of toxins and helps with toxin excretion. Dark, leafy greens are very high in chlorophyll. Increase your intake of spinach, kale, collard greens, parsley, wheatgrass and seaweed.Try incorporating these into every meal. Add your eggs to a bed of steamed kale or throw some spinach and wheatgrass in a smoothie. You can also buy dried seaweed chips as a snack.

, Probiotics are good for overall colon health and also specifically help with detoxification. Probiotics decrease an enzyme in your body that causes your colon to hold onto toxins instead of excreting them. While it is a good idea to take a probiotic capsule every day for general health, you may want to take one to two extra probiotic capsules per day during a colon cleanse.You can also get probiotics through yogurt and other foods as well.

, Most people should drink half their body weight in ounces per day for optimal bowel health. This means that, for example, you weigh 140 pounds, you need to drink 70 ounces of water per day, especially if you want to increase your colon health.This may seem like a lot of water, but if you incorporate a glass or two every few hours, it won't seem like so much. Don't try to drink it all at once. This can make you very sick.
It is especially important to increase water intake when increasing fiber intake or taking a fiber supplement. The added fiber in the diet needs added water consumption in order to digest properly.

Know the common symptoms of appendicitis.,
Monitor any pain you feel.,
Be aware that you may feel pain higher up in your body if you are in your third trimester.,
Pay attention if the pain you feel is followed by vomiting and nausea.,
Be aware if you suddenly develop a fever.,
Monitor any paleness, sweating, or lack of appetite that you experience.,
Stay calm and prepare for the visit to your doctor.,
Avoid taking pain medications before going to see your doctor.,
Do not eat, drink, or take any laxatives before seeing your doctor.,
Know that your doctor will feel around your stomach testing for pain.,
Be prepared for a rotation of the hip test.,
Expect a leg extension test.,
Be ready for a rectal exam.,
Be ready to get some blood work done.,
Ask your doctor for an ultrasound.,
Be open to the possibility of other imaging tests.",How to Detect Appendicitis During Pregnancy," These include:


abdominal pain often starting centrally near your belly button and gradually shifting over a few hours towards the right side (this is the most worrisome sign that likely indicates appendicitis)
nausea and/or vomiting (beyond what you may have experienced in conjunction with pregnancy)
fever
lack of appetite. ;
, The most reliable sign of appendicitis is pain that starts out dull in and around your belly button and, after a few hours, shifts over to the right side and becomes more intense. The ""classic"" appendicitis pain is located two-thirds of the way between your belly button and your hip bone (this spot is called McBurney's Point). If you have appendicitis and try to lie on the right side of your body, you will feel the pain more strongly. You may also feel pain when you stand or move.
Some women experience pain when they stand because they have an overly stretched round ligament (something that can occur during pregnancy). However, that sort of pain goes away within a few moments. Appendix pain, on the other hand, does not go away, so this is how you can distinguish them.

, Women who are 28 weeks pregnant and up will feel pain right under the lowest rib on their right side. This is because as your child and your womb grow, your appendix gets moved. Instead of it being located between your belly button and right hip (in McBurney's Point) it will move up your abdomen so that it is pushed right below the right side of your ribcage. , As you most likely know, vomiting and pregnancy go hand-in-hand. However, if you have appendicitis, you will feel pain first and then you will vomit (or the nausea and vomiting will be worsened as compared to what they were previously). Also, if you are later along in your pregnancy (after the initial vomiting stage has passed), nausea and vomiting are much more likely to indicate something else going on like appendicitis. , When you have appendicitis, a low grade fever usually develops. A low-grade fever by itself is not too much of a cause for alarm. However, it is really the combination of fever, pain, and vomiting that should concern you. If you experience all three of these symptoms at once, you should go see your doctor., Both sweating and paleness can be brought on by the nausea and fever you have when your appendix becomes inflamed. You will also lose your appetite - this happens to anyone experiencing appendicitis, regardless of whether they are pregnant or not.

, Going to the doctor, especially in a stressful situation like this one, can be nerve-wracking so it is best to know what you are going to experience. The abdominal exams your doctor will perform are listed in the following steps.


It is best to see a doctor in the emergency room. Appendicitis is a condition that should be treated promptly if you have it, so it is recommended to be seen in the hospital where tests can be performed quickly if needed.

, While you will be experiencing pain, that pain is one of the only ways doctors can diagnose appendicitis in pregnant women so masking it with medication could be detrimental.

, Most people see a physician in the emergency room when they are worried about appendicitis, so the wait shouldn't be too long.


The reason refraining from eating and drinking is important is that an empty stomach is required for certain procedures done by doctors. Also, it is easier on your digestive tract and reduces the chance of your appendix bursting if you do in fact have appendicitis.

, There are a variety of tests doctors perform in order to determine the cause of abdominal pain to figure out whether or not it is appendicitis. These include pressing around your abdomen to elicit painful areas, as well as tapping and testing for ""rebound tenderness"" (pain after they release the pressure of their hand). The tests may seem redundant and time-consuming, but know that these can be very helpful to your doctor in figuring out exactly what is going on.

, This test will look for the ""Obturator sign,"" which is pain that occurs when your hip is rotated. Your doctor will hold on to your right knee and ankle and then bend your hip and knee while rotating your leg inwards and outwards. Pay attention to any pain you feel in your lower right quadrant of your abdomen - tell your doctor if you feel pain in that area because it could mean that there’s an irritation of the obturator muscle happening, which is a sign of appendicitis., Your doctor will ask you to lie on your side, and he or she will extend your leg asking if you feel pain. This is called the ""Psoas test"" and, when positive for increased pain, it is another indicator of appendicitis. , Although the rectal exam does not relate directly to the diagnosis of appendicitis, many physicians have been trained to do it as a way to exclude the possibility of something else going on. So do not be surprised if this occurs during the visit with your physician. , Your white blood cell counts are usually elevated with appendicitis. However, this test is less helpful in pregnant women than in other patients; this is because your white blood cell counts are already increased in pregnancy, so it does not necessarily indicate appendicitis., Ultrasound is the ""gold standard"" (most highly recommended) diagnostic test for appendicitis in pregnant women. It uses ultrasound echoes to create a picture and to help doctors see if you have an inflamed appendix. Generally people who come into the ER with suspected appendicitis receive a CT scan. However, most doctors prefer ultrasound in pregnant women because it won't cause harm to your baby. Ultrasounds can successfully detect the majority of cases of appendicitis., After 35 weeks of pregnancy, all imaging tests become complicated because of the size of the pregnancy making it hard to see the appendix. At this point, your doctor may recommend a CT scan or an MRI to better visualize the appendix to see if it is inflamed. "

Ask your doctor.,
Use laxatives.,
Take fiber supplements.,
Consider magnesium.,
Ask about N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).",How to Detox Your Colon2," There are many colon-cleansing supplements on the market today. Some are designed to help to flush the colon of impurities, while others are made to support your organs in the act of detoxification. Before you take any of these supplements, you should consult with your doctor to make sure these products are safe for you.

, Laxatives are products that stimulate your colon to work faster and to empty its contents. Take great caution with laxatives, because they can cause uncomfortable cramping and diarrhea if taken in high doses. They can also cause other side effects such as belching, bloating, gas, or stomach cramps. Try brands such as Milk of Magnesia, Miralax, or Dulcolax.


If you use laxatives on a long-term basis, your colon will actually become dependent on them, so make sure to use them only for a few days a time.If you want a more natural laxative, a gentle laxative tea is usually sufficient during a colon cleanse. Step one to two tea bags of Yogi Tea Soothing Mint Get Regular Tea in hot water for five to 10 minutes. Drink the tea at night. Six to eight hours later you should have a normal bowel movement., In addition to fiber-rich foods, supplements that contain fiber bind toxins and help the colon excrete them. Add two tablespoons per day of rice bran, psyllium, or oat bran fiber. An easy way to consume fiber is to add it directly to smoothies or oatmeal.


Make sure to drink lots of water when you are adding fiber supplements. Otherwise, fiber can cause constipation or intestinal obstruction.
You can also take dissolvable fiber supplements, such as Benefiber and Metamucil., Magnesium gently draws water into your colon and has a natural laxative effect. Unlike herbal or over-the-counter laxatives, magnesium is non-addicting and will not cause dependence when used long-term.


Take 300 to 600 mg of magnesium citrate per day. Make sure not to exceed 900 mg per day because excessive magnesium can cause health issues.
You can also buy liquid magnesium citrate and drink it instead of using a supplement. Make sure the amount in the drink does not exceed 900 mg of magnesium a day., N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a precursor to glutathione, which is one of the major detoxifying substances in the body. It is found in many natural foods such as some yogurt and protein rich poultry, but it can also be taken as a supplement when you are detoxing your colon. When you supplement with NAC, your body turns it into glutathione that can be used to help you detox more quickly and effectively.


Take 500 to 1500mg of NAC per day in capsule form during a cleanse. You can buy these supplements in health stores or pharmacies.

"
Use castor oil packs.,
Try an enema.,
See a natural doctor.",How to Detox Your Colon3," Castor oil packs aid in the elimination and detoxification of the colon. Get a flannel cloth, which can be cotton or wool, plastic saran wrap, a bath towel, a hot water bottle or heating pad, and castor oil. Pour oil onto the flannel until it is well moistened. Lie down, placing the flannel directly onto your abdomen. Place plastic wrap over all sides of the flannel to prevent staining of your clothes or bedding. Wrap the towel around your torso over the plastic. Then apply the hot water bottle or heating pad (set to medium) over the towel. Rest for 10-30 minutes. Remove the flannel and clean your abdomen. You may reuse the flannel without washing it for approximately 3 weeks. , Enemas can be used to help with bowel cleansing during a detox program. When you do an enema, you inject fluid into your colon in order to stimulate a bowel movement and help flush the colon of impurities.


Like laxatives, enemas can cause dependence if used too frequently, but they are safe and effective when performed properly during a short-term cleanse., Natural doctors, like naturopaths, are trained in how to safely and properly detoxify their patients. A naturopath can look at your medical history as well as you medications and decide what kind of detox protocol would be best for you. They can tell you how often you should get colonics, and they can also prescribe herbs, supplements, and home treatments to help your body detox safely and naturally.

Consider a colonic.,
Ask your doctor about the procedure.,
Make sure you have at least one bowel movement per day.",How to Detox Your Colon4," Colon therapists perform colonics, or colon irrigation procedures, at their offices each day. Colonics can be somewhat uncomfortable, but they can be very effective in detoxifying the colon. Make sure you go to a colon therapist who is trained in practicing safe and sanitary procedures.

, If you are having colon issues, ask your doctor about a colonic and what to expect. During a colonic the colon therapist gently inserts a tube in your rectum. The tube is attached to a pump that forces water or some other liquid into your large intestine. After your colon is saturated, the therapist removes the first tube and carefully inserts a new tube. The therapist will massage your abdomen to expel the water and waste from your colon.


The therapist may repeat the process to fully cleanse the bowels. Up to 16 gallons of water can be pumped and expelled during this procedure.
Subsequent procedures may involve water treated with probiotics, herbs, or coffee, which help extract things from your colon., The longer that stool stays in your colon, the more time your body has to re-absorb toxins. Many of the changes listed above should help you to have a daily bowel movement if this is not happening for you currently.


If you have improved your diet and tried other options to help and are still not going once a day, it is a good idea for you to visit your doctor for further evaluation and advice.
If you are having more than 2 bowel movements per day or your bowel movements are loose, consider consulting with a doctor before proceeding.

Irritable bowel syndrome
Difficulty digesting fiber;
, Though this natural remedy is frequently used, it is unclear if it is actually effective against gas. If you are interested in trying it, you can purchase it at your local pharmacy. The following contain charcoal:Charcoal Plus
CharcoCaps

, These medications are supposed to help break up uncomfortable gas bubbles in your digestive tract and make them easier to pass. While frequently used, these products haven’t been scientifically proven to be effective. If you try them, read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the packaging. Common brands include:Mylanta
Gas-X
Mylicon
Gelusil

, If you really enjoy eating beans, cabbage, and broccoli, and don’t want to cut back, the solution may be to use Beano. This product contains enzymes that help your body break down foods without producing as much gas.You can purchase Beano at your local pharmacy. It is available as tablets and drops.

The following foods often produce gas when digested:Cabbage
Brussels sprouts
Cauliflower
Broccoli
Beans
Lettuce
Onions
Apples
Peaches
Pears

, Though fiber is healthy and helps move foods along your digestive tract, it can also increase the amount of gas in your bowels. High fiber foods include whole-grain breads, brown rice, whole-wheat, and bran.If you have recently changed your diet to include more fiber, either by taking supplements or switching to whole-grain foods, consider easing into your new diet more slowly. Reduce the amount of fiber you are eating and then slowly increase it again. This will give your body a chance to adjust.

, Your body digests fatty foods slowly. This extra digestion time means that there is more time for the food to generate gas as it breaks down. Ways to reduce your fat intake include:Reduce the consumption of industrially made bakery products, as they contain very often the combination of sugar(refined), yeast and saturated fats like palm tree fat and/or corn starch syrup. This can affect the composition of your intestinal micro-flora.
Eat lean meats like fish and poultry instead of fatty red meats. If you do eat red meat, trim off the fat from the edges.Drink low fat or skim milk instead of whole milk. Though you need some fat to be able to properly process fat soluble vitamins, most people eat too much.Cook at home. Restaurant food is usually rich in cream, butter, and oils. By cooking for yourself you can control how much fat you put in your food. Fast foods are usually particularly high in fat.

, If you are dieting and trying to cut your sugar intake, go easy on the sugar replacements. Some people have difficulty processing them and get gas or diarrhea.

Some people can drink milk if it has been thoroughly and vigorously boiled first.
Ice cream.
Cream.
Cheese.

, Fermented dairy products like yogurt and kefir have life bacterial cultures in them. These bacteria may also help your body break down foods and digest them properly. If your digestive problems have occurred due to either of the following, eating yogurt may be helpful for you:You have irritable bowel syndrome.
You recently took strong antibiotics which may have reduced the normal healthy gut bacteria in your digestive tract.

, If you eat a lot of salt, it will make you thirsty and cause your body to hold water to balance your electrolytes. If you frequently feel thirsty after eating, consider reducing your salt intake by:Not adding table salt to your food. If you are in the habit of doing so, consider taking the salt shaker off the table.
Don’t salt the water for cooking pasta and rice. Reduce the amount of salt you put on meat before cooking it.
When purchasing canned goods, look for cans that say low sodium. This means low salt. Many products are canned in salt water.
Eat out less. Restaurants often add significant amounts of salt to their food for flavoring.

, Exercise will stimulate your body to move food through your system, reducing the time that it may sit in your bowels and ferment. In addition, it will help you control your weight, increase your metabolism, and relax you physically and mentally. The Mayo Clinic recommends 75–150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, or 15 to 30 minutes five times per week. Choose an activity that you enjoy. Many people like to jog, walk, bike, swim, or join local sports teams like basketball or volleyball.
Start out easy and work up to more strenuous exercise. If you have health problems that may make it unsafe for you to exercise, consult your doctor before starting.

, If you are constipated, the feces are not moving through your system as they should. This means that they have extra time to ferment in your bowels and are likely to produce more gas. They may also block the passage of gas.Eating frequent small meals keeps your system continually busy without burdening it with more than it can handle. Try eating less at your normal meal times and then adding a snack between breakfast and lunch and then again between lunch and dinner.

, People often swallow air without recognizing that they are doing it. If you have any of the habits below, you may want to consider making changes.Smoking. Smokers often swallow air when they smoke, leading to bloating and gassiness. You can reduce bloating, and your overall health by quitting.
Sipping drinks with a straw. Similar to smoking, the act of sucking in air makes you more likely to swallow it.
Gulping your food. People are more likely to swallow air when they eat too fast and don’t take the time to chew. Make a conscious effort to eat more slowly. It will also make you less likely to over eat.
Chewing gum or eating hard candies The process of chewing gum or sucking on candy and tasting the flavoring makes you produce saliva. This causes you to swallow more often, increasing the likelihood that you will swallow air.

, Fizzy, or carbonated, drinks taste good, but they release carbon dioxide gas into your system. By cutting them out of your diet, you can lower the amount of gas you have in your gut. This includes:Carbonated sodas and sparkling water
Many alcoholic beverages including those that are mixed with sodas

, Your body naturally produces stress hormones when you are under a lot of pressure. These hormones can alter your digestion. If you are under a lot of stress, try managing it as a way of alleviating your body’s response to it. Not only will you feel more relaxed, but it may also improve your digestion.Use relaxation techniques. There are several methods that many people use, you can try different ones until you find what works best for you: visualizing calming images, meditation, yoga, massage, Tai chi, music therapy, art therapy, deep breathing, or progressively tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body.
Get enough sleep. Most adults need at least seven or eight hours of sleep per night. If you are well rested you will be better able to withstand the stress in your life and to devise creative solutions to your problems.Maintain a social network with friends and family. Keeping up your social relationships will provide you with social support. If the people you care about are far away, you can communicate by phone, letter, email, or social media., You should also see a doctor if your pain is so severe that it prevents you from living your life. The following symptoms may also indicate an underlying condition that needs treatment:Nausea that doesn’t go away
Black, tarry stool or bright red bloody streaks
Severe diarrhea or constipation
Chest pain
Unexplained weight loss

, There are several conditions which can have similar symptoms to gas. This means that if you aren’t sure that your symptoms are just gas, you may want to get checked by a doctor. The following conditions may produce symptoms that feel like gas:Appendicitis
Gall stones
An obstructed bowel
Irritable bowel syndrome
Heart diseases

, Be honest and open with your doctor. In order to best diagnose you, your doctor will need to examine you physically and talk about your diet.Let your doctor tap your abdomen and listen to whether it sounds hollow. If so, it suggests you have a lot of gas.
Your doctor will also listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope. Loud rumbling and gurgling noises may be a sign that the intestines are full of gas.
Give your doctor an honest summary of your eating habits.
Provide your doctor with your medical records, including a complete list of medications, supplements, and vitamins that you take.

Take anti-inflammatory medication.,
Keep your ankle stable.,
Take medication to deal with your flare-up.",How to Deal with Gout in Ankles with FSGS1," In doing so, gravity will help to reduce the inflammation of the ankle as the blood slowly drains from the inflamed area. The minimum elevation needed is 30 degrees over a period of one hour, so that all the blood will circulate back towards the heart.;
, The patient should try to keep their feet off the ground for as long as possible, until the pain and swelling subsides.

, Gout causes inflammation and redness around the affected joint. Inflammation then leads to swelling which makes the pain worse.

Identify problem foods.,
Steer clear of common problem foods.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat more fiber-rich foods.",How to Cure Stomach Pain2," If you experience stomach pain after eating, then the foods that you are eating may be to blame. One way that you can begin to cure stomach pain is to keep track of the foods that you eat and how they make you feel.Over time, you should begin to notice that certain foods cause stomach pain more than others, while some cause no pain at all. Adjust your eating habits to eliminate these causes of stomach pain.


For example, if you notice that you get stomach pain after eating spaghetti and meatballs with pasta sauce, then that food may be causing your stomach pain.
To determine if the sauce, pasta, or meatballs are causing your stomach pain, try eliminating one component each day.

Eat slowly.",How to Cure Stomach Pain3," Eating a lot of food at once causes stress on your stomach that may be causing stomach pain for you. To reduce this stress, try eating small frequent meals spaced throughout the day.For example, instead of having a big lunch, try breaking your normal lunch into two separate meals. Have one at 12pm and the other at 3pm. You can do the same with your breakfast and dinner as well. Try to eat a small 200 – 300 calorie meal about once every three hours during the day.

Keeping track of how much you eat in a food diary is the best way to see if you are burning more calories than you are eating each day.Get one hour of moderate exercise most days of the week.Losing weight is easier if you incorporate plenty of cardiovascular activity such as brisk walking, biking, or swimming. Find something that works for you and stick with it.

Avoid fad diets. Losing weight takes time and fad diets that promise that you will lose lots of weight overnight will probably require you to deprive yourself and you may also end up gaining back the weight you lost after the diet is over., Lying in bed can result in stomach acid rising up and this may lead to stomach pain. One way to reduce this factor is to elevate your upper body while you sleep. You can do this by raising up the head of your bed while you sleep or by placing some pillows under your upper body.Keep in mind that using extra pillows under your head will not help since this will only cause your head and neck to bend forward. It is important to make sure that your entire upper body is elevated.

, Stress is a common cause of stomach pain and other digestive issues as well. To manage stress, make sure that you incorporate some relaxation exercises into your daily routine.



Practice deep breathing exercises. Taking a few minutes to breathe deeply can also help you to manage stress. Try inhaling slowly through your nose to the count of five, then exhale slowly through your mouth to the count of five. Repeat this deep breath exercise for about 5-10 minutes.Listen to soothing music. Music is a great way to change your mood and soothing music can help to reduce stress when it strikes.

Understand why a proper diet can help you deal with gout.,
Lower your intake of animal-based proteins.,
Avoid foods that are high in saturated fat.,
Stick to foods that contain monosaturated fats.,
Cut beer out of your diet.,
Stay away from foods that contain fructose.",How to Deal with Gout in Ankles with FSGS2," The most important way to reduce the risk of gout in patients suffering from focal segment glomerulosclerosis is through a proper diet.


Remember that most of the purine in the body comes from the food we eat. Limiting purine consumption limits the uric acid in the body which decreases the risk of gout.
Another factor to consider is that due to FSGS the uric in the body is not excreted. Since purine it not excreted, limiting high purine food is necessary to prevent the accumulation of uric acid in the body.

, Animal proteins are high in purine. These foods include organ meat (liver, kidney, and brains), lamb, beef, pork, chicken, anchovies, sardines, mackerel and scallops.


Other seafood such as tuna, shrimp and lobsters also contain purines. Decreasing consumption of animal protein will help you prevent gout.
Limit meat, poultry or fish to 113 to 170 grams per day.

, Saturated fat is also bad for those who are at high risks for gout. High saturated fat in the body may lead to obesity. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of having hyperuricemia.


Saturated fats also decrease the elimination of uric acid in the body. Food high in saturated fats include deep fried food, high fat cuts of meat, chicken with skin, butter, ice cream, lard, palm and coconut oil.

, Opting for healthier alternatives that the foods listed above may help to decrease the saturated fat in your body. Instead of using oil that is high in saturated fat choose oil that contains monounsaturated fats.


Olive oil, Canola oil, Sunflower oil, and peanut oil are examples of oil that are monounsaturated fats. Replace butter or margarine with healthier options such as peanut butter
When preparing a meal with meat, remove the fat from the meat or the skin from the chicken. This will limit the saturated fat that gets into your body.

, Studies have shown that beer is linked with gout. Beer interferes with the elimination of uric acid in the body.


A better option instead of beer is wine. Studies have shown that one to two five ounces of wine a day do not increase the risk of gout.
When drinking wine, just remember that too much wine may still cause gout. Limiting your intake to 2 glasses is recommended.

, Fructose is also known to increase uric acid. This is because the metabolism of fructose in the liver drives increases the production of uric acid.


Foods that are high in fructose are table sugar, corn syrup, honey, molasses, maple syrup, fruits and fruit juices. You are advised against consuming more than 32 g (8 tsp.) of sugar based or fructose based foods daily in order to reduce the risk of gout.
Instead of using the syrups and sugar stated above, use applesauce as a healthier alternative. Fruits such as watermelon, strawberry, avocado and kiwi have a low fructose content.

Stay hydrated.,
Manage your weight if possible.,
Talk to your doctor about discontinuing certain medications.",How to Deal with Gout in Ankles with FSGS3," Liquids, specifically water, play a major role in the body’s health. Water is needed by the body to help the kidneys get rid of waste in the body.


Drinking eight glasses of water every day makes the kidney more active in removing the excess uric acid produced in the body.
It also lessens the formation of crystallized uric acid in the joints.

, Doctors usually advise FSGS patients suffering with gout to adopt any reduced-calorie diet containing low quantities of protein and low amounts of fat.


Obesity is closely associated with gout, although the exact link isn’t understood.

, The traditional medications used for gout such as prednisone, allopurinol and colchicine are not usually used in kidney patients suffering from gout, as medications have negative side effects on the kidneys.


These medications may worsen the disease and since the kidneys are the root cause of gout, the integrity of the kidneys must be maintained.
Immunotherapy is the one of the best options for kidney patients suffering from gout.

"
"
Understand the basics of immunotherapy.,
Get your kidney biopsied.,
Protect yourself from infections when undergoing immunotherapy.",How to Deal with Gout in Ankles with FSGS4," Immunotherapy is a treatment which stimulates the immune system to fight kidney disease. This type of therapy consists of six steps: exact diagnosis, blocking the immune reaction, immune tolerance, immune adjustment, immune clearance and immune protection.


In exact diagnosis, doctors run series of tests for autoimmune kidney damage. This test will confirm the type, amount and depositions of the antibodies the patient has.
Blocking immune reaction is done to block the damages. Before progressing to the other steps of immunotherapy, it is important to block the autoimmune reaction of the body to the kidneys. This is because the body attacks the kidneys during the disease process. To stop that the immune system must blocked and reset. This is what immunotherapy does.

, Before immunotherapy, a kidney biopsy must be done to determine the types of antibodies and immune complex that resulted in the kidney damage.


A biopsy is when a small section of the kidney is removed. With any kidney biopsy a patient must fast the day before, and then lie flat on a bed for 4 hours after the procedure.
When the type of antibody and immune complex that attacks the kidneys is determined, immuno-suppresants are given to weaken these antibodies. This is when the blocking happens. The antibodies are weakened and this stops the damage to the kidneys.

, Since antibodies are weakened during immunotherapy and since antibodies help our body fight infection, during this period of treatment the body may susceptible to diseases.


Therefore, precautions must be taken to ensure that the patient will not contract any infection.
Wearing a mask and avoiding contact with sick people are good precautionary measures.

Understand what osmotherapy is.,
Be aware of how the practitioner will prepare the treatment.,
Know that you will be asked to lie down on the medicine bags.,
Understand that this procedure works with the use of osmosis.",How to Deal with Gout in Ankles with FSGS5," Since a decrease in the function of the kidneys is the cause of gout in FSGC patients, it is important that the root cause of the gout be addressed. One of the therapies that address FSGS is Micro-Chinese osmotherapy.


This is a modern Chinese therapy which involves the repair of the renal cells. This treatment requires an osmoscope, osmotic medicine, penetrants, electrode plates, vessels, powder and heating oven.
The procedure is usually done by those who practice alternative medicine but it can also be done at home. The necessary can be bought in herbal shops.

, This treatment is done by soaking the osmotic medicine in a penetrant. Then the soaked medicine bag is warmed in the heating oven until it is heated thoroughly. It can also be heated in a microwave for 2-4 minutes.


After that, a clean cloth is placed in the bed to avoid spillage in the bed.The two electrode plates are placed on the sanitary cloth with the wire edges of the two electrode plates slightly further than the opposite ends of the two plates.
The two medicine bags are placed on the two electrodes with the cloth separating them in the middle. Pressure is applied to the two medicine bags to make them flat.

, Lie down on the two bags with the kidneys right on the two medicine bags. Attach the osmoscope to the power source and pick electrotherapy mode.


The procedure lasts for 45 to 90 minutes, but can be repeated a second time. After the procedure remove the power and wipe the medication from the renal area.

, This procedure allows the medication to be easily absorbed by the body through osmosis.


The medication acts directly on the kidneys through the skin, blood and meridian system of the waist and back.
The direct contact with the skin releases a high concentration of the medicine. The procedure removes the immune complex and the necrotic tissues or scars from the kidneys.

See a doctor or naturopath for long-term constipation.",How to Deal With Constipation," Sorbitol, a sweetener used in most sugar-free gum, is an ingredient in lots of laxatives. If you're suffering from a bout of constipation and want to get things moving, chew a couple pieces of sugar-free gum.


Don't use this as a long-term solution. High levels of sorbitol can cause stomach irritation and other digestive problems.;
, Coconut water is increasingly popular as an after-workout drink, and it has natural laxative effects, as well as diuretic properties and other positive health benefits. Drink one bottle of coconut water to help relieve symptoms, or drink the milk of one raw coconut.Don't overdo it. Too much coconut water can have the opposite effect, giving you very loose stools.

, If you're suffering from constipation, take a tablespoon of all-natural extra virgin olive oil and one tablespoon of lemon juice in the morning on an empty stomach. Olive oil is a common home remedy used to promote digestion and lubricate stool.Similarly, flax oil and orange juice is a common, but unverified, home remedy for constipation.In general, doctors do not recommend using mineral oil or castor oil for constipation remedies. Mineral oil can cause problems such as vitamin deficiencies, and castor oil can lead to long-term constipation.

, The benefits of drinking warm lemon water in the morning are somewhat hard to pin down, but this is an increasingly popular home tonic thought to have any number of weight-loss, skin care, and cold-prevention properties.It's true though that lemon juice stimulates liver function, helping you digest food more thoroughly, making your stools easier to pass.


Drink one cup of warm water with a tablespoon of lemon juice added first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach. For added nutritional benefit and taste, add a small amount of raw honey and some turmeric powder.

, All-natural yoghurt, fermented kombucha drinks, and naturally-fermented sauerkraut are all excellent sources of probiotic bacteria, which are commonly used to treat digestive issues, including constipation and diarrhea. If you've been constipation as a result of viral infection or other illnesses, foods containing probiotics can be a solution.


While the research regarding probiotic cultures and constipation is somewhat mixed, and probiotics are typically used to treat diarrhea, it's true that intestinal flora is an essential part of overall digestive health.
Some favor the prebiotic approach over the probiotic approach because if you feed your existing probiotics, you encourage growth of the good bacteria—as opposed to ingesting good bacteria from another source (typically cows). With prebiotics you are establishing you own stable healthy gut, and don’t have to rely on feeding it new bacteria. You create a situation of competitive exclusion whereby the bad bacteria is less able to find food to eat because the good bacteria is growing faster, outnumbering the bad bacteria and out-eating the bad bacteria.

, For a lot of people, a morning cup of coffee is a quick way to get things moving. The stimulant properties of caffeine do stimulate your intestinal muscles, making it somewhat easier to have a bowel movement. Drink a cup of coffee or some caffeinated tea in the morning to temporarily and quickly relieve constipation.


Don't use this as a long-term solution to your morning toilet routine.Coffee is a diuretic, which means it draws water out of your stools and makes them more difficult to pass. Limit your caffeine in-take as much as possible.

, Available in most groceries stores, a few ounces of natural aloe vera juice every couple of hours can help to relieve constipation. Dried aloe vera is also commonly available in capsule form at natural food stores for use as a constipation treatment., Dandelions do have a purpose. Tea made from dandelion root is a common and effective constipation remedy, rich in phytonutrients.Dandelion root is used in a variety of natural herbal blends available commercially, for things as diverse as constipation relief, liver function, kidney function, and other digestive issues. It also tastes great and is widely available.

, Sometimes, you just get backed up. But if you struggle with constipation regularly, lifestyle changes are in order. It's recommended that constipation sufferers drink as many as two liters of water a day, to prevent dry stool.


Carry a refillable liter bottle around with you during the day, and try to drink it through once before lunch, and once after. Easy to remember.
Start your day with a glass of water to help you remember to keep drinking throughout the day.
Avoid over-consuming alcohol. Alcohol and caffeine can both leech fluids from your system, causing drier stools.

, Possibly the single most important lifestyle change to keep things moving is getting enough fiber in your diet, which makes stool bulkier and softer. If you suffer from constipation, you need more fiber. Gradually increase the amount of fiber in your diet until you're getting at least 20 to 35 grams (0.71 to 1.2 oz) of fiber daily. Good fiber sources include:


Bran and other whole grains found in high-fiber cereals, breads, and brown rice
Vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, carrots, and asparagus
Dark and leafy greens like kale, spinach, and chard
Fresh fruits, like apples, berries, plums, and pears
Dried fruits such as raisins, apricots, and prunes
Beans, legumes, and lentils

, A diet high in saturated fats often causes chronic constipation and other health problems. If you eat a lot of cheese and other dairy products, processed foods, and meat, this diet can make your constipation worse.


Try replacing red meat with leaner sources of protein, like fish and beans.
Try cooking more of your own meals, to avoid consuming too many processed and packaged foods, which are typically very high in saturated fats.

, Unlike laxatives, you can take fiber supplements, sometimes called ""bulk-forming laxatives,"" every day. These help to make your stool bigger and softer. Although they are safe to use regularly, bulk-forming laxatives can interfere with your body's ability to absorb certain medicines, and they may cause bloating, cramps, and gas in some people. Drink a lot of water when you take a fiber supplement.


Common fiber supplements and bulk-forming laxatives available over the counter include Metamucil, FiberCon, and Citrucel.

, Moving your body and getting plenty of cardiovascular exercise will keep your bowels moving, too. Increasing the amount of energy you exert helps to wake up your digestive tract and keep your digestive system functioning properly.


Wait about an hour after a meal to exercise. You need to allow enough time for blood to flood to your stomach and digestive organs to allow for proper digestion.
Just taking a walk after a meal can be one of the best types of exercise for promoting healthy bowel movements.Try to walk for at least 10-15 minutes three times a day, if you can.

, Everybody's busy, but we all need to use the toilet on a regular basis. Regardless of what constipation treatment you use, give yourself enough time at a regular interval to sit on the toilet when you need to go. Don't wait, go now.


Never hold it in. Holding in the urge to go can make your constipation worse.
If you regularly go in the morning, but rush right off to work, try waking up a little earlier and eating breakfast at home. Give yourself plenty of time to relax and use the toilet before you go off into the world.

, Many people miss out on one of the most important parts of the digestive process: chewing properly. Food starts being broken down in the mouth, where your saliva completes an important stage in the digestive process. Make sure you slow down while you're eating, taking the time to chew each bite several times.


Poorly chewed food might not necessarily cause you to be constipated, but it can contribute to intestinal blockages, along with poor fiber, which can cause trapped gas and constipation. Chewing your food poorly makes constipation worse.

, Lots of constipation is caused by high levels of stress. If you're overworked, overbooked, and generally just stressed out, it can affect your digestive tract and result in constipation. Try to allow yourself regular breaks throughout the day, practicing different techniques to help calm yourself down and de-stress.


Try meditating, or using progressive muscle relaxation, focusing your energy on flexing an individual muscle and moving that attention throughout the rest of the body progressively.
Travel constipation is a regular problem for people. If you struggle to make your bowel movements regular when you're traveling, try to be proactive, by

, Most constipation is the result of poor diet. But chronic constipation can happen for a variety of reasons, including Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Crone's disease, and other problems. It can also be the result of medicine you're taking. In that case, stopping the medicine or treating the problem should relieve your constipation.


Ask your doctor about using laxatives. There are a variety of types, including lubricant laxatives, osmotic laxatives, and stimulants. Laxatives can offer short-term relief, but might worsen the situation in the long run. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor before taking osmotic laxatives because they can cause electrolyte imbalances and other problems.
Stool softeners such as Colace and Surfak make stools easier to pass by adding fluid to them. Having softer stool can prevent you from having to strain during bowel movements. Your doctor may recommend one of these products if your constipation is due to childbirth or surgery.
A naturopath can give dietary and lifestyle advice, and look at any underlying health concerns.

Prevent indigestion by avoiding situations or foods that trigger it for you.Spicy, fatty or greasy foods often trigger indigestion.Foods that contain a lot of acid, like citrus and tomatoes, may contribute to indigestion.If you notice a pattern of foods causing you discomfort, discontinue or limit your consumption of these dishes.
You can also download an app to your smartphone to make tracking your diet a little easier.;
, Eating too much food or eating too quickly can trigger indigestion. Never rush while eating. Eating several small meals throughout the day, rather than a few large meals, can help.Here are some other things to try:

Get enough sleep at night.
Try activities such as yoga, meditation, and regular exercise.Engage in relaxing activities that will reduce your overall stress.

, Consume antacids to change the stomach acid that may contribute to indigestion. Liquid antacids act more quickly, while tablets are easier to use or carry with you. Antacids may affect other medications you are taking, so do not take them at the same time. Consult your doctor if you are concerned.Most antacids can be purchased over the counter, but may cause different side effects.
Take an antacid about an hour after eating, or whenever your heartburn usually occurs.
Do not take antacids for a prolonged period of time, as they may cause vitamin B12 deficiency. This is especially true for medications called ""proton pump inhibitors,"" such as Prilosec and Prevacid.If your indigestion continues for more than two weeks, see your doctor.Be aware that there is some evidence that decreasing stomach acid may actually worsen symptoms for some people. It also may be a factor in stomach and small bowel bacterial overgrowth — these studies are ongoing. If you experience a worsening of symptoms after taking an antacid, stop taking them and talk to your doctor.

Check for other injuries.,
Apply a cold pack.,
Take a pain pill.,
Rinse with mouthwash.",How to Heal a Bitten Tongue1," Before you touch the inside of your mouth, take a minute to wash your hands with warm water and soap. If this is not available, use hand sanitizer. The goal is to prevent the germs on your hands from transferring to the now open wound on your tongue, possibly causing infection.Resistant viruses can also cause an infection if they come into contact with a bleeding wound.;
, Your tongue will most likely start bleeding the moment it is bitten because it is highly vascular. Applying pressure to the area will slow the blood flow and allow it to clot. It is important to take action immediately following the injury.If the tip of your tongue is injured, push it up against the roof of your mouth and hold for five second intervals. You can also press your tongue against the interior of your cheek.
If you can reach the wound, grab a piece of ice and place it on the bitten area. You can even hold the ice cube using your hard palate and pressing on it with your tongue if it's not too painful. Move the ice on and off until it melts. You can also place a clean cloth or medical gauze on the area, pressing down a bit as you do so., Open your mouth wide and use a mirror to look inside at your tongue. If the bleeding has stopped and the wound appears superficial, you can continue to treat it at home. If the bleeding continues or increases and the cut seems deep, call your dentist to see if sutures are necessary.


It may also be an emergency if the bleeding is intense. In this case, you should call emergency services.

, Biting your tongue can often be the result of a sports injury or a falling accident. Feel the rest of your mouth to check for damaged or loose teeth, or bleeding gums which can be caused by a tooth fracture. Move your jaw up and down to see if you experience any additional pain. If you have one of these injuries, contact your doctor or dentist., Your tongue will begin to swell right after the injury. This makes it easy to bite it again. Place something cold, such as ice wrapped in a clean cloth, to the wound site. Hold the pack in place for a minute until numbness begins to set in, then remove it. Repeat. You may want to do this several times over the next few days.If a child is the one injured, they may prefer that you use a frozen fruit bar to numb the area., Choose an anti-inflammatory medication that you tolerate well, such as Advil, and take the recommended dosage as soon as you can. This will help to reduce the swelling. It will also counter the onset of pain, which is likely to occur shortly after injury., If you have mouthwash on hand, use it to quickly rinse out your mouth. This will help to clean the area and prevent infection. This is especially important if you were eating when you bit down. Spit out the mouthwash and repeat once more if blood is present."

Brush your teeth.,
Floss.,
Use the right products.,
Get in a routine.",How to Have Great Teeth1," Brushing is one of the best ways to make your teeth look--and feel--great. However, the act of brushing isn't enough. You need to make sure that you are doing it correctly, and frequently. Many people think that more is better, but you should actually only brush twice a day. Increasing the frequency can wear away the protective enamel on your teeth and lead to sensitivity and pain.Spend at least two minutes brushing (each time). Try dividing your mouth into four sections (two up top, two on bottom) and spend 30 seconds on each section.
Don't brush too hard. Too much pressure can cause damage to your enamel, which is the protective covering on your teeth. Instead, brush in firm, but gentle, motions.
Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle and brush in short strokes, making an up and down motion on each tooth.
You should also brush the gum towards your chewing surface to stimulate your blood flow and maintain your antibacterial protection.;
, Flossing is critical for maintaining good oral health, yet it is a step that many people skip. Make sure to floss daily. You will be able to see improvement in your smile--your teeth will have less buildup, and your mouth will also feel clean. Flossing can also help prevent cavities and gum disease.Floss at least once daily to remove plaque from between your teeth. Dentists are split on whether it is best to floss before or after brushing. But they all agree that adding flossing to your daily routine is essential for having great teeth.
Use about 18 inches of floss. Wrap the ends around both hands to give yourself a steady grip. Then move the middle part of the strand up and down between two teeth. Make a ""C"" shape with the floss. This will help you get the curved parts of your teeth. Repeat throughout your entire mouth.
Don't floss too vigorously. Being aggressive near your gums can be painful and cause damage.

, There are a wide variety of toothbrushes, pastes, flosses, and rinses available in drugstores and supermarkets. It's good to have a basic idea of what you need when you are choosing your dental care products. For example, most adults should use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. It has been shown to prevent cavities.Choose a toothpaste that you like. If you prefer a gel, that's fine. If you like the wintergreen flavor, that's fine, too. Dentists report that most brands function in essentially the same way. Picking one that you like best will encourage you to use it more often. The same advice goes for floss and mouthwash.
Consider using an electric (or battery-powered) toothbrush. The advantage to these tools is that you basically just need to guide the brush. This will provide a more consistent stroke.
Be aware that some mouthwashes simply freshen the breath. To make sure the one you are buying will be effective, look for one that contains fluoride and has the ADA seal of approval.Chlorhexidine is the best anti-bacterial substance that works to fight aggressive bacterial species.

, Once you know the basics of proper oral hygiene, it is a good idea to make it a consistent part of your daily routine. Try getting in the habit of brushing your teeth at the same time each day. This will make it feel more natural, and you will be less likely to forget.Try buying two tubes of toothpaste at a time (one whitening, one flouride) and always having a back-up toothpaste. This way, you'll always be prepared to care for your teeth, even if the unexpected happens.

Saying you have stomach pain may not be enough to help your doctor diagnose you properly. Call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms:Indigestion that persists for more than two weeks and does not respond to home remedies.
Significant weight loss.
Nausea or repeated vomiting.
Stool is dark, bloody, or the consistency of tar.
Symptoms of anemia, such as ongoing fatigue or physical weakness.
Chronic use of antacids for indigestion.

, Your doctor may order a blood test to allow her to test for a variety of conditions.A blood test will allow your doctor to test your thyroid functioning and attempt to rule out any metabolic disorders.


Your doctor can also test your blood for celiac disease, an inflammatory condition that can cause symptoms such as indigestion.Your blood can also be tested for anemia, a sign that you may have Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes severe digestive symptoms including indigestion., A stool test can help your doctor discover infection and inflammation.A common bacterial infection, Helicobacter pylori, can cause symptoms of indigestion and may cause peptic (stomach) ulcers.A stool test can also reveal intestinal dysbiosis, an imbalance of bacteria in your digestive system that can cause issues such as indigestion. This can occur if you take antibiotics and do not get your gut flora back to proper levels.Your doctor may test your stool for Giardia lamblia, a common parasitic infection that causes indigestion.If Giardia lamblia is present, your doctor may prescribe a course of metronidazole (Flagyl) or Tinidazole., If your blood test suggests that you may have Crohn’s disease, your doctor may order a colonoscopy. She will use a small, flexible tube and camera to examine the inside of your colon., If your primary physician finds signs of a more serious condition, or if antacids and other medications have not worked to treat your indigestion, you may consider seeing a gastroenterologist. These doctors specialize in treating conditions affecting the digestive system"

Ask your doctor about alternative treatments to treat your indigestion.,
Try enteric-coated peppermint capsules.,
Make chamomile tea.,
Try artichoke leaf extract.,
Try iberogast (STW5).,
Engage in relaxation therapy.,
Take probiotics.",How to Cure Indigestion3," Alternative treatments are believed by some to help soothe or limit the effects of indigestion. Use these treatments in conjunction with your doctor’s orders.Many alternative treatments are not proven clinically and could cause negative interactions with prescription medications or existing medical conditions.
Always ask your doctor before starting any home remedy to avoid any medical complications.

, You should talk with your doctor before using peppermint. Peppermint can help soothe some types of indigestion by calming your stomach muscles and improving bile flow, it can also cause relaxation of the sphincter between the esophagus and the stomach, which can lead to worsening reflux. Using enteric-coated peppermint as opposed to a peppermint tea will avoid the relaxation of the sphincter.

, Chamomile has been used to treat indigestion and other stomach ailments.There is insufficient scientific evidence to say that chamomile will cure indigestion, but it may help relieve some people’s symptoms.You can make a chamomile tea by steeping two to three teaspoons of dried chamomile in one cup of boiling water. Strain the tea after it has steeped for 10 minutes. You can drink this tea up to three to four times per day between meals.People with ragweed or daisy allergies may have an allergic reaction to chamomile. Chamomile may also function like estrogen in the body, so women who have a history of hormone-sensitive cancers should use it with caution. Talk to your doctor before using chamomile., Artichoke leaf extract is believed to work by stimulating bile flow, which helps improve your digestion. You can purchase commercial artichoke leaf extract preparations. Take two 320mg caplets per day.Artichoke leaf extract could cause gas or allergic reactions in some people. People who have allergies to marigolds, daisies, or ragweed are more likely to experience an allergic reaction., Iberogast is an herbal combination preparation that is generally safe to use in treating indigestion.It contains a proprietary blend of extracts of bitter candytuft, peppermint, caraway, licorice, celandine, caraway, angelica root, balm leaf, chamomile, and milk thistle., Stress can trigger the onset of indigestion. Removing stress from your life can help to stop indigestion before it starts, or lessen the effects of it.Ask your doctor about relaxation techniques.
Practice progressive muscle relaxation.
Guided imagery may help you as well.

, Probiotics encourage the growth of the healthy, helpful bacteria in your GI system. Medications, illnesses, and other factors can throw off the balance of bacteria in your stomach and intestines. Taking probiotics may help restore that balance, possibly easing your indigestion. There are different strains of probiotics that are good for different ailments, so talk to your doctor about which kind might be right for you."

Do a saltwater rinse.,
Swish hydrogen peroxide and water in your mouth.,
Rinse with an antacid/antihistamine.,
Use a traditional mouthwash.",How to Heal a Bitten Tongue2," Take 1 cup (250mL) of warm tap water. Add 1 tsp (5 g) of salt and mix with a spoon. Swish this mixture in your mouth for 15 to 20 seconds and then spit it out. You can repeat this process up to three times a day until healed. It is especially effective immediately after meals.The salt helps to kill off bad bacteria in the mouth. This makes the area cleaner and lowers the possibility of infection. It also has healing properties that may help the wound to heal faster.

, Mix equal parts hydrogen peroxide (3%) and water in a glass. Swish this mixture in your mouth for 15 to 20 seconds and the spit it out. Be careful not to swallow. You can repeat this process up to four times daily.Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful antiseptic which will help to control bacterial activity in your wound. It will also act as a cleansing agent by removing debris from the cut and delivering a constant quantity of oxygen to the cells, which also helps to stop the bleeding.
It also comes in a gel form that you can apply directly to your cut using a clean cotton swab.

, Take one part diphenhydramine, like Benadryl allergy liquid, and one part of an antacid, like milk of magnesia, and mix it together. Swish this mixture in your mouth for a minute and then spit it out. You can do this once or twice a day.


Antacids control the acid levels in the mouth which promotes healing. An antihistamine will lessen the inflammation. Combining these medicines creates what some people refer to as a “miracle mouthwash.”If you don’t feel comfortable swishing the mixture, you can also make the solution a bit thicker and apply it as a paste.

, Benzydamine hydrochloride, 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate, or just your standard mouthwash are all good options. Take the suggested amount into your mouth and swish it around for 15 to 30 seconds. Spit the liquid out. Repeat this process after eating. This will help to keep your wound clear of food particles, which also promotes healing by preventing infection."

Continue to use an ice pack or cold compress.,
Apply aloe vera.,
Apply a mouth gel.,
Try an oral adhesive paste.,
Use baking soda.,
Consume honey.,
Apply milk of magnesia to your wound.",How to Heal a Bitten Tongue3," Place a few ice cubes in a plastic bag and then put this on your tongue until the pain is lessened. You can also wrap the bag in a moist hand towel for additional comfort. Suck on a popsicle or drink cold liquids for relief, but nothing that is acidic.


This will stop the bleeding if your cut reopens and it will reduce your pain during the healing process.

, You can purchase aloe vera gel at the drug store. Or, you can cut an aloe vera leaf and squeeze out some of the jelly from the inside. Apply this substance to your wound a maximum of 3 times a day. For best results, apply after rinsing your mouth and before you go to sleep at night.Aloe vera is a natural plant-based remedy that has been shown to improve blood circulation. It also combats certain types of harmful bacteria. Just be careful not to swallow the gel directly.You can also apply the gel to a piece of sterile gauze and keep it on the wound. This may provide a longer lasting effect by preventing your saliva from diluting the gel.

, Purchase a numbing and antiseptic gel from your local pharmacy. Orajel, for example, comes in a small tube for easy application. Simply squeeze a bead of the gel onto a clean cotton swab and apply to the wound area. Repeat this application 2-4 times a day until healed.

, This works similarly to the mouth gels. Take a bead of the paste, put it on a swab, and apply it to the wound site. Repeat this method up to 4 times a day until healed. You can also apply the paste directly with your finger.

, Mix a teaspoon of baking soda with water until it forms a smooth consistency. Dip a cotton swab into the mixture and apply it to the bitten area. Baking soda lessens the produce of acids and bacteria. It is helpful in reducing swelling and inflammatory pain., Fill a teaspoon up with honey, lick the it off or drip it onto the wound area. Repeat this process twice a day. The honey will coat your mouth and prevent the accumulation of harmful bacteria. For even better results, add a dash of turmeric to the honey. Turmeric is antibacterial and will help in the bacteria fight, which will promote healing when it is combined with bee propolis., Dip a cotton swab into a bottle of milk of magnesia. Apply the medicine to the wound area. You can do this three to four times a day. It is even more effective when used after a rinse. Milk of magnesia is an active antacid. It will make the environment of your mouth more hospitable for good bacteria."

See your dentist.,
Check the fit of your dentures.,
Avoid irritation from orthodontic appliances.,
Wear protective gear.,
Manage your epilepsy safely.",How to Heal a Bitten Tongue4," You need to visit your dentist at least twice a year for routine treatment. If you need additional care due to biting issues, you’ll want to make more frequent appointments. Some people are particularly at risk for mouth injuries, such as those with sharp teeth or those who have lots of cavities that might cause fractures and leave sharp edges, so your dentist can suggest possible solutions.For example, if your teeth are not aligned properly, you might find yourself biting your tongue repeatedly. Your dentist or an orthodontist will be able to offer preventative suggestions.

, Make sure that your dentures fit snugly against your gums and do not move overly much. Your dentures should not have sharp edges. See your dentist to make sure your dentures fit correctly if you are suffering from biting injuries., If you wear orthodontic appliances, make sure that they fit in your mouth without too much movement. Ask your orthodontist about the level of movement that you should anticipate. This will help you to make corrections and avoid biting your tongue. Also, place a small ball of wax over any sharp brackets that may puncture your tongue.

, If you play a sport where you mouth could be at risk, wear a mouth guard and/or a helmet. These devices will stabilize your jaw in the event of an impact and lessen the possibility of tongue biting or other injuries. , If you have epilepsy, provide careful instructions for those around you. Placing an item in your mouth during a seizure may do more harm than good and may lead to biting injuries. Instead, they should call for assistance and roll you onto your side until help arrives.

Choose the right dentist.,
Visit regularly.,
Ask questions.,
Consider a specialist.,
Talk about whitening your teeth.",How to Have Great Teeth2," A lot of people dread going to the dentist. Let's face it, it is really no one's favorite activity. However, if you find a dentist that you feel comfortable with, the experience can definitely be a lot better. Make sure that you feel at ease in her office, and that you are treated respectfully. Of course, the most important part is choosing a dentist who is credentialed and competent.Get some reviews on local dentists. You can ask friends, family, and coworkers if they have an office they recommend. You can also read reviews by current and former patients online.
Ask for a consultation before you have any procedures. This will let you get to know the dentist and make sure that you feel comfortable in the environment. At this time, you can also make sure the office accepts your dental insurance.
If you don't have have dental insurance, you'll want to ask about pricing. You should also feel free to ask if the dentist offers payment plans or a sliding scale.

, Most experts recommend going to the dentist every six months for a check-up and cleaning, which includes polishing, air abrasion, and a professional brushing that relieves gum inflammation. At these visits, you will receive a thorough cleaning and the dentist will check for cavities, signs of gum disease, and other issues. Regular check-ups are important because the doctor can spot potential problems and recommend a treatment plan. Your teeth will also look great after a professional cleaning!Schedule your appointments in advance. Dental offices tend to fill up quickly. By booking in advance, you can secure a time and day that is convenient for you.
Choose a dentist that is convenient. If your dentist is near your home or office and easy to get to, you will be much more likely to go.

, Your dentist and her staff are your best resources for all of your questions about your oral health. During your appointment make sure to discuss any issues that you have. You can also ask for tips about the best way to brush, and recommendations on products that will work best for your particular teeth.Your dentist can also help you understand the importance that your mouth has on your overall physical health. Ask your dentist about the possible links between oral health and conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease., Your primary dentist can also refer you to a specialist if you have any issues beyond general oral care. Maybe your teeth are crooked or the gap between your front teeth has always bothered you. Your dentist can recommend an orthodontist to help you make corrections.


If you have gum disease or erosion, your dentist might recommend you see a periodontist. These doctors specialize in gum care. Remember, your gums are important to keeping your teeth healthy., One of the best ways to feel confident about your teeth is to make them whiter. Unfortunately, brushing alone can't whiten your smile. Ask your dentist to tell you about your options. You could consider getting an in-office whitening treatment or doing it yourself at home.If you opt for professional whitening, make sure to discuss costs. Insurance typically does not cover whitening as it is considered cosmetic.
If you decide to try whitening at home ask your dentist to recommend products that she feels are safe and effective.
If you feel wary about using chemical substances, you can also try natural home whitening.

"
Pay attention to your diet.,
Don't smoke.,
Protect your teeth.",How to Have Great Teeth3," It makes sense that what you put in your mouth can have a big impact on the health and appearance of your teeth. Dentists warn that sugar is the substance that does the most damage to teeth. Make sure to read nutrition labels and avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar.Avoid sodas, fruit juices, and energy drinks. All of these have significant amounts of sugar that can be harmful to your teeth.
There are certain foods and beverages that are good for your teeth. For example, drinking tea (black or green) can slow the growth of bacteria in your mouth. Cheese can lower the amount of acid produced in your mouth.
Eat more calcium. This nutrient supports bone health, which includes your jaw. This can help your overall oral health. Try cottage cheese or low fat milk.

, Smoking is harmful to your overall health and this includes your teeth and mouth. Smoking can cause tooth discoloration, gum disease, cavities, and mouth cancers. One of the most important things you can do to help your teeth look great is to avoid smoking.If you don't smoke, don't start.
If you smoke, try to quit. It is a very difficult process, but well worth the effort. Ask your doctor to recommend a smoking cessation product, such as the patch or a gum.

, In order to have great teeth you need to keep them. This means that you need to try your hardest to keep your teeth safe. If you play any sports, consider wearing a mouth guard. This is especially important if you play contact sports, such as football or roller derby.Mouth guards are also very useful if you grind your teeth. Wearing a guard can help you keep from grinding down the enamel on your teeth while you sleep. Ask your dentist to recommend a product; they might even be able to take impressions of your mouth to make you a customized mouth guard.

Get an endoscopy to confirm the presence of esophageal varices.,
Understand how varices develop.,
Determine the source of your portal hypertension.,
Manage your condition as recommended by a physician.",How to Deal With Esophageal Varices," If they are bleeding, you will likely be rushed to an emergency room and given an endoscopy as soon as possible to determine the source of the bleeding. During the procedure, esophageal varices can be recognized and are often banded (endoscopic band ligation)in order to stop the bleeding and cut off circulation to the esophageal varices. Sclerotherapy is also an option. If an endoscopy cannot be performed, imaging tests are an alternative, although they are not preferred., Esophageal varices are commonly associated with portal hypertension, whereby the portal vein (which normally drains blood away from your digestive system and associated glands and sends it to the liver for filtering) is under increased pressure, so blood is pushed through alternative routes. One of those routes is through the vessels in the esophagus, which aren't really equipped to handle such increased blood flow. Because they're doing overtime, so to speak, they are delicate and prone to rupturing.

, The most common cause is liver damage (cirrhosis), but it can also be the result of severe congestive heart failure, a blood clot somewhere in the portal vein system (thrombosis or Budd-Chiari syndrome), inflammatory disease (sarcoidosis), or a parasitic disease (schistosomiasis; more common in the developing world). Blood tests are necessary to pinpoint the cause. If liver damage is suspected (especially if the patient is an alcohol user or had a blood transfusion in the past), the physician may feel that a liver biopsy is necessary.


In Western countries, the most common causes are alcohol use and viral cirrhosis.Hepatitis B is a more common instigator in the Far East and Southeast Asia, particularly, and South America, North Africa, Egypt, and other countries in the Middle East.Schistosomiasis is more closely associated with portal hypertension in Egypt, Sudan, and other African countries.,


Diet - A dietitian will often recommend that you stop consuming alcohol and begin a low-sodium diet (unless your blood pressure in characteristically low, in which case a low-sodium diet may not be wise).
Medication - Your doctor may prescribe medication to lower your blood pressure, reduce acidity in your digestive tract, and combat the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy (where toxins that would normally be filtered by the liver interfere with cognitive functions).
Surgery

A shunt, or a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), is a tube that carries blood from the liver back to your heart so that varices don't form. Because of complications that can result from having a shunt, it's usually a last resort, or a temporary measure until a liver transplant can be completed.A liver transplant may be considered if there's severe or recurrent bleeding from varices that all other treatments have failed to prevent. You may be placed on a waiting list, and possibly face additional obstacles if your liver damage is due to alcohol consumptions."

Determine if you need to see a doctor.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor if your condition is severe or if it does not improve.,
Get a prescription for antibiotics if necessary.,
Discuss tonsillectomy with your doctor.",How to Get Rid of Pus Pockets in the Throat1," Most sore throats will go away on their own after a few days, but if your sore throat is severe or if it lasts more than seven days, you should see a doctor. A sore throat with pus pockets may also indicate that you have a more serious condition such as tonsillitis or strep throat. Monitor your symptoms and if you experience any of the following symptoms, see a doctor immediately:Absence of cold or flu symptoms
Difficulty swallowing or breathing
Fever over 101 °F (38.3 °C)
Swollen tonsils
Swollen lymph nodes (in your neck)
Bright red throat or dark red spots
White or yellow film or spots in your throat;
, Make an appointment with your doctor if your condition lingers, worsens, or is severe. Your doctor can perform a simple culture of the infection in your throat to determine if it is bacterial or viral.When you go to see your doctor, make sure that you share all of the other symptoms that you have been having to help your doctor make the best diagnosis possible.

, Antibiotics are not useful if the pus pockets in your throat are caused by a viral infection, but they can be helpful if the pus pockets are caused by a bacterial infection. When pus pockets are caused by a bacteria, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics such as erythromycin or amoxicillin.Follow your doctor’s instructions and take the full cycle of antibiotics that your doctor prescribes., Having your tonsils surgically removed may help stop recurring episodes of strep throat. If the pus pockets in your throat are affecting the tonsils, and if the infection is severe, or reoccurring too often, surgical intervention may be required.A tonsillectomy is a relatively simple procedure, but an abscess around the tonsils may also be treated by a simpler surgery to drain the abscess. You will need to discuss your options with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your situation."

Think about if Invisalign is a good option.The invisible aligners can work on many cases that standard braces would apply to, but there are exceptions.The person getting the treatment should be in their teens or older.,
Look at your own teeth.,
Ask your insurance if they cover Invisalign.,
Find a doctor near you.,
List questions you need and/or want to ask the dentist.,
Get impressions made.,
Set a tentative timetable for treatment.,
Take possession of the invisible aligners.,
Ask if you will need additional fixtures.,
Get an accurate list of appropriate cleaners for your aligner trays.,
Put your aligner in.,
Take your aligner out.,
Clean your aligner.,
Brush and floss your teeth before putting your Invisalign tray in.,
Wear your aligners most of the day.",How to Get Straight Teeth Without Braces with Invisalign,"
Does the patient have a more severe problem that requires standard braces or more advanced treatment? You will need to consult with a dentist or orthodontist later on, but considering this early will streamline the process.;
, You can help yourself to determine if invisible aligners will be a viable option by at least generally figuring out your teeth's condition. Remember that your dentist or orthodontist will make the official diagnosis.Look for signs of crowding. This the condition of your teeth being too close together or overlapping in some areas.
You might have spacing problems if your teeth are too far apart.
You may have an overbite problem if your top row of teeth bite forward ahead of your bottom teeth.
You may have an under-bite problem if your top row of teeth bite behind your bottom teeth.
You could have a combination of these or other problems, such as headaches, jaw pain, or TMJ disfunction (including grating or clicking).

, Invisible alignment treatments costs are similar to that of standard braces. Dental and orthodontic coverage may apply to Invisalign the same as braces.Invisalign, just like braces, costs between $5,000 and $6,000.
Insurance may cover half of the treatment cost, but contact your provider to be certain.
If you proceed with the Invisalign treatment, regardless of coverage, you can ask your doctor about a payment plan to help with managing the cost.

, You want to find an American Dental Association (ADA) licensed dentist or orthodontist near you that can administer the Invisalign treatment.This treatment can last for months or a couple of years so you want to make sure you find a health provider that is close by.
You want to also confirm that the provider you choose is covered by your insurance company.

, This treatment will have a major impact on you or your child's health and is a significant investment of time and money.Be especially clear on questions of daily life with the aligners, length of treatment, frequency of orthodontist visits, and cost.
You might start a consultation first with something such as, ""Does my overbite and crowding condition need braces? Can I use Invisalign instead?""
If you are a parent asking for a teen then you will want to be especially careful if the teen breaks the Invisalign tray and you need extras. Learn what the contingency is for a broken tray.
Discuss the post-treatment plan. This will probably include retainer options. This is usually a step necessary for braces, and Invisalign is no exception. This will be discussed also in a later step.

, If your dentist has agreed to the Invisalign treatment, then coming up with a detailed treatment plan is the next step. Your dentist will need accurate image of your teeth to proceed.The dentist can accomplish this a number of ways, including molding, x-rays, and/or 3-D imaging. Your dentist may also take intra-oral photos and photos of your face and jaw for comparison after the treatment is completed.


If molding is used then a thick paste-like material is applied around both upper and lower sets of teeth (not both at once), allowed to dry, and removed, leaving an impression of your teeth in the substance. This mold will be used to create an accurate 3D model of your teeth.
The x-rays and 3D imaging allow for advanced visual recordings of your mouth that may reveal additional conditions within the teeth, jaw, etc.
The dentist may even be able to show you simulations of how your teeth could look with treatment.

, This will vary from patient to patient, but generally should fall within a year to two years for teens and adults.You should determine an estimated time to finish the treatment after your first consultation. Know that this time will shift after subsequent evaluations, and depend on your own cooperation with use of the invisible aligners.
This is a good time to also determine how often you will need to revisit the dentist to check your progress. While you will usually get new trays every two weeks, you may visit the dentist to check in every six weeks or so. This schedule also may need adjusting depending on your actual progress.

, These will be tailor made for your teeth based on the modeling done earlier, and then new ones will be modified to gradually shift your teeth into the desired positions.Generally, you will be wearing these all day and night. You will be taking them out only to eat, perform oral hygiene when cleaning the trays themselves, or swapping out for new trays.
You may need to wear the aligners up to 20 hours a day, or you risk the teeth not settling into the correct position before advancing to the next aligner.
Ask your dentist if they will be putting in your first set or if you will be. It is highly recommended that they help you learn how to put in and remove your first set.

, Sometimes just the tray is not enough for your condition. Additional bands or gripping points may be needed.Occasionally bands, just like with braces, are needed for certain corrective measures, such as fixing an overbite and under-bite. This is done by the bands between the top and bottom alignment trays.
Bands can also be used to rotate teeth.
Sometimes a tooth-colored plastic composite material is placed on certain teeth to serve as anchors to give the alignment trays a better fit and help shift the teeth in the correct direction.

, The Invisalign trays are usually a form of plastic or acrylic that is easily brushed and rinsed, but would not respond well to harsh chemical cleaners.There is a commercially available Invisalign cleaning kit, but it is costly compared to standard cleaning methods. The base kit is $75.
Ask your dentist what substances are safe to brush the trays with, and safe to rinse it under.

, You should have your dentist show you this the first time, but you will need to be able to do it yourself. It may be helpful to do it in front of a mirror the first few times.


To put the tray in, line it up with your teeth. Hold the tray with both hands near the back, in the area of your premolars or first molar. Press the trays up onto your teeth, moving back to front.
Do not bite them into place. This will damage the tray.
There may be tightness and/or pain upon initial wearing of the tray.

, Taking the tray out for eating, cleaning, or to get a new tray is a simple process but should be done delicately.


Slip your finger towards the back of the tray around the back teeth where it's anchored. You might use a fingernail to pry between the aligner and tooth.
Gently pull the aligner off of your teeth from the back towards the front teeth until it's completely off.

, Avoid any harsh chemicals or cleaners.This should be a simple and quick process of brushing and rinsing the tray(s).
Run them under lukewarm water and use a soft toothbrush to scrub off any excess particles from their surfaces.
You can brush the trays with standard toothpaste as well, but just be sure to rinse the trays thoroughly with lukewarm water afterwards. Eliminate any excess material on the trays and leave them clean and dry. Consider doing this especially when brushing your own teeth.

, This is essential to avoid trapping bacteria, food particles, and any other unwanted foreign objects in-between the tray and your teeth.You will need to remove your tray every time you eat. Being able to remove the tray easily, compared to braces, is one of its advantages.
Make sure you brush and rinse before you replace your tray in your mouth after a meal.
If brushing is not convenient, for example you are at work or traveling, then attempt at least to rinse your mouth before replacing the tray and then do a more thorough cleaning when the opportunity arises. Consider carrying a travel-size bottle of mouthwash with you so you can properly rinse.

, You need to wear your aligners approximately 20 to 22 hours a day.Maintain good dental hygiene

You will get new aligners in the next stage of movement for your teeth every couple of weeks if you stay on schedule.
See your orthodontist approximately every six weeks, unless you have scheduled something different to make sure you are making adequate progress or if changes need to be made.

Familiarize yourself with removable partial dentures.,
Determine if removable partial dentures are right for you.,
Consider the advantages of removable partial dentures.,
Drawbacks of removable partial dentures.,
Take care of your partial dentures if you decide to get them.",How to Handle Tooth Loss1," These dentures are an ideal solution for the replacement of one or multiple teeth. The denture consists of a metal frame with a plastic material that simulates the gums attached to the metal. Artificial teeth are attached to the ‘gums’ to replace your missing teeth.Your dentist will take an impression of your teeth and then have the partial denture specifically crafted for your mouth.;
, There are certain instances when these devices are your best option. These instances include:


When there is a single tooth to be replaced: Removable partial denture can easily replace a single tooth and provide stability in your mouth.
When there are multiple teeth on the same side of the jaw or both sides of the jaw that need to be replaced. If this is the case, your dentist will take extra precautions to make sure that the denture des not become dislodged when you eat.
When you do not want to spend as much money as you would when replacing a tooth.
When you have teeth that are not periodontally sound (weak gums and underlying bone). The partial denture can support these unsound teeth and make them less likely to fall out.

, First and foremost, they are the most economic option of tooth loss replacement in prosthodontic dentistry.In addition to this:


Partial dentures are non-invasive because there is no surgery needed.
Their performance does not depend much on the condition of neighboring teeth.
They can be repaired easily.

, These partial dentures are slightly bulky, which means that they will feel a little strange in your mouth. This is because they cover a large surface area in order to support as much of your mouth as possible. Also:


They can cause slight discomfort when chewing, and can make speaking a little challenging.
The plastic ‘gum’ may not match the color of your real gums.

, Clean your dentures with a denture cleanser on a routine basis (every night will keep them in working order).


You can also brush the denture with your toothbrush if need be.

Your physician may prescribe local painkillers to soothe the pain caused by the pus pockets or you can take an over the counter painkiller such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin.Follow the dosage instructions provided with your prescription or over the counter medicine. Do not exceed the recommended dosage.
Do not take anything except for acetaminophen if you are pregnant.
Throat lozenges containing an anesthetic can also be helpful for discomfort

, Prepare a mixture of one cup of warm water and one teaspoon of salt. Mix the solution until the salt is fully dissolved. Gargle with the mixture at least once per hour. The combination of salt and warm water should help to reduce pain and discomfort in your throat., Warm beverages will increase blood flow in your throat, making it easier for your body to fight the pus pockets. Drinking a cup of tea before bed (make sure it’s decaffeinated) will also help you get rid of some of the pain during your night’s sleep., Breathing dry air will not help at all with your condition; your throat may even become more irritated and painful. Using a vaporizer to moisten the air will ease throat irritation and pain. If you do not have a vaporizer, you can simply put a shallow dish of warm water in your room. The water will add moisture to the air as it evaporates.You may also want to try a humidifier, which is available in a cool or warm mist variety.

A pontic: This is the part that replaces the lost tooth or teeth.
An abutment: This is the part that is placed on and derives support from the teeth adjacent to the space of the missing teeth.

, If the space created by your missing teeth is narrow, a dental bridge could be a good option for you. In addition to this, if the teeth adjacent to the space of missing teeth are strongly held by the gums and underlying bone, you should consider a dental bridge. Weak or loose teeth may not work with a dental bridge. Also:


When you prefer a fixed alternative over a removable one.
If you are suffering from epilepsy and cannot afford the risk of choking if your denture was to fall out during an episode.
If you cannot take care of your personal hygiene for a physical or mental reason.

, The most prominent benefit is that a dental bridge looks and feels natural. It acts just like your natural teeth.


You can also speak and chew without having to worry about changes to your lifestyle.

, It is important to know that the tooth material of healthy strong abutment teeth is shaved off for the installation of the bridge. Also:


There are chances for bacterial proliferation and subsequent gum inflammation under the bridge or area between the gums and bridge. These areas tend to be difficult to clean.

Familiarize yourself with dental implants.,
Determine if you think dental implants are the choice you should go for.,
Think about the benefits of dental implants.,
Consider the drawbacks of dental implants.",How to Handle Tooth Loss3," Dental implants have become one of the most well-liked tooth replacement options for dentists and patients all over the world. A tooth implant is basically an artificial tooth root-like structure that is placed within your jawbone.These implants are created from titanium or titanium alloys.

, If your jawbone is healthy and strong enough to support a dental implant, you should consider getting one. It takes a couple of months for the implant to bond with the bone. If the bone itself is weak or the X-rays show that the bone density is not sufficient, the implants won’t bond with the bone. Also consider:


If your gums are healthy and disease-free. Strong gums are indicative of healthy bone structure as well.
If you do not have any bone destructive disease like diabetes

, Dental implants can preserve the remaining natural teeth in their original form. The neighboring teeth are not at all affected as they are when you get a dental bridge. Also:


They work independent of the neighboring teeth just as a natural tooth works independent of the rest of the teeth.
Their aesthetic looks make them more in demand as they look as though they have grown from the gums like a natural tooth.
They are a one-time investment as they are extremely durable and last for a lifetime when oral hygiene is well maintained.

, Dental implants are quite expensive. In addition to this, they are surgically inserted, which means that the installation of dental implants are invasive in nature.


The placement of dental implants is a time-taking procedure as the surgical wound needs time to heal properly.
You have to wait three to six months after you have lost your tooth to get it replaced with a dental implant.

Purchase a rotating/oscillating toothbrush in place of a regular toothbrush.,
Schedule a dental cleaning.,
Limit your intake of foods that stain.,
Make an all natural cleaning and whitening paste with baking soda.",How to Get Rid of Yellow Teeth1," They have been shown to significantly reduce stains on teeth more effectively than a manual brush.However, do not brush your teeth more than three times per day because this can be abrasive to your tooth enamel.;
, Dentists use abrasive agents, dental picks and polishing paste or air polishing powder to remove stains. Some of the yellowing or browning of teeth may be caused by tartar, which is only effectively removed with deep dental cleaning and scaling.


Doctors suggest a cleaning every six months to remove stains and protect teeth and gums.

, The main culprits are coffee, tea, juices, soft drinks and sports drinks. If you must drink them use a straw.


Rinse your mouth with water or brush your teeth about 10 minutes after drinking these beverages if you continue to drink them daily, or they will counteract the work you are doing to whiten teeth.
Also, avoid smoking, which can cause permanent staining.

, Mix two tsp. of baking soda with enough water to form a paste. Dip a manual toothbrush in the paste and brush it in a circular motion on all your teeth surfaces, including the interior ones.


Dip the toothbrush in the paste several times throughout the process.
Repeat this method at least once a week, or up to three times per week, but not for more than four weeks in a row. Be aware that it is important to avoid this treatment if you suffer from enamel hypoplasia, so check with your dentist before starting this home treatment.
You can also replace the water with lemon juice for extra whitening power. Rinse your mouth afterward to get rid of residual acid, which can cause sensitivity."

Ask questions.,
Prepare for the extraction.,
Use the aids provided.,
Follow instructions provided.,
Do not consume hot beverages or foods.",How to Have a Comfortable Experience when Getting Wisdom Teeth Removed," Ask your dentist or oral surgeon exactly what will be done and what to expect after wards. The dentist or oral surgeon works for you, and you are not only the patient, but the customer too. If uncomfortable with his/her explanation or methods, consult another. Have the extraction done by someone that makes you feel comfortable. Ask friends, neighbors or coworkers about their dentists if unsure about whom to use.;
, Having one's wisdom teeth extracted can create anxiety, but the procedure has been done hundreds of thousands of times before without incident. If done in a hospital, it is likely that general anesthesia will be administered and will literally be ""over before you know it"". If done in the dentist's or oral surgeon's office, a local anesthesia may be given instead. The dentist or oral surgeon will determine which is best for your particular needs.

, Regardless of the reason for the extraction, some swelling will result. The amount of swelling and discomfort can be substantially limited by medication and by application of cold compresses. The medical staff will initially provide some or all of this for you shortly after the extraction.

, Regardless of where the extraction(s) takes place; be it hospital or dentist's office, instructions will be provided upon being sent home. These will often detail the use of cold compresses and taking non-aspirin or other ""over the counter"" or prescription pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs. The ""pain"" associated with this procedure is rarely greater than ""uncomfortable"" for very long. Longer periods of discomfort are usually associated with bony impaction. This discomfort is usually less than the pain associated with an abscess or other infection at the site that may have been experience prior to the extraction. Medications suggested or prescribed by the dentist will help manage pain and swelling substantially if taken as directed.

, Keep away from warm or hot food and drink for several days or more. Foods that require chewing should be avoided, but it is likely that cooled soups or broths and cold beverages will be most desirable for at least several days after the extraction(s).

Eat a good diet for oral health.,
Use special toothbrushes and toothpaste.",How to Get Rid of Tooth Pain," One of the first things that you can try – even before at-home remedies – is some quick cleaning. Try to remove any trapped particles of food that are lodged near the tooth and might be causing pain. Carefully work dental floss between both sides of the tooth and dislodge any food particles.After flossing, rinse your mouth thoroughly. Rapidly swish warm water around in your mouth to loosen anything that is left. Spit the water out when done.;
, Until you can apply a remedy, take easy steps to control pain. Avoid chewing with that area of your mouth and with the tooth itself, for one.


You might also try to use a temporary filler. If your tooth is cracked or otherwise damaged, it is possible to cover it for a time with softened chewing gum or dental wax until you can find a more permanent solution.Many drug stores also sell temporary tooth filling kits. These are made from zinc oxide or a similar material, will reduce pressure, and can last up to two weeks. They should cost about $10.
You can also put some wax in the cavity to seal it off and protect it further.
To protect against sensitivity, put some cotton from a cotton roll onto your tooth when you eat.

, Use a non-prescription, over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen to lessen the pain until you can get to a dentist. Follow the instructions on the label to determine the correct dosage.For most pain relievers, you will take one or two pills every four to six hours. Exact dosages will vary by medication and brand, however.
You should be able to buy these at any pharmacy or drug store, at a cost of under $20.
Do not put aspirin or other painkillers directly on the gum tissue. Doing so can cause damage and will certainly irritate the nearby tissue., Over-the-counter topical ointments are another option. These work by numbing the area around your tooth or by application directly to the cavity. The active ingredient in such medications is benzocaine. Follow the label directions to determine the proper amount and application.Topical ointment like Orajel should be available at most drugstores, costing about $10.
Only use topical pain relievers approved for dental use. Other topical pain killers could be dangerous if ingested.
Benzocaine in some cases causes a rare but dangerous condition called methemoglobinemia, which decreases the amount of oxygen in the blood. Children less than 2 should not be given medications with benzocaine, nor should you ever exceed the recommended dosage.

, Another quick way to reduce the pain of a toothache is to numb it with cold. Cold temperatures will reduce blood flow to area. You will experience less pain as the blood flow drops.Wrap an ice cube in a plastic bag or a thin cloth and apply it to the jawline surrounding the pained tooth for 10 to 15 minutes.
Take breaks in 10 to 15 minute intervals. After each break, continue to apply the compress to the pained area as needed.
Make sure that the area has returned to “normal” before reapplying the compress. You may otherwise damage surrounding tissue.

, Cloves are an old standby remedy for toothaches, as they have a natural numbing effect and are also good at killing bacteria. You can use whole cloves, ground cloves, or clove oil to get rid of your tooth pain. If using ground cloves, clean your hands and then apply a pinch of ground cloves between the pained gum and cheek. As the cloves combine with your saliva, they will begin to numb the surrounding tissue.
For whole cloves, use clean hands to place two or three cloves in your mouth near the pained area. After your saliva softens them, gently chew the cloves to release the oils.
Alternatively, mix a few drops of clove oil with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of olive oil. Then, soak a sterile cotton ball in the mixture and hold it against the painful part of your tooth or gum.

, Another way to reduce pain and kill bacteria is to prepare a salt water rinse. Salt is not a cure but can strip the mouth of bacteria and draw moisture out from an inflamed gum surrounding a pained tooth, thereby soothing it.Combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt with 8 ounces (250 ml) of warm water. Allow the salt to dissolve in the water before use.
Rinse your mouth with this solution for 30 seconds before spitting it out. Repeat as needed.
You will most likely want to rinse with fresh water after a salt preparation. With water from the tap, rinse again for 30 seconds.

, Both of these common vegetables are traditional folk remedies for tooth pain and are thought to have antibacterial properties. They may give you bad breath, but they’ll help to kill harmful germs in the mouth and can offer temporary relief.Wedge a clove of garlic between your sore tooth or gum and cheek. Hold it there until the pain subsides.
Alternately, cut a small piece of onion and place it on your affected tooth.

, Bayberry root bark is thought to be a natural antibiotic and also contains tannins and flavonoids, making it astringent. When combined with vinegar to form a paste, is supposed to relieve tooth pain, reduce swelling, strengthen the gums.Grind up a 1-inch (2.5-cm) patch of bayberry bark with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of vinegar. Use more bark or vinegar as needed to form a paste.
Apply this paste directly to the pained area of your mouth and let sit until the pain subsides. Then, rinse it away with warm water.
You can also use an anti-sensitivity toothpaste here, too; you should keep it on your tooth for as long as possible.

, If your teeth are painful or sensitive, a paste made from powdered ginger, ground red pepper, and water can be applied directly to the sensitive teeth to relieve the pain. Both spices may be painkillers.They seem to work even better when used together.


Combine a pinch of powdered ginger with a pinch or red pepper in the bottom of a cup. Add a few drops of water until you can stir the ingredients together into a paste. Dip a sterile cotton ball in the paste. Place the cotton directly on the tooth and hold it there until the pain subsides or as long as you can stand it – the paste will probably be unpleasant.
Only apply this treatment to the affected tooth. Do not apply it to your gum tissue, as doing so may cause irritation or burning.

, Myrrh is a resin that comes from certain thorny trees, and is used in things like perfume, incense, and medicine. Having astringent qualities, myrrh can reduce painful inflammation and also kills bacteria. Hence, tincture of myrrh has long been used as a home remedy for toothaches.In a small saucepan, heat 1 tsp (5 ml) of powdered myrrh in 2 cups (500 ml) of water for 30 minutes. Strain the liquid and let it cool.
Combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of this liquid with 1/2 cup (125 ml) water and rinse with the resulting solution up to five or six times daily.

, Like bayberry root bark, black teas contain astringent tannins that can reduce inflammation. Herbal peppermint tea also has a mild numbing effect and, anecdotally, may relieve pain.Many of these are often used in toothache home remedies.


To use tea as a remedy, microwave the teabag in a small dish of water for 30 seconds to warm it up. Then, squeeze out any excess water.
Press the teabag to your sore tooth or gum ad bite down gently until the pain fades.

, This is not about drinking to dull your pain. Rather, potent liquors like vodka, brandy, whiskey, or gin may have some ability to numb your tooth if applied directly.Soak a sterile cotton ball in liquor, like brandy or vodka, and hold it against the pained tooth. You might also take a sip of whiskey and hold the liquid in your cheek near the pained area.
Any relief from this method will be temporary. Do not try this technique with rubbing alcohol, as well, as it is not safe to ingest.

, Toothache home remedies are not meant to be permanent fixes, but only to help relieve pain. If your tooth pain persists or worsens, you will need to see your dentist for professional treatment.There could be serious problems behind your toothache. These include cracked enamel, tooth decay and cavities, of infection.
See a dentist if your pain does not respond to home treatment, is accompanied by swelling, fever, or pus, is caused by an injury, or makes swallowing difficult. Also seek medical attention if experience jaw pain accompanied by chest pain – the latter may be a signal of a heart attack., A dentist may examine your tooth and decide that the pain is caused by tooth decay – that is to say, areas where bacterial acid has eaten away the enamel and exposed the tooth’s root. Alternately, you may be having an issue with an existing filling that has become loose. In both cases the tooth will need to be filled.After numbing your tooth and gums, the dentist will first drill out the decayed part of the tooth. He’ll then fill the cavity with a composite or amalgam filling.
You might have some choice in the filling material. Composite fillings are usually made from a resin of plastic, glass, or porcelain and will largely match the color of your teeth. Amalgam fillings are usually made from silver and may be stronger, but will not match the tooth’s color.They also release a small amount of toxic mercury.
As fillings age, they may break down or become loose. Your dentist will remove the filling, drill away any new decay, and give you a new filling.

, A dental crown, also called a cap, is used when a tooth is damaged but not lost. It is essentially a hollow, artificial tooth that will restore shape and function, protecting the tooth from further damage. These may be needed in cases of severe tooth decay, pulpitis, abrasion, tooth fractures, or severe infections.If tooth decay is too advanced, or in case of a root canal, a filling may not be sufficient treatment and the dentist will use a cap or crown.
Generally the dentist will give you local anaesthetic. She will then file the tooth down and replace it with a crown made from a customized molding of your tooth. These crowns are made from the same restorative materials as normal fillings.

, It may be that your pain is not being caused by a tooth at all but by your gums. Some people have receding gums. This means that the gums have fallen away from your teeth, exposing thin enamel and nerves, and often leads to overly sensitive teeth.If your pain is due to gum recession, the dentist may prescribe preventative care. Sometimes receding gums are caused by inadequate dental hygiene. Your dentist may advise you to floss regularly, brush with soft-bristles, and use a toothpaste like Sensodyne.
In bad cases, the dentist may send you to an oral surgeon or periodontist for grafting. This means that the surgeon will take tissue from the roof of your mouth and then graft it onto the damaged gums. The tissue should then heal and protect the teeth as it should.This procedure will protect you from future root canals, but it is also an aesthetic procedure that makes patients more confident in their smiles.

, If your toothache is not due to cavities, decay, or injury, you may just have a bit of sensitivity due to enamel loss. There are treatments for this, including ways to gradually de-sensitivize the tooth.A desensitizer is a prescription topical treatment that gradually reduces nerve sensitivity of the teeth. As nerves become less sensitive, you should experience less pain.

, Your pain might also be coming from an infection or inflammation in the tooth pulp or even at the root of the tooth. If so, you’ll need to get this treated right away so that the infection doesn’t kill the tooth or spread.A prescription antibiotic is only needed if you have an infection in your mouth.
Infections usually result from abscesses caused by decay or injury.

, If your toothache is caused by a severely infected or damaged tooth or by an impacted wisdom tooth, you may need to have it removed by a dentist. This should be left as a last option. Once you extract the tooth, it’s gone for good.


Wisdom teeth are usually removed because they can crowd the other teeth in your mouth. As the teeth become crowded, more pressure is applied, causing more pain or possible infection. This crowding can change your bite and be painful; it can also cause TMJ disorders, which can also cause headaches.

, To prevent new or worsening damage, you learn good oral hygiene practices. These will keep your teeth healthy, strong, and pain-free.Brush twice a day and floss once a day. See a dentist at least once per year or even every 6 months for a check-up. She will be able to keep track of any possible problems.While regular brushing and flossing will not be able to turn back time and repair decay that has already begun, it can prevent future decay and may remedy pre-decay decalcification.
Try to carry a toothbrush in your purse or carryall, so that you are able to brush on the go. If you are unable to brush, at least rinse your mouth with water.

, What you eat determines how healthy your teeth are. Whenever you eat sugars, for example, they will react with bacteria to form acids that can eat away at tooth enamel. For better, stronger teeth, reduce your sugar intake.Drink less soda, sugary fruit drinks, sweet tea, or sweetened coffee. Include more water in your diet.
Eat less junk food, including candy and pastries.
Avoid acidic foods and juices, as well, like grapefruit juice, cola, and wine. Choose an “alkaline” or non-acid treat instead, like yogurt, cheese, or milk.

, If your tooth pain is caused by dental sensitivity, consider using a toothbrush and toothpaste specifically designed for overly sensitive teeth. You should be able to find them at most drugstores.


Sensitive teeth are often the result of receding gums. As gums shrink, the tooth dentin below the enamel surface is exposed. Sensitive toothpaste is designed to clean this part of your tooth using gentler ingredients.
Switch to a soft bristled toothbrush. If your tooth pain is related to receding gums, a soft bristled toothbrush can be used to preserve more of your natural gum tissue.
Hard and medium brushes are often effective at scrubbing away decay, but soft toothbrushes are a better option if you struggle with gum-related pain or similar problems.

Ensure you don’t swallow hydrogen peroxide. This method should not be used with children.
This method works fine with stains and also reduces the amount of bacteria, but you should not use this treatment for more than four weeks in a row.

, If you have any concerns about tooth or gum sensitivity, be sure to buy toothpaste for sensitive teeth. Use the whitening toothpaste for six weeks.


Prolonged use of whitening toothpaste can erode tooth enamel, causing the yellow dentin to be exposed and colored food will stain your teeth faster than before., Apply them to your teeth for at least a week. The results can last up to a year.

, These kits can cost $30 to $200, but they are so powerful, they can even lighten your natural tooth color in addition to removing stains.

Enjoy your new smile!",How to Get Rid of Gaps in Teeth," You will need a mirror, a tape measure or ruler with metric markings, a pen, and some paper. This process will be easier with a fixed mirror rather than a handheld one. You can also ask a friend to help if you are comfortable doing so.;
, Look into the mirror and identify the teeth that have gaps in between them. Make notes about the appearance of your gaps and why you would like to fix them. Also make notes on any other imperfections that you would like to fix along with your gaps (tooth size, color, straightness, chips, etc.).

, Using the tape measure or ruler, measure the space in between your teeth that have gaps. Write down the measurements in millimeters.

, These measurements and appearance notes will help you to determine what dental treatment will benefit you the most. The imperfections that you have identified will also help you dentist when deciding on your best treatment option.

, There are a few different ways that your dentist can close a gap or gaps in between your teeth. Before you schedule an appointment with your dentist, think about which option best suits your situation.


If you have a single small gap (less than 5 millimeters), dental bonding might be your best option. Dental bonding is not permanent and the composite material may stain over time (if you smoke or eat or drink colored foods and liquids), but it is the quickest and cheapest method of correcting gaps in between teeth.If you have discoloration and/or chips in your teeth in addition to gaps, then veneers might be your best option.Veneers are custom-made covers for your teeth so they are similar to dental bonding, but they can provide more dramatic, attractive results. In addition, veneers can't stain as they are made of ceramic and a cosmetic dentist can give you a perfectly adapted smile according to your eyes and facial anatomy.
If you have multiple gaps, gaps wider than 5 millimeters, crooked teeth, and you do not want to cover up your existing teeth, then braces might be your best option.Braces straighten your teeth using wires that are attached to your teeth with composite material, much like the material used in dental bonding.
If you have multiple gaps that do not exceed 5 millimeters, then Invisalign might be your best option. Invisalign closes gaps and straightens teeth using a series of ultra-thin, clear aligners that you switch out every two weeks.

, Refer frequently to the notes that you made when you evaluated your teeth and make sure that the option you choose is compatible with your situation.

, This list will come in handy when you go for your consultation with your dentist. You may be able to find the answers to some of your questions by searching the internet, but your dentist will most likely have the best answers.

, When you make the appointment, explain that you would like to schedule a consultation to discuss options for closing a gap or gaps between your teeth.

, These notes will help you to remember specifically what you want to change about your smile and they may help your dentist make the best recommendation for you. You may also want to write down some questions about your preferred treatment options so that you can remember to ask you dentist during your consultation.


Try to be concise and precise about your wishes so your dentist can provide you the exact treatment plans for your needs.

, If your dentist suggests a treatment plan that does not meet your needs or expectations, speak up! Ask why your dentist has suggested this treatment option over something else. It is possible that your dentist may have a very good reason for suggesting a particular treatment, but you’ll never know unless you ask. If you don’t agree with your dentist’s reasons for recommending a specific plan of treatment, don’t feel obligated to accept this option. You can always have a consultation with a different dentist to see if the recommendations are the same.

, If you agree with your dentist’s recommendation, now is you time to find out all of the particulars of the procedure and what you will need to do in order to ensure the best outcome.

, Depending on the treatment option that you and your dentist have decided on, this appointment may be the first of many. Prepare for this appointment as instructed by your dentist and don't forget to ask any questions that you have about your treatment before the procedure begins.

, You may be instructed to avoid or abstain from eating certain foods until your treatment is complete or maybe just for a short period of time. Take this advice seriously because failure to follow these instructions may negatively affect your results and your dentist can easily tell if you didn't do as requested.

, After you have completed your treatment, you will have even more to smile about. You may even consider celebrating your new look by having some professional photographs taken.

Take non-prescription pain relievers.",How to Get Rid of a Tooth Infection1," When you call, say that you think you have a tooth infection so that you can be seen as soon as possible. Make sure that you see your dentist even if the pain goes away. Sometimes pain will subside because the nerves have died from the infection. Common signs of a tooth infection include:an intense, throbbing toothache that does not go away
sensitivity to hot, cold, and pressure while eating or drinking
fever
swollen face and/or cheek
tender, swollen lymph nodes (lymph nodes are glands located under your jaw)
flood of bad tasting and bad smelling fluid, which can be white, gray, or yellow

To drain the abscess, your dentist will use a sterile scalpel to cut open the abscess and allow it to drain. You will be given anesthesia prior to this procedure so that you do not feel the pain., If a tooth infection is severe, then it may be necessary for your dentist to perform a root canal or a tooth extraction. These are two different procedures and your dentist will talk to you about your options.Root canal. A root canal involves drilling deep into your tooth in order to drain an infected tooth. Your dentist will then place a crown on the tooth to seal and strengthen it.
Tooth extraction. A tooth extraction is when your dentist removes a tooth that has become infected.

, In many cases, your dentist will prescribe an antibiotic to help treat an infection. The antibiotic will help to fight off any remaining bacteria from your tooth infection.

Make regular appointments with a dentist.Even if you’re taking care of your oral hygiene very well at home, there are certain things — like removing plaque buildup — that simply can’t be done at home.,
Seek immediate attention if your condition requires it.,
Find a good dentist.,
Know which dentists are in your healthcare network.,
Find low-cost dentists in your area.",How to Get Pink Gums," You might be tempted to skimp on toothpaste, but if you want to improve your gum health, you would be wise to choose a toothpaste specifically designed for it. Pay a little extra and buy a toothpaste that is specially formulated for gum health.;
, There are a surprising number of options you have to weigh when choosing a toothbrush. Should you use hard or soft bristles? A regular or electric toothbrush?


Choose a brush size that’s not too difficult to maneuver throughout your mouth.
Avoid hard-bristled brushes, as they may actually damage your gums and cause gum recession. Soft to medium bristles are recommended.
Look for bristles with rounded tips.
Studies show that the only electric toothbrush significantly better than a regular brush is a “rotation oscillation toothbrush,” in which the bristles move in both a circular and a back and forth motion at the same time.

,


Keep the brush at a 45° angle to your gum line.
Your stroke length should be roughly the length of one tooth.
Use circular strokes for the chewing surfaces of your back teeth.
Brush gently, but firmly.
Applying too much pressure can strip the tooth of enamel and cause receding gums.
Clean the interior surface of your teeth in an up-and-down motion.
Remember to brush the surface of your tongue.

, While the conventional wisdom is to brush after meals to remove food particles, dentists suggest you brush before meals, because they are concerned with plaque removal, not food removal. Brushing before meals actually avoids tooth and gum damage that can come from spreading and brushing acids from your meal around your mouth.Even if you adopt the practice of brushing before meals, brushing before you go to bed is still essential.
Although twice a day is the bare minimum, it’s recommended that you actually brush three times a day for optimal oral health.

, Split your mouth into four quadrants: upper left, upper right, bottom left, and bottom right. Brush each quadrant for at least thirty seconds to ensure you’re brushing long enough, and hitting all parts of your mouth.


Make sure you brush each tooth surface at least 10 times.

, Brushing more than three times a day on a regular basis, or applying too much pressure when you brush can actually damage your gums and teeth. Dentists call this “toothbrush abrasion,” and it can result in both receding gums and enamel deterioration that can lead to sensitive teeth.The main cause is represented by the back and forth brushing with high pressure and rapid movements.
If you’re using an electric brush, let it do all the work. Don’t apply extra pressure of your own.

, Toothbrush bristles will wear down and become less effective with use. They can also be homes for all sorts of bacteria they find in your mouth, so you need to replace them from time to time. Dentists recommend replacing your toothbrush every three to four months, or when the bristles start spreading apart making each stroke cause more harm than good, There are a wide variety of flosses in the dental aisle at the store, from nylon to monofilament, from flavorless to mint-flavored. There isn’t a significant difference between any of these types of floss. Use whichever kind feels most comfortable for you. More important than what type of floss you use is that you actually use it regularly., Flossing can be uncomfortable and sometimes gross, but dentists recommend it for a reason. Some say that flossing is actually more important than brushing for maintaining healthy teeth and gums.Whereas over-brushing can be damaging to your gums, over-flossing won’t cause any harm.Flossing also prevents stains between your teeth. These are very difficult to remove even by the dentist.
It doesn’t matter when you floss — day or night, before or after meals. Just make sure you do it at least once a day., The ADA provides specific instructions on how to perfect your flossing technique.Use about 18 inches of floss, securing them to your fingers by winding them around the middle finger on each hand.
Make sure not to cut off blood circulation to your fingertips. Unwind and rewind as necessary throughout the flossing process.
Pinch the floss between your thumb and forefinger to stabilize.
Use a back-and-forth sawing motion to ease the floss between your teeth, all the way up to the gum.
Don’t snap the floss up hard against your gums. This can be painful, and can cause gum damage over time.
Curve the floss into a “C” shape against the side of the tooth.
Gently and slowly move the floss up and down the length of the tooth. Insert the floss between the tooth surface and the prominent gum, called papilla.
Floss every single tooth, including the hard-to-reach ones in the back of your mouth.
Floss both sides of each tooth.

, Don’t take this as a hint to stop flossing! Your gums are bleeding because you’re not flossing! Continuing your daily flossing will help stop the bleeding over time and improve, not hurt, your gum health.

, Mouthwash is an important product because you only target your teeth and gums through brushing and flossing. Mouthwash can treat the rest of your mouth — the cheeks, the tongue, and other exposed surfaces that need cleaning in order to maintain gum health.Choose a mouthwash that has the ADA's seal of approval on the packaging.


Mouthwash can be seen as an oral disinfectant that eliminates a high percentage of the bacteria and plaque involved in cavities or any other dental and mucosal issues.
Choose therapeutic mouthwash specially formatted for gum health over cosmetic mouthwash designed for temporary breath freshening.Avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes that can dry out the skin and cause lesions over time.

, Studies have suggested that turmeric is as good at treating gum disease like gingivitis as store-bought mouthwashes.Dissolve 10 mg of turmeric extract in 3.5 oz. of hot water.Let the water cool down to a comfortable temperature.
Other natural alternatives to store-bought mouthwashes include cinnamon, fennel, ginger, lemon essential oil, tea tree oil, raw honey, and many others., Look at the packaging for specific instructions before proceeding, because mouthwashes with special formulas might have different recommendations for how long you should keep it in your mouth, or whether or not you should dilute the product.


If the packaging says to dilute the product, follow their instructions for doing so. Use warm water. If you feel a burning sensation or the taste is too strong, dilute it further.
Pour it into your mouth and swish it around your mouth vigorously for thirty to sixty seconds.
Gargle the mouthwash in the back of your throat for another thirty to sixty seconds.
Spit the mouthwash out into the sink.
Rinse your mouth with water.

, Rinsing your mouth with mouthwash can actually undo some of the benefits of brushing your teeth. For best results, either use mouthwash before brushing your teeth, or at least half an hour after brushing your teeth.

, You must see a dentist with professional tools for this aspect of your gum and tooth health.


How often you visit the dentist depends on your individual needs, but you should have your teeth and gums checked at least once a year.
Your dentist will advise you on when you should return for your next checkup.

, There are many problems that could require professional attention, but the main symptoms for gum disease include:Swollen or red gums
Bleeding beyond what is normal for early flossing
Loose teeth
Receding gums with pain or sensitivity
Chronic bad breath or bad taste in the mouth

, The ADA provides a search tool for finding ADA-member dentists in your local area.They also recommend taking the following step for finding a reputable dentist in your area:


Ask friends, family, and coworkers for recommendations
Ask your doctor for a recommendation
If you’re moving, ask your current dentist or their staff to help you find a reputable dentist in your new area
If you have special needs, such as gum disease, you may need to find a specialist, like a periodontist.

, Visit your insurance company’s website or call their helpline to find out which dentists will accept your insurance. If you have your heart set on a specific dentist, it will be easier to work with the dentist’s office than with the insurance company, so ask the dentist to make an exception in taking you on as a patient.

, If you don’t have health insurance, or if your insurance does not cover dental exams, do some research to find the low-cost options that are available to you. The safest, most reputable option is to find a clinic that is affiliated with a dental school. These clinics often offer free services to children under 18, along with reduced-fee service for adults.


Find the website for your state’s dental association to locate a local dental school clinic.

Massage or wiggle the affected area.,
Use a medication to minimize a cold sore.",How to Get Rid of Numbness in Your Lip1," Numb or tingling lips could be related to an allergic reaction, especially when accompanied by itching, swelling, or an upset stomach. Try taking an over the counter allergy medication to manage numb or tingling lips and any accompanying symptoms.Note the food and drinks you consumed prior to the onset of your symptoms. Try to identify and eliminate the possible allergen from your diet. If you used a lip balm or similar product before experiencing numbness, stop using it.
In severe food allergies, numbness and tingling can precede anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic response that requires immediate medical care.;
, If swelling accompanies your numbness, apply an ice pack to the affected area for 10 to 15 minutes. Swelling and numbness could result from an insect bite, a bump or other minor trauma, or allergies.Swelling could put too much pressure on facial nerves, which can cause numbness.
You can also take an anti-inflammatory medication to help decrease swelling.

, If no swelling is present, avoid using a cold compress. The issue could be related to a lack of blood flow to your lips, and applying a warm compress can help increase blood flow.Decreased blood flow could be a simple reaction to cold temperatures, or could indicate an underlying issue, such as Raynaud’s disease.

, In addition to applying a warm compress, you could try massaging your lips to warm them and increase blood flow. Try moving your mouth and lips around and exhaling air between your lips to vibrate them.Wash your hands before and after massaging your lips.

, Numbness and tingling can occur just before a cold sore develops. If you suspect lip numbness might be due to a cold sore, apply an over the counter medicated ointment or talk to your doctor about a prescription antiviral pill.You could also try holding a slice of garlic over a cold sore for 10 to 15 minutes."

Make a garlic compress.,
Swish with apple cider vinegar.,
Apply clove oil.",How to Get Rid of a Tooth Infection2," Warm sea salt water can help with pain and it may also help to heal an infection.To make a warm sea salt water rinse, mix about one teaspoon of sea salt with one cup of water. Stir until the salt dissolves in the water. Then, sip enough of the fluid to swish in your mouth and swish for about a minute. Spit out the fluid when you are done.


Repeat this process several times throughout the day to help with pain and promote healing.

, Garlic has been shown to have some powerful antibacterial properties.Try using fresh garlic in a compress for a tooth infection. You can either use fresh, crushed garlic or one teaspoon of dried garlic powder mixed with one teaspoon of water.


To make the garlic compress, place the fresh crushed garlic or garlic powder paste into a clean nylon stocking.
Gather the garlic into one small section of the nylon stocking so that it forms a small ball or lump.
Then, apply the compress to the affected tooth and hold it there for about five minutes.

Floss your teeth twice daily.,
Swish with mouthwash after brushing and flossing.,
Schedule regular checkups with your dentist.",How to Get Rid of a Tooth Infection3," Brushing your teeth in the morning and the evening can help to reduce plaque and prevent cavities. Make sure that you use a fluoride toothpaste to brush your teeth and take your time as well. Other good brushing habits include:Brush all surfaces of your teeth (front, back, tops, and along the gumline).
Keep your toothbrush in a stand that allows it to air dry (a moist toothbrush is more prove to bacteria).
Replace your toothbrush every three to four months.

, Flossing is also crucial because a toothbrush cannot reach between your teeth. You can use regular dental floss or pre-threaded flossers to get in between your teeth. When you floss, you should also make sure to:Use a long (18”) piece of floss so that you will have enough to floss between all of your teeth.
Run the floss up and down the sides of your teeth. Do not just pull the floss in and out between your teeth.
Use a gentle touch. Pressing too hard may cause injury or bleeding to your gums.

, Swishing with an antimicrobial mouthwash or a mouthwash that contains fluoride may also help to improve your dental health. Look for a mouthwash that fights plaque and use it after brushing and flossing for extra protection., Regular checkups can help your dentist to detect any problems, such as tooth decay or plaque build-up. Your dentist can provide treatments to help promote your dental health and fix problems before they get worse. Make sure that you see your dentist twice per year for a cleaning and exam.

Ask your doctor if your medications can cause numbness.,
Ask if you might have a vitamin B deficiency.,
Talk to your doctor about Raynaud’s disease.,
Make a follow up appointment if you’ve had recent dental work.,
Ask your dentist or oral surgeon to prescribe phentolamine.",How to Get Rid of Numbness in Your Lip2," Some medications, such as prednisone, can cause facial numbness. Contact your doctor promptly if you believe you’re experiencing any side effects due to a medication.Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you take and ask about their side effects or potential interactions. Ask them to recommend an alternative if you believe a medication is causing your lip numbness.

, Among other symptoms, a vitamin B-12 deficiency can cause numbness in the face, hands, and feet. Ask your doctor if they recommend a blood test to diagnose a vitamin deficiency and whether you should take a supplement.You could be at risk of a vitamin B deficiency if you’re over 50, a vegetarian, have had weight-loss surgery, have a condition that interferes with food absorption, or take medications such as Nexium, Prevacid, or Zantac.

, If you consistently experience numbness in your face, hands, or feet, along with coldness or discoloration, ask your doctor if Raynaud’s disease is a possible cause. Raynaud’s disease occurs when small arteries that supply blood to the skin narrow, which leads to decreased blood circulation.If your doctor suspects Raynaud’s disease, they’ll administer a physical exam and blood screening to make an accurate diagnosis.
To manage Raynaud’s disease, you should avoid cold temperatures, wear hats and gloves, avoid smoking, and try to minimize emotional stress.

, While a local anesthetic following a dental procedure can cause lip numbness for two or three hours, prolonged numbness could indicate a complication. If you experience persistent numbness after a dental implant, filling, wisdom tooth extraction, or other dental procedure, schedule a follow-up visit with your dentist or oral surgeon as soon as possible.Numbness after an oral procedure could indicate nerve damage or an abscess.  

, If you’re about to have a dental procedure, you can ask your dentist or oral surgeon for a medication to counteract the numbness that results after local anesthesia. OraVerse, or phentolamine mesylate, is an injectable medication that increases blood flow to soft tissues and helps to speed up the return of normal sensation.Tell your dentist or oral surgeon if you have a history of heart or blood vessel issues. It should not be used in patients with a history of cardiovascular disorders.

Seek emergency care if more serious symptoms accompany numbness.,
Seek emergency care for anaphylaxis or hyperventilation.,
See your doctor if numbness worsens or persists.",How to Get Rid of Numbness in Your Lip3," If dizziness, difficulty speaking, confusion, sudden severe headache, weakness, or paralysis accompany numbness, you should get immediate medical attention. You should also seek emergency medical care if numbness occurs suddenly after a serious head trauma.In serious cases, a CT scan or MRI will be necessary to rule out a severe head injury, stroke, tumor, or other life-threatening condition.

, In serious allergic reactions, numbness can precede anaphylactic shock, which can be fatal. Contact emergency services and, if possible, administer an Epipen if these symptoms accompany numbness:Swelling of the mouth and throat
Skin redness or rash
Nausea and vomiting
Restricted airway
Hyperventilating or difficulty breathing
Collapse or unconsciousness

, Numbness in any part of your body usually goes away on its own. However, it could be related to a number of mild or severe medical conditions, so you shouldn’t ignore a case of persistent numbness. If your lip numbness gradually worsens or doesn’t go away, schedule an appointment with your primary doctor."

Be patient and don't assume the worst.,
Don't get frustrated with diagnosing.,
Don't pay too much attention to it.,
Consider some form of counseling or therapy.,
Ask your doctor about medication.,
Pay attention to age and gender.,
Notice how long the twitching lasts.,
Take note of any tics.,
Observe the complexity of the twitching.,
Watch for associated conditions.",How to Deal With Neurotic Twitching," If you see your child or family member twitching repeatedly, don't assume it'll become a permanent behavior. Instead, be patient and supportive of the person and try to understand how stress at home, work or school might play a role. In the vast majority of cases, twitches during childhood fade way within a few months anyway.On the other hand, a neurotic twitch that develops in an adult is less likely to resolve itself.


If a person has a neurotic twitch for a year or so, then TS is more likely, but it's still possible it might go away or become more mild and controlled.
Emotional, psychological and physical stressors are linked to most neurotic disorders. As such, observe your child's routine to understand their primary stressors and alleviate them if possible.;
, There are no lab or brain imaging tests used for diagnosing neurotic twitches, so the cause can be a bit of a mystery in most cases. Try not to get frustrated or too concerned with neurotic twitches, particularly in children, because they commonly fade away after a few months or so.Research the topic online (using reputable sources) to get an understanding of the condition and how common it is among children.


Serious disorders that can cause neurotic twitching need to be ruled out by your doctor. They include attention deficit disorder (ADHD), uncontrollable movements due to a neurological disease (myoclonus), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and epilepsy., Most doctors and psychologists recommend that family members and friends don't pay much attention to neurotic twitching or tics, at least at first.The rationale is that too much attention, especially if it's negative and involves disparaging remarks, can cause more stress and exacerbate the twitching. It's difficult to balance taking interest in someone's problem, but not going overboard with attention that feeds the problem.


Don't mimic the person's twitching in order to be funny or playful — it can make them more self-conscious or nervous.
If the twitches don't go away within a few weeks, ask the person what's bothering them. Repetitive movements, such as sniffing and coughing, can also be caused by allergies, chronic infections or another illnesses.
Deciding on treatment should depend on how disruptive the twitching is to the person's life, not how embarrassed you might be.

, If the twitching is severe enough to cause social problems at school or work for a child or adult, then some form of counseling or therapy should be sought. Therapy typically involves a child psychologist or psychiatrist who uses cognitive behavioral interventions and/or psychotherapy.Over the course of multiple sessions, the child or adult should be accompanied by a close family member or friend for support.


Cognitive behavioral therapy includes habit reversal training, which helps to identify the urge to twitch or have repetitive behaviors and then teaches the patient to voluntarily combat them from occurring. Tics are often classified as ""Involuntary"" movements rather than involuntary ones, because the tics can be willfully suppressed for a period of time. However, this often results in discomfort that builds until the tic is performed.Psychotherapy involves more talking to the patient and asking probing questions. It helps more with accompanying behavioral problems, such as ADHD and OCD.
Depression and anxiety are also quite common in people who develop neurotic twitches.
Most twitching can't be halted completely with therapy, but it can be made less obvious or forceful.

, There are prescription drugs to help control neurotic twitching and reduce the effects of related behavioral problems, but it depends if the condition is considered short term or long term, and if the person is a child or an adult.Drugs are not given to kids with TTD (temporary or transient tics), but are to those diagnosed with severe long-term TS. Psychotropic drugs change symptoms and behaviors, but they often have serious side effects, so discuss the pros and cons with your doctor.


Drugs that help control twitches by blocking dopamine in the brain include: fluphenazine, haloperidol (Haldol) and pimozide (Orap). Perhaps paradoxically, side effects include an increase in involuntary, repetitive tics.
Botulinum (Botox) injections paralyze muscle tissue and are helpful for controlling mild and isolated twitching of the face / neck.
ADHD drugs, such as methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine), can sometimes reduce neurotic twitching, but they can make them worse also.
Central adrenergic inhibitors, such as clonidine (Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex), can increase impulse control in kids and help them to reduce their anger / rage.
Anti-seizure drugs used for epilepsy, such as topiramate (Topamax), can also help twitching in people with TS.Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that any medication will help reduce the symptoms of a neurotic tic disorder. In order to reduce the incidence of undesired side effects associated with medication, dosing should start low and increase slowly up to the point when side effects appear then stop or decrease., Neurotic twitching due to TS often begin between the ages of 2-15 years, with the average age of onset about 6 years of age.TS often lasts into adulthood, but it always starts at some point during childhood. TTD also starts before the age of 18 years, usually at 5-6 years old, but lasts less than a year in duration.There's a lot of similarity between the two conditions with age of onset, but TS often begins a little younger because of its stronger genetic link.
Neurotic twitching that starts during adulthood is typically not diagnosed as either TS or TTD. The twitches must begin during childhood to be diagnosed TS or TTD.
Males are 3-4x more likely than females to develop TS and TTD, although females have higher incidence of other behavioral / psychological problems.TS is hereditary and there is usually a genetic link between most cases.

, The duration of the neurotic twitching is the biggest factor for distinguishing TS from TTD.To be diagnosed with TTD, a child has to exhibit twitching (tics) for at least 4 weeks on a daily basis, but less than a year.In contrast, for a diagnosis of TS, the twitching must occur for more than a year. As such, some time and patience are needed to get a proper diagnosis.


Most cases of TTD resolve and go away within weeks to months.
Twitches that last around a year are called ""chronic tics"" until enough time passes to justify a diagnosis of TS.
TTD is much more common than TS — 10% of children develop TTD, whereas about 1% of Americans (kids and adults) are diagnosed with TS.In contrast, about 1% of Americans have mild TS.
About 200,000 are estimated to have severe TS (both kids and adults)., For a kid or adult to be diagnosed with TS, they must exhibit both at least two motor tics and at least one vocal tic in combination for over a year.Common motor tics include excessive blinking, nose twitching, grimacing, lip smacking, head turning or shoulder shrugging. Vocalizations can include simple grunts, repetitive throat clearing, as well as yelling out words or complex phrases. Numerous types of motor and vocal tics can occur in the same child who has TS.


In contrast, most children with TTD have either a single motor tic (twitch) or vocal tic, but rarely both at the same time.
If your child or family member only shows some sort of neurotic twitching, then it's likely they have TTD and it will resolve on it's own fairly quickly (weeks or months).
When repetitive words and phrases are spoken, it's considered a complex form of vocalization.

, TS varies from mild to severe in terms of repetitive twitching and vocalizations, and tends to involve more complex movements. Complex tics involve several body parts and rhythmic or patterned movements, such as head bobbing while sticking out the tongue, for example.In contrast, children or adolescents with TTD sometimes display complex movements, but not nearly as often as seen with TS.


The most common initial symptoms of both TS and TTD are facial tics, such as rapid eye blinking (single or both), eyebrow raising, nose twitching, lip protruding, grimacing and sticking out the tongues.
The initial facial tics that develop are often later added to or replaced by jerky movements of the neck, torso and/or limbs. A twitch in the neck usually jerks the head to one side.
Twitches from both conditions typically happen many times per day (usually in bouts or bursts of activity) almost every day. Sometimes there are breaks that may last a few hours or so and do not occur when sleeping.
Neurotic twitching often looks like really nervous behavior (thus the name) and can get worse with stress or anxiety and better when relaxed and calm.

, A fairly reliable predictor of potential neurotic twitching behavior is whether or not the person has (or had) other disabilities, such as ADHD, OCD, autism, and/or depression.Serious problems in school with reading, writing and/or math may also be risk factors for developing neurotic twitching behavior.


OCD behaviors include intrusive thoughts and anxiety combined with repetitive actions. For example, excessive concern about germs or dirt might get associated with repetitive hand-washing through the day.
Approximately 86% of kids with TS also have at least one additional mental, behavioral or developmental disability, usually either ADHD or OCD."

, If your dentist is applying porcelain veneers, the thinness of the veneers means that very little tooth alteration will be necessary and the process should only take two appointments. Porcelain crowns are slightly more involved, but should only take two appointments as well. You may need to wear a temporary crown in between the tooth preparation and receiving your permanent porcelain crowns.

, Porcelain veneers and porcelain crowns can be treated just like your natural teeth, and no one will notice the difference between your dental structures and other teeth. Porcelain crowns and porcelain veneers are just as functionally beneficial as they are cosmetically beneficial: enjoy your improved bite and chewing capabilities.

Rest.,
Drink water.,
Try ginger.,
Try over-the-counter motion-sickness medication.",How to Cure Vertigo at Home1," Get some rest during and after attacks. Make sure you are resting as much as possible. While it is not always easy to achieve in our busy modern age, getting rest and relaxation can minimize the effects of vertigo.If you feel dizzy at any point, sit or lie down immediately. Sudden movement—and sometimes any movement—can worsen the sensation of vertigo.
Avoid bright lights if possible, such as those from a television, overhead lighting, or your phone, as these can aggravate your vertigo.
If you are experiencing episodes of vertigo, avoid driving a car or operating any heavy machinery. Also avoid environments with flashing lights, such as video games, some movies, dance clubs, etc.;
, Vertigo or dizziness may be caused by dehydration as it decreases the blood volume and thereby the oxygen supply to your brain. In addition, the balance system in your inner ear uses fluids to transmit information about fluid levels in your body, which is in turn interpreted by the brain to produce a sense of balance. Rehydrating frequently, especially while exercising or suffering from diarrhea, can help minimize your dizziness.The body needs 2.2–3 liters (0.6–0.8 US gal) of liquids a day (respectively). While all liquids fall under this umbrella, water is best. It has no empty calories, no caffeine, and isn't a diuretic, like some sodas, coffees, teas, and juices are., Chinese sailors used ginger for centuries to combat motion sickness, and now it's widely used to fight dizziness. Ginger can be consumed in food, in your tea or you can even munch on it raw.Ginger (zingiber) combats blood pressure as well as acidity and helps blood circulation overall, thus decreasing the episodes of vertigo. Ginger is believed to contain substances that control inflammation and thus soothe an agitated stomach and vertigo.
Add a piece of raw ginger to boiling water to make ginger tea. Up to three small roots per day is acceptable but usually one root or one tablespoon of juice is enough for the body.

, Taking motion sickness medicine, such as meclizine or dimenhydrinate, which are available over-the-counter, can relieve dizziness. However, this should only be taken when absolutely necessary and not depended on. It's always better to address the problem instead of over-medicating it.You should consult your doctor before self-medicating for dizziness. He will be able to tell you what medication and what dosage is best for you.

Learn to travel safely with epilepsy.",How to Deal With Epilepsy," Signs of a seizure can differ in patients and in the way the episodes unfold. The most common types of seizures include convulsions and loss of consciousness. Other symptoms might include arms and legs jerking, mouth trembling or a blank gaze.


Seizures are generally categorized as either partial or primary generalized. Identification is based on cause and point of origination.Partial seizures or simple focal seizures begin in one section rather than the entire brain. Often, the person is aware of what is happening to them.
Complex focal seizures affect a larger part of the brain. The person might be confused and have difficulty understanding what's happening to them.
Secondary generalized seizures begin as focal and spread to both sides of the brain. The person loses consciousness and convulses.
Generalized seizures can come on quickly. Both sides of the brain are affected. Seizures are accompanied by unconsciousness, convulsions, rigidity of muscle and jerky movements.;
, Carry the plan with you at all times. You can print out the form and fill it in.You can also use a small notebook for the plan if you like. A Seizure First Aid app for your smartphone is available.Include the names and numbers of your doctors, pharmacies and two emergency contacts.
Describe the types of seizures and how they’re manifested. Include their length and how often they occur. Note triggers for the seizure.
Provide a first aid plan for treatment. Include how long someone should stay with you, keeping the mouth clear and other details specific to you.
List medications, including amounts, when they’re taken and how they’re administered. Refer to other treatments you receive such as VNS.
Stipulate when emergency services should be called. Be specific in describing the circumstances such as a seizure that lasts more than five minutes., The primary focus of epilepsy treatment during a seizure is to make sure the person doesn't get injured. In most cases all that’s required is making the person safe and offering comfort. Reassure the person and stay with them until you’re absolutely certain that the seizure has stopped.
Stay calm. It will help the person having the seizure to stay calm. It will also help others on the scene not to panic.
Help the person to be comfortable. Help them to sit or lie down. Provide a pillow to protect their head., A person suffering a seizure is unable, to some degree, to control their body. Falling or thrashing movements are fairly common. The setting in which they’re having a seizure should be quickly appraised for potential dangers. Minimize the harm a seizure victim can do to themselves.


Move dangerous objects away from the person having the seizure.
Steer the person away from potential dangers such as a street or a hot stove. Lead them as gently as possible to a safe area.
Don’t forcibly restrain a person having a seizure. It could lead to injury.
Don’t place anything in the person's mouth while the seizure is in progress. It may lead to broken teeth. They may choke on the object.
Help the person to breath properly. You may need to turn them on their side with the mouth pointed downward to prevent choking.

, Although in most cases the help you offer is to protect the person suffering a seizure from hurting themselves, there are some situations that will require you to call for medical help.


If you’re in a public place, have someone else call while you stay with the person who is having the seizure.
Call for help if it’s the first time the victim has had a seizure or if the cause of the seizure isn’t known.Call emergency services if the seizures are repeating rather than stopping.
If the seizure continues for 5 minutes or more, call emergency services.
If the seizure victim is unconscious for 10 minutes or more, call emergency services.
Call for emergency help if the person undergoing the seizure requests that you do., Usually, medication will be tried first to lower the occurrences of seizures. Selecting the most effective anti-seizure medication might take time and experimentation. In many cases, once the right medication is found it can be quite effective. Some patients are able to stop taking the medication eventually with no further epileptic episodes.There are many types of epilepsy (over 40) and seizures. There are numerous drugs designed to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures.
Your doctor will diagnose your type of epilepsy and treatment options will follow.
Antiepileptic drugs are quite successful in preventing seizures as long as they’re taken as prescribed. About fifty percent of patients are able to control their epilepsy over long periods of time.
Take your medication regularly. Make it a routine that’s so consistent the chances of forgetting to take medication are nil.
Speak to your doctor about identifying triggers, like fatigue, that signal an oncoming seizure.

, VNS sends continuous short electrical impulses to the brain through the vagus nerve in the neck. This method can be an alternative if other treatments aren’t working.


A battery is implanted under the skin and is the source of the charge.
The doctor will program the battery to deliver an electric impulse every few minutes.
The patient will wear a magnet on a wrist band or on the belt and has the ability to produce extra electric stimulation if needed by waving the magnet over the implant.
Patients self-administer the electric stimulation when they feel a seizure coming on.
In some cases VNS is effective in eliminating or reducing seizures. In others, it’s ineffective., A ketogenic diet can help to reduce the occurrence of seizures.Ketogenic diets are sometimes recommended for children when medications aren't successful.Ketogenic diets are low in carbohydrates and high in fat content. The body breaks down fat for energy (instead of carbohydrates).
Ketogenic diets require the dieter receive close supervision to ensure they receive proper nutrition. Side effects from the diet also have to be monitored.

, In some cases an underlying condition of the brain is responsible for seizures. Under the right circumstances, surgery can successfully remove areas of the brain responsible for producing seizures.


If seizures begin in the same area of the brain, surgery might be a successful option.
If the area of the brain can be removed without doing harm to key functions, such as speech or eyesight, then surgery is an option.
Surgery is specialized and complicated and requires tests that may take weeks to be completed.
Electrodes may have to be implanted in the brain prior to the surgery to find the source of the seizures since the source will be removed.
If no further seizures occur after surgery, the patient has a good chance to live seizure free.
In some cases, surgery is not effective., A seizure could come anywhere in the house and at any time. Your seizures may be controlled by medication. It’s still important to prepare for the unexpected by taking a few precautions that will make your home safe.


Place fire alarms on all levels of the house. Use fire retardant materials for your furniture. These precautions help to address the possibility of a seizure while cooking or smoking.
Install soft floors. Use cushioned flooring, non-slip linoleum or carpets rather than hard surfaces such as ceramic.
Choose non-coarse rug material to avoid rug burns in the event of a prolonged seizure.
Cover all hard edges of furniture, or purchase furniture with rounded edges.
Use safety glass to avoid injury by shattering glass during a fall.
Cover radiators and pipes that could cause burns. Be sure that your heaters are fixed to the wall and not free-standing.
Use a low-level bed in your bedroom to cut down on injuries from falls.
If you sleep face down purchase a safety pillow which has air holes to prevent suffocation., The kitchen poses a particular threat because of appliances such as stoves which are sources of high heat. Care must be taken to avoid burns incurred during a seizure in the kitchen.


Pans and pots on burners should have handles pointed inward so that you can’t knock them over.
Use a wheeled cart to transfer hot plates, platters and pots to the dinner table, rather than carrying them.
Install heat-resistant work surfaces so that you can slide hot pots and pans, rather than lift them.
Consider using a microwave for your cooking to prevent fires from food cooking too long, and to avoid hot surfaces that could be the source of an injury., The bathroom, like the kitchen poses a special set of risks for someone who falls during a seizure. Make changes to your bathroom with an eye to eliminate the risk of drowning.


Use doors that open either way so that someone can reach you if necessary. You can use an “Occupied” sign on the outside of the door to allow for privacy.
Consider flooring made of rubber, or a non-slipping surface rather than a hard surface.
A shower is safer than a bath because water drains away.
Use toiletries made of plastic rather than glass or ceramic.
If you do choose a bath over a shower, it’s best to have someone in the house in case you have a seizure while in the tub.
A monitor which allows someone to listen while you’re in the tub is a good precaution.
Run a shallow tub and begin with cold water to prevent injury if falling into the tub while the water is running., Protect yourself from Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), a phenomenon in which a person with epilepsy dies suddenly, usually in her sleep.Though it is not clear why this happens, research shows that in 73% of SUDEP cases, the person was sleeping on her stomach. As a precaution, sleep on your back.Consider a wristwatch, bed alarm, or even a service dog to detect seizures that may occur while you are sleeping., If you live alone, you will need to make some additional adjustments to ensure your safety.


If you wander during seizures, make sure you lock your doors so that you don't go outside.Consider signing up with a medical alert hotline, such as Lifeline. You will be provided with a pendant that can detect if you fall and alert emergency services.Make sure your floor is always clear of any obstacles.Place a chair or some other barrier in front of appliances that could burn you if you fell onto them during a seizure, such as the stove or radiator., The American with Disabilities Act prevents discrimination against people with disabilities including epilepsy. You should be able to live a normal productive life and not be hindered from seeking or maintaining employment.Potential employers can’t ask you if you're epileptic.
Your employer should provide a safe environment to accommodate your disability as long as those accommodations are reasonable.
Speak to another employee about your disability so that you’ll have someone who can care for you if you have a seizure. Provide your colleague with appropriate guidance literature and instructions about how to care for you.
Don’t work to the point of fatigue as that could bring on a seizure. If your shifts are too long, ask your supervisor to cut them back.
Avoid high places and machinery with moving parts at work.

, Driving can be an essential part of every day life, depending on location. In most states, people who have not had a seizure in three to five years are allowed a license without the obligation to provide a medical report.Keep in mind that your decision affects everyone you encounter on the road.


Stop driving if seizures reoccur. You’ll need to speak to your doctor and your ability to drive will have to be evaluated.
If you’ve had a seizure due to an unusual occurrence and have lost your license because of it, you could appeal the decision. You’ll probably have to provide evidence from your doctor that you’re taking medication that he prescribed., Whether you travel by car, plane or train, you and traveling companions should understand the type and frequency of your seizures. Research your path and destination to know the availability of medical help, accommodations to meet your needs, and flexibility in altering travel plans if a seizure occurs.


If you’re seizure free and able to drive safely, confirm there are no problems with the legality of driving.
Take frequent breaks if you’re driving. You’ll want to avoid fatigue.
Don’t drive at night if you’re photosensitive.
If you’re flying, the Aerospace Medical Association recommends you travel with a companion who can care for you in the event of a seizure.
Bring a Seizure Plan with you. Also carry a letter from your doctor confirming you’re cleared to fly.
Carry your medicines and label them with specific directions in case someone who isn’t familiar with your condition must care for you.
Request a seat in the front of the plane where you’re more visible to flight attendants so that you’ll receive immediate attention if needed."

Eat more almonds.,
Use lemon in your meals.,
Use apple cider and honey.,
Make a nausea-fighting drink.,
Try amla, or Indian Gooseberry.,
Try yogurt and strawberries.",How to Cure Vertigo at Home2," Almonds are one of the best nuts and rich sources of vitamins A, B and E. Consuming up to five almonds a day, every day – whether eaten directly or crushed or grated or even mixed with food – have been found to be beneficial for vertigo.The exact mechanism isn’t known, but it is suggested that the vitamin B and E content in almonds helps combat free radicals that cause vertigo.
Almonds may also be soaked in water an hour before being consumed.

, Adding a lemon peel or a drop or two of lemon peel extract to your food every day not only enhances the taste of the food but also provides a good source of antioxidants and trace minerals that help with vertigo.


Lemons are rich in vitamin C which works by combating free radicals that cause vertigo. You can also mix it with apple juice and ginger if you'd like., Honey has been known for its curative properties for centuries. Add two parts honey to one part apple cider. Consume one tablespoon of this mixture two to three times a day.This may prevent vertigo from developing or treat it if you are suffering from it, since honey and apply cider facilitate blood flow to the brain.

, For vertigo that is associated with nausea and vomiting, mix together one glass of warm water with four crushed black peppers, seven to eight drops of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Stir well before consuming. This is to be used only to relieve the acute episode of vertigo you're experiencing and not for regular consumption every day. It may calm the wave of nausea occurring with your vertigo. The acidity of lemon and salt will calm down your agitated stomach.

, This plant is rich in vitamin C, vitamin A and antioxidants, flavonoids and pectin. All of these keep your body nourished and revitalized. The vitamin C present in amla neutralizes the free radicals that are released in the body and helps your body combat vertigo.This is an Ayurvedic treatment, which is a form of holistic medicine from India.


Amla can be had raw, one to two a day. It can also be consumed as a juice, tea, blended or pureed into a paste or a juice – one glass (about 200 ml) once a day, preferably in the mornings.You can also marinate amla to make a pickle-like consistency which can be consumed as an accompaniment to food. About two tablespoons of this would suffice for the day’s requirements.

, A mixture of yogurt/curds with freshly cut strawberries also may help treat an episode of vertigo almost instantaneously. This can be consumed on a daily basis as well.Make yourself a small bowl of yogurt (about 120 gms) with about five or six freshly cut strawberries at the very first sign of any dizziness. However, if you suffer from migraines, you may want to avoid yogurt as it contains tyramine, a migraine exacerbator.Flavonoids are found in all different kinds of berries like strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, and cranberries. They are rich sources of antioxidants which makes them very effective in helping with vertigo. In addition, the vitamin C in berries is also beneficial in treating vertigo.
You could also add some chopped almonds to the yogurt and berries for an added boost.

Do the Epley maneuver.,
Try the Half Somersault maneuver.,
Practice the Brandt Daroff regimen.,
Try the ""eye patch"" exercise each morning.,
Maintain a fixed gaze.,
Do simple head rotations.",How to Cure Vertigo at Home3," Also known as the canalith repositioning procedure, the Epley maneuver helps to reset the balance mechanisms in the inner ear by repositioning the particles in the vestibular organs (the balance organs). These particles can get trapped in the inner ear, which causes dizziness. You can do this at home, although it should be demonstrated by your healthcare professional before you undertake it yourself as it does require some quick movements. Note that the Epley maneuver is effective in 90% of cases, it can cause an intensification of vertigo initially. Consider asking a friend or family member to act as your assistant so that your head lands in the right spot each time. Here's how to do it:Sit on a bed. Place a pillow behind you so that when you lie on your back (later in the maneuver), it will be located under your shoulders.
Turn your head 45° by looking to the right.
Lie back quickly and place your shoulders on the pillow. Your head will be lower than your shoulders and you will still be looking 45° to the right. Remain in this position for 30 seconds.
After the 30 seconds, turn your head 90° to the left. Do not raise your head during this movement. Remain in this position for 30 seconds.
Turn your entire body and your head another 90° to the left and wait for 30 seconds. At this point, you should be lying on your left side. Your head should still be lower than your shoulders.
Repeat this exercise three times daily for best results.

, Also known as the Foster maneuver, this is another good exercise and, unlike the Epley maneuver, does not require an assistant. One study found that patients who did both exercises experienced symptomatic relief but reported less dizziness and fewer complications when doing just the Half Somersault. You will likely need to do this exercise multiple times before you experience some relief. Follow this procedure:Get down on your knees and look up at the ceiling for a few seconds.
Touch the floor with your head. Tuck your chin slightly towards your chest so your head moves toward your knees. Wait for the vertigo to subside (about 30 seconds).
Turn your head in the direction of your affected ear (i.e., if you feel dizzy on your left side, turn your head so that it faces your left elbow). Keep your head in this position for 30 seconds.
Then, raise your head so it is level with your back while you're on all fours; your spine should look like a straight line. Keep your head at that 45° angle. Stay 30 seconds in this position.
Raise your head and back so that you are upright again, but keep your head tilted to the shoulder of the side you're working on. Take your time to stand up.
Rest 15 minutes before repeating a second time or doing the other side.

, These exercises involve the head and the muscles of the neck and can be performed at home without a physician's supervision. The repeated head movements of this regimen help you habituate to the experience of vertigo by dispersing the particles in the vestibular organs in the inner ear.Begin in an upright, seated position. Quickly lie down on on one side with your nose pointed up at about a 45° angle. Stay in this position for about 30 seconds (or until the vertigo is gone). Then, get back in your seated position. Do this exercise on the other side.
This exercise is most effective if you do multiple repetitions at least twice daily.

, It is the relationship between our eye muscles and our inner ears that help us stay balanced most of the time while the head is moving. However, the dislodged particles in the inner ear make you think you're moving when you're not and causes the eyes to mistakenly move, making it look the room is spinning. This is why it's important to strengthen your eye muscles. Over time, this will reduce the sensitivity of the inner ear canal which in turn will lead to reduced frequency and intensity of vertigo. As soon as you wake up, keep one hand on any one eye and close it for 20 seconds while using the other eye to look out into the distance and focus on a point far away. Then switch the hand to the other eye and let the previous eye repeat the same effort.Do this about 10 times every day upon waking.

, Staring at one point can help you overcome dizziness. It helps improve your vision and maintain focus while your head is moving. Dancers, when doing turns, are told to ""spot."" This is where they keep their eyes focused on one spot for as long as they can as their body rotates. This lets them spin without becoming dizzy and is the same principle that can be applied here. Focus on a spot straight ahead during your dizziness spell and the dizziness will likely subside. Here's how to practice stabilizing your gaze:Look straight ahead and focus on something (a small coloured square or button) held at eye level in front of you.
Move your head from side to side, all the while maintaining your gaze on the target. Slowly increase the speed of your head movement. Make sure your target is still in focus and is not just a blur. If you start to feel too dizzy, slow down.
Continue moving your head for up to one minute because the brain needs this time to adapt to the adjustment.
Keep working on it until you can do this exercise three to five times everyday. Build up gradually to repeat three to five times a day.
You can also try this exercise with an up-and-down, or nodding, movement.

, While sitting upright on a chair, bring your head down such that your chin touches your chest and then start rotating your head clockwise, slowly but firmly, three times. This may release the spasm in your muscles and reduce vertigo.Repeat it three times going the opposite way, counter-clockwise. Pause for a break of 45 seconds between each direction of rotation. Then turn your head towards either side while using the palm of your hand of that side to resist that movement and stretch the neck muscles.

Avoid substances that affect the circulation to your brain.,
Get enough sleep.,
Maintain a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Do yoga.,
Consider seeking professional help.",How to Cure Vertigo at Home4," Take care to avoid substances that alter the blood supply to your brain, which include caffeine, chocolate, alcohol and various illegal drugs.These substances can cause nerves to swell and blood vessels to constrict. This can increase sensations of dizziness. If you do consume any of these, make sure you're not doing so on an empty stomach as the effects will be worsened.

, Absence of good sound sleep can cause or aggravate vertigo. Try to get a full night's sleep starting at about the same time every night and waking around the same time each morning. Though everyone's sleep needs are different, most adults do best with about seven to nine hours of sleep. Children and teens may require more sleep.If you're working on trying to fall into a more consistent sleep pattern, wait until bedtime to sleep and avoid napping during the day. Naps are a great way to recharge your batteries when you have a stable sleep schedule, but they are counter-productive when trying to change sleeping habits.

, The Anti-Inflammatory Diet can be particularly useful to reduce inflammation, including disorders that end in “itis”. This diet also provides all the essential vitamins and minerals, particularly if you eat a variety of foods. The general principles of the Anti-Inflammatory diet (similar to the Mediterranean diet) include the following:Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as much as possible. This means that you should try to limit any processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch as frequently as you can.
Reduce your intake of salt and sugar by limiting your consumption of chips, cookies, cakes, crackers, etc.
Use olive oil as your main cooking oil since it's full of healthy fats.
Avoid fried or fatty foods, like onion rings, french fries, hamburgers and hotdogs, etc.
Limit red meats and eat only skinless poultry or fish.
Increase the amount of fish in your diet. Excellent sources of omega 3 fatty acids include salmon, tuna, sardines and anchovies.
Increase all fruits, berries and vegetables. Include brightly colored berries and fruits and leafy greens, such as Swiss chard, spinach, beet and mustard greens and kale. You should also try to include broccoli, cauliflower and brussel sprouts, which have anti-inflammatory and cancer-preventing properties.Include garlic and onions into your diet as these contain anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting substances., Everyone's exercise needs are different. However, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that adults get at least two and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) per week, along with two days of moderate strength-training exercise (like weight lifting).While this exercise may not cure your vertigo specifically, it will contribute to your overall health and well-being, much like the dietary changes suggested above.

, Yoga is good for vertigo as it helps release the spasms in the muscles of the neck and keep them more flexible and supple. In the long term, regular yoga for at least 30 minutes a day will prevent re-occurrence of vertigo and ensure a better stress tolerance. Yoga also helps with balance and helps cultivate your ability to concentrate and focus.Yoga is great for the mind and body. Your stress levels will be lower, your muscles will be more relaxed, and you may experience fewer episodes of vertigo to boot.
If you are experiencing vertigo, however, you should let your yoga instructor know before class so that she can offer you modifications for poses as needed.

, Vertigo or dizziness may be caused by a serious underlying pathology; you should seek a professional opinion if you have frequent vertigo or dizziness. A full medical work up will help your physician rule out serious underlying pathologies, such as malignancy and tumors.


You can also contact the Vestibular Disorders Association (VEDA) to find support groups and resources that may be helpful to you.

Try whitening strips.,
Think about whitening gels.,
Look at whitening trays.,
Consider whitening toothpastes.,
Find a dental school.",How to Get Low Cost Tooth Whitening1," Like other over-the-counter treatments, you can buy whitening strips from the store. As their name implies, they are strips that fit over your teeth.To use, you cover the front of your teeth with the strips and then leave them on for 30 minutes. You must do this every day for about two weeks.
Make sure that you brush your teeth before you use the whitening strips. This will provide better strip-to-tooth contact, which should improve your results.
You'll need to do this treatment about three times a year.
While this option is one of the more expensive ones for over-the-counter treatments, it is somewhat more effective than other over-the-counter treatments.;
, Another option is paint-on gels. Basically, you apply the gel to your teeth with a small brush. You also have to leave this gel on for about 30 minutes.Some of these types of whiteners are simply a pen filled with the gel that has a brush on one end.Usually, you apply the whitener once or twice a day, with about the same effectiveness as strips.
It can be applied to just one or two teeth, if you need it.
Also, one disadvantage is it can come off pretty easily after you've brushed it on.
The gel is usually not strong enough to cause tooth sensitivity, but it is still important to avoid placing the gel on your gums to avoid causing any burns.

, With whitening trays, you place a whitening agent in a tray, and then you put that on your teeth. You leave these on for a period of time, then take them off.This method can be more effective than strips or brush-on gel.The best kind are the ones that you mold to your teeth at home. Some are not designed to be molded to your teeth and therefore, are harder to keep on.However, trays that your dentist make will be more effective, as they will be made to fit your teeth allowing the gel to spread equally over your teeth and stay coat the entire tooth surface., Whitening toothpastes may not be as effective as other options. However, they can provide some results, and they are by far one of the cheapest options.Whitening toothpastes can use special abrasive material as well as chemicals to whiten your teeth.
Toothpastes do not contain peroxide, like some other whitening options do.
Use a whitening toothpaste to replace a normal toothpaste. Use twice a day, and you may see results in a month to a month and a half. However, look for a brand that's approved by the American Dental Association, as others can damage your teeth over time due to the abrasive ingredients used to remove stains.Toothpastes with blue covarine may show results more quickly.
You can also follow with a whitening mouthwash., One way you may be able to get professional whitening for less is at a dental school. As dentists are learning, they need to practice their skills. Because they are practicing, services will be at a discounted rate to you.Check with your local colleges and universities to see if there is a dental school nearby.
All student dentists will be under the supervision of professionals, so you will be in good hands.

Think about hydrogen peroxide.,
Consider activated charcoal.,
Mix lemon juice and baking soda.,
Try crunchy veggies.,
Cut down on stains.",How to Get Low Cost Tooth Whitening2," Some people use hydrogen peroxide to naturally whiten their teeth. In fact, hydrogen peroxide is often used in whitening products.Swish it around in your mouth. Make sure to use food grade hydrogen peroxide.
Only leave it in for a few seconds, then rinse it out.
Be sure not to swallow it.
Do not use hydrogen peroxide more than three times a week or for more than four weeks in a row to avoid tooth sensitivity, which is likely to appear with prolonged use.
If you have a soft bristled toothbrush, then you can even brush your teeth while holding the peroxide in your mouth.

, Some people have had luck whitening their teeth with activated charcoal. Activated charcoal is charcoal that has been processed with oxygen. It's also been mixed with zinc chloride or calcium chloride.Activated charcoal is highly absorbent, which is why some people have had luck using it with stains.Start with an activated charcoal capsule. Break it open to pour out half in a small dish. Wet your brush, and dip it into the charcoal.
Use it to gently brush your teeth, then leave it on for a few minutes.
After you're done, rinse it off. Use your regular toothpaste to brush your teeth.

, Some people use this method to whiten their teeth naturally. They simply mix equal parts of lemon juice and baking soda to form a paste.Try to wipe the saliva off your teeth before applying.
The mixture will fizz up at first. Once it's done fizzing, brush it on your teeth with a toothbrush and leave it for a minute.
Use your toothbrush to take it off, then rinse. Only apply this mixture once a week, as any more may damage your enamel over time.
You should have whiter teeth after four to five weeks of using this process, but do not use baking soda and lemon juice for more than two months in a row.

, Eating crunchy fruits and veggies can naturally wear away stains over time. Also, most vegetables and fruits are acidic, helping to reduce stains.Any crunchy vegetable or fruit will do, as long as you eat them raw. Think about carrots, celery, jicama, and bell pepper, for instance.
Apples are also good. They have malic acid in them, which is found in some whitening products.

, One easy way to help keep your teeth white is to cut out things that stain your teeth. If you can avoid the things that stain your teeth, you can help keep them whiter for longer.For instance, cutting out drinks like tea, coffee, and wine can help. Pretty much any dark food, especially drinks, can stain your teeth. Consider using a straw to help cut down on the contact with your teeth.Also, avoid things that may stain your teeth for about three days after you have had oral hygiene done in a dental office. Tooth scaling creates retentive areas in your enamel, which need to remineralize.
Cigarettes and other types of tobacco are notorious for staining teeth.
However, you can avoid all things that stain teeth. For instance, trauma, age, and certain medications or treatments can stain your teeth, such as chemotherapy.

Develop a good relationship with your doctor.,
Educate yourself.,
Find a support group.,
Establish a support network.,
Make sure your potential caregivers are prepared to help you.,
Develop coping strategies.",How to Cope with a Parkinson's Diagnosis1," When you have PD, you and your doctor will be working together as you manage your condition. Treat the relationship as an equal partnership, not a “doctor knows best” situation.Go to your doctor with questions, comments, and concerns you have. Share what you have learned about the condition from books and articles you have read. Take an active part in your management.
For example, you may want to ask, ""How will treatment affect my every day life?,"" ""What side effects will treatment give?,"" ""Will I have to stop doing the things I enjoy doing?,"" or ""How will this affect my family and relationships?""
Since memory loss is a common symptom of PD, make sure to write down questions as you think of them. Bring a list of questions you have written down to your next appointment.
Part of developing this relationship is finding a doctor you like and trust, and that respects your opinions. If you don’t like your doctor, don’t be afraid to find a new one.;
, If you have never known anyone with PD before, you may not even know what being diagnosed means. You may have misconceptions gained from popular culture, or you may have been told misinformation in the past. Start learning about Parkinson’s disease.Go slowly. There is a lot of information, and gaining too much information at one time might be overwhelming.
Ask your doctor for resources. Buy books about PD, or search online for reputable websites with information. Some Parkinson’s organization offer free educational resources.
Exercise caution when using internet resources. Not all of the information you find on the net will be reliable. If you find information online and you’re not sure whether or not it is accurate, ask your doctor or another trusted healthcare provider about it.

, When you get diagnosed, you may want to read about or talk to others who have PD. Learning about someone else’s experience can help you see that you can live with and manage your disease and still live a full life. Discovering the experiences, both good and bad, of others can help give you perspective.There are online and in-person support groups for people with Parkinson’s. Support groups offer safe environments for you to go and talk about the struggles and successes of living with PD.You can ask your doctor or local hospital for help in finding a PD support group in your area. You can also look online for support groups in your area. If there are no groups available for you, try to find online support groups.
A support group may be good if you don’t have friends and family close by, or you don’t feel comfortable sharing your fears and frustrations with your family and friends.
You can get a general idea of what to expect by reading or listening to other’s experiences. If you are talking to someone in person or online, you can ask them questions or share with them your own fears or concerns. They have probably felt the same thing and can help you move towards accepting and coping.
For example, ask, ""I just got diagnosed with PD. How did this change your life?"" or ""I'm scared because of my diagnosis. How did you deal with it?""

, A support network of family and friends can listen to you, support you, and help you through the tough times. Decide who in your life should be your support network and talk to them about it.You may ask a few of them to help you. This might mean helping you as you adjust to living with Parkinson’s, helping you with management strategies, or going with you to the doctor.
Tell your family or friends, ""I have just gotten diagnosed with Parkinson's. This is going to be tough for me, so I would like to know if I can turn to you for support when I need it.""

, Understand that caring for someone with PD can be difficult for caregivers. If a friend or family member has offered to help care for you, talk to them about whether they are emotionally, physically, and financially prepared to do so.Ask your caregiver(s) to accompany you to your medical appointments so that they can ask any questions they may have, gain a better understanding of what you are going through, and get information about what kind of help you may need.
Ask your caregiver to read up on PD. Your doctor may be able to provide helpful literature.
Encourage your caregiver to get help when they need it. Help can come from your caregiver’s friends and family, support groups, community and local services, or services offered through your hospital or medical center.

, When you get diagnosed with PD, you need to find ways to cope with the disease and your emotions. You can do this in a variety of ways. You have to discover what coping strategy works for you.For example, you can try meditation or deep breathing exercises.
Spend time doing things you like, such as reading, hobbies, or listening to music.
Spend times with friends, family, or your pets.
Rely on your spirituality if you are a spiritual or religious person. Faith can help you find comfort in difficult times.

Listen to him or her and don't say things like, ""Oh, you'll be alright"" or ""Don't be afraid"" or ""So-and-so had the same thing, and they are fine now."" While this may be true, your friend may feel that you are minimizing their condition and denying their feelings of fear.

, Ask if you can bring anything special. You are also offering the gift of your time.

, ""I want you to know that I will be there for you through anything you face."" or ""I love you and I always will.""

Adults should aim to eat 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day,, eat low-fat sources of proteins, such as lean meats, milk, fish, eggs, soy, beans, legumes, and nutsand eat complex, high fiber carbohydrates like whole-grain breads. Though pre-processed, pre-packaged foods are often quick and easy, over the long-term they are bad for your health because they are generally high in fats, salt, and sugar.
Try to get at least 7 - 8 hours of sleep each night. Sleep deprivation will make you more vulnerable to the emotional and psychological stressors of being a care-giver., Care-givers often feel anxious and overwhelmed. Actively trying to manage your stress will help you cope.Buffer yourself from the stresses of care-giving with a supportive social network. Take the time to maintain close relationships with friends and family. Let them help you, if they can.Exercise regularly. Try to do at least 75-150 minutes of physical activity each week. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins which will lift your mood and help you relax.Many people walk, jog, swim, or join sports teams.
Set aside time to relax. There are many different relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing, and visualizing calming images.

Use medication.,
Consider surgery.,
Try complimentary herbal treatment.,
Choose the right option for you.",How to Cope with a Parkinson's Diagnosis2," Medication is one treatment option for Parkinson's disease. These medications can help the motor symptoms of the disease, and improve your movement, mobility, and the appearance of tremors.Common drugs include Carbidopa-levodopa, Carbidopa-levodopa infusion, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, anticholinergics, and Amantadine.
These medications will help at the beginning of your condition to control physical motor symptoms. However, as the disease progresses, they will lose their effectiveness.

, Surgery is an option used later in the disease when medicine has stopped working or for those who have severe motor symptoms. Usually, the only symptoms that are able to be treated are the ones that responded to medicine earlier in your treatment.The most common surgery done for PD is deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, electrodes are implanted into your brain that are connected to a generator in your chest. The generator sends electrical pulses to your brain that helps reduce symptoms.
This is offered to advanced PD patients. It can cause problems, like infection, stroke, or a brain hemorrhage, and doesn't stop the disease from progressing., In addition to treating your PD with medicine, exercise, and diet, you and your doctor may decide to use vitamins and herbs.

Be grateful for what you have. If you have to, make a list each day of what you are grateful for.
Don’t be critical of yourself or what you can’t do. Dwelling on the negative aspects won’t help you.
Many doctors have found that those who are positive and proactive in response to their diagnosis have slower deterioration and milder symptoms., For some people, one coping strategy for PD is taking a look at your priorities. Parkinson’s can alter many aspects of your life, limiting what you can do. However, that does not mean that your life is over. You are stronger than you think you are, and prioritizing your life can help you see that and learn to cope.Make what’s important to you your top priorities.

Track your seizures.,
Assess the risk involved in an activity.,
Bring a friend.,
Request extra equipment.,
Wear a “smart watch.” A smart watch is a device that can contact a family member, or nursing service, in the event of a seizure.,
Bring a medical card and/or bracelet with you.",How to Avoid Injury During an Epileptic Seizure2," When you have epilepsy, certain activities can impose additional risks. However, risk factors are different for everyone. You can begin to understand your own level of risk by keeping a detailed log of your seizure activity. This log can help you determine how likely you are to have a seizure during a specific activity.Ask a friend or family member who spends a lot of time with you to help you keep track of:


What happens during your seizures.
How long your seizures typically last?
How often they happen?
What triggers your seizures?
Do you get a warning before the seizure occurs?
How well do you recover after a seizure?

, The riskiest situations for individuals with epilepsy are those that involve heights, traffic, water, or sources of heat/power. You may not be allowed to drive for a period of time after having a seizure or if your seizures are frequent or hard to control. This may be difficult at first, but it is important to follow the advice of your medical team. Additionally, who you will be with and what you’ll be doing play a role in your safety. After you have reviewed the risks, you can better decide if an activity is right for you.Before you engage in an activity, ask yourself the following questions:


When and where will the activity occur?
Will other people be with you?
Will any (potentially) dangerous equipment be involved?
How far will you be from help (if you need it)?

, One of the most simple and effective ways to reduce risk while you are out is to bring a friend with you. Having a friend who is aware of your condition can help to keep you safe if a seizure should happen, and/or contact help if need be. Plus, doing an activity with a friend is always more fun than doing it alone., It may be possible that requesting some extra equipment could make your experience safer, and help you to reduce the risk of injury. This could include a life vest (if you will be near water), a helmet or additional harness (if you will be doing climbing), or using a seatbelt (in a trolley or other vehicle). Consider phoning ahead to see if such accommodations will be available to you., A smart watch can also inform them of your location. Although these devices can be expensive, they can greatly reduce your risk of injury and help you to perform more activities with confidence., Anytime you leave the house, but especially if you are doing an activity that may be dangerous, carry a medical card or wear a medical bracelet. This can help ensure that you get the proper care in the event of a seizure."

Ease the person to the floor.,
Clear the area around the person.,
Put something soft under their head.,
Loosen clothing around the neck.,
Comfort the person.,
Look for a medical bracelet.",How to Avoid Injury During an Epileptic Seizure3," A “grand mal” seizure, also called a “generalized tonic-clonic” seizure, is probably what you think of when you imagine a seizure. This type of seizure may cause a person to fall down, cry out, shake, or lose consciousness. If you encounter an individual having this type of seizure, the first thing you should do is help them lie down on the ground.Once they are on the floor, roll the individual onto one side of their body.
This will help them breathe.

, Move any furniture or other items away from the person as best you can. Pay particular attention to anything sharp, blunt, or hard. Give the person a wide circle around them to prevent an injury., Place a pillow, folded blanket, folded jacket, or anything soft under the person’s head. This will help to protect their head and neck from injury.You will also want to remove their glasses.

, If they are wearing a scarf, tie, or buttoned shirt loosen this clothing as best you can. Constrictive clothing around the neck may make it difficult for them to breathe., During a seizure, an individual can likely still hear and understand you. Speak calmly and try to comfort them. Let them know that the seizure will end is just a matter of minutes, and tell them that everything is OK.You might say, “It’s OK. I’m going to stay with you. We can watch the clock together. This is only going to last for a minute or two.”

, Anytime you encounter a person having a seizure, check right away for a medical bracelet. A bracelet may communicate an epilepsy diagnosis, or another health concern. You will need this information if you must contact emergency services.These are usually small metallic bracelets worn on the wrist.
A person may also have a medical tattoo that communicates this info.

Take antiepileptic or anticonvulsant medications.,
Work with your doctor to create a personalized medication plan.,
Consider brain surgery if medications do not control your seizures.,
Consider vagus nerve stimulation.,
Talk to your doctor about responsive neurostimulation.,
Learn more about deep brain stimulation (DBS).",How to Control Temporal Lobe Seizures1," These medicines have a direct effect on the brain’s electrical activity. A seizure occurs when too much electrical activity spreads from one part of the brain to the other areas. This causes uncontrolled stimulation of nerves that supply many parts of your body. Anticonvulsants minimize these abnormally high levels of electrical activity, thereby reducing symptoms of seizures.One of the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsant medications is oxcarbazepine. It works by reducing the abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The recommended dose for adults is 1200 mg/day orally. For children ages 2 to 16 years, the recommended daily oral dose is 8-10 mg/kg.;
, Antiepileptic drugs may take up to two months to show their effects. During this time, try to remain patient and work with your doctor to create a plan for your use of medications, should the first medication you try not work. Start with one first line drug (such as oxcarbazepine described above, or lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or phenytoin). Begin at a low dose and gradually increase the dose until you no longer experience seizures.


If the first medication you try does not reduce your seizures, or you experience negative side effects (such as bowel disturbance, baldness, breast enlargement in males, abnormal hair growth in females, skin rash etc) then your doctor may add a second line drug to your medication regimen. These second line drugs could include topiramate, zonisamide, valproic acid, tiagabine, gabapentin, lacosamide, or phenobarbital.
If the second line drug is not effective, then your doctor will phase you off of it and then start you on a different one. Always consult your doctor before stopping or reducing a medication.

, A brain surgery called temporal lobe resection may be an option for people whose seizures are not controlled by medication. It may also be an option for patients whose seizures are disabling or when the side effects of medications are too severe and can greatly affect the quality of your life. Brain surgery is only considered if the area of the brain where seizures usually start (called seizure focus) can be clearly identified. Also, the area of the brain to be removed must not be responsible for any vital or critical functions such as movement, sensation and language.


In this procedure, the brain tissue in the temporal lobe is resected, or cut away in order to remove the seizure focus. Nearly 90 percent of people with temporal lobe seizures see a significant reduction or cessation of seizures after getting this surgery.However, because the temporal lobe’s functions include organizing sensory input, language and speech production, auditory perception and memory association and formation, removing a portion of it increases the patient’s risks for:
Double vision
Memory problems
Motor skills and language problems
Partial, one-sided weakness or paralysis of the body
Reduced visual field

, This type of surgery makes use of a vagus nerve stimulator, which is a small device that is surgically implanted under the skin near the collarbone. The vagus nerve is one of the 12 cranial nerves in the body that is found in the neck and has many functions such as breathing, speech, sweating, regulating heartbeat and emptying of food. A wire or lead under the skin connects the vagus nerve stimulator to the vagus nerve in the neck.The doctor programs the device to create weak electrical signals that travel along the vagus nerve to the brain at regular intervals. These signals aid in preventing electrical bursts in the brain that cause seizures. The vagus nerve stimulator can be activated right after surgery.
A slight bulge in the area of the collarbone can be noticed and the surgery will leave scars on the side of the neck.

, Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) is a device that directly stimulates the brain to stop or control seizures. The surgeon will surgically implant the stimulator in the skull that is connected to one or two electroencephalogram (EEG) leads which records the brain’s electrical activity. These leads are surgically implanted in or on top of the brain where the abnormal electric activities start.The device is battery-operated and has special technology that is able to detect and record the brain’s electrical activity. When the device detects a seizure, it automatically sends an electric current to disrupt the seizure activity. The device is programmed by neurologist based on the EEG and response of the patient.

, DBS therapy controls excess electrical activity in the brain through the use of regular electrical impulses to minimize the frequency and severity of seizures. The surgery for DBS is done by a trained neurosurgeon under general anaesthetic. During the first part of the surgical procedure, two leads are placed inside the brain through an incision in the skull. The leads are connected to small wires and are attached to the neurostimulator.During the second part of the surgical procedure, the neurostimulator is implanted under the collarbone. The neurostimulator contains a small battery and a computer chip that is programmed to send electrical current to the brain in case of seizures in order to disrupt it. After the surgery, the stimulator is programmed by the doctor using a hand-held computer. This sets the amount of electrical stimulation delivered. It can take several months for doctors to determine the right level of stimulation because it varies from person to person, so careful monitoring and recording is done.

Consider buying dementia aids.",How to Care for Someone With Dementia," Read books and learn all you can about dementia so you better understand what you are dealing with. There are a wide range of products available to help make both the dementia patient and the caregivers life easier.;
, People with dementia are for the most part caring, smart, funny and always wanting to help others. They respond to kindness and they need a lot of patience.

, Sometimes people with dementia become anxious or angry. At these times diversion is most important. They like to be kept busy with games, crafts, singing, or just talking about the past. Their abilities will be different because the stage of their dementia is different.

, It will be hard for a mate not to grieve the loss of his/her mate of many years, or for the child not to grieve the loss of a loving parent. Attend support groups and seminars, and know you are not alone.

, For those who are caring for relatives suffering with dementia, there are a range of dementia products and dementia aids designed to make both carer and patients' lives easier. Many drug stores and medical supply shops may carry them and you can find sites on the web which carry a whole range of items specifically geared towards patients with dementia.

These products cover a range of categories, such as memory aids for dementia, mobility support aids, products to improve bathing safety, assistive devices, nutritional items for specific needs, products to help deal with and manage incontinence, special clothing and aids for vision and hearing.
Some of these products are designed to help daily life. Dementia products such as mobility aids and hearing devices provide essential day to day support and good nutritional products can provide valuable calories, nutrients and support a balanced diet, or act as a meal replacement where required.
Other products are valuable for emergencies - such as incontinence management products and aids and also for hospital trips where an extended stay is required. Products exist to help make homes more friendly for patients liable to be wobbly on their feet - to help get in and out of the bath, or up steps for example, by adding wheelchair friendly ramps and aids to mobility.
Others still are designed for the lighter side of living with dementia and help encourage recreation and activity - such as large print playing cards and decorative canes for patients who wish to maintain a sense of style!
The market for dementia aids is growing all the time and offering ever better choice and availability, as new innovations seek to help manage and ease life with the condition and help carers offer easier support and assistance in maintaining a good, dignified quality of life for the patient.

Find a support system.,
Join a community or support group for individuals with MS.",How to Cope With a Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis1," Seek out a doctor who is knowledgeable about MS and can explain the complex personal and medical issues that come with a diagnosis. It may take time, but continue to shop around for a doctor whom you like and are willing to have potentially difficult conversations with. Once you’ve found a physician you like schedule regular appointments to be able to discuss your current state and be informed as possible.Research multi-disciplinary MS clinics for a physician you can see regularly.Consult your current physician for referrals to an MS specialist by asking questions, like “Can you recommend a specialist whom you like?” or “Is there a MS specialist within your group practice?”;
, Understanding the progression of your diagnosis and the potential treatment options will give you a larger scope of what your options are and how best to go about treatment. There are four different types of MS (Relapsing-Remitting, Primary-Progressive, Secondary-Progressive, and Progressive-Relapsing) that call for different treatments at varying points in the progression of the diagnosis.Consult your doctor, and visit online resources like the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, to understand the different types of MS and their potential treatments.MS treatments consist of multiple elements: disease-modifying medication, treating exacerbations, managing symptoms, rehabilitation, and providing emotional support. Discuss each of these elements with your doctor to fully understand your options for treatment., Work with your doctor to choose a treatment plan that works best for you. Creating a treatment plan will provide actionable steps to managing your diagnosis and allow you to set attainable and realistic goals.


Ask your doctor questions like, “How do I go about treating my symptoms?” “Which disease modifying medications would best benefit my diagnosis?” and “When should I enroll in a rehabilitation program?”, Family, friends, or loved ones can provide emotional support as well as another perspective to ask questions from. If you already have a primary caregiver in mind have them accompany you to your initial appointments to learn as much as possible about your diagnosis as possible.Have your family, friend, or loved one take notes on diagnosis explanations, treatment options and methods, as well as medications, rehabilitation, and referrals.Draft a list of questions about your diagnosis or treatment to ask your doctor together.

, Joining support groups can not only provide emotional support but can also be a great resource of information about the progression of MS and the many coping strategies around diagnosis. Reach out the the National Multiple Sclerosis Society to see where local support groups meet near you.Enroll in the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s “Knowledge is Power” program to have access to literature, videos, and worksheets for those diagnosed with MS."

Increase your sodium intake.,
Up your intake of calcium.,
Eat more magnesium-rich foods.,
Increase your intake of Omega-3 fatty acids.",How to Control Temporal Lobe Seizures2," A person with hyponatremia, or low levels of sodium in the body, can suffer seizures from brain swelling. This happens when water flows into the brain because of a drop in sodium levels, in order to balance the level of fluid and salt. This leads to cerebral edema or brain swelling. The excess fluid now disrupts the ability of the neurons or nerve cells to transmit electrical signals. This disruption can cause abnormal electric impulses or activity in the brain and may aggravate the occurrence of temporal lobe seizures.


The recommended intake of sodium is less than 2300 mg a day.Foods rich in sodium are bacon, soy sauce, cured meat and fish, cheese, pickles, instant noodles, roasted and salted nuts, pretzels, eggs, biscuits and canned goods.

, Performing any kind of brain function requires several neurons or nerve cells in different parts of the brain to communicate with each other. They are able to communicate by sending electrical signals, triggering an inflow of calcium ions into active cells. Having a sufficient amount of calcium in the body aids in proper nerve cell communication through the use of electrical signals in the brain.


If the level of calcium in the body drops, it can result to a disruption in the electrical signals in the brain and may aggravate the occurrence of temporal lobe seizures.
The recommended intake of calcium is 1000 mg per day.Foods rich in calcium are cheese, yogurt, milk, sardines, spinach, kale, fortified cereals, oranges, soybeans and enriched breads.

, Magnesium is a well-known anticonvulsive agent that helps regulate the electrical activity in the brain. Low levels of magnesium can lead to abnormal electrical activity in the brain and may aggravate the occurrence of temporal lobe seizures.The recommended intake of magnesium is 350 mg daily. Foods rich in magnesium are spinach, nuts and seeds, mackerel, beans, lentils, brown rice, avocados, yogurt, bananas, dried fruit and dark chocolate.

, Omega-3 fatty acids play important roles in determining both the structural and functional properties of neuronal membranes. Omega-3 affects the membrane’s functions, which include electrical signalling, sensitivity of receptors and release of brain chemicals or neurotransmitters. If the level of omega-3 fatty acids is insufficient, the electrical signalling in the brain can be impaired and can result to abnormal electrical activity, which in turn leads to the occurrence of temporal lobe seizures.The recommended dose for omega-3 fatty acids is not more than 3 grams daily. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids are sardines, salmon, soybeans, flax seeds, walnuts, tofu, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, shrimp and winter squash.

Follow your biological clock.,
Try to avoid becoming constipated.,
Stop smoking.,
Control your stress levels.,
Adopt certain safety measures.",How to Control Temporal Lobe Seizures3," Everyone has a biological or internal clock that senses what time of day or night it is, so that your body can prepare itself for the activities you will be doing during that time. This internal clock is controlled by hormones and enzymes like cortisol. Your neural functioning is affected by this internal clock. Because of this, you should try to stick to the activities your brain thinks you should be doing at each time of day.


This means avoiding stimulating yourself with substances like caffeine at nighttime, as this can affect when you go to sleep.
Keep your work space well lit during the day, as this will help to keep your brain stimulated.

, When you are constipated, your body forms and absorbs toxic substances that can affect your brain and nervous system. In turn, these toxins may act as a trigger for seizure activity.


Eat plenty of fiber by including fiber-rich fruits and vegetables in your diet. You should also stay hydrated in order to maintain good bowel health.

, The nicotine in cigarettes acts on brain receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter (brain chemicals that stimulate brain functions) acetylcholine. This increases neuronal firing or the process in which the neurons or nerves relay messages to each other through electrical impulses. If there are excessive electrical impulses in the brain, it may aggravate the occurrence of temporal lobe seizures.


Talk to your doctor about methods you can use to quit smoking. You can also read an article about the topic here.

, Stress deranges normal neuronal activities in the brain which may act as a trigger for seizures. Try to live as stress-free a life as possible in order to control any stress-induced seizures you may experience.



Try meditating to control your stress levels. To meditate, find a quiet, calm place to sit. Close your eyes and focus solely on the air passing in and out of your body as you breathe. Let your worries and anxieties slip away. There are several different kinds of meditation, including mantra meditation, and mindful meditation.Another way to fight stress is to engage both your body and mind by practicing yoga. Yoga can help to strengthen your body, while also acting as a form of meditation for your mind. You can practice yoga at home, or you can sign up for a yoga class at your local gym or meditation center., These are not to control seizures but to prevent accidents and injuries during a seizure episode. You do not have control of yourself during a seizure and it could put you at risk for injury, especially if you are alone.


Do not swim or go into any body of water by yourself. Wear a life jacket before going into the water.
Do not climb ladders or position yourself in precarious places, as you may fall if you have a seizure.
Do not drive or operate dangerous mechanical tools.

Relax frequently.",How to Cope With a Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis2," A diagnosis of MS means that you will inevitably have to adjust your lifestyle. Allow yourself to grieve over what potential changes lie ahead and begin planning and making adjustments.


Consider the physical, mental, and emotional effects of your diagnosis and make adjustments accordingly. You may not be able to go running every morning, but you can still participate in aerobic exercise. You many need to write things down more frequently to improve dexterity and memory.Find a rehabilitation clinic focused specifically on MS patients that can deal with physical, cognitive, mental, and occupational rehabilitation., Be flexible and allow yourself room to learn new ways to do old activities. Understanding that the way you live will change will allow you to enjoy your life as much as possible.


Be patient. Although some tasks or activities might only need minor adjustments some might require you to completely relearn them.

, Setting goals will keep you determined and give you a sense of purpose to continue moving forward. Coordinate goals with your rehabilitation program as well as setting your own personal goals, whether they be professional or personal.


Take the time to develop long term goals, like minimizing the effects of MS, adapting your home to be more accessible, or working with a vocational rehabilitation therapist to make a career transition into something that can be managed with your treatment.Set short term goals. These can be associated with treatment and therapy, like improving mobility, strength, and balance, or with personal goals, like getting breakfast with a group of friends each week, starting a book club, or taking up a new hobby., Exercise is an important part of coping with MS. The more aerobic exercise you do the more muscle you’ll build and the less you will be affected by depression or fatigue. Consult with your doctor or rehabilitation program to decide on what exercise regimen is best for you.Try low impact aerobic exercises, like water aerobics or swimming.

, Relax can help establish and promote a sense of overall well being. Taking up mentally and physically relaxing hobbies can help relieve immediate stress as well as provide long term relief.Try and yoga or meditation class, or get a weekly massage.
Relaxing doesn’t only mean being still. Take time to go and have fun!

Disclose your diagnosis to your family.,
Tell your friends about your MS.,
Seek advice from a therapist.",How to Cope With a Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis3," Disclosing your diagnosis can be complicated and come with many reservations. No person is the same and neither will each conversation disclosing your diagnosis be. Telling those closest to you of your diagnosis is the best way to rally their support behind you.


Asking yourself questions, like “What do I want this person to know?” or “What reactions do I expect once I’ve told them?” will help you prepare your disclosure., Telling your friends is the next step to creating a community and network of support. Not everyone needs to be told at the same time, so start with friends with whom you feel the most comfortable. As time progresses you may find that you’re willing to disclose your diagnosis to more people.Asking yourself questions like, “What do I want this person to understand about my MS?” or “What is the best way to deliver this information: face to face, with a pamphlet, over the phone?” will help you determine how to disclose your diagnosis and therefore how to receive the most support.Remember, it’s your diagnosis. You don’t have to tell anyone if you don’t want to.

, Seek a therapist if you would like to discuss feelings you have about how your diagnosis might affect your current relationships in an one-on-one atmosphere. See a therapist will also allow you to discuss personal issues you are not yet ready to discuss with your family, friends, or support groups.Consult your physician or rehabilitation center to ask for therapist recommendations.

Avoid future pinched nerves.",How to Treat a Pinched Nerve," A pinched nerve occurs when a nerve is damaged in some way and unable to fully send its signals. It is caused when a nerve gets compressed, which can be due to a herniated disc, arthritis, or bone spurs. You can also get a pinched nerve from other situations and activities such as injury, poor posture, repetitive motions, sports, hobbies, and obesity. Pinched nerves can occur all over the body, although they are most common in the spine, neck, wrists, and elbows.

These conditions cause inflammation, which constricts your nerves and causes them to become pinched.
Poor nutrition and general health can worsen a pinched nerve.
This condition can be reversible or irreversible, depending on the severity of the case.;
, A pinched nerve is essentially a physical obstruction of body’s wiring system. The symptoms of a pinched nerve usually include numbness, minor swelling, sharp pain, tingling, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness. A pinched nerve is typically associated with shooting pains in the affected area.


These symptoms happen because the nerves are not effectively sending signals through the body due to the compression or obstruction to your nerve., Once you diagnose your pinched nerve, you need to start taking care of yourself. You should stay off of the affected body part or use it less. Repetitive use of muscles, joints, and tendons that have caused the compressed nerves will make it worse. This is because the surrounding areas continue to swell and constrict the nerve. The easiest way to get a bit of immediate pain relief from any compressed nerve is to rest the pinched nerve and the surrounding area until the swelling and compression completely subsides.


You should avoid flexing and moving the area of the pinched nerve so you don't pinch the nerve even further. There are certain movements that cause your symptoms to immediately get worse, and these movements should be avoided if at all possible.
If a certain movement or position causes increased symptoms and pain, isolate the injured area and avoid doing that movement.
In the case of carpal tunnel, a common injury that is caused by a pinched nerve, keeping the wrist straight during sleep and avoiding any bending of the joint will provide the most relief from any compression., Sleeping extra hours is the natural way for your body to repair damage. If necessary, take the time to sleep extra hours each night until you feel better or the pain subsides. A couple hours of extra rest for your body and the injured area should help decrease the symptoms significantly.


This works directly with limiting overuse. If you sleep more, you are moving less. Not only will you not overuse the affected area, your body will have more time to heal itself as you sleep.

, There may be times where you cannot rest the affected nerve as much as you want because of work, school, or other obligations. If this is the case, you can wear a brace or splint to immobilize the injured area. This will allow you to do some basic work like usual.

For example, if the pinched nerve is in your neck, use a neck brace to help hold the muscles still throughout your day.
If your pinched nerve is the result of carpal tunnel syndrome, use a wrist or elbow brace, also known as a volar carpal splint, to avoid an unnecessary movement.Braces can be found at most retail drug stores. Follow the instructions provided with the brace. If you have any questions or concerns, consult your doctor for additional help.

, A pinched nerve is often accompanied by swelling, and swelling can compress the nerve even further. To help reduce swelling and increase circulation, rotate between periods of using ice and heat on the area of the pinched nerve, which is a method called hydrotherapy. Apply ice for 15 minutes 3-4 times a day to help reduce inflammation. After that, apply a heat pad to the affected area for 1 hour for 4-5 nights a week until your symptoms get better.

Place an ice pack, either a store bought one or a homemade one, over the affected area with light pressure. The pressure will help to cool the affected area. Keep a soft cloth between the ice pack and your skin to prevent any burns from the cold. Do not use for more than 15 minutes because it slows blood flow, which stalls healing.
Use a hot water bottle or a heat pad after icing to encourage blood flow, which can help to speed up the healing process. Do not heat for over an hour because it can increase inflammation.
You can also take a hot bath or soak the pinched nerve in hot water to relax the muscles in the area and increase blood flow., Applying pressure to the pinched nerve can help to relieve tension and reduce pain. Get a full body massage to help induce relaxation in all your muscles, relaxing the affected area as well. You can also get a gentle, targeted massage of the area near the pinched nerve. This will offer more specific relief and help the nerve to heal.


You can also massage the affected area yourself to get some relief. Gently knead the area with your fingers to increase blood flow and loosen any muscles that may be contributing to the compression of your nerve.
Avoid intense deep-tissue massage or heavy pressure because this could apply unnecessary pressure and worsen the pinched nerve., Many over-the-counter pain relievers are are great for treating a pinched nerve. Try taking non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin to reduce any swelling and pain.

Follow the instructions provided with your medication and review all warnings. Consult a doctor if you are unsure about dosing or side effects, especially if you have other medical problems or take other medications.

, If the symptoms and pain subside but continue to come back over the course of several weeks or months, consult your doctor for help. Even if the suggested methods to alleviate symptoms were originally helpful, if they no longer provide relief, you need to get the area checked.

You should also see a doctor if you feel constant numbness or pain in the area despite minimal use or if the muscles in the affected area feel weaker over time.
Seek immediate treatment if the symptoms are severe or the area feels cold or appears very pale or blue.

, You can rest your pinched nerve and still keep your blood pumping. Good blood and oxygen circulation and toned muscles can actually help heal the pinched nerve. Daily activity should be done conservatively and only when it is comfortable for you. Try going swimming or for walks. These will help to move your muscles naturally while placing a minimal amount of stress on the joints and tendons where the pinched nerve is.


Inactivity can lead to a loss of muscle strength and cause the healing process of the pinched nerve to take much more time.Keep good posture when exercising or resting. This will help to ease tension at the location of the pinched nerve.
Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent a pinched nerve.

, One of the underlying factors of a pinched nerve is a calcium deficiency. You should start eating more calcium rich foods such as dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt and leafy greens like spinach and kale. This can help the nerve and also improve your overall health.


You can also take calcium as a supplement. You can buy these from many health food stores, general stores, or pharmacies to take on a daily basis. Follow the directions or consult your doctor if you are unsure of how much calcium to take. Never take more than the recommended dose.
Check labels of packaged foods to see if they are calcium fortified. Many brands offer a calcium enriched product in addition to their usual products.

, Potassium is a key ion involved in cell metabolism. Because it causes weaker connections between nerves, a lack of potassium can sometimes contribute to symptoms of a pinched nerve. Increasing potassium in the diet may help to restore proper balance to your nerve function and alleviate your symptoms.


Foods rich in potassium include apricots, bananas, avocados, and nuts. Drinking fluids like skim milk and orange juice can help to increase potassium absorption.
Potassium supplements, similar to calcium supplements, can be taken on a regular basis in addition to a healthy diet. Talk to your doctor before taking potassium supplements, especially if you have other medical problems (especially problems with your kidneys) or take other medications. Your doctor may want to check your blood for potassium levels before recommending supplements.
Potassium deficiency is diagnosed by a doctor. To help rectify a potassium deficiency, your doctor may recommend a diet with increased potassium intake after assessing the underlying cause. Consult your doctor if you suspect this could be an issue., If you are having problems and no method has worked, you might consider seeing a physical therapist. She can give you specialized stretches and exercises that aid in healing a pinched nerve. Certain exercises relieve the pressure on the pinched nerve, helping to reduce pain. Many of the stretches used in this healing process must be done with a trained professional or partner, so don't do them on your own.


As time goes on, your physical therapist may give you additional exercises that can be done on your own. Don't do any of the exercises alone unless she tells you to do so.

, This treatment, used mainly in treating a pinched sciatic nerve, can alleviate pain and help to heal the nerve. It involves a steroid shot to the spine and can only be injected by a doctor. After being evaluated by your doctor for the degree and type of pinched nerve you have, she may discuss this option with you.Epidural steroid injections can be a quick and effective means of getting relief from your pain. When this procedure is performed by a trained medical professional, any side effects and dangers are considered remote. However, rare side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, backache, and bleeding from the site of injection., For significant pain or symptoms that are not improved with other treatments, surgery on the pinched nerve may be the best treatment. The surgery may be to relieve pressure or to remove the part of the area that is pinching the nerve. Surgery usually provides relief after recovery. Recurrence of the pinched nerve may occur but is typically rare.


A pinched nerve in the wrist may involve cutting muscle tissue to alleviate pressure in the area.
Pinched nerves caused by a herniated disc may be corrected by removing part or all of the disc, followed by spinal stabilization., Even after symptoms have subsided, it is important to continue to properly exercise, maintain proper body mechanics and good posture, and avoid previously discussed risk factors. Recovery from pinched nerves will depend on a number of factors including the degree of nerve impingement, maintenance of a treatment regimen, and any underlying disease processes.


Full recovery is common in pinched nerves in the back. Acute low back pain caused by pinched nerves usually subsides within about 6 weeks of targeted care in 90% of individuals., Most pinched nerves will recover completely and, in most individuals, symptoms will be get better with proper treatment. To prevent re-injury, avoid any repetitive motions that have previously caused pinched nerves. The most important thing you can do is to listen to your body. If a movement begins to cause discomfort or symptoms of a pinched nerve appear, stop what you are doing at the time and allow the affected area to recover.


Talk with your doctor about a plan and regimen to properly care for and balance the use, rest, and isolation of your previously affected nerve.
The use of a brace as a preventive measure before a nerve is pinched can help.

Don't confuse synesthesia with hallucinations.,
Be aware that no two people with synesthesia have the same experience.,
See your primary care doctor.,
See an eye doctor.,
Understand that some doctors do not believe in synesthesia.",How to Tell if You Have Synesthesia," Synesthesia is considered a rare neurological condition that affects the senses, but it's likely that many people who have it are either undiagnosed or assume that other perceive the world just like them. It is unknown how many people have synesthesia.;
, If you actually see colors in the air, smell, hear, or feel things, you have projected synesthesia. This form of synesthesia is rarer than associated synesthesia and is what people first think of as synesthesia.


Some people with synesthesia (called synesthetes) hear, smell, taste or feel pain in color.Others can taste shapes or perceive written letters and words in different colors. For example, they may see an ""F"" in red and a ""P"" in yellow when they read.
Some synesthetes see abstract concepts, such as abstract shapes, units of time or mathematical equations floating in space outside their bodies — this is termed ""conceptual synesthesia.""

, According to research done in the U.S., there are some factors strongly associated with synesthesia. For example, about 3x more women than men have synesthesia in the U.S.People who have synesthesia are also much more likely to be left handed and have a 40% chance of a relative having the same condition.

, Often when people talk of their synesthesia, others assume they are hallucinating or on drugs. What distinguishes true synesthesia experiences from hallucinations is that they are repeatable and predictable, not fanciful and random.For example, if you taste strawberries when you hear a certain song, then one must always trigger the other sensation in a predictable fashion to be considered a synesthete. It doesn't always have to be two-way, though.


Synesthetes often note being teased and ridiculed (usually starting in childhood) for describing sensory experiences that others can't experience.

, Synesthesia is a sort of cross-wiring of the nerves and brain synapses related to the five senses. And no two synesthetes have the exact same wiring scheme. For example, the most common form of synesthesia is grapheme-color, when numbers and letters each have their own color. The colors assigned to each letter are different for everyone, but many people have red A's. Another common form is chromesthesia, or colored hearing — sounds, music or voices that are heard and also trigger the eyes to see colors.However, someone may see the color red whenever they hear the word ""dog"", whereas another might see the color orange. Synesthetic perceptions are specific to each person.

, Because the sensations of synesthesia can mimic certain medical conditions and head injuries, it's a good idea to see your doctor to rule out anything serious. They will check the functioning of your brain, reflexes and senses to see if you have any physical problems or deficits. If they believe that it is something serious, they might refer you to a neurologist. Keep in mind that people with synesthesia typically pass all standard neurological exams and are considered normal in that way.If you have a neurological deficit that's causing visual sensations, then you're very unlikely to also have synesthesia.


Head trauma, post-concussion syndrome, brain tumors, brain infections, migraine headaches, seizures with auras, epilepsy, cerebral stroke, toxic reactions, LSD ""flashbacks"" and experimentation with hallucinogens (peyote, mushrooms) can all produce sensory phenomena similar to synesthesia.
Synesthesia is usually present from birth, so developing it as an adult is extremely rare. If it comes on suddenly in adulthood, see your doctor immediately for an assessment because it could be related to a problem with your brain / nervous system., Some visual sensations of synesthesia can also mimic certain eye diseases and conditions, so it's a good idea to see an optometrist or an ophthalmologist to get your eyes examined. Eye trauma, glaucoma (pressure in the eye), cataracts, retinal or vitreous detachment, corneal edema, macular degeneration, and optic nerve dysfunction are all eye conditions that can produce visual phenomena and color distortion.The vast majority of people with synesthesia do not suffer from any physical ailments of their eyes.
An ophthalmologist (eye disease specialists) is likely a better choice than an optometrist, who mainly focuses on determining the acuity of your eyesight and prescribing glasses / contacts.

, You may encounter some doctors who do not believe that the condition exists. Furthermore, some insurance companies may not cover treatment. You should still visit a doctor to rule out any underlying conditions that might be causing your symptoms, but be aware that your doctor might diagnose it as something else entirely.


You may want to get a second opinion, if you believe that your concerns are not being taken seriously by the doctor.
If your doctor says you do not have synesthesia but have a different condition entirely, trust their advice, and follow their instructions for treatment.

Conduct an online search.,
Go to the DMV in person.,
Get a replacement ID.,
Let your family know about your wishes.",How to Remove Your Name from the Organ Donation Registry1," The simplest way to remove your name from the organ donor's registry is to do so through your state's Department of Motor Vehicles. In many states, you can complete at least a portion of this process online.


Do an internet search containing the words ""remove my name from organ donor registry"" along with the name of your state.
In many states, you will be able to submit a form online that removes you from the registry. You'll need to know basic information about yourself, such as name, address, and drivers' license or ID number. You'll simply fill the form out and submit it.In other states, you'll have to print out a form, fill it out, and mail or fax it to the DMV.;
, If you prefer, visit your local DMV in person. Depending on what state you live in, you might have to fill out a special form to remove your name, while in other states, you'll just request an updated driver's license or ID card., Regardless of whether you remove your name from the registry through an online form or have to send a form in, you need to get an updated ID so that your wishes are clear in the event of an emergency.


Depending on your state's policy, you may have to pay for a replacement.

, While your family can't override your wishes not to be an organ donor, you should let them know about your decision anyway. That way, in case you die without identification, there will be no confusion about what you want done with your organs.

Go to the Donate Life website.,
Go to the registration section.,
Get a new driver's license or ID.,
Let your family know about your wishes.",How to Remove Your Name from the Organ Donation Registry2," Donate Life is a nonprofit organization that maintains organ donation registration information for many states across the country. As a matter of fact, many DMV websites will actually redirect to a Donate Life site in order for an individual to modify or change registration information.If you have the option (and you probably will), go to your state's Donate Life site rather than the national site, http://www.registerme.org. The state sites are usually more accurate, up to date, and functional.

, There will be section on the webpage that will say ""update my donor profile,"" or ""edit registration."" Click this link.


After you follow the link, there will be a space for you to enter your name, date of birth, zip code, and driver's license number. Once you enter that information, it takes you to a page where you'll see all your donor information. There you can remove your name from the registry completely or prohibit certain organs from being donated. , Although there's a low probability it would be an issue, in an emergency situation, you don't want to take any chances you'd be mistaken for an organ donor. So even if you've updated your information with the registry itself, you need to update your ID.


Depending on your state's policy, you may have to pay for a replacement ID card.

, Just to be clear, your family can't override your wishes not to be an organ donor. Nonetheless, you should let them know about your decision. That way, in case you die without identification, there will be no confusion about what you want done with your organs.

It is also cheaper than using the services of an attorney.Advance directive and living wills are legal documents that make a formal declaration about your wishes for end of life care (should you be unconscious), including life support and organ donation.
The US Living Will Registry keeps a record of your advance directive or living will and puts it in a national database that health care providers across the country access.

, The Living Will Registry maintains a list of advance directive forms for all fifty US states. You can find them at http://uslwr.com/formslist.shtm. Pick the form for your state, fill it out according to your wishes, and have it notarized., Although the advance directive you filled out is perfectly valid all by itself, it will be a much more effective document if it is uploaded to the Living Will Registry's database, because health care providers across the country will access it in the event of your death or incapacity.The cost to purchase a spot in the registry is $59. It gives you a place in the registry for five years, meaning that it's just a little more than $10 per year.

Rest your muscles.,
Use heat therapy.,
Perform piriformis stretches.,
Apply ice.,
Make yourself comfortable.",How to Beat Piriformis Syndrome1," If you are having pain and discomfort from piriformis syndrome, then one of the best things you can do is rest your body. Piriformis syndrome may be the result of irritation or injury from exercise or other forms of strenuous activity.If you have a physical job or you like to exercise every day, then this advice may be a challenge for you. But it is important to rest to avoid further damage or irritation to the piriformis and to allow it to recover.;
, Heat therapy is an effective way to help soothe pain and discomfort caused by piriformis syndrome. Heat therapy is also an effective way to warm up your muscles before stretching them.Try using a heating pad on the affected area or take a warm bath to cover more areas at once.

, Certain stretches have been found to be effective at relieving some of the pain and discomfort associated with piriformis syndrome. For best results, you will need to perform the stretches three times per day.To perform a piriformis stretch, you will need to lay on the floor with your knees bent and both of your feet flat on the floor.
Then, pull your right leg in towards your chest and use your left hand to pull the leg over to the left side of your body.
Hold the stretch for five to 30 seconds, depending on your abilities.
Repeat the stretch on the other leg.

, After stretching, applying ice can be an effective way to reduce pain and swelling associated with piriformis syndrome. To use ice, wrap an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables in a thin cloth or paper towel. Then place the ice pack on the most painful area. Leave the ice pack in place for about 20 minutes and then remove it. Wait for at least 2 hours to reapply., Piriformis syndrome may be agitated by sitting or standing in certain positions, so you will need to make sure to avoid these positions. Do what you need to do to make yourself comfortable while sitting and standing.Try sitting on a cushion or comfortable chair if sitting feels painful to you. If you have trouble standing, consider using crutches or a cane to help support your weight while you stand.

Learn critical facts about prions.,
Watch for meat recalls.,
Only buy meat from local farmers.,
Cut back on meat consumption.",How to Avoid Contracting variant Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Disease,"


Prions are misfolded proteins that can cross the blood brain barrier and are nearly impossible to treat. The afflicted human has no choice, ultimately, but to suffer with the symptoms until it's their time to die.
Prion transmission from animal to human occurs when humans consume infected tissue from other animals that have had this disease. Other animals are primarily ruminants like cattle, sheep, deer, bison, and elk. In cattle and bison, the disease is known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in deer Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), and in sheep and goats, Scrapie. Generally when encompassing all ruminants, this disorder is known as Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE). The tissue that is most likely to retain the prions of this disease include the skull, brain, trigeminal ganglia (nerves attached to the brain), spinal cord, eyes, tonsils, dorsal root ganglia (nerves attached to the spinal cord), and the distal ileum (part of the small intestine). Although this may seem a non-point for the average meat-consumer, contamination may occur during meat processing especially if the processing is not hygienic or slaughtering/butchering requirements are not followed by law.
Unlike bacteria or viruses, prions cannot be removed from meat by sanitation or heat.
The incubation period of TSE is 8 to 10 years. Since most livestock are slaughtered well before that age, the risk of contracting vCJD may be significant, if and only if neither the producer nor the meat packers are careful to extract and eliminate any SRM (Specified Risk Material) that will contaminate supply. Just because a prion is incubating does not mean it is harmless, thus any SRM is removed on the processing floor before the meat is chilled and butchered for the supermarket shelves. In Canada and the EU, SRMs are not produced as livestock feed, unlike in the United States. Producers also follow mandatory feed regulation guidelines held by the federal government which mean feeding absolutely no animal by-products to livestock. This ban is mandatory in Canada, whereas the U.S. is a little less strict as it allows chicken waste, which contains remnants of animal by-product in it (chicken manure isn't just the manure, it also contains some feed dropped by the birds), to be fed to cattle. Chicken waste is prohibited as ruminant supplemental feed in Canada and the European Union due to risks of BSE.
Visit various sites that have more scientific facts on vCJD, BSE, TSE and Scrapie. BSEinfo.orgis a good place to start, as well as information from the CFIA on BSE. Both sites are very informative on everything to do with BSE or Mad Cow Disease.;
, In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for food recall decisions and public notification. In other countries like in Canada, the CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) is also responsible for such actions. Both the FDA and CFIA are responsible for inspecting packing plants for any flaws in the system, and to ensure the meat being produced is safe to eat. The FDA and CFIA are also where producers can report reportable diseases like BSE, CWD, Scrapie, and others.


Watching for meat recalls is easier said than done. The FDA reports on recalled food consistently. This information can be found at fsis.usda.gov.Rather than wasting your time weeding through the lengthy list, it is better to subscribe to public health alerts through your email address.
Historically, prion diseases were big news in the media in the U.S. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case, as shown by a lack of coverage on a confirmed case of BSE in 2012 after a dairy cow in California became supposedly “lame."" You now have to actively seek out that information yourself instead of relying on the media to let you know about it. If you are in Canada, the CFIA also has a site and a means to keep you updated on reportable diseases that are found. So far, in 2014, no BSE cases were found, but 4 CWDand 7 Scrapiecases have been confirmed.

, Often, that the pound of ground beef you picked up at the local grocery store came from multiple cattle . Ground meat is continually produced and is composed of different cuts of meat from different cattle. This increases the likelihood of contamination. Contamination is less likely if the meat you are getting is not ground, but in specified cuts for roasts and steaks. On the other hand, buying from local farms in bulk provides a premium (meat is more expensive, but you pay more for a better product), allows you to know where your beef comes from and how it was raised and fed, and is less likely to be contaminated.


The larger the packer facility, the more product is produced resulting in increased chances of oversight and errors in processing occurring, thus the increased risk of contamination.
Of course, get to know your local farmer and their history. If your local farmer has had no meat recalls in the past, has their animals primarily on pasture and/or fodder, and does not feed the animals any animal by-products like chicken litter, then the health of the animals is likely very good. It's often considered that local meat is safer than meat that is mass-produced.

, Change your source of meat (fish and poultry) or become vegetarian. Becoming vegetarian is probably the best way to prevent vCJD; obviously if you don’t eat contaminated meat then, in theory, you can’t get infected with any food-borne diseases. However, even the spinach you buy may have risk of being contaminated with E.coli. That said, many of our foods come contaminated, in much the same way as they have throughout history––through error, oversight and sloppy work practices. It’s best to know where your food comes from and to pay a little extra for foodstuffs that are high risk, such as meat and fresh produce.


Local foods are less likely to become contaminated. This is also true for processing; the less exposure our food has before being consumed, the less likely it is to be contaminated by any infectious rare agent.

Most aneurysms are detected after the fact, when they've already become medical emergencies, or when brain imaging is performed for other purposes. Because it's a difficult thing to screen for, most doctors will recommend against testing and looking for aneurysms that are not ruptured, unless you've experienced any of the symptoms or fit the profile of an aneurysm.;
, If you experience eye pain, specifically pain coming from behind the eye, as well as blurry vision and paralysis of the face, you need to talk to your doctor immediately and request that a screen and scan be performed.

, Your doctor may throw a lot of technical possibilities at you, so it helps to be somewhat informed before getting stuck in his or her office and getting locked into possibly-expensive tests that you might not want done. Generally, the scans performed will include:



Computerized tomography (CT). This is a special kind of X-Ray usually used to detect bleeding. The scanner produces slice-like sections of your brain to examine, and might also involve injections of fluid that will illuminate the blood in the images.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI generally uses a combination of radio waves that interact within a magnetic field to produce a detailed 2D or 3D version of your brain. Fluid may also be injected to improve the image.

Cerebrospinal fluid test. Also known as a ""spinal tap,"" this is used in cases in which you've experienced a hemorrhage that isn't showing up on another scan. Despite the gruesome common name, most patients don't experience much discomfort during or following the test.

Cerebral angiogram. During this test, a thin probe is inserted near your groin and and threaded through your arteries to your brain to inject a dye, which is used to track the flow of blood and check for hemorrhaging. It's the most invasive of the tests, only used when the others don't reveal anything.

, If your doctor notices something in a scan, or if you're concerned about the possibility of an aneurysm, you'll probably be referred to a specialist. If you fit the risk profile or have experienced any of the symptoms of an aneurysm, talk about your tests with a neurosurgeon or neurologist to get more information. Further tests and screens may be required, and you'll be able to get more specific information from an expert in the field., In addition to increasing the risk of developing emphysema and lung cancer, smoking also increases your chances of developing an aneurysm. You may need your doctor's help to find the right program to help you quit.


Also avoid exposing yourself to secondhand smoke. If you fit the risk profile, avoid indoor areas that allow smoking.

, Drinking too much alcohol can also weaken blood vessel walls, increasing the possibility of developing an aneurysm. If you have other problems related to excessive drinking, you may need to give it up entirely.

, Abusing drugs, prescription or otherwise, can lead to inflammation in blood vessels and the formation of aneurysms. Habitual cocaine and amphetamine users are particularly susceptible to the development of brain aneurysms., Choose a diet with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat and non-meat protein sources. Avoid excess fats, cholesterol, sodium and sugar. Eat smaller portions, or start preparing more of your own meals to have more control over your portions. Consider eating several smaller meals throughout the day, rather than two or three big ones.

, Maintain good cardio health and do some light strength training to maintain a healthy body weight and physique. Exercising at least 30 minutes every day will help you avoid an aneurysm or prevent one from rupturing. Your doctor can recommend suitable exercises for you if you want to get started. You don't have to go all out. If you want to start exercising, try starting with:


Light stretches in the morning before breakfast. Just doing some calisthenics for 15 or 20 minutes each morning will get you moving and can be a nice warm up to stimulate other activities.
Short sets of sit-ups and pushups. You don't have to start dead-lifting heavy weights or running marathons. Do sets of 20 sit-ups and 10 pushups to get started with and gradually work your way up.
Check out some exercise videos online or at your local library for some guided instruction, or talk to your doctor for more possibilities.

, Key factors to avoiding an aneurysm or preventing one from rupturing include monitoring your weight, cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure levels. Scheduling regular doctor's visits and staying on top of your health is the best way to avoid aneurysms altogether.

, Taking steps to manage your stress level can help you avoid developing an aneurysm or, quite literally, ""popping a blood vessel."" If you want to lessen the amount of stress in your life, start by learning to recognize the things that cause stress that you can work on. You might stressed out about:


Relationship issues
Work
Family commitments
Financial problems
Other trauma

, You deserve a break, especially if you're concerned about your health. Discuss the possibility of taking some brief time off from your job to rest up and eliminate some of the stress that you're concerned about from your life. Forget about your work worries for a while and come back refreshed and rested. Go on vacation. Visit family. Do what will relax you.


If your job is a constant source of agitation and stress in your life, you might consider switching jobs, transferring, or finding a new line of employment altogether.

, You don't have to start building ships in bottles to calm down. Find something that excites you and distracts you from the stresses of life. Want to start playing paintball? Get out there and try it. Do something that will be fun, something that exercises your mind and your body. Try:


Playing games like poker or chess


Doing outdoor activities like hiking, biking, or swimming
Reading more

Picking up an instrument, or renewing an interest in an old one
Taking a class or lessons


, Studies have shown that oldest populations worldwide all have one thing in common: they all participate in quiet, restful activities that involve no speaking, each day. Many perfectly normal people enjoy the relaxation involved in meditation, and you don't have to be a yoga master to experience the benefits.


Simply sitting quietly in or outdoors for 20 or 30 minutes each day can drastically reduce your stress. Start watching the sunset or rise each day as a way of relaxing and centering yourself.

Make sure your kit isn’t expired.",How to Test Blood Serum1," Set aside some time to read and understand the kit’s instructions before taking the test. Specific instructions will vary by test kit, and it’s essential to follow them precisely in order to yield accurate results. In particular, look for the following information:How to store the test before using it
Whether you should fast or whether anything can interfere with the test
How to collect, store, and transport the sample
Any time limits, such as how soon to send the sample to a lab after collecting it;
, If you’re using a home blood test kit, you’ll most likely have to collect your sample by pricking your fingertip. Gently massage your middle or ring finger to make it easier to draw blood. Wipe your fingertip with a sanitizing pad, such as gauze and 70% rubbing alcohol, then use the lancet to firmly prick your finger at the thickest part of your finger’s pad.Use the kit’s test strip or sample tube to collect your specimen. Avoid milking or squeezing the puncture site to draw the blood, or you might damage the sample.
Sanitize and place a bandage or gauze pad over the puncture after collecting the sample.

, Cap the collection tube and gently invert it (rotate it to turn it upside down then right side up again) if the instructions call for it. Place the sample in the mailing vessel, then send it to the laboratory.Check the instructions to see if you should freeze your sample before mailing it.

, For many home test kits, you can call the laboratory as soon as the the next business day to see if your results are available. Check your kit for an activation number and any other information you should have on hand when you call the lab.Some tests offer anonymity and use activation numbers instead of names to identify a sample.

There are no tests to confirm whether or not you have piriformis syndrome, so your doctor will perform a physical exam and ask you to explain all of your symptoms. Your doctor may also want you to have an MRI to rule out any other possible causes of your symptoms., A physical therapist can design a program developed to meet your specific needs and guide you through exercises that will efficiently stretch your muscles and relieve pain.Get started early with physical therapy to get the greatest benefit.

, Massage and trigger point therapy may offer relief for piriformis symptoms. In some cases, piriformis symptoms might actually be caused by trigger points, or muscle knots. These knots may be found in the piriformis or gluteal muscles, and the pressure they cause can lead to pain at the site of the knot or even elsewhere on the body. Locate a health professional who is trained in trigger point therapy (a doctor, massage therapist, physical therapist) and see if this is the source of your pain., Your doctor may recommend certain over-the-counter and prescription medications to help you deal with pain. For example, some doctors may prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the discomfort of your piriformis syndrome.Ask your doctor about taking ibuprofen or naproxen for occasional piriformis pain as well.

, Some injection treatments have been found to be helpful in cases of piriformis syndrome. Ask your doctor if an injection treatment might be useful in your situation. The two main injection treatments for piriformis syndrome include anesthetic injection and Botox injection.


Anesthetic injection. A pain relieving substance such as lidocaine or bupivacaine may be injected into the piriformis to help relieve pain.Botox injection. Botox injections have also been found to be effective in reducing pain and discomfort from piriformis syndrome., Electrotherapy has been found to be effective in some cases of piriformis syndrome. Ask your doctor or physical therapist about the possibility of using Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) or Interferential Current Stimulator (IFC) to help treat your piriformis syndrome., Surgery has provided long-term pain relief for some sufferers of piriformis syndrome, but as with any surgery, there are some serious potential side effects to this treatment. It is best to exhaust all of your other treatment options before looking into surgery for piriformis syndrome."

Warm up before you exercise.,
Stick to flat surfaces when you run and walk.,
Stretch after you exercise.,
Stand up straight.,
Stop exercising if it causes pain or discomfort.",How to Beat Piriformis Syndrome3," Taking five minutes to warm up your muscles can help to prevent injury and it is also a good way to prevent piriformis syndrome. Make sure that you allow your body some time to warm up before you do anything too strenuous.To warm up, just do a lighter version of the type of exercise you are about to perform. For example, if you are about to go for a run, spend five minutes walking briskly.

, Uneven surfaces can cause you to strain your muscles more than flat surfaces do. To avoid this potential risk factor, choose flat surfaces to exercise on. For example, if you live in a hilly area, go to a track to walk or run., Muscles tighten up when we exercise, so it is necessary to stretch after a workout to loosen them up again. After you finish exercising, take a few minutes to stretch all of your major muscle groups. Stretch your neck, arms, legs, and back., Poor posture may also lead to the development of piriformis syndrome, especially during exercise. Take extra care to stand up straight and tall when you are walking or running. Pay attention to your posture all other times as well., Overdoing it may lead to the development of piriformis syndrome, so it is important to know your limits. If you begin to feel pain and/or discomfort during your workout, then stop and take a break. If the pain continues after you resume, then do not do any more exercise. Rest and wait for the pain to subside. If it does not subside, then call your doctor."

Withdraw the needle swifty and apply pressure.,
Label specimens properly and promptly.",How to Test Blood Serum2," Wash your hands for at least 30 seconds in a sterile sink designated only for handwashing. Dry your hands with single-use towels and use the towels to turn off the faucet. Put on a pair of sterile, latex-free gloves before touching instruments, surfaces, or any other objects.Be sure to wash your hands and change your gloves between each procedure.

, Using a confident, calm voice, let the patient know who you are and that you’ll be drawing blood. Make sure you’re speaking to the right patient, and that they’re actually supposed to have blood drawn.Say, “Hello! I’m James, your phlebotomist, and I’m here to take a couple blood samples. Are you Jane Smith?”
If the patient seems nervous, try to be extra friendly and try to reassure them. Let them know collecting a blood sample is a quick, routine part of medical care, and that it’ll be over in just two or three minutes.

, Check the paperwork that lists the ordered tests and verify them with the patient. Ask the patient if they’ve fulfilled any instructions, such as fasting or stopping a medication.You should also ask about any allergies, such as to latex, at this time.

, If they aren’t already in position, have the patient sit in a sterilized phlebotomy chair or, if they’re in a hospital bed, sit up as best they can. Have them extend their arm and locate a straight, visible vein, preferably around the inside bend of the elbow. Apply a tourniquet three to four inches above the selected site, and ask the patient if the tourniquet is comfortable or too tight.If you can’t find a good vein, try massaging the forearm to increase blood flow or applying a warm, damp washcloth to the area for five minutes.
Avoid drawing blood from a scarred area, hematoma (or bruised area), or an IV (intravenous) site.
Collect the sample promptly after applying the tourniquet, and avoid leaving the tourniquet on for more than two minutes.

, Wipe the selected site with 70% rubbing alcohol to sanitize it. Apply firm but gentle pressure, and wipe in a circular motion from the center of the puncture site outward to cover an area of at least two centimeters (about an inch). After sanitizing, wait 30 seconds for the area to dry completely., Have the patient make a fist, and hold their arm with your thumb below the site to pull the skin taut and anchor the vein. Swiftly inject the needle into the vein at a 15 to 30 degree angle and avoid excessive probing, or moving the needle away from its point of entry. Fill the collection tube; for serum tests, it’s recommended to collect at least twice the volume of blood the test requires.For example, if a test calls for four milliliters of blood, it’s best to collect eight to ten milliliters to ensure sample viability and test accuracy.

, If you’re collecting multiple tubes of blood for multiple tests, fill tubes in the correct order to avoid cross-contamination of tube additives. Make sure to cap the sample tubes with the appropriately colored cap.For example, a blood culture tube, non-additive tube, coagulation tube, clot activator, and serum separator must be drawn in that order. A serum separator tube should be capped with a gold top., Release the tourniquet before withdrawing the needle.Remove the needle swiftly and gently in a straight backward motion along the angle of entry. Apply a clean gauze pad to the puncture site, then have the patient hold the pad in place with gentle pressure.Ask the patient to keep their arm straight to prevent a hematoma, or bruise, from forming.
Discard the used needle and syringe into a sharps container.

, Label the samples immediately with at least two patient identifiers, or according to your lab’s standards. Generally, you should include the patient’s full first and last names (or, in some cases, a unique ID code), along with their date of birth or hospital or office file number.When handwriting a label, use a ballpoint pen instead of felt tip to prevent accidentally wiping away information during handling.

"
Invert the sample gently five to ten times.,
Allow the blood to clot for 30 to 60 minutes before centrifugation.,
Pack samples safely for transportation.",How to Test Blood Serum3," After collection, you should gently invert the sample tube five to ten times. To invert the sample, slowly rotate it upside down then right side up again.Avoid inverting it too roughly or more than ten times, or you could damage the sample., A serum test sample needs to clot in an upright position before the serum can be separated in a centrifuge. After 30 to 60 minutes, place the sample in the centrifuge and spin it at 2200 to 2500 RPM.Be sure to separate the serum in a centrifuge within one hour of collection.

, Place the sample in a leak-proof plastic container with the lab request form packed or labelled on the container’s exterior. If the lab is off-site, pack the sample container in an appropriate mailing vessel, then send it to the lab for testing.The lab will then expose the sample to the appropriate detection reactants. For example, a lab might use the ELISA technique to expose the sample to an enzyme that detects a viral antibody."

Talk to your doctor.",How to Hold Your Bladder As a Woman," As your bladder fills, nerve endings in the pelvis send signals to your brain that it is time to relieve yourself. Because the urge to urinate originates from these nerve signals, try to distract yourself by thinking of something else.Try to think complex thoughts, like brainstorming ideas for a new project at work or coming up with a solution to a scheduling issue at home. If you think of simple thoughts -- like counting to 10 or going over the alphabet -- this will not fully distract you from your body's signals to urinate.
If you can wear headphones and have access to your phone or computer, try listening to the news or a podcast with a complex story. Taking in outside information will help you ignore the urge to pee.;
, You will naturally feel the urge to cross your legs and keep pressure on your pelvis. While you can do this, you should keep the rest of your body relaxed as this will distract you from the discomfort of a full bladder.


Roll your shoulders backwards and forwards. Roll your head from side to side. This will relieve pressure on your spine and neck that you might feel if you are keeping a tense posture.
If you are sitting, cross your legs so you exert slight pressure on your bladder. Square your shoulders and extend your spine. This will help you sit up straight. Do not slouch as this will put extra, unnecessary weight onto your bladder.
If you are standing, position yourself with your feet parallel and your toes touching. Distribute your weight evenly across each leg and stand tall. You might feel the urge to cross your legs while standing, but try to avoid doing this. Crossing your legs will feel awkward because it will put an uneven amount of weight on one leg.

, If you cannot access a bathroom when you need to urinate, this will cause a significant amount of mental and physical stress. Breathe deeply from your diaphragm, pushing out the muscles in your lower belly as you inhale and drawing them back in as your exhale.


This deep, measured breathing will relieve pressure on your pelvis. It will also relax other muscles in your body that may feel very tense or constricted.

, If you are wearing very tight jeans or shorts, try to loosen them or change into a different pair of pants. They may be putting undue pressure on your bladder.


Obviously, if you are in public, do not unzip or unbuckle your pants.

, If you have to walk, move very slowly.

, One of the key steps in avoiding uncomfortable pain from holding a full bladder is to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles (which are located at the base of the bladder). By completing these exercises, you can strengthen your bladder and experience less frequent urges to urinate. To find where your pelvic floor muscles are located, go to the bathroom and urinate. While you are peeing, try to stop urinating mid-stream. If you can stop, then you have found the correct muscles.To complete Kegel exercises, tighten your pelvic floor muscles while you are sitting or lying down. Hold the contraction for five seconds and then release for five counts. Repeat this exercise four to five times.
Continue to practice this exercise until you can tighten these muscles for ten seconds at a time. You should do three sets of 4-5 contractions each day.

, If you are someone who drinks large quantities of liquid in short spurts (such as after exercising or when you have a break during the day), then stagger your liquid intake so you are drinking smaller amounts of liquid throughout the day. This will relieve pressure on your bladder.


Keep a bottle of non-carbonated water by your desk and take a sip every 5-10 minutes.
You should generally aim for 9 cups of water (or 2.2 liters) every day., Your bladder will become a stronger organ if you train yourself to urinate on a regular schedule. If you schedule regular bathroom trips every 2-4 hours, then you will experience less frequent urges to urinate at unexpected times., Studies have shown that excess weight and obesity can create an overactive bladder. If you are experiencing frequent urges to pee and are also overweight, try shedding some pounds to see if this will help relieve your symptoms.You should always consult with your doctor to find the best way to lose weight. Generally, you will need a combination of moderate cardio exercise (running, walking, swimming, hiking), 3-4 times a week and a healthy diet of lean proteins, fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
Avoid foods that are high in sugar, fat and processed carbohydrates, such as white bread, white rice, white pasta, popcorn, chips, cookies, brownies, cake, ice cream, etc. Sugary drinks like soda and cocktails should also be avoided or only consumed in very small quantities.

, Certain foods have been shown to irritate the bladder and cause frequent urges to urinate. If you have a persistent need to urinate, you should avoid consuming the following:Acidic fruits (oranges, grapefruits, lemons)
Spicy foods
Chocolate
Corn syrup
Tomatoes and tomato-based sauces

, Similarly, certain beverages can also have negative effects on the bladder. Consuming the following drinks may diminish your bladder's ability to hold urine:


Sugary, carbonated drinks like soda
Drinks with artificial sweeteners (like diet sodas)
Coffee and tea
Excessive consumption of alcohol (more than 5 drinks a week)
Fruit and vegetable juices from oranges, grapefruit, and tomatoes
If you have a problem with urinary leakage or a persistent urge to pee, then try eliminating these foods and drinks for a week and see if the problem has improved. You can slowly reintroduce one or two items from these lists to see which one is the biggest irritant to your bladder., If you are experiencing longterm issues with urination, such as pain in the bladder or a persistent, constant urge to pee, then speak to your doctor about the best way to treat your symptoms.


If you are currently taking medicine for another condition such as high blood pressure or depression, this could be negatively impacting your bladder. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your dosage or switching to a medicine with fewer side effects.
You might be reluctant to talk to your doctor about your bladder issues because you think they are embarrassing. But you shouldn't hesitate to seek treatment; bladder pain could be the sign of something much larger, such as cancer or a problem in another organ such as your kidneys, so go ahead and talk to your doctor.
Medicines such as Mirabegron and botox injections to the bladder are also sometimes used to treat incontinence."

Consider the ethical problems.",How to Use Social Media to Aid an Organ Donor Search," Facebook is a powerful social media tool for organizing campaigns and has helped people find organ donors in the past. In fact, some doctors are hopeful about its potential to boost the number organ matches dramatically. If you don’t already have an account, consider signing up and building a presence there.To sign up, go to Facebook’s main page at www.facebook.com or search for Facebook on a search engine like Google.
Under the heading “Sign Up,” enter your name, email address, password, birthday, and sex. The next steps will guide you through the creation of your personal page. Once finished, you can use this as the basis for your search and add friends, photos, and messages.
You can also try creating a non-personal page for your campaign. On the Facebook homepage, click the link that says “Create a Page for a celebrity, band, or business.” Next, click the button that reads “Cause or Community,” input the name of your drive, and hit “get started.”;
, Once you’ve set up a personal or community page and added friends, write a message to tell them that you are searching for an organ donor for a friend or loved one. Try to craft an announcement that gives the essential details and asks for help. Then, post the message or share it with your group of friends.


Say something like, “Dear Friends, we want to let you know that X is very sick and needs a kidney. She is looking urgently for a donor with type B+ blood between the ages of 25 and 40. If you know a possible match, please contact us.”
You can post such a message as a personal status update. You might also send it as a “personal message” to your entire group of friends for the widest possible readership. Also, ask your friends to share the message with whomever they can.
Once you’ve announced the search, keep your friends updated. Post new messages from time to time to tell them how the search is going, if you’re still looking for a donor, or if you’ve found a match.

, As of 2012, Facebook offers users the option to update “organ donor status” on their personal profile. This was designed as a way to help boost the rate of organ donor registration and, at least at first, led thousands of people to sign up. Your own friends might not be aware of this tool, however. Encourage them to sign up.Consider posting a message about this under your personal status. Friends who are already registered to donate organs can update their profiles, but also make sure to include a link to sites where people can sign up for the first time.
If you’re in the US, you should direct friends to the “Donate Life America” page and have them click the “Sign Up” button. This will redirect them to the organization’s website, where they can register as a potential donor for organs, eyes, or tissue.

, Another way you can broaden your social media presence is by joining public organ donation pages and groups on Facebook. There are a number of these community pages, like Organdonor.gov. You can also search Facebook for similar sites in your country or area. Join them to get connected to other people who share the same interests or are potential donors.To look for sites, go to the search option and type a key word like “organ donation.” You can narrow the search only to public pages and community groups by hitting these keywords on the list of options at the top of the page.
Sign up for these pages or join open community groups. Follow the pages and post about your own search to raise awareness.

, Twitter is another way that you can approach your search for an organ donor. Like Facebook, Twitter is a social media networking site that can connect you to hundreds or even thousands of people. It also allows you to send short messages of up to 140 characters, or “Tweets.” Registered and unregistered people can read these tweets.To sign up for Twitter, go to www.twitter.com or search for Twitter on an internet search engine. Click on the button at the top of the page that says “Sign Up.” Then, follow the instructions to open an account.
Twitter is especially convenient because it can work through your mobile phone. By adding a phone number to your account, you’ll be able to send and receive tweets via SMS text messaging.
From a computer, login to your account and go to “Settings” on the drop-down profile icon. Click on the “Mobile” tab, select your country, and then enter your mobile phone number. Click “Continue” and Twitter will send you a verification code to your phone number. Enter the code to activate your phone.

, Twitter is really useful when you pair it with other social media and can help you to spread the word about your organ donor search. If you link it your Facebook profile, you can share Facebook posts on Twitter or share Tweets with your Facebook friends. Then, for example, an update about the search that you send out as a Tweet will automatically appear on your Facebook feed.If you’d like to link your accounts, go to www.facebook.com/twitter. Click “Link to Twitter” by your profile or by the page you want to link and follow the instructions.
You can also control the kinds of things that you share on Twitter. You can choose to limit if you’d only like to share status updates on the search, but also choose to include things like photos, links, and info on events.

, You’ll want to get your message out to friends and followers often to run the best and most thorough donor search. Find and follow others on Twitter to build up a network. Follow your Facebook friends if they have accounts and keep in touch using the Tweet function, sending things like news and updates.Learn to use hashtags. When you send out a Tweet, you can add a short label with the prefix #. This allows people to search for Tweets with a common topic. For example, you might add hashtags like “#organdonors” or “#organdonation” to Tweets on your search.
The internet group Organize captures all the information it can carrying hashtags about organ donation and puts it into a huge registry, as well. So far, they’ve compiled the names of about 600,000 people who support organ donation and hope that this will boost donor rates.

, Before you jump head-first into a social media search, you should check to see that finding a donor online is legal and doable in your country. In some places, like Belgium, doctors have refused to transplant organs from online donors because this bypasses the official waitlist. In other places, however, the law is more relaxed.Look into relationship limitations. In some countries like Germany, you can only accept volunteer organ donations from people who are related to you either in the first or second degree or “in a very special way.” In Belgium, you must be in a “sustainable relationship” with the donor.
On the other hand, in the US the laws are less strict about transplants between people who aren’t biologically related. This means that a donation from a Facebook friend is theoretically OK.
If you aren’t entirely sure that searching on social media is legal, talk to a lawyer before you start your campaign.

, One of the big problems of looking for organ donors off the official waitlist is that it encourages the black market sale of organs. Know that selling organs for money is against the law in most countries, including the US, where it is prohibited by the National Organ Transplant Act. You could get into big trouble if you accept an organ in exchange for payment.The ban on organ sales is supposed to make donation more equal. That way, the rich don’t have an unfair advantage in getting access to needed transplants. People who break the US law face fines or even jail time.
Be wary of any potential donors who ask for something in return. According to one study, about 3% of Facebook donation pages got offers to sell organs like kidneys, usually from people in Third World countries and especially south Asia.

, Legal or illegal, searching for an organ donor off the official waitlist raises some thorny ethical issues. In the end, you might find that you’re OK with searching through social media and don’t have any qualms. But you should at least give the issues some careful thought.Is it fair for you to bypass the waitlist, for example? Some people wait patiently for years to get an organ transplant and, in some countries, the wait lists try to prioritize those who have the greatest need.
Consider also that searching for organs via social media privileges those who are able to present their story better or who are just more photogenic and media savvy. Are you OK with this, too?
What about tech privilege? Many people who need organ transplants have limited or no access to social media. Is it fair for them to be put at a disadvantage in finding a donor?

This will help ensure that you have the support system you will need during recovery and that you understand the mental strain a transplant surgery can put on you.Psychological testing can include a psychological evaluation, talking with social workers to figure out who your pre- and post-surgery support system will be, as well as addiction counseling as necessary.;
, As with any surgery, there is a chance for certain complications, including rejection or infection. Both can be surmountable, so put yourself into a mindset of healing and defeating any obstacle. A positive outlook will increase your chance of surviving the surgery and its aftercare., It is important that you have people in your life who you can count on during the surgery itself, but especially during the recovery. You can’t do everything yourself and you’ll need to take it easy so your body can heal itself.It would be best to have someone with you at all times during the recovery process, but if that’s not possible, you’ll need someone to come check on you and help you with things at least once a day.
You will need help for a few weeks with everyday things like grocery shopping and walking around.
If you don’t have anyone in your life that you can ask, you could look into hiring an in-home caregiver for your recovery periodor ask your pastor if any of the congregation members might be willing to help.

, Prepare your bags for the hospital ahead of time, and have them ready at a moment's notice. The call for a new liver could come at any time and you’ll need to get to the hospital as soon as possible.Bring a couple changes of clothes, things to keep you occupied while you are in bed for several days (books, magazines, movies, knitting, etc.), and any other personal items you would not want to be without for an entire week.
Most patients stay in the hospital for at least one to two weeks after a liver transplant surgery.

, Transplant coordinators will generally ask also that while you are on the list that you stay no farther than a specified distance from the transplant hospital in order to ensure that you will be able to travel there with enough time for the donor liver to stay viable.

, Do not consume any food or drink anything if you have been called about a potential match. They are required to wait a certain amount of time (around 12 hours) after you last ingested something before they can put you under for surgery.This could potentially cause you to lose precious time while the new liver is still viable.

, It may be several days before you’re able to bathe again after the surgery, so you’ll want to make sure you shower before you head to the hospital. Cleaning your body will help make your more comfortable (especially in the days following the surgery) and help the pre-op team get your ready for surgery.


To prepare your body for surgery, you’ll also need to remove all external elements. For example, remove any nail polish, take off all of your jewelry, and wear your glasses instead of contact lenses.

, Check in at the hospital or transplant center as instructed by your coordinator. If there is a match for your liver, you’ll need to get to the hospital as soon as possible to be prepped for surgery.


When you check in, you’ll meet with your doctor (or another member of the transplant team) to discuss what will happen as you move forward in the procedure. They will explain the procedure to you and help guide your expectations about what will happen.
The team will help prepare you for the surgery – clean your body, put you in a hospital gown, and take you to the operating room when you are ready.

, Your doctor will refer you to a transplant specialist who will conduct the necessary tests to determine if you are a viable candidate to be put on the list. You will need to undergo various physical tests to determine the functionality of your existing liver.Physical tests can include lab work, imaging tests, cardiovascular testing, and an overall health exam.

, To get on the list for a new liver, you need to have your current liver evaluated and tested so that you can receive your MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score.MELD scores range from 6 to 40. The higher your number, the more severe your case is.
People with higher MELD scores are typically placed higher on the waiting list for a new liver.

, The first major step toward undergoing a liver transplant is being placed on the national waiting list by a transplant center team. Organ donation is managed in the United States by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).While getting on the waiting list an important step toward getting your new liver, it does not guarantee that a match will be found.

, Financial counseling will be included in your pre-transplant preparations to help you comprehend the expenses that you will be looking at from the surgery and after care, and to determine if and how much your insurance company can help you with that.It is important to understand how much of a financial strain this will put on your and your family so that there are no surprises later when you are recovering.

, Once you are on the waiting list, there is not much you can do except wait for news. The transplant committee will convene to discuss if transplantation is the right course of treatment for you and they will keep you updated on any progress made in finding you a new liver.

, You must continue living and treating your illness while you are on the waiting list to give yourself the best chance of survival. Follow any of your doctor’s orders and try to maintain overall good health while you wait.During this time you should be very conscientious about making healthy lifestyle choices – like eating well, exercising if possible, not smoking, not drinking, etc.

, If possible, ask your friends and family members to get tested to see if they are a potential match with you. This may increase your chances for getting a new liver more quickly. Speak to your transplant team if you have a family member willing to do a living liver transplant.Remember that there are significant risks for the donor, so try to be understanding if people are wary of doing this for you.
Once a liver is viable, it must be transplanted within 12-18 hours."

Don’t go for a swim (unless you plan on relieving yourself in the water).",How to Hold in Pee when You Can't Use the Bathroom1," Your urethra is the opening to the outside through which urine exits your body. Imagine squeezing muscles surrounding the urethra while allowing your other muscles to relax. These are the same muscle you would squeeze if you were trying to stop a stream of urine. Relax the pelvis and abdomen to avoid placing additional pressure on the bladder. Tensing unnecessary muscles can waste effort and may make the problem worse.;
, You may have to do this several times while holding in urine. Different positions can relieve some of the pressure on your bladder, making it easier to hold in urine. Consider this:


Don't press on the lower part of your abdomen. It will put more pressure on your bladder.
Cross your legs when standing. When standing, crossing your legs may help you hold in urine by compressing the urethra and surrounding areas. It can help you feel like you’re closing off your urethra.
Try crossing or uncrossing your legs while sitting down. These changes in position can alleviate pressure on the bladder.
Sit upright but relaxed. Raise your upper body and allow your back to arch, taking pressure off your bladder, but do not stretch your abdomen as this may put pressure on your bladder. Relax your abdomen.
Do not lean forward, pull the front of your pelvis up, or squeeze your abdomen inward.

, The buildup of gas in your intestines can place pressure on your bladder. Alleviating this pressure by passing gas may make you feel more comfortable and may allow you to hold in urine longer.

, Make yourself as warm as you can by covering up with blankets, turning up the heater, or curling your body closer together. There is a phenomenon called cold diuresis, wherein acute exposure to the cold causes an urge to urinate., This can put pressure on your bladder and make you uncomfortable.


Stay sitting, if sitting. Too much movement can jar your bladder and make you uncomfortable. If you find yourself in a comfortable position, stay there until it becomes uncomfortable and you need to reposition yourself.
Avoid changing positions too suddenly, and tense, abrupt, or sudden movement.
Keep movements as fluid and graceful as possible when you walk or perform other activities.

, Friends may think it's hilarious to describe waterfalls, rivers, and other bodies of moving water — as well as flushing toilets — when they have been told you need to go. Speak calmly and firmly. Show no signs that their efforts are getting to you. If they continue, calmly remove yourself from the area. If this is not possible, plug your ears and loudly hum while closing your eyes. If you should not close your eyes or do not wish to plug your ears, just hum as loud as you can. Turn away from your friends to show them you will not communicate with them unless they stop.

, Drink enough to maintain normal hydration, but avoid anything unnecessary.

, Avoid any thoughts about urinating, water, or toilets.


Don't have an internal debate about urinating versus holding it in.
Do not think about using the restroom until you are actually there.
Do not think about urinating as soon as you reach the restroom. You may begin to urinate before you have time to remove your pants and underwear.

, Find a restroom, squat in a field, or similar.

, It won't. Letting a little bit of urine out is virtually impossible — more often than not your bladder won't stop after just that little bit, and you'll succeed in peeing your pants.

, Laughing might cause you to contract muscles that put more pressure on your bladder.


Avoid friends and situations that may cause you to laugh.

, If you are a swimmer, you may have experienced the urge to urinate after entering a cool body of water. This is called immersion diuresis, or cold immersion diuresis. "

Once you have been notified, you should bathe or shower so your body is clean for surgery. You should also brush your teeth, being sure you do not swallow any water.You should also remove all makeup, nail polish, and jewelry. Take out your contact lenses and wear your glasses instead — your contacts must be removed during surgery.;
, You should pack a bag with loose, comfortable clothes to wear home when you are discharged from the hospital, as you do not want to irritate the incision post surgery. Look for clothing that are stretchy and soft, as well as comfortable underwear, socks and shoes. Make sure the footwear you pack is easy to slip on and off without having to bend over.You may also want to pack a small, firm pillow in your bag. You can then use this pillow as support for your abdomen, as it will feel tender and sore post-surgery.

, You should also have a folder or pouch that contains all your identification cards, such as your driver’s license and your medical insurance card. This way, you will be able to provide the hospital with current and correct information.If your doctor gave you any paperwork that relates to your surgery, you should bring this with you as well.

, You should fast at least eight hours before the surgery or as soon as you get the call that there is a kidney donor available. This will ensure you are prepared for surgery, as your stomach will need to be empty when the procedure is done., You may want to set up a chair with arms that are stable enough for you to push up on them when you need to get up and sit down. This will make sitting much easier post-surgery.You may also want to set up a heating pad near the chair, as it can help to soothe any soreness or pain around the incision.

, You should designate a responsible adult to accompany you to the hospital and wait for you during the procedure. You will also need a person to drive you home once you have been discharged from the transplant center.Try to only have one person accompany you to the hospital, as you do not want too many people in the transplant center with you due to the high risk of infection when you are immunosuppressed. If you are a minor, both of your parents can accompany you to the hospital.
You can also set up a phone tree or an email group that will allow you to update your family and friends easily. You may assign someone as the lead person who will then pass information to others. This will allow you to focus on your recovery and still circulate information about your surgery easily., Once you get to the transplant center where your kidney transplant is going to be done, you should meet with the medical team assigned to your surgery. You may contact the medical team on the way to the hospital so they are ready for you when you arrive.You should also be in contact with the surgeon who will be doing your kidney transplant. This will ensure you have all the necessary information about the surgery beforehand.

, You will get a thorough medical evaluation at the transplant center to confirm you are healthy enough for surgery. The medical team will ensure you do not have an infection or a medical issue that could cause issues with the surgery or your recovery.The medical team will also make sure the donated kidney is in good shape and will function properly in your body once it is transplanted.

, The medical team will also prepare your body for surgery by removing any hair on your chest and your abdomen. You may also be given a laxative or an enema to clean out your intestines and prevent you from getting constipated after surgery.An IV will also be inserted into your vein to give you medicine and prevent you from getting dehydrated. You may also be given a sedative to help you relax before the surgery.

, The medical team and/or the surgeon should outline exactly how the procedure will be done before you are operated on. You will be put “under” with general anesthesia and be asleep for the surgery.Then, the surgeon will make an incision on your lower abdomen, just above your groin. The donor kidney will be placed in your lower abdomen and the kidney’s blood vessels will be connected to your iliac artery and vein. The surgeon will also connect your ureter to your bladder.
The surgeon may also place a small drain into your abdomen to remove any excess fluid that may build up after the surgery.

, After the surgery, you will be moved to the intensive care unit and stay there for 24 to 48 hours. Then, you will be placed in transplant care for the rest of your hospital stay. You will spend at least five to 10 days in the hospital to ensure there were no complications with the surgery and that you are recovering properly.Depending on your medical condition and needs, you may be able to get out of bed and walk small distances after the surgery. There will be a medical team on hand to administer your medications and ensure you are recovering well.

, Once you leave the hospital, you will be monitored and checked by the transplant team on a weekly basis. You should also be given instructions on how to recover properly at home and what medications you will need to take. You should also schedule your first follow up appointment and any lab appointments.During the first year after your transplant, you will be required to go in for check ups with the transplant team on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Once your condition stabilizes, you will be returned to the care of your primary care doctor.
You should also plan to visit the transplant team once a year, on or close to the anniversary of your transplant. This will allow the team to assess your progress and discuss any health issues or concerns you may have due to the transplant.

, You should continue your care at home by giving yourself six to eight weeks to rest. Do not lift heavy objects or do strenuous physical activity. Reducing all physical activity will ensure that you recover properly from the transplant.Try to do some light exercises, like walking and stretching two to four weeks after the surgery. You may also be able to resume more intense exercise like hiking, bicycling, tennis, golf and swimming six weeks after the surgery. Avoid rough contact sports, as this could put you at risk of injuring your transplanted kidney.
You should also avoid driving at least six weeks after the surgery. You may need to plan ahead so a friend or family member can help you get around while you recover.

Understand bladder training techniques.,
Perform Kegel exercises.,
Go longer between restroom visits.,
Don’t give in to every slight urge to urinate.",How to Hold in Pee when You Can't Use the Bathroom2," If you are frequently in situations where you are unable to find a place or the time to relieve yourself, then you may want to consider training your bladder ahead of time. This can help you to wait longer between trips to the restroom.

, These exercises can be practice by both men and women to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. It can sometimes be confusing about which muscles to contract for Kegel exercises — to practice, start urinating, then make yourself stop the stream of urine by contracting your muscles. These are the muscles of your pelvic floor.Once you know what it feels like to contract the pelvic floor muscles, you can do Kegel exercises at other times throughout your day.


Try doing Kegel exercises during commercials while watching your favorite show, sitting at your desk, lying down, while filling up your car with gasoline — you can practice at almost any time, really.
Try to do these exercise three times a day for three to four days a week.

, Set a schedule for yourself and keep track of your restroom visits. If you find yourself urinating every two hours, try to go two and a half hours hours between restroom visits the next week.

, According to experts, resisting every small urge to urinate can actually stretch the bladder slightly.Wait five to 15 minutes to see if the urge passes before making a trip to the restroom.

Consider waiting out your UTI.,
Eat foods rich in antioxidants.,
Stay hydrated.Drinking lots of water encourages you to urinate often.,
Support the natural balance in your gut.You shouldn't think that your body should be completely free of bacteria.,
Increase the amount of fish in your diet.,
Avoid caffeine and sugar.Caffeine acts as a stimulant, and the type of processed sugar found in processed or sweet food feeds bacteria.,
Drink cranberry juice or extract.,
Combine cranberry with lingonberry in your diet.,
Take bearberry powder.Uva Ursi (Bearberry) might not be available in your grocery store, but you can find it easily and cheaply online.,
Take brewer's yeast.,
Take one teaspoon of D-mannose twice per day.,
Drink teas and extracts that are proven to treat UTIs.,
Drink lots of water.,
Urinate as soon as you feel the urge.,
Take special care after sexual activity.,
Wear loose clothing on the lower half of your body.,
Maintain a high-fiber diet.No conclusive research exists yet on the connection between high-fiber diets and UTIs.,
Do not douche or use feminine hygiene sprays.",How to Heal a Urinary Tract Infection Naturally," The symptoms can range from irritating to incredibly painful, but UTIs will often heal on their own even if left untreated. One study showed that 71% of women who didn't treat their UTIs reported improvement within just one week.Don't ignore frequent UTI, though, as they could result in a far more dangerous kidney infection if left untreated.;
, Antioxidants protect the body's cells from various types of damage. They're used to treat a wide variety of medical issues, from cancer and Alzheimer's disease to UTIs.Vegetables and fruits are naturally rich in antioxidants, but seek out specific foods, such as blueberries, raspberries, currants, blackberries, squash and bell peppers.

, Though it's uncomfortable, urinating often will help the infection heal more quickly.

, In fact, for every cell in your body, there are ten microbial organisms in your body! Your gut produces healthy, natural bacteria that help your body to perform some tasks — from digesting food and supporting your immune system to helping your brain function properly.When you don't have a healthy ""gut flora,"" as experts call it, your body is vulnerable to a variety of health issues ranging from cancer and diabetes to UTIs.


Fermented foods can help maintain a healthy balance in your body. Eat foods such as yogurt, pickles, tempeh, miso, sauerkraut, kefir and kombucha teas.
You can also take probiotic (healthy bacteria) supplements to promote gut health. They've been shown to help prevent recurrent UTIs and are likely useful in preventing UTIs in general.Many yogurt brands now include probiotics, but you can also take probiotics in pill form. Probiotics are measured in units of either ""organisms"" or ""colony forming units"" (CFU). Shoot for 5 billion organisms/CFU per day.

, Omega-3 fats are necessary for a healthy immune system that can fight off infection.The best source of omega-3 fats you can find is fish, although you can also buy supplements in pill form at the grocery store.

, Both of these things will encourage your infection to worsen, so avoid them at all costs. Cut coffee, black teas and sodas out of your diet.

, Cranberries are a well-known treatment for UTIs that make it harder for bacteria to thrive. Cranberries both make urine more acidic and introduce a chemical from a class called proanthocyanidins, that makes it harder for bacteria to stick to the bladder and urethra's cells.Although many people use cranberries it to treat UTI, studies suggest that cranberries are better at prevention than treatment.Drink 300-600 mL of cranberry juice daily. The study in question studied Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice cocktail, specifically.Take cranberry capsules (400 mg twice per day)., Lingonberry is a berry in the same family as cranberry. One study suggests that drinking cranberry-lingonberry concentrate reduces the risk of UTIs in women and girls.The subjects in this study drank 7.5 g of cranberry, and 1.7 g of lingonberry concentrates mixed in 50 mL of water daily.

, Though uncommon in general American usage, Native American and European medicine have used it for centuries. Take 250-500 mg of powdered bearberry three times per day.


This might give your urine a greenish-brown tint, but this is not harmful.
Bearberry acts as a diuretic (rids the body of salt and water), so ask your doctor about using it if you're on other medications., In theory, brewer’s yeast “crowds out” the bacteria that causes UTIs, but as of now, there are no reliable clinical trials proving it can treat UTI. Furthermore, brewer's yeast can interact badly with certain types of medications, so talk to your doctor before considering brewer's yeast. Despite the lack of scientific studies, many people take 3g of brewer’s yeast twice per day to treat UTI.


Consult a doctor before taking brewer’s yeast if you're on other medications. It should NOT be taken with a class of medications called MAOIs.MAOIs include the drugs: Selegiline, Phenelzine, Tranylcypromine, Rasagiline, Isocarboxazid, Phenelzine Sulfate, Selegiline hydrochloride, Tranylcypromine sulfate and Rasagiline mesylate

, Take each dose with cranberry juice or water. D-mannose is a type of sugar that, unlike the sugar in sweet foods, actually treats UTIs. Experts think it interferes with how bacteria “stick to” and infect cells.Although nobody's yet studied it in the treatment of UTIs, D-mannose has proven effective at preventing recurrent UTIs.Be aware that D-mannose can cause loose stools and bloating.

, A wide variety of teas and extracts can be used for UTI treatment. The best thing about this method is that you can change up the products — if you get tired of one taste, you can switch to another product. All that matters is that you increase how much of these products you drink on a daily basis. If you buy any of these products in dry form, mix one teaspoon with a cup of hot water to make a tea.


Pipsissewa: take eight to 10 drops in a six-ounce glass of water two to three times per day.
Corn silk: take 400 mg twice per day.
Buchu: take 500 mg twice per day.
Equisetum or Horsetail:Do not take this if you have diabetes. Horsetail can reduce Vitamin B and thiamine levels, so make sure you're taking B-complex vitamins if you use it., Keeping hydrated is the easiest way to prevent a UTI, and it's also important for your overall health.Drink at least six to eight eight-ounce glasses of water every day to help “flush out” your system and prevent UTIs.

, The longer urine is in your bladder; the more bacteria can grow. Women should always wipe toilet paper from front to back, especially after a bowel movement. This prevents bacterial contamination from feces.

, Women, especially, should always urinate after sex to stop bacteria from moving into the urethra.Birth control methods that use spermicide increase the risk of UTIs. However, using non-oral contraceptives without spermicide increases the risk of unwanted pregnancy. A good compromise is to switch to oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices or contraceptive rings, if possible.

, The goal is to keep your genital area as dry as possible. Loose, preferably cotton, pants and underwear let air pass better than nylon underwear or tight jeans.

, However, high-fiber diets will decrease the chances of constipation, which is a common cause of UTIs. Many people prevent UTIs by eating diets full of beans, lentils, whole grains and root vegetables.

, The vagina's natural secretions should “wash away” any abnormal odors you might worry about. More importantly, these sprays, washes, wipes and deodorants often use harmful chemicals in their pleasant fragrances.They often cause skin reactions and hormone problems.Douching washes away normal, healthy vaginal bacteria and actually increases the risk of UTIs. Douching also affects the acid-alkaline balance of the vagina, causing dryness and irritation.Douching is also linked to increased risk of vaginal infections, sexually transmitted infections and infertility."

Build models of mathematics and biology that can model and mimic the natural formation of organs in the utero of the pregnant woman.",How to Learn and Understand the Current Limitations on Medical Procedures of Organs Transplantation in Surgery," Organ transplantation is one practice of the surgical medical sciences that is of recent age only. Organ transplantation is used in the case of complete failure of the function of certain organ in the body of humans. An example is the surgical procedure of liver transplantation. This surgical procedure is often used with patients who had complete liver failure for a long time and reached an end stage liver failure that requires the immediate medical intervention of a new functional liver transplantation instead of the diseased nonfunctional organ. This procedure is currently used with all other organs transplants in the body of humans. This surgical procedure usually depends on the availability of a suitable alternative organ to be implanted in the body if the patient.;
, The immediate source of such an organ would be an organ donor that is usually one member of the family that this specific patient belongs to. This is so due to the matching of genetic materials between these two persons. Organ transplantation poses few problems and obstacles that make this surgical procedure in humans a handicapped primitive procedure in the current practice of the medical sciences. One of the problems that faces such a procedure includes the obstacle of rejection of the Implanted organ by the patients immune system. This is usually the case with all organ transplants that occur in the world. This problem is currently faced by the medical procedure of immune cells suppression using suppressing agents such as the hormone cortisol. This procedure is however very unpredictable in its outcome and relies heavily on luck more than on medical information and professional knowledge of the subject. Also if this process of organ rejection by the immune system of the patient is overcome then other problems can arise later.

, The fact that the implanted organ has foreign tissue to the body of the patient is an obstacle for the normal metabolic function of this implanted organ in the body of the patient. This implanted organ has in most cases cells that are foreign in their nature to the host body. For this reason this poses another problem that will likely make this organ transplantation not live for a long period of time. The usual search for a donor of an organ for transplantation in the body of a diseased patient is in my opinion not the right choice to do. This is so due to the two main obstacles that were mentioned previously. A more logical and possibly more successful choice would be to use organs that are natural to the patient biological tissues.

, This choice of natural biological tissue of the patient can survive the two obstacles that were mentioned previously of organ rejection and of the problem of odd metabolism due to the presence of foreign cells in the transplanted organ in the host body. This procedure is however limited by the unavailability of this type of organ to implanted in the body of the diseased patient.

, Currently stem cells research tries to solve problems in this direction. Stem cells research is however limited to the production of certain types of new cells that are capable of regeneration and proliferation in the body. This type of new cell research can have certain advantages but also has many limitations. A more promising subject of medical science in this direction would be related to the basic medical science that is called embryology. This basic medical science of medicine deals with natural development of the fetus in the uterus of the pregnant woman. This development of the fetus into a baby can form one subject of research in the direction of finding suitable organs for transplantation in the body of diseased patients. The development of the particular organs in the fetus can be modeled and used to generate organs that have superiority over organs by foreign organ donors.

, By knowing the mechanism that underlies the development of that particular organ in the embryo one can use this to mimic it for the production of highly promising organs for transplantation in the body of needy patients. This subject still needs to developed further using advanced biological as well as mathematical models such as the mathematics of geometric shapes that is called topological sciences of mathematics. I think that the fetus in every pregnant woman has common features to all pregnant women. This is true for the general same shape of all newborn people. They differ however in their biochemical content of cells and enzymes. By knowing the mechanism of development for each organ in the body in the embryo one can use this mechanism to synthesize new and freshly made organs from the native tissues of the diseased patient to be transplanted in his body.

, I think that the embryo in all living organisms has predestined and preprogrammed outcome that is identical for all humans. This can only suggest that there is common mechanism that underlies the development of these fetuses for all common organisms such as in humans. The topological features of each animal shape differs from each other. Each living entity has its own topological structure that is unique for him. This shape or structure of every living system should be modeled and understood mathematically in order to be able to mimic its formation on the biological and cellular levels. This can be done by doing specific research on these topics instead of wasting resources of money and time on useless subjects of current medical issues.

Perhaps it might even be that your friend is carrying a diaper bag wherever they go even though they have no infants following them.

, Your first thought might be an urge to cure your friend, searching the internet to do so. Instead of doing so, have a second thought about your motivation.


Is it because you think diapers gross you out or because you want to help? Your friend is most likely wearing diapers for a reason. It is best to assume that doctors and experts have already tried their best. If your friend has worn diapers for years, your friend is most likely accustomed to wearing diapers and accepted themselves as someone who needs to wear diapers as part of their daily ritual again.
Sharing the secret with you is a big step and is not the occasion for you to suggest a cure you found on the Internet. Your friend most likely has tried it already and consulted experts unable to help.
Diets and other easy cures are most likely not working and cause more stress than relief. If your friend is comfortable with their life you are there to support as a friend, leaving her/his doctor to be in charge of any possible cure.

, The answer to these questions could surprise you in how much you honestly care for your friend.


Would you mind talking about your own underwear with this person? If not, you might be better off just going along waiting for your friend to start this conversation.
Constantly talking about urine, diapers or putting on songs relating to wet pants, incontinence, water or having your friends ring tone be one of those songs is not a good subtle way to get her/him to start the conversation.
Please respect if (s)he does not want to initiate the talk.;
,


What is the goal of the conversation? Is it to have the person cut back on their diaper usage or completely rid themselves of their diapers? Or is it some other goal covered that deals with their diaper use?
Do you want to be supportive, and if so how much? Think honestly how much support you can give, as diaper wearers and handling them will take a lot of psychological and physical help from friends, and can be anywhere from helping them change their diaper to covering up their lie that they might not want exposed to others to shield the wearer from obvious psychological damage if they spread it to others who spread it even further.
Turn off your phone to show you care about a private conversation.

, Let there be room for your friend to tell a sad story, cry and confide in you without disturbances or other appointments coming up. Your friend might have had this conversation before and be confident about wearing diapers, but it might also be the first time they have this conversation outside of close family.


Read the rest of this guide. Consider the intimacy of the help you want to provide, where your limits are as well as bring up situations where you have doubts on how to handle it.
Express your friendship to and with them. Let your friend know that you like her/him because of certain reasons including their personality and that wearing diapers does not change your viewpoints of your friendship with them in any way.
Ask what word they would prefer you’d use. Some prefer calling these absorbent pants diapers, while others don’t like the connotations these words give and prefer pads, briefs or absorbent underwear…sometimes however, the wearer might not even like any of those terms to be used and would like another piece of clothing name to refer to it as. Find a word that suits you and your friend's level of discretion.
Try on one of their diapers, to see how your friend feels when wearing them if you can stomach the idea that you are wearing one and can be assumed to be able to take it off confidently without a fuss. If you are a inquisitive person, you might ask your friend if you can borrow a diaper to try it on yourself, which can open the conversation to let your friend show their expertise and advice on their ability to wear a diaper and make them feel accepted and on equal footing with the remainder of the people in the world. Use the guide in How to Wear a Diaper to find out how you can wear a diaper like them.

, Ensure their diaper use isn't done due to other medical issues such as prostate problems or stress incontinence. Have their family talk to them and have their family bring them to a doctor who can treat and evaluate why they might even need their diapers to ensure theirs no other drastic reason that is curable but if left untreated can become quite a problem down the line in time.

, Many wearers may feel ashamed that their diapers will get exposed in public and that if not taken seriously, the problem may get out of hand. Make sure they can count on you to help them handle life's emergencies while wearing it in public, from shielding other's view of them to other issues about their use.

,, Like underwear, diapers have a tendency to show in the lower back after bending down to pick something up or when the person is just stretching. This is enhanced by diapers having a higher waist and a plastic like back panel that can make it easy for shirts to slide up and uncover their diaper. Your friend most likely will not be aware of the diaper showing, and just like a Laundry Instruction Tag showing it is considered polite to tell your friend, so the wardrobe malfunctioncan be adjusted.


Use a code word to represent when this occurs to your friend. Your friend might appreciate if you don't say ""Your diaper is showing"" out loud, but you may agree on another more inconspicuous word that is less detrimental to their health like Socks, pants or some other term you could devise with them.
Diapers can be tucked in. The top rim of the diapers are made of plastic that will help to seal in the urine while they are lying down. Once tucked under and into the diaper itself, it can become less conspicuous, but that may create skin contact with the plastic which can result in itching and skin irritation to the wearer. To decrease the height of the diaper-rim, it is better to bend this top part outwards letting the wearer’s other clothing keep the diaper in a better place on their body.

, Offer to carry your friend's diaper bag. Although your friend may say on occasion that they can do it, just being ready and caring, can definitely mean a lot for your continued friendship to evolve. It can be annoying always having to carry a bag with spare diapers, and the supplies that go along with their diaper use and changing including carrying wet wipes and ointment. Offering to carry their bag eases not only the physical but also the psychological burden of carrying diapers. Your friend might say no, but it at least is a nice gesture showing acceptance and willingness to help out.

, Although certain types of diapers have different absorbency rates and times that they tend to be most often worn towards between changes, there is a difference between wet and dirty or just being wet or just being dirty, and they all need to be changed. Some adult diapers are made to be worn comfortably for several hours, including about a typical lifestyle of one to three hours for the thinly-padded ones to ten to fourteen hours for the thickest padded ones. A change is advised:


When the diaper is so wet it might leak
After soiling accidents
When the diaper smells. Nobody nearby likes the emanating smell.(Waterproof plastic pants can limit smell.)
Before starting a long trip with no access to restrooms
Before going for a bicycle ride.Your friend might not notice when they wet themselves. Having a friend to keep notice of their diapers’ problems is of great comfort during the ride. You might also get to pick up on small subtle changes that your friend might not be aware of or has gotten used to as time has worn on while they wear their diapers. It is not uncommon to get a bit grumpy when the diaper is soaked as the wetness is subconsciously felt and irritates, but your friend might not feel that the diaper is wet as they are concentrating with the road ahead when cycling.

, However, back off from constant interrogation with them if they so desire. It can feel rather intimidating, disempowering and embarrassing to be confronted with your friend having wet the diaper and needing a change. You need to have an agreement with your friend to know that it is okay with you to comment on their need to have their diaper changed by you and that you won’t mention anything to anybody else (‘’’what goes on in the room, stays in the room’’’)


Having a code word might ease the situation. ""I can smell your socks"" is less likely to attract attention than mentioning wet diapers or asking your friend if their diaper needs to be changed. Alternatively, you can agree on a non-verbal hint like a poke or tap on their body to tell your friend that you can smell their diaper without drawing attention from anyone else.

, Sometimes, diaper wearers feel like they can’t make it to the restroom in time so they wear their diaper. If you can show them that they ‘’can’’ make it in time, you can get your friend to use the toilet and might even be able to save the diaper from even being used altogether.

,


If your friend invites you to shopping clothes together they will most likely want your input if her/his diaper is showing or if the clothing actively hides the diaper and how visible it is. You can use code words for this in order to keep it privately in the shop. However, before shopping, be careful to check for their diaper being wet to ensure other clothes that you hadn’t bought yet don’t become wet and you’ll be forced to purchase those pieces.

, If you are comfortable talking about and buying menstrual pads or tampons with your friend, it should also be possible to talk about buying plastic pants together. Otherwise, let it be up to your friend to start that conversation. Plastic or rubber pants will decrease the smell, sound, risk of leaking and keep the diaper tight to the body making it less visible. It is, on the other hand, a rather intimate thing for them to buy, more so than buying regular underwear. It is a piece of clothing only you and your friend's closest peers will see, but it is also a garment that romantic partners or people looking up a skirt will see and hence is a crucial fashion accessory. If plastic pants are worn, it is also most likely that the leg gathers of these pants will show at the lower back when picking something up or stretching.

,


Are all places where semi-public nudity is expected and accepted, leading to your friend having to be extra considerate of having their diaper showing. Talk with your friend about this before planning or paying these activities. Suggest the activity to your friend and listen to the reply.
One possibility might be for your friend to visit the toilet quite often before, during and after the activity and wearing no or a very thin diaper. This puts increased stress on your friend as (s)he has to be aware of the placement of the nearest toilet, possibly wait in line and suddenly rush away to avoid accidents. While biking usually does not include semi-public nudity it does involve putting a lot of pressure on the diaper as well as bending the diaper out of the cup shape that is naturally forming while walking. Additionally bikes makes it harder to wear skirts an otherwise good female garment for making diapers less noticeable.
In case your friend suffers from fecal incontinence (s)he will have to wear a special swim diaper if you go to a swimming pool and as these garments are quite noticeable your friend will have to accept to show publicly that (s)he is wearing a diaper. Swim diapers should also be used on the beach.

, Although other references in pop and rock music both mention, incontinence has become more common and is no longer taboo to wear diapers, but it does not necessarily mean that your friend is ready to have it as public knowledge. A talk among a group of friends can naturally turn this topic into something more irrational and cause great psychological pain for the wearer to get through, and want them to wear diapers even more or even longer than originally planned. Depending on your friend, they might get embarrassed about the topic and it is an option for you as their friend to steer the conversation towards another topic.

, Slipping into something more comfortable is common when the wearer gets home or is in a place that they are confident that the friend won’t mention to others as the wearer is a frequent guest of. With you finding out that they wear diapers, this might also lead to the request of wearing thicker more comfortable diapers while you are the only one around, because it gives better protection from leaks while resting or sitting down in one solitary spot or limiting movement.


Another issue is heat and skin contact with plastic. While plastic pants might be preferable in public they are hot and tight elastic bands can irritate the skin. Spending extended time with your friend at home (s)he most likely would prefer not to wear plastic pants leading to an increased risk of smell, noise and leaks, where the increased risk of leaking is mitigated by wearing a thicker diaper.


, During the summer, heat is a challenge as diapers act as extra insulation on the body. Where you can wear a thin pair of shorts or a skirt, your friend still needs their diaper. During parts of the summer where you want to wear as little clothing as possible to cool down, your friend might request to wear nothing but a diaper. If your friend requests for that let him/her do it - and see it as a good sign that (s)he is not embarrassed about wearing diapers (A lot of kids are only in diapers on hot summer days!). As long as both of you don’t mind that an occasional accident might happen, your friend can avoid wearing the diaper altogether. Make sure your friend only sits on chairs with plastic covered seats, and be prepared to remove any stains that occur from their nonuse of the diaper. Utilize How to Remove Urine Odors and Stains Permanently to find out these steps.

, While disposable diapers are most convenient (thinner, easier to change, no dirty laundry to bring home) they are a possibility in the privacy of the home. Cloth diapers absorb the urine in another way allowing the skin to breathe differently, but may also make the wearer feel more wet and can absorb more, particularly while sitting and lying on the side leading them to be less likely to leak, offering a greater sense of security. (Cloth diapers do tend to be more cumbersome to handle and as the plastic pants are in direct contact with the urine, they need to either be reused after being dried off with paper towels or hand washed after they are replaced by a new pair.

, Diapers, ointments, wet wipes, plastic pants take up a lot of space especially for extended stays as a typical day might require anywhere from three to five diaper changes. If your friend comes to visit a lot, it might be convenient if they can have a stash of diapers at your place so they don’t have to carry a large diaper bag each and every time they visit you. Running out of diapers is a psychological burden leading your friend to most likely bring more diapers than needed in the diaper bag. By having a stash somewhere in your house where only both of you have access to, both of you know that they can stay longer and that you can have unplanned events without your friend suddenly needing to leave because a diaper change is required and having to travel home in a soaked diaper may risk a leak because no clean diapers were available when they were needed most.

,


If multiple people are attending, talk with your friend about their her/his preferences of wearing diapers all the time or just during the night of the sleepover and if they want the invitees to the party to know about their problem. Prepare a list of attendants and let your friend know who has RSVPed and to make sure they know who is coming. is coming.

,


Diapers are put on differently when lying down than standing up. Going to sleep and turning around while sleeping, requires a tighter fit around the legs. When the wearer walks with one on, the diaper forms a natural cup to keep in place the urine to the body while giving the legs the much needed room to move freely. Lying down while changing into a night diaper during the sleepover lets your friend put the diaper on much tighter as their thigh muscles are not flexed. This brings up the situation where your friend might want to borrow your bed and have the room for themselves while changing into their night diaper. You might want to bring up this issue with them in advance of the sleepover to have a talk about it in private, and letting your friend know if they can or can not use your bed for your diaper-change during the times of their sleepover.

, While your bladder is full, you may head to the toilet, but your friend may feel differently when they wear their diaper and they feel the need to “go”. (Due to peer pressure, they may choose not to go and take it out on the diaper more quickly.)Some embarrassing moments may be created when their diaper shows the leak on both their bed and any surround area as well as the stench of their urine in their diaper and the need for them to get out of their bed wearing their diaper and showing off the potential of the diaper-use.

, Comfort your friend and have a talk about using larger diapers, plastic or rubber pants. Another possibility is to get disposable mats or plastic/rubber bedsheets to protect the bed next time. Removing the stain can be done by consulting How to Remove Urine Odors and Stains.

, A lot of liquid is consumed during breakfast and the gravitational pull of standing up also creates an increased need to urinate. This results in more urine during the first hour after having slept. It is therefore an option to keep the night diaper on during breakfast and change afterwards, to have a nice clean diaper for the rest of the day. The alternative is to change right after having woken up and taken a shower, but then the diaper is more likely to get as wet but not soaked during breakfast, starting the day and leaving the house with a diaper that is already wet. A lot of persons suffering from fecal incontinence will also experience a soiling accident within the first hour after getting up and letting them stay in their night diapers until the ""big"" accident occurs might be a good idea

, Personal hygiene is important especially if your friend has slept for several hours and eaten breakfast wearing a wet diaper. Leading to your friend spending extra time in the shower. It feels great getting clean in the morning and starting the day with a dry diaper, not just a physical cleaning, but a spiritual one feeling fresh and smelling good for the day to come. This extra time needs to be taken into consideration when planning for the following morning and is not the time to talk about saving on the energy bill and the environment.

Drink plenty of water and other fluids.,
Drink lemonade, limeade, or cranberry juice.,
Take pain medication, if necessary.,
Know when to see a doctor.,
Take medication or schedule a removal procedure if the stone does not pass.,
Stay away from sugar, soda, and corn syrup.,
Exercise.,
Restrict animal protein to 6 ounces or less daily.,
Eat enough calcium but avoid supplements.,
Eat a “low-oxalate” diet.,
Avoid crash dieting.,
Be especially vigilant if you have a history of kidney stones.",How to Get Rid of Kidney Stones," Fluid intake will make you urinate, and urination will eventually help you pass the kidney stone. Pure water is the best. Only one or two out of 10 kidney stones will require more than drinking lots of water and waiting, so make sure that if you do anything, you do this.


The Institute of Medicine recommends that women drink about nine cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day. Men should drink about 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids per day. Aim to drink enough water so that your urine is light yellow or clear. This is a sign that you are drinking enough liquids.;
, You should look for varieties that are low in sugar, or make your own. Lemons, limes, and cranberries are very high in citric acid, which helps prevent crystals from increasing in size and becoming new kidney stones.Avoid dark beers. These contain oxalates, which can contribute to future kidney stones., Take NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. NSAIDs come in various forms: ibuprofen (Motrin in particular may be effective), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin are all commonly-used NSAIDs.If you are under the age of 18, do not take aspirin, as it has been linked to a dangerous disease called Reye's Syndrome, which causes acute brain damage.If you are dealing with a large, painful kidney stone, you may need to get a prescription-strength pain medication. Your doctor will be able to better diagnose the situation if this occurs.

, Most kidney stones will pass with a little bit of patience and a lot of fluid. About 15% of kidney stones will require intervention from the help of a doctor. See a doctor if you:Have frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urinary tract infections can get worse when a kidney stone is introduced.Have had a kidney transplant, have a compromised immune system, or currently possess only one kidney.
Are pregnant. Treatment of stones during pregnancy usually depends on the trimester of pregnancy.
You believe your kidney stone has been obstructing your urinary tract. Signs of obstruction include reduced urine flow, urinating at night, and side pain., If the kidney stone does not pass on its own, you may need medication or one of several procedures to remove the stone.


Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is ideal for kidney stones under 2 cm. This is not a good choice for pregnant women, as it requires an x-ray to locate the stone, and it may not work on very large stones.For stones located in the ureter, your doctor may perform a ureteroscopy. This entails the insertion of a tiny camera into your ureter so the doctor can see the stone and then remove it by inserting a wire basket through your bladder and into your ureter, pulling the stone free.If you have a large (larger than 2 cm) or irregularly-shaped kidney stone, your doctor may perform a percutaneous nephrolithotomy or a percutaneous nephrolithotripsy.While you are under general anesthesia, the surgeon will make a small incision in your back and remove (nephrolithotomy) or break up (nephrolithotripsy) the kidney stone.If your kidney stones are the result of hypercalciuria, meaning your kidneys produce a high level of calcium, your doctor may prescribe a diuretic, orthophosphates, bisphosphonates, or, more rarely, calcium-binding agents.If you are also suffering from gout, you may be prescribed allopurinol.

, Sugar disrupts the body's ability to absorb calcium and magnesium, making it a culprit in the formation of kidney stones. Fructose, found in table sugar and high fructose corn syrup, is connected to increased risk of kidney stones.If you want to give your body a healthier lifestyle, and avoid kidney stones while you're at it, try cutting down on the sugar you consume.


Some citrus-flavored sodas, such as 7UP and Sprite, contain high levels of citric acid. While you should avoid high-sugar beverages, the occasional clear soda may be a good way to increase your citric acid intake., Exercise for 30 minutes every day. Moderate exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of kidney stones by up to 31%.Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity such as walking, jogging, or gardening., Animal protein, especially red meats, increases your risk of developing kidney stones, especially uric acid stones.Keep animal protein intake to 6 ounces or less — about the size of your palm or a pack of cards — per day to help reduce your risk of developing all types of kidney stones.Red meats, organ meats, and shellfish are high in a substance called purine. Purine increases your body’s production of uric acid and can cause kidney stones.Eggs and fish also contain purines, although less than red meats and shellfish.Get protein from other sources, such as calcium-rich dairy or legumes. Legumes contain fiber and phytate, a compound that may help prevent kidney stones from forming. Be careful of soybeans, though, as they contain high levels of oxalate., The fact that many kidney stones are made of calcium may make reducing your calcium intake sound like a good idea. However, research shows that diets that are too low in calcium actually increase your risk of kidney stones. Eat a good variety of dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, to meet your daily calcium needs.Children four to eight years old need 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Children 9-18 should get 1,300 mg of calcium daily. Adults 19 and older require at least 1,000 mg of calcium daily. Women over 50 and men over 70 should take 1,200 mg of calcium a day.Unless your doctor recommends them, avoid calcium supplements. While the calcium you get from your diet has no effect on kidney stones, consuming too much calcium from supplements may increase your risk of developing kidney stones.

, The most common type of kidney stone is composed of calcium oxalate. Avoiding foods that are high in oxalate can help prevent future kidney stones. Limit your oxalate intake to 40 – 50mg dailyEat foods that contain oxalates at the same time as foods that contain calcium. The oxalate and calcium are more likely bind to each other before they reach the kidneys, reducing your risk of developing kidney stones from these foods.Foods that are high in oxalate (10mg+ per serving) include nuts, most berries, wheat, figs, grapes, tangerines, beans, beets, carrots, celery, eggplant, kale, leeks, olives, okra, peppers, potatoes, spinach, sweet potato, and zucchini.
Beverages that contain high levels of oxalate (more than 10mg per serving) include dark beer, black tea, chocolate-based beverages, soy beverages, and instant coffee.
Your body may turn high doses of vitamin C — such as those from supplements — into oxalate. Unless recommended by your doctor, don’t take vitamin C supplements., Crash dieting increases the amount of uric acid in your bloodstream, elevating your risk of kidney stones. High-protein diets, such as the Atkins diet, are particularly hard on your kidneys and should be avoided.That said, a healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and limited lean proteins can be a great way to keep you healthy and prevent kidney stones.

, According to studies, about half of all patients to come down with a kidney stone will have another within 7 years of the first.Be sure to take preventative measures if you've already had a kidney stone; it means you're even more at-risk.

Ask family members first.,
Look for individuals between the ages of 18 and 70.,
Make sure the donor has a healthy medical history.,
Know which blood type is compatible to yours.",How to Find a Kidney Donor1," You have a higher chance of finding a compatible kidney donor through a family member, especially an immediate family member. You may consider asking your family members first about getting tested to be a kidney donor before you talk to friends or other acquaintances., The kidney donor must be over the age of 18. Though having a donor between the ages of 18 and 70 is ideal, people over 70 years old can donate an organ as long as they have a healthy medical history and are medically sound to withstand the operation., A good donor will also have a medical history free of kidney disease and will not have any major health issues that could lead to kidney problems. Preferably, you want a kidney donor who does not smoke tobacco or drink in excess.You should also try to find a donor who does not have diabetes and has a body weight within their normal range. If the donor is considered medically obese, they may need to try to lose weight in order to be a good donor.

, There are four different blood types, type O, type A, type B, and type AB. Type O is the most common blood type, followed by type A, type B, and then the rarest blood type, type AB. The donor's blood type must be compatible with your blood type for the transplant to go well. You should know your blood type and determine which blood types are compatible with yours so you can check to see if a donor will be a match.Type O blood types can donate to type O, A, B, and AB.
Type A blood types can donate to type A and AB.
Type B blood types can donate to type B and AB.
Type AB can donate to type AB.

Keep track.,
Calculate the pattern.,
Choose a set length of time (interval).,
Hold back.,
Strengthen muscles.,
Increase your time.,
Do another diary for a couple days.",How to Do Bladder Training for Sudden Urges to Pee," Keep a sort of diary, or a log, for just a day or two, record the times of day and catch the fluid, measure and record the amount that you urinate, and record each time you have an accidental ""leak"" of urine each day. Record your fluid intake, also. Your doctor may suggest taking a medication and limiting fluids to no more than 6–8 cups per day from all sources while you’re learning to control your bladder better.;
, Average the number of hours that you go between trips to the bathroom during your day?

, Using your average interval of time between needing to urinate, set your interval for beginning your training with one that is 15 minutes longer than the average. So, if you usually had made it for one hour before you need to use the bathroom, now add 15 minutes to make your training interval one hour and 15 minutes.

, Each day during you training, empty your bladder first thing in the morning, and then don’t go again until you reach your desired time interval. If the targeted time comes before you feel the need to go, still go anyway to empty your bladder. This includes learning to urinate on a schedule.


If the urge hits too early, remind yourself that your bladder really is not full, and use whatever techniques you can such as to sit or lie down to delay going. The mistaken urge to urinate should taper off after about a minute. Try to wait five minutes or longer before slowly walking to the bathroom.

, Try doing pelvic-floor (muscles) exercises (also called Kegels). This by clinching/contracting the muscle that hold back urine flow, muscles which you can find by trying to stop or by stopping flow of urine or passage of gas. Do 6 to 10 contractions in a session, by holding each exercise -- tensing and clinching for about 3 seconds each time and relaxing for about 3 seconds between (holding the Kegels tight feels odd, but do it to get results). Do this once or twice per day. It takes weeks to build some muscle and months to get much stronger.

, Once you are successful with your initial interval between going to urinate, try to increase it by 15 minutes. Over several weeks or months, you may find you are able to wait much longer and feel the urge less often.

, Do this record after four to eight weeks (1 to 2 months), to see how much you have improved. Compare your initial list/diary to your second diary to note the improvements in urinating (voiding) intervals and voided volumes (amounts)—this process reinforces the bladder training process.

Drink as much water as you can.,
Treat pain.,
Get a lot of rest.,
Keep track of your symptoms.,
Assess your symptoms.,
Contact your doctor.,
Get a diagnosis.,
Follow your doctor's treatment advice.",How to Get Rid of a Kidney Infection Naturally," While kidney infections can be dangerous and should be treated immediately with antibiotics, there is much that you can do to help the healing process. Drinking a lot of water can help flush out the bacteria that are causing the infection.Avoid coffee and alcohol. These beverages can irritate the bladder and also add to dehydration.
Drink cranberry juice. It has been shown to prevent kidney infections.;
, You can apply a heating pad to your side and back.This heat will reduce, but not eliminate, the pain.


It is not natural, but an OTC pain reliever and fever reducer, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), will control your symptoms more effectively., Kidney infections can be very stressful on your body. You need to preserve your energy for recovery as much as possible


To get more energy for recovery, eat small, frequent meals. Make sure you are getting nutritious foods into your body.

, Let your physician know if you are not getting better. If your symptoms are getting worse, you should contact your doctor immediately.

, You should suspect you have a kidney infection if you have several of the symptoms. These include:


Fever
Back, side (flank), or groin pain
Abdominal pain
Frequent urination
Strong, persistent urge to urinate
Burning sensation or pain when urinating
Pus or blood in your urine (hematuria)
Urine that smells bad or is cloudy

, If you have the symptoms of a kidney infection you should see a physician as soon as possible. Kidney infections can damage the kidneys and the infection can spread throughout the body.


Kidney infections are very serious and should not be treated lightly. They often require hospitalization.

, A kidney infection is diagnosed by a doctor with a combination of symptomatology and urinalysis. This means that your doctor will ask you about all of your symptoms and then you will need to give a urine sample if the doctor suspects a kidney infection. Other tests, such as an ultrasound or X-rays, are occasionally also needed to get a definite diagnosis.

, Kidney infections are usually treated with the antibiotics, such as levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Other antibiotics may be needed if you don’t respond well to the ones given initially.

Strengthen your pelvic muscles.,
Retrain your bladder.,
Make yourself comfortable in the bathroom.,
Apply external pressure or stimulation.,
Learn about self-catheterization.,
Consult with your doctor.,
Ask about available medications.,
Think about urethral dilation and stenting.,
Consider sacral neuromodulation.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.",How to Empty the Bladder," One of the most effective and best-known ways of strengthening your pelvic floor muscles is by doing Kegel exercises.They are simple exercises you can do anywhere that increase the strength of the muscles that control your bladder — as well as the uterus, small intestine and rectum. To help identify your pelvic floor muscles, stop urinating in midstream. The muscles that contract are the ones Kegel exercises strengthen. The exercises can be done in any position (so you can do them while sitting at traffic, at your desk at work, etc.), although it's easier while laying down.


Once you've identified your pelvic floor muscles, tighten them and hold the contraction for five seconds, followed by relaxing them for five seconds.Repeat this sequence five to 10 times a few different times daily.
Over the course of a few weeks, work up to keeping the pelvic muscles contracted for 10 seconds at a time, while also relaxing for 10 seconds afterwards. Do the exercises standing and sitting as well. Repeat this sequence five to 10 times daily until you're able to control your bladder better.
Be careful not to cheat by flexing your abdominals, thighs or buttocks, and remember to breathe freely while doing the exercises.
Many factors weaken pelvic floor muscles, such as pregnancy, childbirth, surgery, aging, obesity, chronic coughing and excessive straining from constipation.;
, Bladder training is an important behavioral therapy that can be effective in treating urinary retention and incontinence.The goals of this therapy are to increase the amount of time between urinating, increase the volume of fluid your bladder can hold and diminish the sense of urgency and/or any leakage issues. Bladder training requires that a fixed bladder emptying schedule be established, regardless if the urge to urinate is present or not. If the urge to pee occurs before the assigned time, urge suppression via contracting the pelvic muscles should be done.


Empty your bladder as best you can as soon as you wake up. Then set intervals of one to two hours to try to go again, regardless of urge.
As success is achieved controlling your bladder and urinating on demand, increase the interval in 15–30 minute increments until it's possible to remain comfortable for three to four hours.
It typically takes between six to 12 weeks to gain control of your bladder again and be able to fully void it when you feel the urge to urinate., Making yourself comfortable in the bathroom can contribute to being able to empty your bladder normally. If the air temperature or floor is too cold, that could distract you from the business at hand. Sitting down on the toilet may be the most comfortable for both genders, as some men feel back, neck or prostate pain while standing to urinate.Privacy can also be an important comfort factor, so don't try to urinate in public bathrooms and keep the door shut while at home.


Turn the temperature up in your house during the winter time and consider wearing slippers and a robe to the bathroom to keep warm.
Set up some aromatherapy candles in your bathroom and give it a ""spa look"" to soothe and relax you while you're trying to pee.
If you're a ""clean freak,"" keep your bathroom tidy so it doesn't distract or bother you.
Take your time. You need to allow yourself an average of 30–60 seconds to urinate, so don't rush and get stressed about it.
Try running some water in the bathroom sink in efforts to stimulate a strong urge to empty your bladder., Applying pressure over your bladder from the outside of your lower abdomen can help stimulate urination and promote full emptying of the bladder — think of it as a kind of massage or physical therapy.Look online to get an anatomical understanding of where your bladder is, then apply gentle pressure inward (towards your spine) and downward (towards your feet) to try and ""milk"" your bladder while urinating. This technique is easier to do while standing, as opposed to sitting on the toilet hunched forward.


Alternatively, try tapping the skin/muscle/fat directly over your bladder to trigger a contraction and release.
For women, inserting a sanitized finger into their vagina and applying forward pressure against the anterior vaginal wall can often stimulate the bladder and get it to release urine.
For men, too much stimulation of the lower abdomen might cause an erection, which makes it much more difficult to urinate. As such, maintain a flaccid penis when trying to fully empty your bladder.
Letting warm water run over your lower abdomen and genitalia can trigger the urge to pee. As such, try emptying your bladder while taking a warm shower.

, If you're really desperate to urinate and are feeling significant bladder and kidney pain, then self-catheterization may be the answer if the above advice doesn't work. Self-catheterization involves inserting a catheter (long, thin tube) up into your urinary tract and close to the opening of the bladder in order to drain urine from it.This procedure needs to be taught and demonstrated by your family doctor or urologist, but it's not for the squeamish or faint of heart.


It's usually better for your doctor to perform catheterization under a local anesthesia, but if you feel comfortable with the procedure and can use some lubrication instead, then give it a try.
Lubrication can reduce the need for a topical anesthesia, but some compounds (such as petroleum jelly) can irritate the delicate mucus membranes of the urethra and lead to pain.
It's important to sterilize the catheter thoroughly before inserting it into your urethra, as any introduction of bacteria can lead to an infection.

, If you're having trouble emptying your bladder for more than a few days consecutively, then make an appointment with your family doctor. Your doctor will examine you and try to find the root cause. In addition to weak pelvic muscles, other causes of urinary retention include: blockage in the urethra, bladder/kidney stones, genitourinary infections, severe constipation, cystocele formation (in women), prostate growth (in men), spinal cord injury, over-use of antihistamines and after effects from anesthesia due to surgery.You doctor may take a urine sample, x-rays, CT scan, MRI and/or diagnostic ultrasound studies to determine the cause of your bladder problem.
Get a referral to a genitourinary specialist for more testing, such as cystoscopy (insertion of a scope to view inside the bladder/urethra), urodynamic testing (measures bladder's ability to empty), and/or electromyography (measures muscle activity of bladder/lower pelvis).Common symptoms of urinary retention include: pain in lower abdomen, bloating, frequent urge to urinate, difficulty starting/stopping urine stream, weak flow of urine and leakage.If you're in severe discomfort from a full bladder that refuses to empty, your doctor can drain your bladder with a catheter — a relatively quick outpatient procedure done with a local anesthetic. Self-catheterization can be taught for home use (see above).

, Ask your doctor if your bladder problem and inability to void urine normally can be treated with medication. Some drugs can cause dilation (relaxation and widening) of the smooth muscle of the urethra and opening of the bladder, although long-term use of these can cause the opposite problem — incontinence and loss of bladder control.For men with enlarged prostate glands, a common cause of bladder / urinary problems, drugs such as dutasteride (Avodart) and finasteride (Proscar) are available to stop the benign prostate growth or even shrink it.


Medications that can relax the muscles of the bladder/urethra and also help with prostate enlargement include: alfuzosin (Uroxatral), doxazosin (Cardura), silodosin (Rapaflo), tadalafil (Cialis), tamsulosin (Flomax), terazosin (Hytrin).Medications should be viewed as only a short-term solution and not thought of as a permanent cure for urinary retention.

, Urethral dilation treats a blocked urethra by inserting increasingly larger diameter tubes into the urethra to stretch it out.In contrast, a stent is also used to stretch out a constricted urethra, but the stent expands like a spring and pushes back the surrounding tissue with time, instead of being replaced by larger ones. Stents can be temporary or permanent. Both dilation and stenting are outpatient procedures that require a local anesthesia and sometimes sedation.


Alternatively, the urethra can be made wider by inflating a small balloon attached to the end of a catheter.
These procedures are performed by a genitourinary specialist called a urologist.
Unlike regular catheterization which can be taught, dilation and stenting should not be done at home under any circumstances.

, Sacral neuromodulation, also called InterStim therapy, uses mild electrical pulses for the nerves that control the bladder and the muscles of the lower pelvis related to urinating.This therapy helps the brain, nerves and smooth muscles communicate better so the bladder can empty properly and at regular intervals. The electrical device has to be surgically inserted and turned on to function, but it's a reversible treatment that can be discontinued at any time by turning the device off or removing it from the body.


This therapy is also known as sacral nerve stimulation, although the sacral nerves in and around the tail bone can also be stimulated manually by massaging the area with a vibrating device. Try this at home to see if it causes better bladder emptying.
Sacral nerve stimulation is not indicated for a bladder or urinary retention problem caused by an obstruction.
Be aware that not all forms of non-obstructive urinary retention can be treated with sacral nerve stimulation, so ask your urologist if it's a good idea for you.

, If all of the above-mentioned techniques and treatments don't help with your bladder / urinary problem, then surgery should be considered as a last resort if your doctor thinks it might be helpful. There are a variety of surgeries available, but it depends on the actual root cause of your problem. Some examples of surgical procedures to help with urinary retention include: an internal urethrotomy, a cystocele or rectocele repair for women, and prostate surgery for men.An internal urethrotomy involves repairing a urethral stricture (blockage) by inserting a special catheter with a laser on the end.
A cystocele or rectocele procedure involves removing cysts, repairing holes and strengthening the vagina and surrounding tissues to move the bladder into its normal position.
To treat urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), part or all of the gland is surgically removed, typically by the transurethral method (use of a catheter inserted through the urethra).
Other surgeries can be done to remove tumors and/or cancerous tissues in the bladder or urethra if that applicable.

Talk to your family and friends about needing a kidney.,
Reach out to coworkers and other social networks.,
Answer common questions and concerns.,
Outline the surgical procedure.,
Let people volunteer to be a donor.",How to Find a Kidney Donor2," Start a conversation with those closest to you, such as family or close friends, about your need for a kidney donor. You should not put pressure on your loved ones to donate or ask them outright to be a donor. But you can get the conversation started around your need for a donor by discussing your health issue and your prognosis with those closest to you.For example, you may start the conversation with family and friends by saying, “I have spoken to my doctor and I need a kidney transplant to stay healthy. I will be going on dialysis, but it is not a long term solution. My best option is to find a kidney donor.”

, You should also reach out to your other social and professional networks, such as your coworkers, your local community groups, or your neighbors. Discuss your need for a kidney donor with people in these social groups and start a conversation about your medical condition. Talking to people in your social groups can be a good way to increase awareness about your need for a donor.You may also reach out to places of worship in your neighborhood or area, such as your local church or mosque. Try to tap into any communities that know you personally or as an acquaintance. Appealing to these groups can increase your chances of finding a donor.

, You should then field any questions your family, friends, or coworkers might have about being a kidney donor. Answering their questions can help them feel informed and aware of the process. It may also sway them to become a donor. You should try to provide as much information as you can about the role of a kidney donor and the process of becoming a kidney donor.For example, a family member may ask, “What would I have to do to become a kidney donor?” or “What are your chances of recovery if you find a donor?” You should then try to answer their questions to the best of your ability, using information from your doctor.
You may discuss the need for testing once the person agrees to become a kidney donor. They will need to go through several medical tests to ensure they are a good match for you and have a functional kidney to donate.
You may also outline when you need a kidney donor according to your doctor, such as right away or in the next several weeks. Putting a timeframe on the need for the donation may help put your situation in context for your family and friends.

, You should also be forthcoming about what exactly happens during the kidney donation and what the recovery time is post-surgery for the donor. Providing this information could help put a possible donor’s fears or concerns about donating to rest.You should explain that donor surgery is considered minimally invasive, often using a laparoscopic procedure or a minimal surgical procedure. Most donors can also leave the hospital within one to three days after the surgery.
You may also discuss the possibility of finding someone who is not a perfect match, such as a member of your extended family. Current anti-rejection drugs have allowed a wider range of individuals to become good kidney donors.

, Do not try to guilt or pressure those closest to you to be a donor. Instead, let them consider your needs and volunteer on their own terms. Having those closest to you volunteer will make the process less stressful and ensure everyone involved feels supported.If a family, friend, or coworker offers to be a kidney donor for you, you should thank them profusely. Then, you should emphasize that they are not bound to the donation and they can back out if they begin to feel overwhelmed or have second thoughts once the process begins. This will ensure your family member or friend does not feel pressured to be a donor and does not feel obligated to follow through.
You may want to try to have multiple people in your family start the process of being a kidney donor for you, if they volunteer. Having more than one possible donor can increase your chances of finding a good match.

"
"
Sign up for the donor list at your transplant center.,
Create a donor post on social media.,
Join an online donor group.",How to Find a Kidney Donor3," Another option many people use if they cannot find a donor through people they know is putting their name down on a donor list through their transplant center or their doctor. You may then find a donor once your turn comes on the list or if a suitable match for you appears through the transplant center’s list of donors.The donor list may be very long, depending on your transplant center and the need for kidney donors. But putting your name on the list will ensure that you have a possibility of finding a donor once your turn comes on the list.

, If you are not able to find a donor in your family or your group of friends, you may decide to look for a donor on social media. You may create a Facebook page and share it with your friends online to let everyone know you are looking for a kidney donor. Or you may post a message on your social media profiles to let everyone know of your need for a donor.In your posting, you should outline why you need a kidney donation and how you are doing medically at the moment. Include information on what makes a good kidney donor, such as the age range for the donor, blood type, and a good medical history.
Keep your posting personal and specific to you. Try to sound approachable and friendly in your posting so you can appeal to people that may not know you personally.
For example, you may say, “This is hard to post but I feel I need to be honest about my health. My kidneys are currently failing and my doctor says they will likely shut down completely in the next few months. My hope is to get a transplant so I do not need to go on dialysis, but the waiting list is very long. So I am doing my best to educate everyone I can about my situation and appeal for a kidney donor in other ways.”

, You can also reach out to the online community by joining an online donor group. You may search for kidney donor groups or forums online on your own or ask your doctor to refer you to online donor groups.Many of these forums can help you find support and guidance as you deal with your kidney issues. You may also be able to get a referral for potential kidney donors through other users in the group.
Keep in mind about 24 percent of living kidney donations are done through living unrelated donors. Finding a donor that you do not know personally may feel challenging, but you can end up finding a suitable donor through reaching out to the general public.

Allow the donor to meet with your doctor.,
Have the donor get tested for eligibility.,
Set a date for the kidney donation.",How to Find a Kidney Donor4," Once you believe you have found a suitable kidney donor, you should arrange for the donor to meet with your doctor at the transplant center. The donor may also want to speak to their spouses, their family, or their doctor as they start the process of being a donor. You should make sure the donor feels supported and prepared for the donation by speaking to medical professionals and their own personal support system.You may also suggest that the donor talk to someone who has been a living donor before, as this may help them get more familiar with the process of donating a kidney. Your transplant center may be able to refer the donor to a kidney transplant support group, where the donor can talk to other living donors and recipients who went through the donation process.

, A good living donor will be physically healthy and willing to donate their kidney. They do not need to be the same race or sex as the recipient to be a good donor. Your potential donor will be tested by your transplant center to ensure they are healthy and that the transplant will have a high rate of success.The evaluation of the donor can take from one to six months to complete. The transplant center will run blood tests on the donor as well as tests for blood pressure, heart rate, and lung function. The donor will also need to get a CT scan closer to the donation date to check the state of their kidney.
Individuals who are 70 years and older can still be good kidney donors as long as their kidneys are healthy and their body is able to handle surgery. People who smoke can be donors, though they will need to stop smoking before and after the surgery for a period of time.

, Once your kidney donor has been approved, they may be scheduled in for their kidney donation right away, depending on your needs as a recipient. Your transplant team will determine the best date for the donation and help your donor prepare for the surgery.During the surgery, both you and the donor will be given general anesthetic and placed in adjoining operating rooms.The surgeon will then remove the donor’s kidney and inspect it before taking it into your room and placing the new kidney in your body.
The transplant is often quick and painless for both the donor and the recipient. The donor and the recipient are usually able to leave the hospital after several days and can resume normal activities within four to eight weeks.

Exercise.",How to Dissolve Uric Acid Crystals," If you have gout, a type of arthritis from high uric acid levels, crystals can form in the fluid around your joints. Although older men are more likely to get it, it can affect anyone. No one knows the true cause of gout, but certain risk factors include a diet high in meat and seafood, obesity, chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, family history of gout or if you are on certain medications.Gout causes inflammation and attacks of joint pain (usually at night and experienced in your big or great toe), along with redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the joint. The discomfort lingers for days to weeks after the attack ends and could actually develop into chronic gout, leading to impaired mobility.;
, If you have chronic gout, frequent or painful gout attacks, talk to your doctor about starting a prescription medication. Your doctor may do different tests to diagnose gout, including a blood test to measure your uric acid levels, a synovial fluid test (where a needle draws fluid from your joint), or an ultrasound or CT scan to detect urate crystals. With the results of the tests, your doctor will be able to decide if and which medication you should start.


Your doctor may prescribe medications like xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uricosuric drugs, and other less common drugs such as colchicine, which is for acute gout attacks.

, These medications decrease the amount of uric acid your body makes which can lower your blood uric acid level.Your doctor will most likely prescribe these medications as a first form of treatment for chronic gout. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors include allopurinol (Aloprim, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric). While these medications can cause an initial increase in gout attacks, they'll eventually prevent them. Side effects of allopurinol include diarrhea, drowsiness, rash and low blood counts. Make sure to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day when taking allopurinol.
Side effects of febuxostat include rash, nausea, joint pain and reduced liver function.

, These types of medications help your body to excrete more uric acid through your urine. Uricosuric drugs prevent your body from reabsorbing urate (uric crystals) back into your blood, which can reduce the concentration of uric acid in your blood.You'll probably be prescribed probenecid, but it's not recommended if you have kidney issues. Start by taking 250mg every 12 hours for the first week. Your doctor may increase the prescription over time, but never to more than 2 grams.


Side effects of probenecid include rash, stomach pain, kidney stones, dizziness, and headache. To prevent kidney stones, you should drink at least six to eight full glasses of water a day while taking probenecid.

, Some medications, including thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), and loop diuretics (such as furosemide or Lasix) should be avoided, since they can aggravate your condition. You should also avoid low doses of aspirin and niacin because they can also increase your uric acid levels.


Don't stop taking medications without talking to your doctor. In many cases, there are alternatives available.

, Try to eat healthy, fiber-rich foods and lean proteins.Foods that are high in dietary soluble fiber can help to dissolve uric acid crystals. The fiber helps to absorb the crystals, removing them from your joints and helping to eliminate them from your kidneys. You should also avoid saturated fats, like cheese, butter and margarine. Reduce your sugar intake, including high-fructose corn syrup and soft drinks, all of which can promote gout attacks. Instead try to include:Oats
Spinach
Broccoli
Raspberries
Whole-wheat items
Brown rice
Black beans
Cherries (Cherries can reduce gout attacks.One study showed that eating 10 cherries a day protected people from gout flare ups.)
Low-fat or non-fat dairy

, Naturally occurring substances in food called purines are converted to uric acid by your body. Studies have shown that eating foods high in purines could lead to a gout attack within a few days of eating the foods.Avoid high-purine foods including:Meats: red meat and organ meats (liver, kidney and sweetbreads)
Seafood: tuna, lobster, shrimp, mussels, anchovies, herring, sardines, scallops, trout, haddock, mackerel

, Drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day has been shown to decrease gout attacks.Liquids generally count toward water recommendations, but it's best to stick to water. You should also minimize or cut out drinking alcohol since it can metabolize and increase uric acid levels.If you do want to drink something other than water, look for drinks that aren't high in sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or caffeinated. Sugar can increase your risk of gout and caffeine can be dehydrating.You can still drink coffee in moderation (two to three cups a day). Some studies show that coffee may reduce the levels of uric acid in your blood, although the studies do not show a decrease in gout attacks., If you'd rather increase your vitamin C through your diet, try eating:Fruits: cantaloupe, citrus, kiwi fruit, mango, papaya, pineapple, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries, watermelon
Vegetables: broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, green and red peppers, spinach, cabbage, turnip greens, sweet potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, winter squash
Cereals fortified with vitamin C

, Try to exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. One study showed that exercising 150 minutes a week reduces uric acid levels. It can also reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and help you lose weight. Weight loss has been linked to lower blood uric acid levels.Even lower physical activity has been linked to some reduction in uric acid levels. For example, if you can't jog for 30 minutes, try briskly walking for at least 15."

Make sure the catheter tube is not twisted or blocked.,
Do not pull or tug on the catheter bag.",How to Empty a Catheter Bag," Use warm water and soap to clean your hands. Dry your hands once they are clean. Do this every time you are going to touch the catheter to prevent the spread of germs.You may also put on medical gloves, if you have access to them.;
, The drainage tube is at the end of the catheter tube. It is connected to the catheter tube with a plastic colored clip.Make sure all the urine from the catheter tube drains into the catheter bag as you hold it straight. This will make it less messy when you empty it.

, This will make it easier to empty. Squeeze the plastic pieces on the drainage tube together gently until they come off the edge of the holder.Slowly slide the drainage tube out of the holder. Then, place the drainage tube over the toilet.
Point the drainage tube down into the toilet but do not let the tube touch the edges of the toilet.

, Once the plastic clips have come off the edge of the holder, you should open the metal clamp that is on the catheter tube. Do this by pushing down on the bottom metal piece until it releases.Let the urine drain from the bag into the toilet. Once it has drained completely, you should close the metal clamp by pressing the metal pieces together. It should click shut as it closes.
You can then clip the drainage tube back into the holder and reuse the catheter, if it is a reusable catheter.

, You will likely use a large catheter bag if you are not very mobile and have to lie down in bed often. This type of bag often hangs from a stand by your bed so it can emptied by a nurse or a caretaker.You may also use a large catheter bag overnight for when you sleep. This way, the urine can travel through the catheter and into the large catheter bag during the night.

, You will likely use a leg catheter bag if you are going to be up and about on your feet, walking around throughout the day. This bag is attached to the inside of your thigh, just above your knee, with elastic straps. You can then wear pants or a long skirt to over the catheter bag.Though leg catheter bags do not hold as much urine as large bags, they are ideal if you plan to move around a lot throughout the day and do not want to have to pull a catheter bag stand behind you.

, If you tend to wear a leg bag throughout the day, your doctor may recommend that you switch to a large catheter bag at night so you do not have to worry about the catheter bag when you are sleeping. It is also better for your urinary tract if you use a large catheter bag overnight.You can switch to a large catheter bag by first washing your hands well and then raising the drainage tube so all the urine goes in the leg bag.
Then, take off the cap or clip on the leg bag and kink up the catheter tube by folding it over once. This will ensure no urine passes through the tube.
Carefully pull the end of your catheter from the leg bag. Connect the end of the catheter to the large catheter bag. Unkink the tube so the urine now flows into the large catheter bag.

, You should always rinse out the catheter bag before you reuse it. You should also rinse out the leg bag and let it dry if you are switching to a large catheter bag for the night.Do this by rinsing the bag out with one part vinegar and three parts water. Let the bag soak for 20 minutes and then rinse it out with warm water. Let it air dry by hanging it up in your bathroom.
You should clean the leg bag every day if you use it daily and replace it once a month.

, You should check that the catheter tubing is not twisted, looped, or blocked in any way. Make sure you hang the urine bag up on a stand so it lies vertical and straight. This will ensure the catheter bag works properly overnight and throughout the day.If you are wearing a leg bag, make sure it is placed below your bladder, at waist level, and the tube lies flat against your leg. You should make sure the leg bag is fastened to your thigh with medical tape, leaving a little slack in the catheter so there is not too much pressure on your bladder or urethra.
If you wear a leg catheter bag often, you should try to get in the habit of switching the bag from one leg to the other. You can do this right after you have a shower.

, You should be careful not to pull or tug at the catheter bag, as this can dislodge the catheter and lead to poor drainage or leaking. You should check the catheter bag periodically to make sure it is draining properly.If you experience leakage from the catheter bag and cannot locate the issue, you should see your doctor. Sometimes, leakage can occur due to bladder spasms, a blockage, or a urinary issue.
Always keep catheter bag and tubing below the level of the bladder to prevent urine backflow into your bladder.

See if the stone can be removed with a ureteroscope.,
Have percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery.,
See if thyroid treatment is necessary.",How to Dissolve Kidney Stones1," If you have trouble passing small stones on your own, your doctor may prescribe a type of medication called an alpha blocker, which relaxes the muscles in your ureter to help you pass the stones more easily. This should be sufficient for smaller stones, but you may need extra help to pass larger ones.If you have uric acid kidney stones, then a course of potassium citrate might be in order so that the stones dissolve on their own.;
, This procedure uses sound waves to break up large stones, making them easier to pass. Since the procedure can be painful, patients are usually placed under anesthesia during the 30 to 45 minute process of pulverizing the stones. This is an effective treatment, but it can cause bruising and pain as the small pieces of stone eventually pass.

, Stones that are too large to be broken up with shock wave therapy, but too small to require surgery may be removed with a scope that is inserted into the ureter. Once the stone is located, it is broken up using small tools. Since the procedure can be painful, it usually requires either local or general anesthesia.

, For large stones that can't be broken into bits using shock wave therapy, surgery may be required to remove them. A small incision is made in the patient's back, and a tiny instrument is inserted to remove the kidney stone or stones. The surgery requires an overnight stay in the hospital., In some cases, calcium kidney stones are caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is when the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. This can happen when a small tumor grows on a parathyroid gland, or when a separate condition causes the parathyroid to overproduce parathyroid hormone. Once your doctor has determined the cause of the hyperparathyroidism, he or she will recommend the proper course of treatment to correct the problem.

When you sit down, it may feel like you are sitting on a ball or an egg; this feeling may disappear when you stand up or lie down. This is the most obvious symptom of a cystocele, and you should see your primary care physician or gynecologist as soon as possible.This feeling is generally considered a sign of a severe prolapsed bladder.;
, If you have any pain, pressure, or discomfort in your lower abdomen, pelvic area, or vagina, you should see a doctor. Any number of conditions, including a prolapsed bladder, could cause those symptoms.If you have a cystocele, this pain, pressure, or discomfort may increase when you cough, sneeze, exert yourself or otherwise place pressure on the muscles of your pelvic floor. If this is the case, be sure you mention it to your doctor.
If you have a prolapsed bladder, you may also feel like something is falling out of your vagina.

, If you tend to leak urine when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or exert yourself, you have what’s known as “stress incontinence.” Women who have given birth are particularly susceptible, and a prolapsed bladder can be a major cause. See your doctor to resolve the issue.Notice as well if you've experienced any changes when you urinate, including difficulty initiating a stream of urine, incomplete emptying of the bladder (also known as urinary retention), and increased urinary frequency and urgency.
Note if you've had frequent bladder infections, or urinary tract infections (UTIs). ""Frequent"" is defined as having more than one UTI in a six-month period. Women with cystoceles often wind up with frequent bladder infections, so it's worth paying attention to the frequency of your UTIs.

, Pain during sex is called “dyspareunia” and can be triggered by a number of physical conditions, including a prolapsed bladder. If you are dealing with dyspareunia, you should see your primary care physician or gynecologist as soon as possible.If pain during intercourse is a new development for you, and you’ve recently delivered a baby vaginally, then a prolapsed bladder is a particularly likely cause. Don’t delay seeing your doctor.

, Some women with cystoceles also experience pain, pressure, or discomfort in the lower back area. Back pain is a very general symptom that could mean many things – or nothing serious at all – but it makes sense to schedule an appointment with your doctor. This is especially the case if you are experiencing any of the other symptoms., If your case is a mild one, you may not notice any the above symptoms. Some cystoceles are first discovered during routine gynecological examinations.


However, if you exhibit or experience any of the symptoms described above, you should consult your primary care physician (PCP) or gynecologist.
If you do not experience symptoms there is often no need for treatment.

, During pregnancy and childbirth, your pelvic muscles and supportive tissues are strained and stretched. Since these are the muscles that hold your bladder in place, serious stress or weakness on them can allow the bladder to slip down into the vagina.Women who have been pregnant, especially if they had multiple vaginal births, are at high risk for the development of cystoceles. Even women who delivered by cesarean are at risk.

, Postmenopausal women are at significant risk for a prolapsed bladder due to reduced levels of the female sex hormone estrogen. Estrogen is partly responsible for maintaining the strength, tone, and resilience of your vaginal muscles. As a result, the low levels of estrogen accompanying the transition into menopause cause these muscles to become thinner and less elastic, which leads to overall weakening.Note that this drop in estrogen takes place even if you enter menopause through artificial means, as with the surgical removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) and/or ovaries. These surgeries not only cause damage to the pelvic area, but also cause changes in estrogen levels. Therefore, though you may be younger than most menopausal women and otherwise healthy, you are still at risk for a cystocele., Intense straining or heavy lifting can sometimes trigger a prolapse. When you strain the muscles of your pelvic floor, you risk triggering a prolapsed bladder (especially if the muscles of your vaginal wall have already been weakened by menopause or childbirth). Types of straining that can cause a cystocele include:Lifting very heavy objects (including children)
Chronic, intense coughing
Constipation and straining during bowel movements

, If you are overweight or obese, your risk of a prolapsed bladder is increased. The extra weight places additional strain on the muscles of your pelvic floor.Whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese., If you think you may have a prolapsed bladder, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist.


Be prepared to give your doctor as much information as possible, including a complete medical history and a detailed description of your symptoms.

, As a first step, your doctor will probably perform a routine gynecological exam. In this exam, the cystocele is detected by applying a speculum (a tool for inspecting body orifices) against the posterior (back) vaginal wall while you lie back with your knees bent and ankles supported by stirrups. The physician will likely ask you to ""bear down"" (as if you were pushing during childbirth or having a bowel movement) or cough. If a cystocele is present, the doctor will see or feel a soft mass bulging into the anterior (front) vaginal wall when you strain.A bladder that has ended up in the vagina is considered positive diagnosis of a prolapsed bladder.In some cases, in addition to performing the standard pelvic exam, your doctor may want to examine you standing up. It can be beneficial to evaluate a prolapse from different positions.
If your doctor notices a prolapse in the back wall of your vagina, she is likely to also perform a rectal exam. This will help her determine the strength of your muscles.You don't need to prepare for this examination in any way and it should not take very long. You may feel slight discomfort during the pelvic exam, but for many women this is just a routine exam much like having pap smears.

, Your doctor will likely recommend tests known as cystometrics or urodynamics.


A cystometric study measures how full your bladder is when you first feel the need to urinate, when your bladder feels ""full,"" and when your bladder is actually completely full.Your doctor will ask you to urinate into a container that is connected to a computer, which will take some measurements. Then you will lie on an examination table and the doctor will insert a thin, flexible catheter into your bladder.
Urodynamics is a set of tests. It includes measured voiding (aka uroflow), which will time how long it takes you to start urinating, how long urination takes to complete, and how much urine you produce. It also includes cystometry, as mentioned above. It will also include a voiding or emptying phase test.
In most urodynamics tests, your doctor will place a thin, flexible catheter into the bladder, which will remain in place as you urinate. A special sensor will gather data for your doctor to interpret.

, In some cases, usually when your prolapse is more severe, your doctor may recommend additional tests. Common additional tests include:



Urinalysis - In a urinalysis, your urine will be tested for signs of infection (such as a UTI). The doctor will also test your bladder to see if it empties completely. This is done by inserting a catheter (tube) into a woman's urethra to remove and measure the amount of remaining urine after voiding, the post-void residual (PVR). A PVR of more than 50-100 milliliters is diagnostic for urinary retention, one of the symptoms of a prolapsed bladder.Ultrasound with PVR - An ultrasound test sends out sound waves that bounce off the bladder and back to the ultrasound machine, producing in the process an image of the bladder. This image also shows the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after urination, or voiding.Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) – This is a test in which a doctor takes x-rays during urination (voiding) to view the bladder and evaluate problems. A VCUG shows the shape of the bladder and analyzes urine flow to pinpoint any potential blockages. The test can also be used to diagnose stress urinary incontinence masked by a cystocele. It is important to make this dual diagnosis, as the patient will also need an incontinence procedure in addition to a cystocele repair (if surgery is needed). , Once your doctor confirms the presence of a prolapsed bladder, you should ask for a more detailed diagnosis. Cystoceles are divided into categories based on severity. The best course of treatment will depend on what kind of cystocele you have, as well as the symptoms it is causing in your life. Your prolapsed bladder may fall into any of the following “grades”:Grade 1 prolapses are mild. If you have a Grade 1 cystocele, only part of your bladder is descending into your vagina. You may exhibit mild symptoms such as slight discomfort and urine leakage, but some women don't exhibit any symptoms. Treatment may consist of Kegel exercises, rest, and avoidance of heavy lifting or straining. If you are postmenopausal, estrogen replacement therapy is also a consideration.
Grade 2 prolapses are moderate. If you have a Grade 2 cystocele, the entire bladder descends into the vagina. It may reach so far that it touches the vaginal opening.Symptoms such as discomfort and urinary incontinence become moderate. Surgery to repair the cystocele may be warranted, but you may be able to get adequate symptom relief with a vaginal pessary (a small plastic or silicone device that you place inside your vagina to hold the walls in place).Grade 3 prolapses are severe. If you have a Grade 3 cystocele, part of the bladder actually bulges through the vaginal opening. Symptoms such as discomfort and urinary incontinence become severe. Cystocele repair surgery and/or pessary as with a grade 2 cystocele is required.
Grade 4 prolapses are complete. If you have a Grade 4 cystocele, the entire bladder descends through the vaginal opening. In these cases, you may experience other severe problems, including uterine and rectal prolapses.

, A Grade 1 prolapsed bladder usually requires no medical treatment as long as it is not accompanied by pain or discomfort for the sufferer. Check with your physician as to whether she recommends medical treatment or more of a ""wait-and-see"" approach. If your symptoms do not bother you very much, your doctor is likely to recommend basic treatment approaches including Kegel exercises and physical therapy.Note that your physician may recommend that you back off certain activities, like weight lifting or other activities that put strain on your pelvic muscles. It's still healthy to exercise regularly, though.You should also know that how your symptoms affect your quality of life is a key factor in deciding on treatment. For example, you may have a severe prolapse but are not troubled by your symptoms. In this case, you could talk with your doctor about less severe treatment options. On the other hand, you might have a mild prolapse, but the symptoms cause you significant distress or inconvenience. You could talk with your doctor about a more aggressive approach.

, Kegel exercises are performed by contracting the muscles of your pelvic floor (as if you were attempting to stop the flow of urine), holding them for a brief period, and then releasing them. Regular performance of these exercises, which require no special equipment and can be performed anywhere (including while waiting in line, at a desk, or relaxing on the couch), can strengthen your muscles. In mild cases, they can keep your prolapsed bladder from descending further. To perform Kegel exercises:Contract, or tighten, the pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles used to stop the flow of urine when urinating.
Hold the contraction for five seconds and then relax for five.
Work up to holding the contraction for ten seconds at a time.
Your goal is three to four sets of 10 repetitions of the exercises daily

, A pessary is a small, silicone device that, when inserted into the vagina, holds the bladder (and other pelvic organs) in place. Some are made for you to insert yourself; others need to be inserted by a doctor. Pessaries come in a variety of shapes and sizes and a healthcare professional can help a woman choose the most comfortable fit.Pessaries can be uncomfortable, and some women have trouble keeping them from falling out. They may also cause vaginal ulceration (if not correctly sized) and infection (if not routinely removed and cleaned on a monthly basis). You will likely need a topical estrogen cream to prevent damage to your vaginal walls.
Despite these disadvantages, a pessary can be a valuable alternative, particularly if you wish to postpone or are not a good candidate for surgery. Talk to your doctor, and weigh the pros and cons for your particular case.

, Because a reduced level of estrogen is so frequently responsible for weakened vaginal muscles, your doctor may suggest estrogen therapy. Estrogen can be prescribed as a pill, vaginal cream, or ring inserted into the vagina in an effort to strengthen weak pelvic floor muscles. The cream doesn't absorb very well and thus is strongest on the area where it is applied.Estrogen therapy does have risks. Women with certain types of cancer should not take estrogen, and you should discuss the potential dangers and benefits with your doctor. In general, topical estrogen treatments are less risky than oral, “systemic” estrogen treatments.

, If other treatments do not work, or if your cystocele is very severe (Grade 3 or 4), your doctor may recommend surgery. Surgery works better for some women than others. For example, if you have plans for future children, you may wish to postpone the surgery until after your family is complete to avoid prolapse happening again after childbirth. Older women may also have higher risks associated with surgery.A common surgical treatment for prolapse is vaginoplasty. A surgeon will lift your bladder into place, and then may tighten and reinforce your vaginal muscles to make sure that everything stays where it should. There are other surgical procedures to be considered, and your doctor will recommend the one she believes is best for your unique situation.A surgeon will explain the procedure and all of its risks and advantages and potential complications before the surgery. Potential complications include a UTI, incontinence, bleeding, infection, and in some rare cases, damage to the urinary retract that requires surgery to repair properly. It's also a possibility that women may experience irritation or pain during sexual intercourse after the surgery due to a suture or scar tissue inside of them.Depending on the specifics of your case, you may need either local, regional or general anesthesia. Many women can return home within one to three days post-operation and most patients can return to normal activity levels after about six weeks.If you also have a prolapsed uterus, your doctor may recommend a hysterectomy to remove it. This can be done along with the surgery. If the cystocele is accompanied by stress urinary incontinence, a simultaneous urethral suspension procedure may be needed.

Prevent re-occurrences of hematuria.",How to Detect Blood in Urine," Blood will often make your urine appear to be red, pink or brown (similar in shade to Coca-Cola). After you pee, step back and inspect the color of the urine before you flush the toilet to look for abnormal colors in it.Your urine should be clear or a very light yellow in shade. It should resemble the color of lemon juice from one squeezed lemon.
If your urine is a dark yellow, it might indicate that you are dehydrated. Increase your water intake to 8 to 10 glasses of water a day in order to have healthier urine.Dark or orange urine can also be a sign of a problem with your liver, especially if you have light colored stools or yellowing skin. Consult your doctor immediately if this describes your symptoms.;
, Blood in the urine can often be a symptom of a problem in your bladder, urinary tract, or kidneys.


Have you had any pain or irritation when you have used the bathroom recently? Have you had trouble controlling when you urinate or do you experience a burning sensation when you pee? If so, this might be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI).Have you had any pain in your kidneys? You will generally have felt this in your back. Your kidneys are located under your ribs and on either side of your spine (not on the small of your back or above the buttocks, as commonly perceived). If you have any pain on your back, you might have an inflammation or irritation in the kidneys.Are you a long distance runner? Blood in the urine has been connected to vigorous exercise, especially marathon runners. In this case, blood in the urine is most likely harmless, but you should still consult your doctor.Are you menstruating? Blood in the urine can occur when you use the bathroom during menstruation. While blood in the urine in this case is generally harmless, you should still consult your doctor if your symptoms persist after you finish menstruating., If you detect blood in your urine, you should contact your doctor. While there might not be anything wrong with you, blood in the urine is a serious symptom that can only be properly assessed by a medical professional.Start by contacting your general practitioner for an appointment.They will know your medical history and will be able to test for any problems in your urine and blood. It is possible that they will refer you to a specialist (like an urologist) if you need advanced treatment for a particular area of the body or for a specialized condition, like kidney disease.

, Your doctor will most likely want to test your urine, although he or she will also check for other abnormalities, like pain in the kidneys or bladder. The urine sample will help your doctor find the underlying cause of the blood in your urine.The urine sample is called a urinalysis. If the urinalysis reveals Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the urine, it is likely you are suffering from a bladder infection (or cystitis). The urinalysis may also show bacteria in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract that stems from the anus. In this case, you likely have urethritis, or an infection of the urethra. The urine sample can also detect the presence of any cancerous cells.If large amounts of protein are present in the urine, this may be an indication that you suffer from a kidney disease., Your doctor may decide to also take a blood sample in addition to a urine sample. You will most likely have this taken at your doctor's office, but they may send to a different health care provider or commercial facility that specializes in taking samples. The blood sample is then sent to a lab for analysis.Your doctor may analyze a blood sample in order to determine the presence of creatinine, a waste product that is normally filtered out of the blood stream by your kidneys. If you have a high level of creatinine in your blood, this may indicate a problem with your kidneys. , If your urine sample and blood tests indicate a larger problem in the kidneys, then your doctor may wish to do a biopsy. This is where a small piece of kidney tissue will be removed and examined under a microscope. It's a very common procedure.Local anesthesia will be administered and the doctor will use computerized tomography, or ultrasound, to guide a biopsy needle into your kidney.
After the tissue is removed, it is examined by a pathologist in a lab. Your doctor will call you in a week or so with the results and to discuss what treatment is necessary, if any.

, It is likely your doctor will have a diagnosis prepared for you after analyzing the blood and urine samples. But if not, he or she may want to conduct further tests, such as a cystoscopy or take an imaging test of your kidneys.


The cystoscopy is a more invasive procedure than a biopsy. A tubular instrument will be inserted into your bladder and urethra to look for any abnormal growth or tumors in the area.X-rays of your urinary tract will also reveal any mass growth or tumors that might be blocking responsible for blood in your urine. Your doctor will generally only require these if the cause of the blood is unclear from earlier tests.

, The treatment for the blood in your urine will vary depending on its underlying cause. If you have a UTI, your doctor will prescribe a course of antibiotics (usually in pill/capsule form, taken once or twice a day). If you have kidney stones, you might be given a round of shock wave therapy. It is also possible that your doctor will find no serious, underlying cause of blood in the urine. In this case, you might not be prescribed any treatment, but you should be vigilant of any reoccurrence of hematuria.

, Hematuria can be caused by any number of conditions, some harmless, some more serious. In more benign cases, it can be caused by menstruation or excessive exercise (especially when you become dehydrated).. But its more serious causes can include the following:


A UTI
Blood clots or clotting conditions, such as hemophilia
Kidney stones
Kidney disease or diabetes
An enlarged prostate
Trauma or injury to the kidney
Kidney, bladder or prostate cancer, There are actually two forms of hematuria: gross and microscopic. In gross hematuria, you will be able visibly spot the blood in your urine through the pink, red or brown discoloration. But if you suffer from microscopic hematuria, you will not be able to visibly detect any blood in the urine.


If you have a history of kidney, bladder or prostate cancer in your family, be sure to have your doctor test your urine at your annual check-up, especially if you are over the age of 40. Microscopic hematuria might be a symptom of a larger problem in your urinary tract, but it can only detected through testing., While the specific steps for prevention will vary depending on the cause of the blood in the urine, there are some general measures you can take to prevent a reoccurrence.


If your hematuria is caused by a UTI, then drink plenty of liquids (8-10 glasses of water a day) to stay well hydrated. If you are a woman, be sure to wipe from front to back when you use the bathroom so you won't get bacteria from the anus into your urinary tract.If your hematuria is caused by kidney stones, drink lots of water and avoid foods that are high in salt.If your hematuria is caused by cancer in either the bladder or the kidney, then be sure to drink lots of fluids, eat a healthy diet of lean meats and vegetables, and stop smoking. Light to moderate exercise will also be a good preventative measure.

Drink several quarts of water every day.,
Make dietary changes to shrink stones.,
Drink beverages containing lemons every day.,
Try herbal remedies.",How to Dissolve Kidney Stones2," No matter what type of stone you have, kidney stones smaller than 5 millimeters will usually pass on their own, without the need for medical intervention. If you can feel your kidney stone but it isn't painful enough to require treatment, your doctor will probably advise drinking 2 to 3 quarts of water daily until the stone passes.Staying extremely well hydrated will help flush the kidney stone from your system.


Aim to drink enough water to produce mostly clear urine. Clear urine is an indication that your body is extremely well hydrated.
Non-caffeinated, sugar and alcohol free beverages like ginger ale, fruit juice, cranberry juice, or green tea could also help you stay hydrated. Avoid beverages with caffeine, artificial sweeteners, sugar, or alcohol while you're trying to pass a kidney stone.

, Since kidney stones are caused by the buildup of certain minerals, eating fewer foods containing these minerals can help to shrink the stones. This is especially effective if you have either calcium or uric acid stones.



If you have calcium stones, cut back on the following foods that make the problem worse: salty foods, dairy products, oysters, tofu, and fatty foods.If you have calcium oxalate stones, you should avoid foods high in oxalate, like rhubarb, grapes, spinach, sweet potatoes, coffee, and chocolate.

If you have uric acid stones, cut back on the following foods containing uric acid: organ meat like liver and kidney, anchovies, sardines, beans, mushrooms, spinach, cauliflower, yeast, and alcohol.

, Whether you drink real lemonade, lemon juice, lemon-lime drinks or just water with a few lemon slices, the acidic nature of citrus helps so that kidney stones do not form., While no herbal remedy has been scientifically proven to remove kidney stones, many have found that consuming certain herbs, especially in the form of tea, can help to shrink the stones so they pass more easily. Try the following herbs in order to treat a mild kidney stone:


Birch leaf tea, which is said to help remove waste products from the urinary system.Black tea, which increases urine flow since it is a diuretic.Nettle leaf, which is also a diuretic and can help flush the kidney stones from your system.
Dandelion root, which is said is to be an effective kidney tonic.
Apple cider vinegar, which is said to help dissolve stones. You can consume 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of apple cider vinegar each day, or mix it with water.

Avoid using sorrel, which can cause calcium oxalate kidney stones to worsen.
Banana stem juice is a well-known treatment for kidney stones in India.

Determine if you really have a kidney stone.,
Visit a doctor to get an imaging test.,
Figure out what kind of stones you have.",How to Dissolve Kidney Stones3," While not all kidney stones cause people to have symptoms, even very small stones can cause severe pain. If you've already had a few kidney stones in your life, you might be reasonably sure that's what's going on. However, since the symptoms of a kidney stone overlap symptoms of many other disorders, it's a good idea to receive a diagnosis so you can treat it properly. Here are the most common symptoms of kidney stones:Severe pain in the side and lower back, which often spreads to the abdomen and groin.
Pain that comes and goes in waves, and is present during urination.
Foul-smelling, cloudy, pink or brown urine.
Nausea and vomiting.

, Getting an x-ray, CT scan or ultrasound (depending on what your doctor recommends) when you notice the symptoms of a kidney stone is the best way to determine how you should treat the stone. Imaging technology can will reveal the size, shape and number of stones you're dealing with.


If you have a stone smaller than 5 millimeters, your doctor will probably advise using at-home methods to help the stone pass.
If you have a larger stone or multiple stones, your doctor may prescribe a medication or recommend a different course of medical treatment to pulverize the stones so you can pass them.

, Kidney stones produce the same symptoms, but they can be caused by several different conditions. Knowing what's causing the formation of your kidney stones will help you reduce their size and prevent them in the future. Your doctor may perform blood or urine tests to figure out what type of stones you have. After you pass a stone, your doctor might send it to a lab for analysis to determine its makeup. Here are the different types of kidney stones:



Calcium stones: these are the most common type of stones, and are caused by a high level of calcium combined with another substance, such as oxalate or uric acid. Doctors may prescribe a thiazide diuretic or phosphate containing preparation in order to get rid of these stones.

Uric acid stones: these form when the urine contains too much acid. Doctors will prescribe allopurinol, which may help dissolve the kidney stone. Also, they may prescribe potassium citrate to lower the pH of the urine and dissolve the uric acid stone.

Struvite stones: these can form after a urinary tract infection. To prevent struvite stones, your doctor might suggest that you keep your urinary tract clean and free of infections.

Cystine stones: this type of stone is caused by a rare genetic disease. These are more difficult to treat. Your doctor may have your drink more fluids or prescribe you medication that reduces the amount of cystine in the urine."

Drink fluids.,
Apply heat.,
Look over the counter.,
Rely on loved ones.,
Cry out or scream.",How to Cope With Kidney Stones," The National Institute of Health recommends that a person suffering from a kidney stones should drink 2 to 3 quarts of water a day.If you're feeling nauseous, try taking small sips as often as you can. This will help flush your kidneys as well as encourage that little mass to move.;
, Get a heating pad and place on the side(s) experiencing pain. Additionally, you can try getting into a hot shower, allowing the water to spray onto the afflicted area. These provide temporary relief, as they are methods of distraction for your body.


The heat allows your mind and body to focus on an additional stimulus, taking the full focus off the kidney pain. The heat not only distracts the mind but also relaxes the tender, swollen muscles around the kidney. This allows some of the muscle tension to ease up, thus making it easier for the stone to work its way down.

, Advil or another medication containing Ibuprofen will help with the inflammation caused by the stone (and can be used in addition to narcotics prescribed by your doctor).However, these cannot be taken if you are pregnant.

, Have someone rub your back or press their hand or fist firmly into the painful kidney. Laying flat on your stomach with a pillow under your pelvis might help. Do not be afraid to ask for help. This will also give your loved one a sense of being useful. Though you are experiencing extraordinary pain, your family and friends are experiencing the pain of not being able to do anything to help you.

, There is no shame in vocalizing your pain. Most grown men who have experienced kidney stones will tell you there is no worse pain, and some women even place the pain above childbirth. Letting your frustrations out does not make you a wimp in this situation!

The pyrogens now bind to the receptors in the hypothalamus and the body’s temperature starts to rise. By making the body hot, the immune system makes it more difficult for microorganisms to survive.;
, Infection can alter the normal eating habits of a person. When higher body temperatures occur, such as greater than the normal value of 98.6 degree F, the enzyme’s function in a person’s taste buds stop and therefore cannot send messages to the brain because they are able to work only in an environmental temperature of 77 to 98.6 degree F. Without sense of taste, the person’s appetite is lost.

, The muscles become inflamed whenever infection is present; as the body secretes inflammatory chemicals as a reaction to infection. This makes the person feel tired and weak.

, The kidneys are located at the back of the abdomen. When it gets inflamed because of infection, pain receptors at the site send pain signals to the brain and it is felt at the back. The pain may be described as sharp, dull or excruciating.

, The kidneys remove waste products from the blood. One of these is a toxic substance called urea. If the kidneys’ function is impaired because of infection, then urea will accumulate in the brain and this can lead to mental changes such as confusion.

, The presence of blood in the urine may be associated with infections that can damage the kidneys and their surrounding structures. A break in a structure can result in the leakage of blood that may be visible in the urine.

, Upon urination, the microorganisms that cause infection may be excreted. These make the urine cloudy and foul-smelling.

, A sharp, dull or excruciating pain may be felt when urinating. This is because the increased pressure in the urinary tract which allows urine flow out of the body, can compress the inflamed areas in the kidneys or its surrounding structures.

, Kidneys control the production of urine. If they are damaged, overproduction may occur and this can lead to increased episodes of urination.

, This procedure is done to determine the presence of infection. A urine sample is collected and is submitted to a laboratory for analysis. The presence of white blood cells and bacteria in the urine suggests infection.

, This is done to identify the type of bacteria that causes the infection. Generally, a part of the urine sample is placed in a tube or dish which contains certain substances that stimulates growth of any bacteria present. Results may be obtained after a few days later once the bacteria has multiplied.

, This is a device that releases wavelengths to produce detailed images of the structures within the urinary tract. The procedure is done by a trained technician and results are interpreted by a radiologist (a doctor that specializes in reading and interpreting medical images).


The test can reveal any obstruction in the urinary tract that could contribute to the development of a kidney infection. This is usually indicated for individuals who do not respond to any treatment within 72 hours.

, A combination of X-ray and computer technology is used in this test to produce a three-dimensional image of the urinary tract to identify any obstruction.


It commonly involves the injection of a special dye (contrast medium) that outlines or highlights the structure being examined. During the procedure, the patient is advised to lie still on a CT scan machine where pictures are taken by a technician.
Images created are also interpreted by a radiologist. This test is typically recommended if patients do not respond to any treatment within 72 hours.

, An image of the bladder and urethra is taken while the bladder is full or during urination or voiding. This can be done in a hospital facility or in an outpatient center by an X-ray technician. Results are interpreted by a radiologist.


The introduction of anesthesia is typically not required although in some cases sedation may be used. A contrast dye is injected until the bladder and the urethra is filled up to make the structures more visible on the x-ray images.
The test may reveal irregularities in the internal structure of the urethra or the bladder.

, This is a physical exam of the prostate which is done in a medical facility. Anesthesia is not required.


During the procedure, the patient is asked to lean over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees near to his chest. The examiner will then insert a gloved and lubricated finger into the rectum and looks for the prostate gland which is located in front of the rectum.
An enlarged prostate may obstruct the bladder which can lead to kidney infection.

, A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the patient’s vein which then moves through the body and into the kidneys. Special cameras and computers are used to generate images of the radioactive material as it travels through the kidneys.


The areas in the kidney where damages are present are highlighted by the radioactive material as seen in the images produced. It can also show the extent of kidney damage such as scarring.
The procedure is done in a medical facility by a technician and results are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not required and since the dose of radioactive material injected is very limited, chances of causing damage to cells are also low.

, These can be given to lower and control the body’s temperature and relieve pain. Examples are paracetamol and aspirin.


They work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandin E2 which causes the cells in the hypothalamus (part of the brain that regulates temperature) to fire at a rapid rate, therefore increasing the body’s temperature.
These medicines also work by blocking specific body chemicals that send pain signals to the brain. For adults, the dosage of paracetamol is usually 500 mg oral tablets every 4 to 6 hours.

, Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to eradicate the cause of infection. One recommended antibiotics is ciprofloxacin.


Ciprofloxacin works by entering the cells of the bacteria and inhibiting the enzyme called DNA-gyrase, which is responsible for replicating and repairing the DNA or genetic material of the bacteria. If this enzyme malfunctions, the bacteria cannot multiply or repair themselves – this eventually kills the bacteria.
The recommended daily oral dose for adults is 500 mg every 12 hours for 1 to 2 weeks.

, This antibiotic works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to create cell walls. The cell walls keep unwanted substances from entering the bacterial cells and stop the contents from leaking out.


Co-amoxiclav weakens the bonds that hold the bacterial cell wall together. As a result, holes appear in cell walls and kill the bacteria.
The recommended daily oral dose for adults is 375 mg tablet every 8 hours or 625 mg tablet every 12 hours for 1 week.

, This is a medical intervention that replaces lost fluids in the body by inserting a sterile needle into the vein, which is connected to a tube and fluid bottle.


If fever is present because of infection, the increased body temperature also increases one’s metabolism. This means that all the biochemical reactions in the body needed to keep us alive speeds up. In order for the body to do this, it needs both water and oxygen.
We are able to breathe faster because the body supplies more oxygen. As you breathe faster, more moisture is expelled along with carbon dioxide. The body makes use of more water, thus resulting in dehydration.
Also, if you have a fever, the increase in temperature causes you to sweat more because the body tries to regulate temperature by making the stored water evaporate through sweat to cool us off. More sweat leads to dehydration.

, Lectin, which is a substance in aloe vera, stimulates the production of macrophages – the cells responsible for fighting foreign bodies by ingesting them. This can help eradicate the cause of kidney infection.


Aloe vera is available in the form of juice which you can drink. 50 ml of aloe vera juice is recommended daily.

, Garlic is known as a natural antibiotic. The active ingredient in garlic called allicin has the ability to stimulate the body’s immune system by stimulating the activity of a type of white blood cell called macrophages which engulf foreign body that causes kidney infections.


For best results, you should eat a clove of garlic every 4 hours.

, Peppermint tea which is brewed from the plant's leaves contains phenolic constituents. Derivatives of phenol called phenolics damage the bacteria’s lipid-containing plasma membranes.


This results in the leakage of the cellular contents of the bacteria. Without those cellular contents, the bacteria cannot survive and eventually dies.
Allow the peppermint leaves to steep in a cup of hot water for about 2 to 3 minutes before drinking. Drink 3 to 4 cups a day.

, Carctol is a mixture of 8 Indian herbs that includes, Hemidesmusindicus, Tribulusterrestris, Piper cubeba, Ammanivesicatoria, Lepidiumsativum, Blepharisedulis, Smilax china and Rheum emodi.


Carctol eliminates acids from the body which results in the creation of an alkaline environment where most infectious agents cannot survive. A standard recommended daily dosage of Carctol for adults is 4 to 8 capsules.
In some cases, carctol can cause constipation so it is recommended that you increase your fluid intake (more than 8 glasses of water a day) while taking it.

, Turmeric contains a powerful antioxidant called curcumin, which inhibits the growth of bacteria and keeps them from binding to the host cells.


Turmeric is available in liquid extract form, of which the recommended dose is 30 to 90 drops per day.

, Water flushes harmful microorganisms out of the body in the form of urine. In case of kidney infection, drinking more than 10 glasses of water each day can help flush out infectious agents that lead to kidney infection.


Also, this will help replace lost fluids. Because of fever, the increased metabolism in the body makes use of more water and the body tries to regulate the temperature inside by making the stored water evaporate through sweat to cool us off.
These all lead to dehydration, thus, drinking more than 10 glasses of water a day is recommended in order to replace the lost fluids.

,


Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C are blackberries, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, grapefruit, lemon, mango, orange, melon, papaya, pineapple, potato, spinach, strawberries, tangerine and tomato.
Eat at least one of these vitamin C-rich foods with each major meal. The recommended daily intake of this vitamin is 65mg.

, Carotenoids - which are a derivative of vitamin A - enhance the activity of the immune system’s cells and improves cell-to-cell communication to easily identify foreign bodies and inhibit their growth.


Foods rich in carotenoids are carrots, sweet potatoes, tomato, pumpkin, cantaloupe, apricots, spinach and broccoli.
The recommended daily intake of vitamin A is 0.9 milligrams daily for men and 0.7 milligrams daily for women.

, An infection is usually associated with weakness and a feeling that you do not want to get out of bed. During sleep, the immune system releases cytokines, which are protein molecules that the cells of the immune system use to send signals to one another.


When you have an infection or inflammation, certain cytokines increases. Cytokines help to fight off infections by aiding the immune system in identifying which specific viral cells or foreign bodies it should be attacking.
It is recommended that you get a proper sleep of at least 8 to 10 hours a night to aid your body in fighting infection.

, To ensure that the body will not receive additional harmful microorganisms that can aggravate the kidney infection, it is vital to check if that your water source is clean and not contaminated. Contaminated water is one of the ways in which an infectious agent can be transmitted. To ensure safety of water supply, the following methods may be used:



Boiling: Water should be brought to a boiling point for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the fire. This ensures that microorganisms in the water are killed.

Chemical Disinfectants: Substances like chlorine and iodine are dissolved in water to remove parasites. However, this does not give 100 percent efficiency, thus filtering or boiling should still be utilized.

Portable Filtration Devices: Contains a pore size of less than 0.5 microns to filter viruses. It should be used in combination with either the boiling method or a chemical disinfectant.

Bottled Water: Alternative to water purification but the seal must be checked for any signs of tampering to ensure water safety.

, To ensure food safety, the following must be done:


Wash hands frequently with antimicrobial soap and clean water.
Avoid eating street foods.
Place food in sealed containers.

However, in 2009 after the publication of several large studies, the US Preventative Services Task Force recommended against teaching women to do consistent and formal self-examinations.These research studies concluded that BSE didn't reduce mortality or increase the number of cancers found.Recommendations by the American Cancer Society and the US Preventative Services Task Force state that BSE should be done at the discretion of women and that they be informed of the limitations of BSE. Perhaps most importantly, these organization stress how important it is that women be aware of what is normal for their breast tissue.
In other words, a BSE does and should not take the place of a physician's examination for detecting abnormalities. However, doing a BSE can help you become more aware of what is normal in your breasts and can help you assist your doctor in detecting changes. BSE should never be seen as a way to replace a clinic breast exam done by a physician.;
, You can do this whenever you like, although it's a good idea to do it after your period, when your breasts are less tender and swollen. Try to do it every month at around the same time. In front of a mirror, sit or stand without a shirt or bra on. Lift and lower your arms. Look for any changes to the size, shape, tenderness, and appearance of your breast tissue, and the area surrounding, especially your underarm or armpit area. These changes may include:Dimpled and puckered skin, like the skin of an orange (known as peau d’orange).
New redness, or a scaly rash.
Unusual breast swelling or tenderness.
Nipple changes, such as retraction, itchiness, or redness.
Nipple discharge, which can be bloody, clear or yellow.

, The ideal time to do a BSE if you are still menstruating is when your breasts are the least tender, so usually a few days after your period ends.You can do the examination either lying down, where the breast tissue is more spread out and thus thinner and easier to feel, or in the shower, where the soap and water can help your fingers move more smoothly over your breast skin.Follow these steps:


Lie flat and place your right hand behind your head. Using the first three fingers of your left hand palpate (feel) the breast tissue on your right breast. Be sure to use the pads of the fingers, not just the very tips.Use three different levels of pressure to feel the tissue at the top under the skin, in the middle of the breast and deeper pressure to feel the tissue close to the chest wall. Make sure to apply each pressure level to each area before moving on.Start at an imaginary line drawn down your side from your underarm and move in an up and down pattern. Start at the collar bone and move downward until you reach your ribs. Move across to the middle of your body until you only feel the sternum (breastbone). It's important to examine the whole breast so try to be a bit methodical in your BSE.Then, reverse this process and put your left hand under your head and perform the same exam on your left breast.
Remember that your breast tissue extends to the area near your armpit. This area of the breast is often called the tail and can also develop lumps or cancer., Know how they look and feel. Establish a familiarity with them and their texture, contours, size, etc. You’ll be better able to communicate changes with your physician.


Advise your partner to communicate any changes they may notice. Your partner may notice differences in your breast tissue that you may have overlooked since they can see your body from a different angle

, Some people have a higher chance of developing breast cancer than others. Be aware, though, that just because you may fall into one or more of these categories, you’re not doomed to have breast cancer; however, it does mean that you should be more aware about your breasts and get regular clinical breast exams and mammograms. Some factors that indicate higher risk include:Gender: Women are more likely to develop breast cancer than men.

Age: Risk increase with age. Most people who have breast cancer are over 45 years old.

Menstruation: If you started menstruating before you were 12 years old, or entered menopause when you were older than 55, your risk is slightly increased.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding: An early pregnancy or multiple pregnancies can both reduce your risk, as does breastfeeding. Having no children or getting pregnant after the age of 30 increases your risk of developing breast cancer.

Lifestyle factors: Obesity, smoking and alcohol use are all risk factors for breast cancer.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Current or previous use may increase the risk for breast cancer. However, this is still being debated with studies coming out regularly for and against, so it's best to have an open discussion with your doctor about personal risks, other options, and monitoring.

, There are also risk factors related specifically to you, your family history, and your genetics, including:



Personal medical history: If you have had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer, there is a risk that the cancer can re-occur in the same or opposite breast.

Family history: You are more likely to develop breast cancer if one or more members of your family have had breast, ovarian, uterine or colon cancer. Your risk is doubled if you have a first-degree relative (sister, mother, daughter) with the disease.

Genes: Genetic defects found on BRCA1 and BRCA 2 can dramatically increase your risk of developing breast cancer. You can opt to find out if you have these genes by contacting a genome mapping service. In general, approximately 5-10% of cases are related to heredity.

, Swelling from a tumor or infection can distort the shape and size of the breast tissue. This change often occurs on only one breast, but may appear to be on both sides., If you are not currently breastfeeding, there should be no discharge coming from the nipple. If there is discharge, especially without squeezing the nipple or breast tissue, seek medical attention for further testing., In particular, look for swelling around the breast, collarbone or armpit. There are aggressive and invasive types of breast cancer that may cause swelling in these areas before you can feel a lump in the breast tissue., Tumors or growths in the breast near the surface of the skin or nipple can cause a change in shape of the tissue.In some instances, the nipple will become inverted or you may notice a dimpling in the skin over the breast tissue.

, Inflammatory breast cancer, though rare, is a particularly invasive and aggressive type of cancer. It may present with symptoms similar to an infection in the breast, such a tissue that is warm, itching or red. If antibiotics do not quickly resolve the issue you should seek the care of a breast surgeon immediately., If you experience pain in your breast tissue or at the nipple area which does not resolve quickly you should seek medical attention. Breast tissue is not normally painful and pain may indicate an infection, growth, or lump or tumor. However, breast pain is not usually a sign of cancer.Keep in mind that if you are still menstruating or pregnant, you may experience temporary breast soreness, discomfort, tenderness as a result of hormone fluctuations. However, if you feel pain and it is persistent and unrelated to your menstrual cycle, you should still consult your doctor., Remember, exhibiting these signs doesn’t necessarily mean you have breast cancer. They’re all good reasons to see a doctor, though, for further investigation. Such symptoms include:


Weight loss.
Bone pain.
Shortness of breath.
Ulceration of the breast, meaning the existence of sores that may be red, itchy, painful and ooze pus or clear fluid.

, When you go in for your yearly physical or pelvic exam, ask your physician to do a manual check of your breasts for any suspicious lumps or other changes. Physicians are trained in how to do a breast exam and will know what to look for. This is why you should never try to replace this exam, though sometimes uncomfortable and awkward, with your own self-examination.Your doctor will begin by checking the appearance of your breasts. You will be asked to raise your arms over your head and then hang them down by your sides while the doctor examines the size and shape of your breasts. You will then undergo a physical examination. While you lie down on the examination table, your doctor will use the pads of their fingers to examine the entire breast area, including the armpits and collarbones. The exam should last for only for a few minutes.If you feel uncomfortable, you can ask for a nurse or family member to be present in the room for the exam. If you’re a female patient seeing a male doctor, this is standard procedure in most cases. If you feel any anxiety, take a deep breath and remind yourself that this is a necessary part of keeping an eye on your health.

, A mammogram is a low-radiation X-ray used to examine breast tissue, and it can often detect lumps before you’re able to feel them.The National Breast Cancer Foundation recommends a screening mammogram every one to two years for women 40 and older. Women who are younger than 40 but who have risk factors for breast cancer should consult with their physician about how often to have mammograms. Even if you have no known risk factors or symptoms, regular mammograms every few years as part of your physical is recommended. In the mammogram, your breast is placed on a platform and compressed with a paddle to even out the breast tissue, hold the tissue still during the x-ray, and allow for the use of a lower-energy x-ray. You’ll feel pressure and may experience some discomfort, but this is just temporary. The will be done on both breasts so the radiologist can compare both sides.
Although the doctor may be looking for potential cancerous growth with a mammogram, the test can also detect calcifications, fibroadenomas and cysts., If you or your physician notice a lump or anything else that raises alarm bells, such as nipple discharge or skin puckering, you may need to undergo additional testing to determine the cause and whether or not you have breast cancer. These tests may includeDiagnostic mammogram: A breast X-ray to evaluate the lump. This may take longer than a screening mammogram because more images will be required.

Ultrasound: Ultrasonic waves are used to produce an image of the breast. Current evidence reports this test is best used in conjunction with a mammogram. Although non-invasive and simple, the ultrasound will have many false positive and false negative results.However, this imaging study is often used with great results to guide a needle biopsy of a suspected tumor.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses magnetic fields to create images of the breast. You may undergo an MRI if the diagnostic mammogram does not rule out a tumor or growth. This imaging technique is also commonly recommended for women who are at very high risk of developing breast cancer, such as those women with a family history or genetic disposition., If the mammogram and MRI detect a tumor or growth, your physician may recommend an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy to determine both the type of cell growth and the surgical procedure or chemotherapy treatment necessary to treat the cancer. In a biopsy, a very small piece of tissue is removed from the suspicious area of the breast and analyzed. This procedure is usually done with a larger needle through numbed skin. Most breast tissue biopsies are outpatient procedures, and you won’t have to stay overnight in a hospital. Only in the case of a surgical biopsy (also known as a lumpectomy) will you be put under local anesthesia.Tissue biopsy is necessary before treatment options are decided in order to determine the nature of the cancer. Though a biopsy may seem and is indeed scary, it is important to know whether the cells in the breast tissue are cancerous and then to decide on a course of treatment. The earlier breast cancer is caught, the greater the survival rate.
It's important (and encouraging!) to note that 80% of women have a breast biopsy do NOT have breast cancer., Waiting for the results of biopsies and scans can be a stressful and anxious time. People cope in different ways. Some like to distract themselves with fun activities and keep busy. Others find it useful to read up on breast cancer and try to learn about all of the options available if the diagnosis is positive. Some people also use the waiting time to reflect on their lives and (re)assess their priorities and relationships.Get plenty of exercise and eat healthily in order to keep your energy and spirits up. Seek social support from friends, colleagues or family members who have experienced similar situations and who may be able to offer insight and suggestions for effective coping.If you find yourself obsessing, feeling overwhelmed, or depressed to the point that your mental and physical well-being is at risk, you should let your health provider know. It can be useful to get in touch with a mental health professional or counselor to talk about what you're feeling as you wait for diagnosis.

Prescription pain medicines may be an option if over-the-counter pain relievers do not work, but is not usually advisable. Ask your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking prescription pain killers.;
, The heat soothes pain and is especially helpful when used in conjunction with pain relievers. If you don’t have a heating pad, make a warm compress by soaking a hand towel in warm water and wringing it out.Heating pads can be bought at your local drugstore.
Make sure you follow instructions on your heating pad to avoid burning your skin.

, Avoid sugar, alcohol, tomatoes, spices, chocolate, caffeine, high-acid foods and artificial sweeteners when you first notice pain or bladder discomfort. These foods may make symptoms worse. , Drinking at least ten glasses of fluids a day helps flush bacteria out of your system.Cranberry juice can increase the acidity of your urine, which can help kill the bacteria. It can also prevent bacteria from sticking to the walls of your bladder so that it can be flushed out.Drinking a lot makes you urinate frequently, which helps get rid of bacteria and dilute urine so going is less painful.Do not drink coffee, tea, or caffeinated beverages, as caffeine can further irritate your bladder.Do not drink cranberry juice if you take blood-thinners because of a possible interaction.Ask your doctor about possible interactions with any antibiotics you are taking before drinking cranberry juice with an active infection., Bacteria thrive in moist, warm environments. Wear cotton underwear and loose pants to circulate air and prevent moisture buildup."

See your doctor.,
Take antibiotics to treat the infection.,
See a specialist for frequent infections.",How to Cope With a Bladder Infection2," Whether this is your first bladder infection or a recurring one, see your health care provider to get a diagnosis. If left untreated, bladder infections could lead to worse conditions, including kidney infection.The most common cause of a bladder infection is bacteria, specifically E. coli, but tests might be necessary to confirm there are no serious contributing factors.If you are male, seeing a doctor is important to rule out an enlarged prostate and other conditions.
Children suffering from this condition must see a doctor right away.

, Ask your health care provider if a course of antibiotics is recommended. Typically these must be taken for 3 days or up to two weeks, depending on the brand and type of antibiotic prescribed.Make sure to complete the entire pack or bottle, even if you start feeling better before you have taken them all.
Misuse (such as not completing the full course of treatment) and overuse of antibiotics both contribute to bacteria evolving to become more resistant to these drugs. The next time these bacteria reappear, they may not respond to the same medicines.Infections may be caused by bacteria other than E. coli, including Staphylococcus, Chlamydia, and Mycoplasma. Only your doctor can determine which bacteria are involved and the type of antibiotic that will best treat it.

, If you have had more than one infection every three months, ask your doctor about the possibility that you are infected with an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Your doctor will perform a urine culture to determine if this is causing your recurring infections. You may also wish to ask for a referral to a urologist to check for interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome (IS/BPS). This is a chronic condition that involves inflammation of the bladder and may need different treatment.IS/BPS may have different causes, including nerve problems, a weak immune system, or genetic defects.
IS/BPS patients may require a low-dose antibiotic taken for up six months to two years."

Practice good hygiene.,
Take extra hygiene precautions if you are sexually active.,
Control stress.,
Drink plenty of fluids and cranberry juice to prevent infections.,
Talk to your doctor about medication.",How to Cope With a Bladder Infection3," Wipe from front to back when using the restroom. Take showers instead of baths, and clean your genitals with mild soap and water..Avoid scented bath products if you have frequent infections, since these may indicate you are hypersensitive to chemicals often found in such products. Avoid using deodorants around these areas of your body.
Change sanitary products frequently.You may also wish to switch from tampons to sanitary pads.

, Women suffer from cystitis more often than men, because their urethra is much shorter. Sexual activity can introduce bacteria into the vagina and cause an infection.


Always urinate directly after intercourse if you suffer from repeat infections. This will help flush any bacteria from your system.It is best to wash your genitals with mild soap and water before and after intercourse.
Avoid scented feminine products and douches. These irritate your body and are unnecessary if you practice good hygiene.
Avoid spermicides and internal birth control devices like diaphragms. Switch to oral birth control if possible.

, Stress may contribute to cystitis. Do something every day to decrease stress in your life, like yoga, meditation, or regular exercise.

Learn yoga and practice it daily.

Start a daily meditation practice.
Find an exercise you enjoy and make time for it everyday. There are so many different types of exercise that can be done inside, outside, or at a class or gym.

, Cranberry juice may be better at preventing an infection than actually treating one.You can also take cranberry tablets or pills as a preventative measure, though you should not take them if you are also taking blood thinners.Drink at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day., If you have frequent bladder infections, your doctor may recommend prophylactic treatment. Your doctor would prescribe you a low dose of antibiotics to take on a daily basis in hopes of preventing future infections."

Recognize abnormal ear itching (pruritis).,
Recognize ear pain (otalgia).,
Check for ear discharge (otorrhea).,
Check for hearing loss.",How to Treat a Fungal Ear Infection1," It is fairly normal for your ears to itch. The hundreds of little hairs on and in your ear can be tickled easily. If your ear itches constantly and scratching/rubbing doesn’t satiate your problem, you might have a fungal infection. This is the primary way that fungal ear infections present themselves., You’ll almost always experience ear pain in one ear — not both, because the fungal infection is local. Sometimes, sufferers describe this as “pressure” or “fullness.” The pain can be mild or severe. Pain usually intensifies the more you touch your ear., Fungal ear discharge is usually thick and can be clear, white, yellow, and sometimes bloody/foul-smelling. Do not confuse this with normal waxy build up. Take a Q-Tip and swab your ear (being careful not to insert the tip into your ear canal). There will be a normal level of waxy buildup, but if either the amount or color seems off, you may have a fungal infection in your ear., A fungal ear infection may present itself in the form of muffled speech/sounds, difficulty understanding words, and trouble hearing consonants. Sometimes, people recognize their hearing loss more by a change in behavior. Frustration brews as a result of one’s inability to hear, so said person withdraws from conversations and social settings."

Understand what tinnitus is.,
Determine your risk factors for tinnitus.,
Take the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory questionnaire.",How to Reduce Tinnitus Naturally1," Tinnitus can range from very loud to very soft sounds, can be loud enough to interfere with normal hearing and be heard in one or both ears.You may hear ringing, buzzing, roaring, clicking or hissing sounds., There are essentially two types of tinnitus: subjective and objective tinnitus.


Subjective tinnitus is the most common form of tinnitus. It can be caused by structural ear problems (in the outer, middle and inner ear) or by problems with the auditory nerve pathways leading from the inner ear to the brain. In subjective tinnitus, you are the only person hearing the sound.
Objective tinnitus is much rarer, but can be perceived by a physician during an examination. This can be caused by vascular problems, muscle contractions or conditions related to the inner ear bone.;
, Tinnitus tends to affect men more often than women. Older people tend to experience tinnitus more than young people. Some of the key risk factors for tinnitus include: Age (the peak age of first experiencing tinnitus is between 60 and 69 years)
Gender
Military service (exposure to loud explosions, gunfire, loud machinery)
Employment in a loud workplace environment
Listening to loud music
Those exposed to any loud noise, either through work or through leisure activities
A history of depression, anxiety and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

, The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, a questionnaire from the American Tinnitus Association may be a good place to start. This questionnaire asks you to assess your level of auditory problems so that you can determine the extent to which tinnitus affects you. This can be a good first step in figuring out how to treat your tinnitus.

Talk with your doctor about other treatment options.",How to Diagnose an Overactive Bladder," If you feel like you need to rush to the restroom and have a sudden urge to urinate, you're experiencing ""urgency incontinence."" It may feel like you can't control your bladder. This is a classic symptom of overactive bladder.Urgency incontinence is different from stress incontinence. In stress incontinence, the urine can leak after a cough, sneeze or sudden pressure on the bladder.;
, Your bladder may be overactive if you urinate frequently, more than 8 times in a 24 hour period.This is especially true if you wake up more than once or twice a night with the need to urinate.Nocturia is a symptom of overactive bladder in which your bladder has a hard time holding urine through the night., The risk for overactive bladder increases as you age, but it isn't considered a normal part of the aging process.Other disorders like diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and stroke are also risk factors for overactive bladder. In general, overactive bladder can be caused by:Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
Nerve damage
Overactive bladder muscles
Other conditions like stroke or multiple sclerosis that affect the nerves controlling the bladder
Side effects of a prescription medication

, If you suspect you might have overactive bladder, keep track of your symptoms. You should log how often you leak urine throughout the day, how often you go to the restroom, and how often you need to urinate throughout the night.


Looking at your log over a several day period can help you determine if you're bladder is overactive. If you think you are, take your log to your doctor.Consider printing off a bladder diary worksheet. This will help you fill in information about what you were doing when you needed to rush to the restroom, whether you accidentally leaked, and how much you drank throughout the day., If you are experiencing any symptoms of overactive bladder, make an appointment with your physician as soon as you can. Since many conditions may cause overactive bladder, your doctor may need to treat an underlying condition.


Your doctor will take a complete medical history, perform a physical exam and will possibly order some lab tests. Your doctor may also ask you to fill out a symptom questionnaire or will want to see the log of your bladder symptoms.

, Your doctor may want to test how your bladder is functioning. You may need a urinalysis, a urine culture (to determine if you have a UTI), an ultrasound (US) scan of your bladder, a cystoscopy (where a narrow tube with a camera attached is inserted into the bladder) and possibly some blood testing.


These tests can determine if you have a bacterial infection causing the overactive bladder. Initial testing will tell your doctor how to proceed with treatment., If your doctor suspects that nerve damage is causing your overactive bladder, you may need to see a neurologist. The neurologist will be able to perform other specialized tests so you have a full diagnosis. Specialized tests can help rule out other causes of incontinence.These tests can determine whether your bladder is completely emptying when you urinate, how fast your urine flows, and whether muscle contractions or stiff muscles cause the incontinence., Overactive bladder is usually treated by training your bladder and reducing your chances of incontinence accidents. Your doctor will recommend that you regulate your fluid intake. For example, you might need to schedule bathroom breaks and plan when to drink beverages.


Avoid caffeine, alcohol, carbonated beverages and spicy foods. These can make your symptoms worse., Practice double voiding. To do this, wait a few minutes after you urinate and then try to urinate again. This can fully empty your bladder and reduce your risk of bladder infection. If you're having trouble completely emptying your bladder, ask your doctor about using a catheter every once in a while.If you're still leaking often, consider wearing bladder control underwear or absorbent pads.

, Train your muscles to hold urine more effectively. You can progressively train your muscles by delaying urination for longer and longer amounts of time. You should also do kegel exercises to strengthen muscles that control urine flow. Spend at least 6 to 8 weeks exercising these muscles in order to see results.To practice kegels, contract the muscles that control the flow of urine. Once you've identified them, you can tighten and release these muscles regardless of where you're at or what you're doing. Hold the muscles for 5 seconds and release for 5 seconds. Repeat this at least 4 or 5 times., If changing lifestyle habits and exercise isn't relieving your incontinence, talk with your doctor about prescribing medication to relax your bladder. Be aware that there are common side effects with these (like dry eyes, dry mouth, and constipation. Common medications for overactive bladder include:Tolterodine
Oxybutynin as a skin patch
Oxybutynin gel
Trospium
Solifenacin
Darifenacin
Mirabegron
Fesoterodine

, If you're still struggling with incontinence, your doctor may recommend injecting onabotulinumtoxinA (botox) into your bladder tissue. This might stop the nerves from contracting (which may be causing your incontinence.Surgery is also an option for people with severe symptoms who aren't getting relief from other treatments. Surgery is done to remove the bladder or expand its capacity."

Know the symptoms.,
Yawn and swallow.,
Exert counter pressure.,

Keep your child awake.,
Encourage your child to swallow.,
Fake yawn to encourage yawning.,
Consider rescheduling travel if your child is sick.,
See your doctor about ear drops.,
Wait for equilibrium to be restored.,
Look out for severe symptoms.,
Get treatment if the barotrauma persists.",How to Prevent Your Ears from Popping," Whenever the air pressure around you changes, such as when you're flying in an airplane, climbing to or descending from a high altitude, or diving underwater, the pressure in the cavity inside your ear is supposed to change with it. When the pressure change is quite sudden, however, the pressure inside the ear doesn't always catch up right away. This difference in pressure between the ear cavity and the outside environment, called barotrauma, leads to uncomfortable and even painful symptoms, like the following:Pain or discomfort in the ear
A feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear
Ringing in the ear (tinnitus)
A change in hearing, almost as if you are submerged in water and sounds are muffled
In severe cases, hearing loss, bleeding and vomiting;
, To prevent your ear from popping uncomfortably or painfully, you need to stop the difference in pressure from building up. You can do this by yawning and swallowing, actions that open the Eustachian tubes in your ears, allowing the pressure in your ear to sync up with the pressure in your environment.


You can also help yourself swallow by chewing gum, sucking on candy, or nursing a drink, all of which will keep you swallowing.

, You can do this by performing a simple exercise: close your mouth, pinch your nose, and blow gently. The air has no where to go, so it presses on your Eustachian tubes, which relieves pressure. Do not blow too hard when you attempt this. If you blow too hard, the maneuver is quite painful, and has the potential to actually damage your ear drums. Blow just hard enough to gently pop your ears.
Repeat the maneuver several times, especially during takeoff or descent while traveling by plane.

, These earplugs are specially designed to gradually equalize the pressure as you gain elevation or descend, so that pressure does not build up in your ears.


Filtered earplugs are available at drugstores and in airport shops.While they're not guaranteed to be effective, they can help minimize ear popping while you travel.

, Barotrauma happens more often when you have a head cold, sinus infection or any type of congestion. That's because the Eustachian tube doesn't always open properly when it's inflamed due to allergies or a cold. If you're feeling stuffy before changing altitudes or diving, use a nasal decongestant or antihistamine in preparation.


Take a decongestant, such as Sudafed, every six hours and continue for 24 hours after you land to shrink membranes in the sinus and ear. Follow the precautions on the label.You can use a pediatric-strength nasal spray as directed on the packaging. The child-strength formula will help open your Eustachian tubes without giving you a stronger dose of medication than you need.
Do not take decongestants before or during diving. The body metabolizes decongestants differently while underwater, so taking them before diving is considered risky.
If your congestion is quite bad, you might want to reconsider your travel or diving plans and reschedule for when you're feeling better, especially if you've had severe barotrauma in the past., While you might be tempted to lull your child to sleep before airplane ascent or descent, if she is awake you can help her prevent barotrauma from happening. Keep her occupied so she doesn't end up falling asleep right when the cabin pressure changes. Try people watching, or read a book together.
Be sure that you prepare a young child for the loud sounds and bumpy process of takeoff and landing, so that she does not become frightened. While you can't warn a young baby, you can try other methods of comfort, smiling and saying soothing words to let her know everything is alright.

, Giving your toddler, baby or child something to suck on is a good way to encourage swallowing. Have him swallow throughout the ascent and descent, or if he seems to be complaining that his ears are bothering him.


Nursing works great for young babies if you breastfeed. If not, try a pacifier or bottle.
An older kid can drink through a sippy cup or a straw, or suck on a lollipop. The key is to get him to actively suck and swallow, so if he is old enough, teach him how to consciously do this in advance so that you can prompt him when it is time.

, While no one really knows why, yawning is socially contagious, so if your child sees you fake a yawn, she is likely to actually yawn in response.

Yawning opens the Eustachian tubes in your child's ears, so that the pressure that has built up will equalize with the rest of the cabin.

, This is especially true if your child has experienced severe barotrauma in the past.Young children generally should not be given decongestants, so if your child has a stuffy nose or sinus infection, it might be a good idea to reschedule your flight to avoid severe barotrauma. Plus, you can avoid exposing other passengers to the illness.
If your child has flown before and did not exhibit signs of extreme discomfort, its not necessary to reschedule your flight.

, Prescription eardrops can numb the area so kids don't experience pain and discomfort when this happens. While this is a rather extreme measure, if your child seems to be especially sensitive to popping ears, this may be the right solution.

, If your ears pop on a plane or while diving, the problem will usually right itself when you're back on land.


Even if the pressure doesn't equalize right away, after an hour or two your ears should feel normal again. In the meantime, yawning and swallowing can help you feel better faster.
Some people take a few days for pressure to equalize in their ears, during which time hearing can be muffled, although this is rather rare.

, Get medical attention if the discomfort is severe, or if it persists for more than a day. Severe barotrauma is rare, but can cause permanent ear damage and bring about hearing loss. In very severe cases, barotrauma can cause the inner ear to rupture. This injury usually heals on its own, but you should see a doctor just in case there's another problem complicating the injury. If you experience any of the following symptoms that might indicate your inner ear has ruptured, get medical attention immediately:Discomfort or pain that persists for several hours
Severe pain
Bleeding from the ears
Hearing loss that doesn't go away

, In rare cases, surgery is required to restore equilibrium inside the ear. An incision is made in the eardrum to allow pressure and fluid to drain.If you experience severe pain that doesn't go away, see a doctor to determine whether surgery may be necessary.


In the meantime, do not fly, dive, or perform any other activity that requires you to gain or lose significant altitude. If your ears pop again further injury could occur.

Let the bug make its way out on its own.,
Flush the ear with warm water with a dropper or a bulb syringe.,
Use mineral oil to kill the bug.,
Go to a doctor for suction.,
Inspect the bug for missing parts.,
Take it easy.,
Watch for signs of infection.,
Follow up with a doctor.",How to Remove a Bug from Your Ear," Your ears can be sensitive for many reasons. They can be tender because of allergies or weather changes. If you have a bug in your ear, you may experience pain, swelling, blood, and crackling. You may even feel biting or stinging. You may also experience hearing loss or dizziness.;
, While a bug in the ear may be scary, it is best to stay calm in this situation. Being too active may lodge the bug further in your ear or cause it to crawl further back, or cause damage to the sensitive inner ear or eardrum.








, You do not want to jam the bug further in your ear or risk accidentally hurting yourself further. There are a lot of nerve endings in the ear. You can damage these nerves by using tools such as cotton swabs or tweezers. Do not try and pry the bug out. 







, If the bug has crawled all the way against your eardrum, you may want to consider a trip to your doctor to remove it. Have someone shine a flashlight or a lighted magnifying glass in your ear to attempt to locate and identify the creature. This can help to diagnose the bug's location as well as the type of bug.








, To set up for removal, you want to get into a comfortable position. This might be sitting somewhere comfortable with your head tilted to the side so that you or a friend can easily access the ear. You might find it comfortable to lay on your side with your ear facing the ceiling.








, One way to try to remove a bug in your ear is to use gravity. Tilt your ear toward the ground and attempt to wiggle your ear. Grasp the pinna (outside of the ear) and give it a wiggle. If the bug is not too far into your ear canal, it may fall out on its own.








, If the bug is still alive and is not too far inside of the ear canal, it may simply come out on its own. If you stay calm and keep objects (like fingers) away from your ears, there is a chance that the bug will find its way back out of your ear.








, Hold your head upright and stretch the ear canal by pulling the outer ear. Put a steady stream of warm water into your ear. Tilt your head to the side to drain out your ear. Do not irrigate your ear if you think your ear drum has been ruptured to avoid causing additional damage.








, Use a drop or two of mineral, baby, or olive oil inside your ear canal to kill the insect. This can help you to avoid stinging or eardrum rupture from scratching or biting. 







, A doctor or medical professional can use a special suction device, commonly used to remove ear wax, to attempt to remove the bug. This may be dangerous to try on your own, so make sure you visit an emergency room or urgent care clinic an allow a professional to remove the bug for you.








, Make sure that you have removed the entire bug from your ear. If you missed any parts, it may cause further problems such as an ear infection. Carefully inspect whatever objects you remove from your ears.








, Removing a live animal from your ear is a stressful procedure. Flushing or suctioning your ears may also cause slight dizziness due to stress on the middle ear. Avoid standing up too quickly and strenuous exercise for at least a day after the procedure.








, The bug may have caused damage in your ear before it was completely removed. Signs of an ear infection include swelling, dizziness, hearing loss, fever, and pain. 







, If you are unsure if you have removed all of the insect, or you are worried about infection, make an appointment with your family physician to make sure you are completely healthy. They may refer you to a Otolaryngologist, an ear specialist, for follow up diagnostics.

To help you not have to do this at work, consider getting up 20 to 30 minutes earlier than you would normally in order to make time to have a bowel movement before you go to work.


This can help you feel better about having it over with early in the day and relieve any stress about the possibility of having to have a bowel movement at work.;
, When you have IBS, there may be times when you need to be away from your desk in order to have a bowel movement. You should tell your boss, supervisor, or human resources department about your condition. Most people will be understanding since it is a medical condition you can’t help.


Explain that you’ll be gone from your area of work from time to time.
If you have to, you can work out a cover schedule with a few trusted coworkers so your work area is covered when you have to leave.
If your boss or supervisor does not believe you, you can get your doctor to write a note explaining your condition and the symptoms that require the special treatment.
If you can, try to arrange your work hours around your IBS patterns. Even ask your boss if possibility of working some days at home., If you have IBS, you may need to get to the bathroom in a hurry. To make it easier at work, ask your boss or supervisor to move your desk closer to the bathroom. This will help you get there faster.


If your desk is close to the bathroom and you don't have to walk across the department or past all your co-workers, it's less likely you'll be stopped on your way to the bathroom., You may need to take your medication or supplements at work. You may also have diarrhea or an accident at work. You should have wet wipes to clean up or an extra change of clothes to be prepared for anything.


This will make you feel less self-conscious in case something happens at work., Stress plays a major role in aggravating your IBS. This can be problematic when you are at work, because your job may be a major point of stress. You need to learn to cope with the stress of your work to help cope with your IBS while you are there. There are many different types of stress management that you can undertake, with or without the help of a counselor. These stress techniques include:Mental health methods, such as behavioral therapy, hypnosis, or psychotherapy

Deep breathing techniques
Meditation

Tai chi or yoga

Additional lifestyle changes (Eating small frequent meals, weight loss, making dietary changes by avoiding foods that trigger symptoms)

Know when to consult your doctor.,
Use clotrimazole to treat fungal infections in the ear.,
Get a prescription for fluconazole (Diflucan).,
Avoid antibiotics.,
Follow up with your physician.",How to Treat a Fungal Ear Infection2," When you have an ear infection, it is best to visit your doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and to find out the best course of treatment. If you are experiencing intense pain, losing your hearing ability, or experiencing any other unusual symptoms, you should seek professional help.Your doctor can clean your ear canal thoroughly with a suction device and provide medications to treat your ear infection.
Your doctor may also recommend over-the-counter medications for pain or prescribe a medication if the pain is severe., Clotrimazole 1% solution is the most popular antifungal medicine that doctors prescribe for the treatment of fungal ear infections. It kills both Candida and Aspergillus. This drug works by inhibiting the enzyme used to convert ergosterol. Ergosterol is needed by the fungus to maintain the integrity of its membrane. With clotrimazole, the fungal growth is inhibited by depleting levels of ergosterol.Keep clotrimazole’s side-effects in mind. These may be ear irritation, burning, or discomfort.However, side effects are not as common with the topical forms of clotrimazole as with the oral form.
To use clotrimazole, wash your hands with running water and mild soap. Clean the ear with warm water until any visible secretions are gone. Softly pat the ear dry with a clean cloth. Do not vigorously wipe the remaining liquid off. Doing so can exacerbate the condition.Lie down or tilt your head sideways to expose the ear canal. Straighten your ear canal by pulling your earlobe downward, then backward. Apply two to three drops of clotrimazole into your ear. Keep your ear tilted for two to three minutes to allow the solution to reach the infected area. And then tip your head, pouring out the medicine into a napkin.Replace the cap to the bottle and store the medication out of sight and reach of children. Store it in a dry and cool place. Avoid direct sunlight or heat.If clotrimazole does not get rid of your ear infection, then your doctor may decide to try a different antifungal agent, such as miconazole., If you have a more severe fungal ear infection, fluconazole may be prescribed by your doctor. It works just like clotrimazole. The most common side effects are a headache, nausea, dizziness, change in taste, loose stools, abdominal pain, skin rash, and elevation of liver enzymes.Fluconazole is taken in tablet form. Doctors normally prescribe one dose of 200mg for one day and then 100mg daily for three to five days., Antibiotics are only effective in the treatment of bacterial infections, so they will not combat fungal infections.


Antibiotics can even worsen fungal infections since they can potentially kill good bacteria residing in the ear or other parts of the body — the bacteria that is fighting your fungal infection., You will need to see your physician again in a week or so to see if the treatment is working. If the treatment is not working, then your doctor may try a different option.


Also, make sure to call your physician if your symptoms get worse or do not improve.

Apply a warm compress to the affected ear.,
Use rubbing alcohol and apple cider vinegar.,
Eat foods rich in vitamin C. Vitamin C is needed for the growth and repair of tissues damaged by a fungal ear infection.,
Use garlic oil.,
Use olive oil to clean the ear.",How to Treat a Fungal Ear Infection3," Add two to three drops to the infected ear with a medicine dropper. Let the drops sit in the ear canal for five to 10 minutes and tilt your head to let them drain. This measure will help soften any crusted or hardened debris in the ear canal, which will, in turn, help wash any fungal colonies out of your ear., Turn it on to the lowest setting possible and place its end at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) from the infected ear. This method will dry any moisture present in the ear canal, which will hinder the growth of fungus.Be very careful not to burn yourself.

, Get a clean towel and soak it in warm water. Ensure that the towel is not too hot. Place the warm towel over the infected ear and wait until it cools down. The measure helps relieve pain, without having to take pain-relieving drugs. It also increases blood flow to the infected area, which leads to faster recovery., Mix both in a 1:1 ratio. With a medicine dropper, add a few drops to the infected ear. Let the drops sit in the ear for 10 minutes and tilt your head to let them drain. The mixture can be utilized every four hours for up to two weeks.


The rubbing alcohol is a drying agent, which will get rid of moisture in the ear canal causing the fungal infection. It also disinfects the skin of the ear canal. The acidity of vinegar slows the growth of the fungus, as Candida and Aspergillus prefer a ""basic"" environment for optimal growth.This mixture will disinfect and dry out the ear, lessening the duration of the infection., It helps the body produce collagen, a protein instrumental in making tissues like skin, cartilage, and blood vessels. Doctors recommend supplements of 500 to 1,000 mg of vitamin C per day with food.


Excellent dietary sources of vitamin include citrus fruit (oranges, limes, lemons), berries (blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, raspberries), pineapples, watermelon, papaya, broccoli, spinach, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower., Take a capsule of garlic oil, puncture it, and pour it into the infected ear. Let it sit for 10 minutes and tilt your head to drain the oil. It can be repeated daily for up to two weeks. In studies, garlic oil has been found to have antifungal effects on Aspergillus (one of two main causes of fungal ear infections).


Furthermore, garlic oil has been found to have similar or better rates of cure when compared to prescription medications used to treat fungal ear infection., If you have a fungal infection, there will be whitish or yellowish secretions from the ear. In addition to this, there will also be an overproduction of wax. All these can cause blockage in the eustachian tube. Olive oil is a perfect wax softener.


With a medicine dropper, add three drops to the infected ear. Let the drops sit in the ear canal for five to 10 minutes and tilt your head to let them drain. It will soften earwax (cerumen) and any other hardened secretions in the ear canal and facilitate its removal (much like hydrogen peroxide). Olive oil also has properties to decrease the inflammation associated with fungal ear infections. The anti-inflammatory properties of olive oil are mediated by high levels of polyphenols present in the oil."

In general, these tests are not invasive or painful, but may cause some discomfort. You may experience changes in the bones of the inner ear that can be genetically based. The inner ear includes three very small bones: the malleus, the incus and the stapes. These three bones are connected to each other and to the eardrum (tympanic membrane). They are also connected to the structures that translate sound vibrations into nerve impulses that we perceive as sound. If these bones are not able to move freely because of otosclerosis, tinnitus can result.
You may also have excessive earwax, which can cause tinnitus.

, Unfortunately, many times the exact cause of tinnitus cannot be determined. Many times, it may simply be due to aging, such as the following conditions:Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis)
Menopause: Tinnitus is one of the rarer symptoms of menopause and it may be actually due to age rather than the menopausal transition. Often, the tinnitus disappears along with other menopausal issues. Hormone replacement therapy with synthetic progestins has been associated with increased tinnitus., If you work in a constantly loud environment, or you have been exposed to loud noises, be sure to mention this to your doctor. This will help him diagnose your condition.

, Many disorders that impact blood flow can cause tinnitus. Talk to your doctor about the following disorders:


Head and neck tumors that press on blood vessels and change the blood flow
Atherosclerosis or the build-up of cholesterol-containing plaques on the insides of arteries
High blood pressure
Anatomical variations in the carotid artery in the neck that can cause turbulence in blood flow
Malformed capillaries (arteriovenous malformation)

, Many medications can cause or exacerbate tinnitus. Some of these medications can include:


Aspirin
Antibiotics, such as polymyxin B, erythromycin, vancomycin and neomycin
Diuretics (water pills), including bumetanide, ethacrynic acid and furosemide
Quinine
Some anti-depressants
Chemotherapeutics, including mechlorethamine and vincristine

, Tinnitus can be caused by many different conditions, so be sure to get your doctor’s opinion on whether you have any of the following conditions:


Meniere’s disease: This is an inner ear disorder caused by increased inner ear fluid pressure
Temperomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders
Head and neck injuries
Benign tumors including acoustic neuromas: These usually only cause one-sided tinnitus
Hypothyroidism: Low thyroid hormone levels

, If you get the symptoms of tinnitus after an upper respiratory infection (URI), suddenly and without any known cause, or you experience dizziness or hearing loss along with the tinnitus, make an appointment to see a physician right away.


See your regular physician first. He may refer you to a specialist such as an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist (ENT specialist or otolaryngologist).
Tinnitus can cause other problems, including fatigue, stress, insomnia, difficulties with concentrating and with memory, depression and irritability. If you are experiencing any of these, make sure to mention these to the doctor.

, Treatment for tinnitus will depend to a large extent on the discovery of an underlying cause, but may include the following:Earwax removal.
Treating underlying conditions: Examples of this might include treating high blood pressure or atherosclerosis.
Changing medications: If your tinnitus is due to a reaction to a specific medication, your doctor may change the medication or change the dose.
Try medications specifically for tinnitus: While there is no specific drug to treat tinnitus, some medications have been used with some success. These include antidepressants and antianxiety drugs. These, however, are also associated with a number of side effects including dry mouth, blurry vision, constipation, heart problems, drowsiness and nausea.

, Hearing aids may be useful for some people. Your physician might recommend a hearing aid after you have been examined by a licensed audiologist.According to the American Tinnitus Association, “hearing loss causes less external sound stimuli to reach the brain. In response, the brain undergoes neuroplastic changes in how it processes different sound frequencies. Tinnitus is the product of these maladaptive neuroplastic changes.”Essentially, this means that with progressive hearing loss, the brain tries to adapt. But sometimes, that adaptation doesn’t work and tinnitus is the result. In general, the hearing loss is often at and above the frequency of the tinnitus itself."

Use calming background sound.,
Listen to soothing sounds as you fall asleep.,
Try listening to brown or pink noise.,
Avoid loud noises.,
Look into music therapy.",How to Reduce Tinnitus Naturally3," Mask the noise in your ears by turning on background music or other sounds.You can use tapes or CDs with “white noise” of the ocean, a babbling brook, rainfall, soft music or whatever works to help block out and cover up the sounds in your ears.

, White noise or other soothing sounds can also be used to help you sleep. This can be important, as many people find it difficult to sleep with tinnitus. At night, the sound in your ears can become the only sound audible and can make it hard to fall asleep. Background noise can serve to provide a peaceful sound to help you sleep.

, “Brown noise” is a collection of randomly generated sounds and is generally perceived as much deeper sounds than white noise.“Pink noise” uses lower frequencies and is also perceived as deeper sounds than white noise. Either pink or brown noise is often recommended to help with sleep.Find examples online of both pink and brown noise. Choose the noise that sounds best to you.

, One of the most common triggers for tinnitus is the presence of loud noises.Avoid these as much as possible. Some people may not be affected by loud noises. But if you do experience worsening or aggravated tinnitus after hearing loud noises, you’ll know that this may be a trigger for you.

, A German study involving music therapy in tinnitus showed that music therapy employed in early cases of tinnitus can prevent that tinnitus turns into a chronic condition.This therapy involves listening to your favorite music with its frequency altered to center on the same frequency as the ringing in your ears."

Get a chiropractic adjustment.,
Visit an acupuncturist.,
Ask your doctor about aldosterone.,
Try personalized sound frequency treatments.",How to Reduce Tinnitus Naturally4," Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems, which can cause tinnitus, can be successfully treated with chiropractic approaches,, TMJ problems are thought to promote tinnitus because of the proximity of muscles and ligaments that attach to the jaw and the hearing bones. A chiropractic treatment would consist of manual manipulation in order to re-align the TMJ. The chiropractor might also manipulate the vertebrae of the neck in order to decrease the symptoms of tinnitus. Chiropractic adjustments are not painful, but they may cause some temporary discomfort. The chiropractic treatment may also include the application of heat or ice and specific exercises.Chiropractic treatments can also help with Meniere’s disease, another relatively rarer cause of tinnitus., A recent review of studies of the success of acupuncture for tinnitus concluded that there was some cause for hope. Acupuncture techniques would vary based on the underlying cause for the tinnitus. These techniques also often include traditional Chinese herbs.More studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture on improving tinnitus.

, Aldosterone is a hormone found in the adrenal gland that regulates sodium and potassium in the blood.One study found a tinnitus patient with hearing loss to have an aldosterone deficiency. When the patient received bioidentical aldosterone, the patient's hearing was restored and the tinnitus went away. , There is a relatively new approach that may be useful for some. The idea is to find the frequency of the particular sound in your ears and masking that specific frequency with specially designed sounds.


Your ENT or audiologist may have recommendations about these treatments.
You may also find these treatments available online for a fee through websites such as Audionotch and Tinnitracks. These services walk you through testing for the specific frequency of your tinnitus and design a treatment protocol.
There have been limited studies on this approach, but they do appear promising. "

Take CoQ10.,
Try ginkgo biloba supplements.,
Increase your intake of zinc.,
Try melatonin supplements.",How to Reduce Tinnitus Naturally5," Your body uses CoQ10, or coenzyme Q10, for cell growth and maintenance. It is also an antioxidant. CoQ10 can also be found in organ meats, such as heart, liver and kidney.One study indicated that CoQ10 supplements could be helpful for some patients with a low serum level of CoQ10.
Try taking 100 mg three times a day., Ginkgo biloba is believed to increase blood flow to the brain and has been used to treat tinnitus with variable results. This is likely because tinnitus has many known and unknown causes.


A recent review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of ginkgo biloba to treat tinnitus.Another recent report, on the other hand, concluded that a standardized extract of ginkgo, EGb 761, was an effective treatment.EGb 761 is a “standardised extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves and has antioxidant properties as a free radical scavenger. A standardised extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves is a well-defined product and contains approximately 24% flavone glycosides (primarily quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin) and 6% terpene lactones (2.8-3.4% ginkgolides A, B and C, and 2.6-3.2% bilobalide).” Commercially, this particular supplement is sold as Tebonin Egb 761.
Follow manufacturer’s instructions if taking this supplement.

, In one study, almost half of tinnitus patients improved with 50 milligrams (mg) of zinc daily for 2 months. This is actually a rather high dose of zinc. The recommended daily intake of adult males is 11 mg and for females, the recommended dose is 8 mg.


Don’t take this amount of zinc without talking to a knowledgeable healthcare professional first.
If you do take this high amount of zinc, don’t take it longer than 2 months.
Balance your intake of zinc with copper supplements. A high intake of zinc is associated with copper deficiency and copper-deficiency anemias and taking the extra copper will help prevent that.Take 2 mg of copper every day.

, Melatonin is a hormone that is involved in the sleep cycle. One study indicated that 3 mg of melatonin taken at night was most effective in men without a history of depression and those with tinnitus in both ears."

Most problems that negatively affect hearing are benign and reversible, so don't be scared to seek professional opinions.


Don't try to self diagnose or get an unqualified friend or family member to dig in your ears.
Your healthcare professional may refer you to an ear specialist for further examination.;
, An ear specialist (otolaryngologist) or audiologist can conduct a more thorough ear exam, including a hearing or audiometric test, which evaluates the ability of sound to reach the brain. This is a relatively quick and painless test and vital to understanding if your hearing issue is permanent or not.


The otolaryngologist will be able to tell you if your problem is related to SNHL or CHL.

, Make sure you get the doctor to explain the diagnosis clearly and provide you with various treatment options. If your problem is SNHL, then treatment will likely be forthcoming from an otolaryngologist. However, if you problem is CHL, then you have many more treatment options, possibly including some simple and safe home remedies depending on the cause.


Researching hearing loss on the internet will give you an idea of potential treatments, especially for CHL, but always stick to reputable medical sites.

, Although you can't attain normal hearing via natural ways or home remedies if you suffer from SNHL, advances in medicine and technology can certainly help your situation.


SNHL is the most common type of hearing loss among Americans, occurring in 23% of the population older than 65 years.Excessive noise exposure is the most common cause of SNHL (particularly high frequency hearing loss) and it affects about 15% of Americans aged 20 to 69., A hearing aid is a small electronic device that is worn in or behind the ear. They make some sounds louder by magnifying sound vibrations entering the ear. A hearing aid has three main parts: it receives sound through a microphone, which converts sounds into electrical signals and sends them to an amplifier, which amplifies them and sends them to the cochlea through a tiny speaker. The sounds then cause little hairs to move within the cochlea, which stimulate nerves to send messages to the hearing center of the brain.


These days, hearing aids are quite small and hardly noticeable, so there's no need to be overly self-conscious if they are your best option.
Hearing aids can work a little differently depending on their electronics, which are either analog or digital.

, If the hairs within your cochlea are too damaged due to an infection, tumor or head injury, then a hearing aid will not be of much use. Instead, you will need an invasive operation called a cochlear implant in order to regain functional hearing, which is an electronic medical device that does the work of the damaged cochlea to provide sound signals to the brain.


A cochlear implant is significantly more expensive than a hearing aid.

, There are a variety of other technologies based on electronic amplification, electromagnetic energy transmission, radio signals or infrared waves that are designed to enhance sound either on their own or work in conjunction with a hearing aid or cochlear implant.

, Surgery may be needed to drain an inner ear infection, remove a tumor or reshape a genetic malformation in order to help restore hearing loss. Keep in mind that any surgical procedure carries risks, so be well informed before choosing this route.

, Blockage by earwax or other debris is a common cause of CHL. Earwax is healthy in small amounts and has protective, lubricating and antibacterial properties. Most of the time the ear canals are self-cleaning, but sometimes they become clogged or impacted, which causes partial hearing loss in addition to sensations of ear fullness, itchiness or ringing (tinnitus). Cotton-tipped applicators are not recommended for cleaning deep into the ear canal, so consider safer methods such as placing a few drops of mineral oil, baby oil or glycerin into your clogged ear.Hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide drops may also safely dissolve earwax, although they will likely cause a benign stinging or burning sensation for a few minutes.
Irrigation or ear syringing can be performed by a physician or at home using widely available and inexpensive irrigation kits. Make sure to use a warm saline solution for best results.
A procedure called ear candling is not recommended by doctors to clean ear canals due to risks of burning and eardrum perforation.

, The common cold, sinusitis and allergies can clog the eustachian tubes (which connect the middle ear with the upper throat and nasal cavity) with fluid and mucous, leading to ear pain, popping sensations and reduced hearing. Blocked eustachian tubes often get better without attention, but to accelerate their clearing try closing your mouth and holding your nose, then gently blow as if you are blowing your nose.


Yawning or chewing gum also may help unclog eustachian tubes.
You may feel a ""pop"" when the tubes open up, which signifies equal pressure between the inside and outside of your ears.

, Antibiotics destroy or inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as the pathogenic bacteria that can cause inner and middle ear infections. If your doctor diagnoses you with an ear infection, then an antibiotic such as amoxicillin might be helpful and help restore your hearing.


Keep in mind that some oral antibiotics, such as erythromycin and tetracycline, can also cause hearing loss.

, If you don't suffer from either SNHL or CHL, but simply want to improve your hearing then engage in regular cardiovascular exercise because it helps with blood circulation and fine tuning within the ear ., Play music at relatively low volumes while having a conversation with a friend. Add a second source of music and then a third source while continuously focusing on the conversation. This will train your ears to filter out ambient sounds.

, Close your eyes and ask a friend to walk to a location of their choosing somewhere away from you, perhaps 6 metres (20 ft) away or more. Have your partner make two-second bursts of sound with a horn or bell and then point to where you think the sound came from. Have your friend change their direction and distance each time.

, Close your eyes and listen to all the different sounds in your environment. One by one, try to decipher individual sounds that you hear, both near and far away. The more you practice, the more sounds you will learn to recognize., Examples include CLIX (based on identifying differences between words), Forbrain (based on recognizing pertinent sounds in voices), and Category Carousel (based on associating sounds with images)., Examples of such food include cold-water fish (herring, salmon, trout), most nuts, seeds and whole grains, and virtually all fresh vegetables and fruits.Antioxidants combat aging throughout the body and include vitamins A, C and E. Antioxidants neutralize oxygen radicals that build up in the body and cause damage.
Vitamin B3 (niacin) promotes blood circulation to the ear (and throughout the body) by slightly expanding small blood vessels, whereas B6 (pyridoxamine) is needed for healthy nerve function.
Poor vitamin B12 and folate (vitamin B9) status may be associated with age-related auditory dysfunction, so make sure your levels are adequate via food sources or supplements., In addition to adding certain foods for health benefits, removing certain foods from your diet may yield health results and better hearing also.


A diet high in saturated animal fat is linked to high blood cholesterol levels, which may increase your risk of clogged arteries. Your ears need proper blood flow to perform well.
Consuming high levels of salt may increase fluid retention in your ears.

, Heavy metals are toxic to nerves (especially small ones like those which innervate the inner ear) and ultimately destroy them. The body can't rid itself of heavy metals very well, so they build up with time and become more dangerous.


Foods relatively high in mercury tend to be fish such as shark, swordfish, tilefish and king mackerel.

, Although you can't reverse SNHL, you can take steps to keep it from getting worse. For example, reduce your exposure to loud and sustained noises and wear earplugs if exposure is unavoidable.


Reconsider going to rock concerts or sporting events such as car racing.
Turn down the volume on you MP3 device while listening to your favorite music.

, Never stick a sharp object into your ear! Sticking a pin, pencil, knife or other sharp object into your ear may perforate your eardrum and lead to permanent hearing loss.

A perforated eardrum may be accompanied by pain, dizziness, and a ringing in your ears., Although some medications are clearly life saving and needed on a regular basis, others that deal with minor symptoms such as headaches may be negatively impacting your hearing.


Salicylates such as aspirin have been shown to disrupt electrical current in the inner ear.Medicines used to treat high blood pressure and cancer also create a higher risk of hearing loss.
Some chemotherapy drugs can even cause permanent hearing loss. These drugs include cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and nitrogen mustard.
High doses of aspirin can cause temporary hearing loss.Antimalarial medications such as quinine and chloroquine can also cause temporary sensorineural hearing loss., Don't let your cold, flu, sinus infection or allergies get out of control (or become chronic / recurring) such that it impacts your ears and reduces your hearing. Keep your immune system strong so that it can naturally fight off infections.


Getting lots of sleep, drinking lots of water, controlling your stress and eating nutritious food all positively impact your immune system.
Some serious health conditions, such as diabetes, may lead to hearing loss as well. If you have diabetes, do what you can to keep it under control and seek immediate medical attention if you start having ear pain. This may be a sign of a condition called necrotizing external otitis, which can lead to hearing loss and even death."

Check with your private insurance company.,
Investigate your Medicare options.,
Check with the VA. United States veterans are entitled to hearing aids if their hearing loss is connected to their military service.,
Look in to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan.",How to Afford a Hearing Aid1," Unfortunately, most private insurance companies do not cover the cost of a hearing aid. However, you should always double-check with your company before assuming that this is the case. Furthermore, three states--New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Arkansas—now require companies to cover some or all of these costs.If you have a “health savings account” as part of your insurance policy, you can use the money in this account to pay for a hearing aid.
Contact your insurance company. Ask, ""Do you offer any coverage for hearing aids?"";
, Unfortunately, Medicaid does not cover hearing aids or any other hearing-related services. Medicare, on the other hand, may offer some assistance, but this varies from state to state. If you are enrolled in Medicare, contact your case worker to find out what benefits you are eligible for.Contact your local Department of Health and Human Services.
When you speak to your case worker, ask ""Does my Medicare package offer any help with hearing aid costs?""

, If this applies to you, speak to someone at your local VA hospital about getting tested and obtaining a hearing aid.When you speak to someone at your local VA, you might say, ""How can I receive help with the costs of a hearing aid?""

, If you are a federal employee (or retiree), hearing aid coverage is available through some of the insurance options in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. This can help provide hearing aids to both you and members of your family.Contact your federal health insurance company.
Ask a representative: ""Does this policy offer any help with the cost of hearing aids?""

Try probiotic snacks at work.,
Take prebiotics at work.,
Try digestive enzymes at work.,
Take peppermint oil while at work.,
Use additional herbal remedies.,
Keep a diet diary.",How to Cope with IBS at Work2," When you are at work, try to bring a small lunch/dinner. This will give your body less to digest, which will help keep your stomach and bowel from getting aggravated while you are working. You should also chew your food extremely well, which helps with digestion. Also when you eat at work, keep your water or other liquids at a minimum.


Too much water or liquid while you eat can dilute your stomach acid, which will slow your digestion., To help improve your digestion while you are at work, eat foods with more fiber in them. This will help ease your IBS symptoms while you are at work. You should aim for 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day, so try to have at least 10 grams of fiber while you are at work. Make sure you ease into an increase in fiber — introducing too much fiber too quickly can cause a flare up in IBS symptoms. Fiber-rich foods include:


Vegetables, such as Swiss chard, mustard greens, spinach, collard greens, beet greens, kale, turnip greens, broccoli, cabbage, Brussel sprouts, and cauliflower
Beans
Fruits, especially those you can keep the peelings on because it adds extra fiber
Whole grains, Probiotics are good bacteria that helps with gut health, such as L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. Fermentum, B. longum, and B. bifidum. When you pack your work food every day to take to work, bring a serving of food that has probiotics in it. You can eat it as a snack or as part of your lunch/dinner. You can also take probiotic supplements, which are found at most health food stores. Foods with probiotics include:


Yogurt, especially greek yogurt
Kefir
Kimchee
Kombucha
Tempeh, Prebiotics are a type of supplement that helps support gut bacteria similar to probiotics.If you want to help your IBS while you are at work, consider taking a prebiotic supplement at the beginning of your shift or workday. Keep a bottle of them in your desk so they are easy to get to. Find one that contains inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). You can also bring a serving of prebiotic food to eat at work, such as:


Chicory root
Jerusalem artichoke
Dandelion greens
Garlic
Leeks
Asparagus
Wheat bran
Bananas, You can take digestive enzymes at work to help reduce many symptoms of IBS, including gas and abdominal discomfort or bloating. These enzymes help to break down nutrients into smaller, more absorbable bits, which will help you digest food better while you are at work. Keep a bottle of digestive enzymes in your desk for easy access.


They also help you get more from the nutrients in the food you eat while at work.When you are buying a digestive enzyme, request the advice of a pharmacist or advice of naturopath who has been trained in this method of treatment. You may also want to look for a look for a Seal of Approval from either the Natural Products Association (NPA) or the US Pharmacopoiea. (USP) to make sure they are safe.

, Peppermint oil is a great treatment for IBS and it's portable and easy enough to take to work. Keep a bottle of peppermint oil supplements in your desk for easy access. This way, you can take a dose of peppermint oil to help ease your symptoms at any point in the day.


Take a dose of 0.2 to 0.4mL of peppermint oil in capsule form once while at work.
Take an additional one to two doses before and after work each day., There are some additional herbal treatments that you can use at work to help with IBS. Bring herbal tea bags and have a cup during your afternoon break. If you don't get breaks, these can be used at any point during your work day to help relieve your IBS symptoms. These herbal methods include:


Fennel tea or fennel oilGinger teaAmino acids such as glycine and glutamine, Food triggers can cause a problem with your IBS, which is a major problem at work. When you are at work, keep a track of everything you eat and drink over the course of a month. Also list the symptoms you experience after each meal. After the month is over, analyze your diary to determine what types of things trigger your IBS. Once you find them, you should avoid your food triggers, especially at work, so you IBS does not act up. Common triggers include:Foods high in fat
Coffee and other caffeinated drinks
Alcohol
Artificial sweetener
Foods with fructose or high fructose corn syrup
Foods that produce intestinal gas, such as beans, legumes, and raisins
Gluten

Learn the causes of IBS.",How to Cope with IBS at Work3," IBS has many symptoms. These can vary from person to person, but there are some general ones that typically occur. These symptoms include:Abdominal pain or discomfort, which must be followed by two additional symptoms, such as improvement of pain or discomfort after a bowel movement, a change in the frequency of bowel movements, or a change in the appearance of stools
Diarrhea or constipation, or a mixture of both
Bloating
White or grey-white mucus in your stool
A feeling that the bowel movement didn’t completely eliminate the stool
A worsening of symptoms during menstrual periods in women

, If you recognize the symptoms of IBS, you can go see your doctor if you notice them. They may come and go during a month, but you will be diagnosed with IBS if you have experienced them at least three times a month for the last three months or if your symptoms have listed for at least six months.


Your doctor will do a physical exam and examine your symptom patterns.
If your doctor isn't sure, she may order a series of other tests to check the state of your bowel., There is no one thing that causes IBS. It can be situational, medical, food-related, hormonal, or mental. The most common causes for IBS include:http://www.holistichelp.net/ibs.html</ref>


Signal issues between your brain and digestive tract to determine how your intestines function
Bacterial infections in the small intestine called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
Food sensitivity or a difficulty with absorbing various foods
A hormone imbalance with GI hormones, GI neurotransmitters, and reproductive hormones
A number of mental health problems, including PTSD, depression, anxiety, or a history of panic disorder and abuse

Avoid salty foods.,
Eat a healthy, whole-foods diet.,
Try cutting down on coffee, alcohol and nicotine.",How to Reduce Tinnitus Naturally6," It is generally recommended to avoid salty foods because of their association with high blood pressure, which can cause tinnitus. , A reasonable recommendation is to eat a healthy, whole-foods diet low in added salt, sugar and saturated fats and to increase the amounts of fruit and vegetables in the diet., Some of the most common triggers for tinnitus include coffee, alcohol, and nicotine.Avoid any and all of these as much as possible. We don’t really know why these are triggers for different people. Because tinnitus is a symptom of a number of different possible problems, the reason these are triggers may vary on an individual basis.


Cutting out these substances may not improve your tinnitus. In fact, one study showed that caffeine was not associated with tinnitus at all. Another study indicated that alcohol may actually help relieve tinnitus in older adults. At a minimum, watch what happens if you have any coffee, alcohol or nicotine, especially being aware of what happens to your tinnitus after you indulge in any of these. If the tinnitus gets worse or harder to deal with, you may want to consider avoiding those triggers completely.

"
"
Try cognitive behavioral therapy and tinnitus retraining therapy.,
Join a support group.,
See a mental health professional.",How to Reduce Tinnitus Naturally7," Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an approach that uses techniques such as cognitive restructuring and relaxation to change a person’s response to tinnitus. Tinnitus retraining therapy is a complementary practice that helps desensitize you to the noise in your ears.


The therapist will teach you different ways to cope with the noise. This is a process in CBT known as habituation, where you can learn to ignore the tinnitus.The therapist will teach you about your tinnitus and will teach you a variety of relaxation techniques. This person will help you adopt a realistic, effective attitude in dealing with tinnitus.”A recent review of the technique indicated that it didn’t affect the level of noise, but it positively affected how the individual responded to the noise. The response after CBT included less depression and anxiety, with higher reported levels of satisfaction with life.A recent large review of therapeutic approaches to tinnitus determined that a combination of sound therapy (background noise) plus CBT provided the best overall results.Another study reviewed nine high-quality studies evaluating the efficacy of tinnitus retraining therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In each study, a variety of standardized and validated questionnaires was used. The investigators found that both tinnitus retraining therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy were equally effective in relieving the symptoms of tinnitus. , You might find it useful to find a tinnitus support group, especially if you are experiencing depression or anxiety associated with the tinnitus.


This support group can help you develop tools to cope with your condition.

, Anxiety and depression can be associated with tinnitus and vice versa. If you are experiencing these symptoms, make sure you seek out professional help. Usually, depression and anxiety exist before the tinnitus, but these conditions can follow the onset of tinnitus.The sooner you get treatment for tinnitus, anxiety and/or depression, the sooner you can begin to feel and function better.Tinnitus can also make concentrating difficult. This is where cognitive behavioral therapy can be very useful, providing different tools and resources to cope.

See an osteopath or chiropractor.",How to Overcome Dizziness," High levels of stress can cause changes in breathing rates and hormone levels, which can lead to dizziness or feelings of light-headedness and nausea. Certain anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks or various phobias also cause dizziness.As such, reduce the stress and anxiety in your life as much as you can by communicating your feelings and trying to resolve relationship conflicts. Becoming less overwhelmed may reduce your dizzy spells.


Sometimes a change of job, reduced hours, a different schedule or working more from home can reduce stress and anxiety issues.
Natural stress-relieving practices you can try at home include meditation, yoga, tai chi and deep breathing exercises. Watching how-to videos online before you start can be helpful.;
, Acute or chronic (long term) dehydration is also a common cause of dizziness, especially light-headedness.If your body doesn't contain enough water — due to either vomiting, diarrhea, fever or not drinking enough on a hot day — then your blood becomes a little thicker and your brain doesn't get the oxygen it needs, which can lead to dizziness. Furthermore, dehydration also leads to overheating (hyperthermia), another common cause of dizziness. As such, focus on drinking more water, especially on hot and humid days, and see if that positively impacts your dizziness.


Aim for about 8 eight-ounce glasses of water per day (64 ounces total) if you're physically active or outside on hot days.
Avoid drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages such as coffee, black tea, soda pop and energy drinks. Alcohol and caffeine are diuretics and make you urinate more often than normal.

, Another common cause of dizziness, light-headedness, headaches and overall lethargy is low blood sugar levels.Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) is a common problem for diabetics who take too much insulin or people who skip breakfast and get too busy to eat the rest of the day. Your brain needs adequate glucose in the blood to function properly. As such, consider changing the amount of insulin you inject (with your doctor's approval) if you're diabetic, or eat something that your stomach / intestines can quickly digest and see if your dizziness goes away. With hypoglycemia, dizziness is often accompanied by sweating and confusion.Fresh sweet fruit (especially ripe bananas and blueberries), fruit juice (especially sweetened apple or grape juice), white bread, ice cream and honey are all good foods to eat to quickly raise your blood sugar level.
Conversely, constantly having too much sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) can also cause dizziness due to dehydration and over-acidity.Chronic hyperglycemia usually occurs in people with undiagnosed / untreated diabetes.

, Perhaps the most common cause of short-term bouts of dizziness, especially in the elderly, is a condition called orthostatic hypotension.This condition occurs in people with relatively low blood pressure (particularly the systolic number) who stand up too quickly from a supine or seated position. As they stand up quickly, there is not quite enough pressure in the arteries that supply blood to the head to compensate fast enough, so the brain gets less oxygen than it needs for a few seconds or so. The result is temporary dizziness or a feeling of faintness. If this sounds like the cause of your dizziness, then take more time while standing up and make sure you're gripping something stable to keep your balance.


If you're getting up from a lying position, transition to a seated position for a few moments first, before standing up.
Chronic hypotension may be due to taking too much blood pressure medication, muscle relaxants or vasodilators, such as Viagra and similar drugs for erectile dysfunction.
Peripheral nerve problems, dehydration, and other medications may also cause hypotension.

, Not getting enough sleep, either in terms of quantity or quality, is another possible cause of dizziness, brain fog and overall grogginess. Chronically poor sleeping patterns are associated with higher levels of stress, hypertension, depression, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, all of which can cause dizziness to varying degrees.Sleep disruption is linked to chronic anxiety, emotional / psychological trauma, chronic pain, caffeine use, over-medication, restless legs syndrome and many other issues, such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea (heavy snoring). As such, turn off the TV or computer and go to bed a little earlier and avoid caffeinated beverages (coffee, black tea, soda pop) at least 8 hours before bedtime.


Sleeping late on the weekends is fine and may make you feel more rested and/or less dizzy, but you'll never be able to properly ""catch up"" on the sleep you lost during the work week.
Natural sleep aids that you can take shortly prior to bedtime include chamomile tea, valerian root extract, magnesium (relaxes muscles) and melatonin (a hormone that regulates sleep and circadian rhythms).

, Head trauma from car accidents and contact sports is a common cause of mild-to-moderate brain injuries, usually called contusions or concussions. The main symptoms of a concussion include dizziness, along with dull headaches, nausea, brain fog and ringing in the ears.Head trauma tends to be cumulative, meaning it gets worse with each injury and builds over time, so try to reduce the risk or incidence of getting your ""bell rung.""


Sports such as boxing, football, rugby and ice hockey are particularly risky for suffering significant head trauma.
Always wear your seat belt while driving (prevents severe whiplash), and avoid activities that jar your head and neck such as bouncing on a trampoline, bungee jumping or going on roller-coaster rides.

, In reality, almost all medications (both over-the-counter and prescription) list dizziness as a potential side effect, but it's more common with specific types of drugs.In particular, blood pressure meds, diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers, anti-depressants, strong pain relievers and some antibiotics are most likely to cause dizziness. However, ask you family physician if any of the drugs you're taking is a likely culprit, or if the combination of your medications is a good possibility.


Never stop taking a medication ""cold turkey"" without the supervision of your doctor, even if you believe it to be the cause of your dizziness. It's better to wean yourself off and/or switch to a drug with similar actions.
Due to the complexities of chemical interactions in the body, it's practically impossible to predict how more than 2 medications may interact with each other.

, Viral infections that cause the common cold and flu are primarily respiratory pathogens, so most of the symptoms affect the lungs, throat, sinuses and inner ears. As such, the build-up of mucous and other fluid can clog breathing passages and/or the inner ear, leading to dizziness and loss of balance. If that's the cause of your dizziness, then simply wait it out for a few days, keep hydrated and clear your sinuses by gently blowing into a tissue or rinsing them out with warm salt water.


Plugging your nose and then trying to blow through it is a method of clearing out the narrow Eustachian tubes, which run from the throat to the middle ear. The tubes allow the equalization of pressure on each side of the eardrum, and dizziness or poor balance is often a consequence of having them clogged.Other conditions often associated with dizziness include allergies, migraine headaches and anemia (low red blood cell count)., As noted above, both low blood pressure (hypotension) and high blood pressure (hypertension) can cause dizziness, so get your family doctor to measure yours. In general, blood pressure should be below 120 (systolic) over 80 (diastolic).Of the two conditions, hypertension is the more potentially dangerous and sometimes a symptom of heart disease. In fact, most serious issues with the heart, such as cardiomyopathy (diseased heart muscle), congestive heart failure and arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythms), cause hypertension and dramatically increase the risk of chronic, reoccurring dizziness.If you're had a mild heart attack or stroke, less blood will circulate to your brain and cause dizziness and other symptoms. Your doctor make take an electrocardiogram (ECG) to rule out a heart attack.
The unfortunate irony is that medication for reducing hypertension is notorious for causing dizziness.

, Also as noted above, both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can cause dizziness. If you are a diabetic and hypoglycemic, then your doctor may adjust your insulin levels such that you're taking less. However, if you're hyperglycemic, that may be an indication you've developed diabetes. Your doctor can send you for a blood sugar test, which measures the amount of glucose — a major source of energy for the brain and most other cells in the body. Normal levels for a fasting blood glucose test are between 70-100 mg/dL.You can buy blood glucose monitors from pharmacies, which require you to prick your finger for a blood sample. Without fasting, normal readings should be below 125 mg/dL for a general reference.
Short-term hyperglycemia can also be caused by eating lots of refined sugar (called a sugar high or rush), which may lead to some dizziness.

, If your dizziness is significant and disabling and best described as the world is spinning around you, then your may have vertigo. Vertigo may be due to benign positional vertigo (spinning feeling that occurs with head movements), labyrinthitis (an inner ear viral infection) or Meniere's disease (build up of fluid in the inner ear).Essentially, vertigo results from a change in the balance mechanism in the inner ear (vestibular system) or in the connections of that mechanism to the brain. IN short, you're vestibular system thinks you're moving, but you're not, creating a spinning feeling. However, vertigo is often self resolving as the body usually adapts to whatever is causing the problem.


Benign positional vertigo is often caused when crystals inside the ear become dislodged and irritate the semicircular canals.Sometimes vertigo is severe enough to cause nausea, vomiting, headache and loss of balance for hours at a time.

, Osteopaths and chiropractors are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. A relatively common cause of dizziness and vertigo is jammed / misaligned / dysfunctional joints of the upper neck, typically where it attaches to the skull. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned. You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with a spinal adjustment.


Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your dizziness or sense of vertigo if it's caused by upper neck issues), more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results.
Arthritis of the upper neck, especially rheumatoid arthritis, can lead to chronic bouts of dizziness.

Realize you have Psoriasis.,
Find out all the places in your body which are affected by Psoriasis.,
Observe the time of the year when such dryness usually occurs.,
Always keep such affected areas moist.,
Maintain a healthy lifestyle.,
Keep away from stress.,
Focus on being happy!",How to Control Psoriasis by Changing Lifestyle," The first step to cure your condition is to firstly realize and accept the fact that the dryness, the itching and the roughed look of your skin is not any fungal or bacterial infection. It is not because you are dirty or unhygienic. Go to a good physician, dermatologist. An experienced doctor can tell you that you have Psoriasis by merely looking at it once.;
, Generally, Psoriasis affects children around the time they hit puberty. Rough and dry fingernails (on feet and/or hands), dry hands and dry soles, extremely dry elbows and knees are just the very common places where Psoriasis affects. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body including back (upper back and lower back), legs, genitals, groin etc. It is very important to find out all the places where such dryness occurs.

, Psoriasis affects the most during the time of winters and generally simply vanishes during summers. If your dryness has direct connection to the time of the year it occurs, you should consult a doctor and check if it’s Psoriasis.

, It is essential to understand here that Psoriasis is not strictly a 'disease', and is rather a condition. Simply put, our immune system does not realize it has something to fight against and your body does not respond to the extreme dryness as it would respond in a person not affected by Psoriasis. So basically, when your body does not give it enough moisture (not realizing the dryness is a problem), you need to provide it with external moisture at all times.


Now the moisturizers which are available in market for normal dryness can be useful for some who have mild cases of Psoriasis, but for major dryness problems, specific moisturizers are available in markets which would keep your affect areas moist for a long time. E.g. (Ranbaxy Xerina is a cream available for feet and elbows).

, The most important part in fighting Psoriasis is to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Keep away from smoking, drinking or any other vices. Stay clean. Work-out, perform regular exercises. Eat healthy and regularly and keep your sleeping patterns right. This is advisable to everyone, but the people affected by Psoriasis would realize how important a healthy lifestyle is once they see the difference it brings in their condition.

, Stress is a factor which boosts Psoriasis in people. If you have Psoriasis, it may have been dormant in your body for years, but the time you are stressed, you mind is weak, your immune system is weak, it kicks in. Keep yourself headstrong and always have a positive feeling about your condition. Believe that it can be cured, and it will be cured. Traditional meditation and Yoga techniques can help your reduce stress. Working out also increases the blood flow in your brain and makes you feel positive.

, Happiness and laughter can cure any disease. It’s very important to keep your mind in the right place and stay away from depression.

Recognize a boil.,
Learn the different kinds of boils.,
Know the risks.,
Treat a boil medically.,
Avoid the complications.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Cure Boils Naturally2," A boil typically appears as a red, firm bump on your skin. Over time, it can increase in size and eventually form a head, meaning that the top surface becomes filled with pus, which can be very painful. The boil can break open, draining and weeping pus.


The pus is a mixture of blood cells, bacteria, and fluids., There are a number of different types of boils. Furuncles occur in hair follicles and can have more than one opening onto the skin. These may be associated with chills and a fever and can become chronic problems. You may also develop a carbuncle, which is generally larger than furuncles and can also become chronic. Carbuncles can also form hardened lumps under the skin. Cystic acne is both a type of acne and a type of boil that is associated with more severe forms of acne.


Other forms of boils include hidradenitis suppurativa, which occurs when there are many boils forming in the underarms and in the groin. This is an inflammatory condition of sweat glands. Hidradenitis suppurativa is resistant to antibiotics and often requires surgery to remove the affected sweat glands.
You may also get pilonidal cysts, which are relatively uncommon and result from an inflamed hair follicles located at the top of the buttock crease. Pilonidal cysts can occur after long periods of sitting., Boils are most often the result of infections with the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, though other bacteria and fungi can result in boils. MRSA can cause boils as well. If your boil is not healing well or if you get recurring infections, talk to your physician to determine if MRSA or another bacterium is the cause of the boils or if your immune system is suppressed. Boils can be found anywhere on the body but are most commonly found on the face, neck, armpit, buttocks, and inner thighs.Boils can happen to anyone at anytime. There are also some other factors that can increase your risk. These include:


Caring for or having close contact with someone with a boil or a Staph infection.
Diabetes can suppress the immune system and can lead to increased risks of infections.
Any condition resulting in a suppressed immune system.
Other skin conditions that weaken the barrier function of the skin, which can include eczema, psoriasis, and acne., Boils are most commonly diagnosed by appearance and can be medically treated by lancing them, which is when a doctor pokes a hole in the top of the pus-filled head of the boil and drains the pus.


Topical or oral antibiotics may be used in some cases, though most often, draining the boil is sufficient for healing to begin. Antibiotic treatment is usually reserved for large boils or for those that last longer than two to three weeks.
Medical treatment may also be necessary if the boil is on the face or spine, is particularly painful, or if it is associated with a fever. , Although boils are mostly benign, there are other issues that can be associated with boils, especially if they are left untreated. In rare cases, the infection associated with a boil can spread causing infections in the brain, heart, bones, blood, and spinal cord.


They should not be ignored, especially if they are recurring. , There are some situations where you need to see a doctor. Make sure you see your physician if the natural remedies recommended do not help within two to three weeks, if you are running a fever, if the boil is very painful or limits movement or sitting, if the boil is on your face, or if you feel over-fatigued.


Also seek medical help if, during home treatment of boils, you see reddish streaks coming from the boil, if it gets worse, or another boil develops. This is particularly important because of the recent rise in antibiotic resistant infections that may require more intensive medical care."

Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight.,
Apply sunblock.,
Begin sunbathing.,
Increase your exposure time gradually.,
Expose all areas of your skin affected by psoriasis to equal sunlight.,
Talk with your doctor regularly.,
Avoid tanning salons.",How to Control Psoriasis2," Ultraviolet B (UVB) light is found in sunlight and has been known to improve psoriasis symptoms. Phototherapy treatments are often done under medical supervision in an office, but careful exposure to sunlight can have similar effects.


It is best to consult your doctor before beginning a sunbathing regimen. Exposure to sunlight can aggravate your psoriasis.

, Make sure areas unaffected by your psoriasis are covered with sunblock before exposing your skin to sunlight. This will protect you from painful sunburns and skin cancer. Use at least SPF 30 to ensure proper protection.

, At first, only expose yourself to sunlight for five to ten minutes daily, around noontime. Stick to these short intervals to make sure that your psoriasis is not aggravated by the sunlight.

, Do this in intervals of 30 seconds. Only increase your exposure after you are sure your skin can handle the sunlight.


Do not go over the recommended exposure time. Ultraviolet light can make psoriasis symptoms worse in large doses.

, Keep careful track of your exposure time and rotate accordingly.

, As you continue sunbathing, it is important to keep visiting your doctor to check your skin for sun damage and determine if the treatment is working.

, Do not use tanning beds as a replacement for natural light. Most tanning beds emit UVA light, not UVB. This will not help psoriasis and can make symptoms worse. "

Use over-the-counter topical treatments.,
Use anti-itch creams.,
Avoid triggers.,Dietary treatment",How to Control Psoriasis3," There are several readily available products that have been found to improve psoriasis symptoms.


Coal Tar. This is one of the oldest treatments for psoriasis, and can help reduce itching, swelling, and scaling of skin. It is found in a variety of over-the-counter creams and shampoos. Be aware that coal tar can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, meaning you will burn more easily. Make sure there is none on your skin before sunbathing.
Salicylic Acid. This works as a peeling agent that softens and loosens scaly skin. Like coal tar, it is found in many OTC topical products.
Aloe Vera. This can help reduce the irritation and itching associated with psoriasis.

, These don't prevent or alleviate the scaly skin caused by psoriasis, but can fight uncomfortable itching. Some that have been found effective are calamine, hydrocortisone, and camphor., In addition to treating your psoriasis symptoms, you can also avoid things that will trigger or exacerbate your symptoms. The following list names some known psoriasis triggers:


Smoking

Use prescription topical treatments.",How to Control Psoriasis4," While the previous remedies have been found effective in some cases, they won't work for everyone. There are a variety of prescription treatments that the doctor can recommend.

, Like sunbathing, this involves exposing your skin to UVB light. Phototherapy, however, is performed in a medical facility under a doctor's supervision. Exposure is more concentrated here than with sunlight, which may irritate your skin initially. Continued treatment, however, often leads to improvement., There are a multitude of medications that come in oral and intravenous (IV) forms. The two main classes of psoriasis drugs are systemics and biologics.


Systemics are designed to work throughout the body. They are given orally in liquid or pill form, or by injection. Some systemic drugs are Acitretin, Cyclosporine, and Methotrexate. It is important to note that this category of treatment is probably the most dangerous and is not suitable for longterm use as these drugs some of which are actually anti-cancer drugs are highly cytotoxic and may have serious consequences and health risks. In addition, the disease may become resistant to these drugs if usage is stopped. If using these drugs, some form of surveillance such as regular blood tests to check liver function among other thingsBiologics are derived from living cells cultured in a laboratory. They are administered in IV form. Unlike systemics, biologics target specific parts of the immune system to suppress psoriasis symptoms. Interleukin 12/23 and Interleukin 17-A are examples of biologics., In addition to OTC topicals, there are more concentrated treatments available by prescription. Topical treatments include"

Consider a cream or ointment.,
Try using coconut oil as a moisturizer.,
Avoid moisturizing lotions.,
Experiment with multiple moisturizers.",How to Choose a Moisturizer for Psoriasis2," Many dermatologists will recommend a heavy/thick moisturizing cream or ointment instead of a lotion for treating psoriasis. This is because thicker creams will lock water into the skin, allowing the moisturizing effects to last longer.You may want to ask your dermatologist: ""What type of moisturizer do you recommend to treat my psoriasis?"", ""Should I use a cream, ointment, or lotion?""

, You may want to consider using extra virgin coconut oil, instead of cream, as a form of moisturizer. Oils can be preferable to creams because they help to prevent the evaporation of water from your skin and the moisturizing effects can last for up to eight hours. In order to use coconut oil as a moisturizer for psoriasis follow these tips:Use coconut oil on plaque psoriasis spots in the morning after showering.
Heat the coconut oil in warm water in order to make it easier to rub into your skin.
Apply liberal amounts of oil to affected areas.
Reapply throughout the day if the skin begins to tighten and dry out.

, Lotions are not as useful as creams or ointments when moisturizing with psoriasis. This is because most lotions are very thin and contain a lot of water. Although lotions are absorbed into the skin quickly, they do not have long lasting benefits.


If you do use a moisturizing lotion, you will have to reapply the moisturizer more frequently throughout the day., In order to find a moisturizer that works well, you may need to experiment with a variety of different oils, creams, and ointments. In many ways this will be a process of elimination until you find one that helps keep your skin moist. You can reapply moisturizers throughout the day and do not need to stick with one particular moisturizer. For example, you may find that you like using an ointment in the morning but a lighter lotion before getting into bed.

"
Talk with your doctor or dermatologist.,
Consider over the counter topical treatments.,
Try Steroid creams or ointments.",How to Choose a Moisturizer for Psoriasis3," When you are diagnosed with psoriasis, you should talk with your doctor or dermatologist about different skin care options. Ask your doctor to recommend skin care products such as moisturizers that can help to alleviate and prevent some of the symptoms associated with psoriasis.


You should always talk with your doctor before you make changes to your skincare routine.
For example you may want to say ""I am considering trying a new moisturizer to help ease the symptoms of my psoriasis. Do you have any recommendations?""
You could also say ""I have tried these three products with little success. Are there any other options you would suggest?""

, You can also look into a number of over the counter topical treatments for psoriasis that are placed directly on the skin. For example, coal tar and salicylic acid have both been approved by the Federation of Drug Administration as treatment for psoriasis. Coal tar works by slowing the growth of skin cells and restoring the skin’s appearance. It can also help to reduce itching, inflammation and scaling that result from psoriasis. Similarly, salicylic acid works by causing the outer layer of skin to peel away, which can remove psoriasis scales. Some side effects include:Coal tar: Can irritate, redden, and dry the skin and should be used in combination with a moisturizer. The tar can also stain clothing. It will also make your skin more sensitive to sun damage. Coal tar is a time honored treatment of psoriasis. However, cleaner methods of treatment have become more popular today.
Salicylic acid: Can cause hair loss and may cause skin irritation if left on the skin too long.

, Topical steroid creams and ointments can also be used as anti-inflammatory agents that help to reduce swelling and redness. They are the mainstay for the topical treatment of psoriasis. When using steroid creams, apply a small amount directly to the affected area only. Always speak with your doctor or dermatologist before using a steroid cream to treat psoriasis.Steroids can have a number of side effects including: Skin thinning, change in pigmentation, bruising, and dilated blood vessels.
If applied to a large area of skin over a long period of time, steroids can also affect internal organs.
A typical regimen involves a twice daily application of the corticosteroid over the treatment area. Lower potency steroid should be used on the face and intertriginous  areas.

Use an oil-based cleanser on other affected areas.,
Wear sunblock.,
Use a cool compress to cool your face.",How to Clear Up Rosacea Without Medication1," The sebum that clogs up your pores and can cause irritation in rosacea is an oil. The best substance for dissolving oils (and dirt, cell debris, dirt, bacteria, etc.) is another oil. We are so used to thinking that oils are bad for the skin. This makes many people forget that the skin has natural oils to protect and moisturize it. As a result, we may use cleansers with (often) irritating chemicals.Choose your primary oil from a list of non-comedogenic oils. Non-comedogenic means that the pores won’t be blocked.Some of these oils are more expensive than others, and some may be easier to find than others. The most non-comedogenic according to the American Academy of Dermatology) with a rating of 0 or 1 out of a possible 5 are:
Hemp seed oil (0)
Mineral oil (0)
Shea butter (0)
Sunflower oil (0)
Castor oil (1): Castor oil can be moisturizing for some people, but it can be drying for others.;
, Make sure your skin reacts well to the oil cleanser that you choose. Test it on a small patch of skin first and wait a day. If your skin condition worsens, stop using this cleanser and try a different one.


Avoid cleansers that might trigger allergic reactions. For example, if you have a nut allergy, don’t use hazelnut oil.

, For oil cleansing, pour a small amount of oil into the palm of your hand. Gently massage the oil onto your face for two minutes, using small, circular motions.


Use this method twice a day and after heavy sweating.
You can add essential oils to your oil if you choose. Add one to two drops of essential oil for every ½ cup of oil. Some scents to choose from include:
Oat
Chamomile
Lavender

, Use a washcloth soaked in warm water and apply the washcloth to your face. Let it stay on your face for about 20 seconds. This helps the oil absorb into your skin.

, Use the warm damp washcloth to slowly and gently wipe off the oil from your skin. Rinse the washcloth in warm water and repeat until you have wiped all the oil off your face.

, Use a cotton towel to gently dry your face. Do not rub your skin, since this may irritate your face.

, Once your skin is clean and dry, moisturize it with an oil-based moisturizer. It doesn’t need to be the same type of oil that you use in your cleanser. But if you notice that your skin is improving with the oil-based cleanser, try a moisturizer made of the same oil.

, If your rosacea affects your skin anywhere else on your body, use the same basic approach as you use for your face. Apply oil, allow it to get absorbed and rinse off with warm water. Apply an oil-based moisturizer over your entire body.

, Protecting the skin also involves protecting yourself from the sun and heat. Use a sunblock if you are going to be spending extended time in the sun. This is usually more than 15 minutes in full sun. Be sure to limit your time in the sun.


If your skin is too sensitive for chemical sunscreen (most conventional sunscreens), consider trying a physical sunscreen. This type of sunscreen contains ingredients that actually help reflect the sun's rays from your skin. Look for a sunscreen with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. You might also try a natural sunscreen, such as retinyl palmitate (a form of Vitamin A), vitamin E, or beta carotene., Rosacea can get worse in hot temperatures, so keep cool! You can make a cool compress by soaking a clean cotton towel with plain cool water. Press this gently to your skin to help decrease redness.

Apply an ice pack.,
Bandage the area.,
Use arnica.,
Make a parsley rub.,
Take vitamin C. Some people bruise easily due to vitamin deficiencies.,
Try essential oils.",How to Care for a Bruise Naturally1," As soon as you can after you hit yourself and you think it might bruise, apply an ice pack to the area of the bruise. This will help slow the blood flow and reduce inflammation. Wrap the ice pack in a cloth instead of putting it directly against your skin. It can cause cold burn on your skin. You should also limit how long you leave the pack on your skin because it can cause skin irritation or low blood pressure.


You can also use ice cubes wrapped in a towel or a bag of frozen vegetables if you don’t have a pack handy. Frozen peas or other small vegetables work very well because they conform to your body shape. After use, you can refreeze them and use them as an ice pack again. You shouldn’t eat them if they fully defrost, though.
If you have a bruised or black eye, you can use a steak as well.;
, You can apply a pressure bandage, which is also called an elastic bandage, around the bruised area. This will limit the amount of blood and fluids that can leak. Make sure you don’t apply the pressure bandage too tightly


Remember to take it off after one to two hours. Restricting blood flow for extended periods of time is not healthy for you.
If the bruised area is swelling, try to raise that part of your body above the level of your heart., If you want to use a more homeopathic remedy, you can take arnica. Arnica is an plant that is in the daisy family and helps bruises as well as sprains and sore muscles. Arnica is used to reduce the amount of bruising and pain. It can also speed healing. It can come in tablet form as well as a cream or gel.


Take three to five of the tablet as soon as possible after bruising. You can continue to take arnica daily as long as needed for the bruise.
Creams or gels containing Arnica can be used daily as long as the skin has not been broken. Using arnica on broken skin will sting. Try brands such as Nelson’s Arnica Cream and Boiron’s Arnicare, which can be found in most larger drugstores and pharmacies., You can make a homemade parsley rub to treat your bruise. Parsley is high in vitamin K, which helps with blood clotting. Take some dried parsley, enough to lightly cover the bruise. In order to keep the parsley together as you soak it, take a clean nylon knee-high and fill the toe or foot, depending on the size of the bruise, with parsley. Tie off the end of the knee-high and soak the parsley-filled end in a bowl of witch hazel. Squeeze out the excess witch hazel and cover the bruise with the parsley-filled knee-high. Spread out the parsley evenly over the bruise.Leave this compress on for about 30 minutes and repeat twice a day.
You can only reuse the parsley twice, so you need to make a new poultice daily.

, A diet that is high in vitamins C helps build your resistance to bruising. Vitamin C also strengthens the walls of blood cells. Eat plenty of foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits. You can also take vitamin C supplements, which are readily available at more grocery stores and health stores.


Increasing your vitamin K intake may also help reduce bruising because it helps with blood clotting., There are some herbal essential oils that can be useful for your bruise. Add the essential oil directly onto the bruise. The amount will vary depending on the size of the bruise. Massage into the bruise. Do this at least once a day. The bruise should heal within one to two weeks. There are a few herbs that support wound healing that can be helpful for your bruise:


Hypericum/St John’s wort
Symphytum/Comfrey
Achillea /Yarrow
Plantago/Plantain
Calendula/Marigold"

Stay away from skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual.,
Avoid prolonged contact with a surface containing mites.,
Wash or isolate any materials infected with scabies thoroughly.,
Be careful if you’re in a group susceptible to scabies infection.,
Be aware of your environmental risks for scabies.,
Realize that animals cannot spread scabies.,
Identify the symptoms.,
Look out for particular spots.,
Get treatment immediately if you have scabies.",How to Avoid Catching Scabies," Skin-to-skin contact is the best way to catch scabies. If someone is infected with scabies, avoid close contact with them until they seek treatment.Contact has to be prolonged to pass scabies, so gestures like a handshake will rarely pass scabies to another person.
Longer physical contact, such as hugging or sharing a close environment with skin contact, can potentially infect someone.
Sexual intercourse is one common way to catch scabies from another person. If you had sexual intercourse with someone infected with scabies, seek treatment immediately.;
, Scabies can live for only 48 – 72 hours when not on a person. Keep away from any clothing, blankets, or linens that touched a person infected with scabies.Towels can become infected with scabies, since they are used in close contact with those infected. Avoid handling infected towels without gloves.
Linens and bedsheets can also become infected with scabies. Take them off any beds and immediately launder them — this should be done on the first day of treatment.
Clothing can also carry scabies. Any clothing that an infected person wore in the last 72 hours can still have mites on them and should be washed.

, It's important to clean or quarantine surfaces that may still be carrying scabies. This will help to stop it from spreading to other people.


If possible, wash anything that has come into contact with those infected with scabies. Use the hottest water possible and dry them using the hottest setting. You can also dry clean anything that has come into contact with an infected person. Make sure to tell the dry cleaners, though, so they can take special precautions to avoid a scabies infestation of their own.
When you can't wash the material infected with scabies, keep it sealed and away from others. Place infected material in plastic bags that are tightly sealed with as little air as possible in the bag. Keep the bags sealed for at least one week.
Items that have not touched your skin for more than one week likely will not need to be washed.

, Certain groups or people are more susceptible to being infected with scabies, mostly because they are more likely to have skin-to-skin contact with others, which is the only way that you can catch scabies. If you’re a member of one or more of these groups, be careful and aware of any symptoms of scabies.Children are vulnerable to scabies. They can acquire it from being in communal environments in which scabies is more common.
Mothers of young children are very susceptible to scabies. They often catch scabies from their children first before passing it on to others.
Sexually active people can also acquire scabies. Scabies is most easily contracted as a result of prolonged skin-to-skin contact.
People living in nursing homes or similar environments. The elderly or those living in close quarters can also get scabies because they are in close contact with many people.
People in confinement, in places like prison, are also at risk of contracting scabies.

, Scabies do not spread in dirty environments; the scabies mite simply wants to stay on human skin. This means that some environments, such as the following, are especially ripe for a scabies infestation:College dormitories are a common place to catch scabies, since so many people are coming into contact with one another and the outside world. Places like a communal bathrooms are somewhere to easily catch scabies.
Nursing homes are another place to catch scabies. Since so many people are in close quarters, scabies can easily spread among the residents.
Childcare centers can also spread scabies. It’s not because the children are dirty, but rather because one person infected can easily infect others through skin-to-skin contact.
Classrooms can also spread scabies, since children are constantly coming and going from the outside and are around one another for long periods of time.
Camps are another place to catch scabies. The mixture of a variety of people in close quarters can spread scabies.

, While animals may have other ticks or mites, they cannot spread scabies to humans. Skin-to-skin contact with another human is the only way to catch scabies.


For dogs, scabies is called mange. This produces a slight itch on human skin, but goes away quickly.Bring your pet to the doctor if they are exhibiting symptoms of mange such as itching or hair loss.
Scabies from dogs will not cause human scabies. If you get scabies, it's from another human, not from your pet even if they have mange.

, There are several symptoms of scabies, and they range from minor to extreme. Knowing the symptoms won't necessarily help you avoid catching them, but may help you know if you need to move on to curing them.Itching is a symptom of scabies that persists at night. It is the most common symptom, and can be so intense that it keeps those who are infected awake at night.
Many people affected by scabies get a rash. The rash from scabies appears as little bumps, usually in a line, and can look like tiny bites, knots, or even pimples. The rash can be confused with eczema because of their similarities.
Sores from scabies are only caused by intense scratching. After the sores have developed, the risk of infection greatly increases. Staph and strep may infect the skin.
Thick crusts on the skin can form from a severe type of scabies. These crusts hold hundreds and even thousands of mites, along with their eggs, and greatly increase the itch, as well as making the rash more extreme.

, Understand that there are particular areas scabies tend to form, because the mites prefer them over the rest of the body.


Scabies often attack the hands. In particular, they can be found between the fingers and around the nails.
Arms are a common place to find scabies infections. The elbows and wrists are particularly vulnerable to infection.
Skin covered by clothing is often infected. Most commonly, the belt-line, penis, buttocks and skin surrounding the nipples can become affected; however, anything that clothing or jewelry covers is also a likely place for scabies to develop.
In children the spots to watch out for scabies include scalp, face, neck, palms of hands, and soles of feet.

, A scabies infection is serious. Additionally, untreated scabies can cause you to pass the infection along to other people with whom you have skin-to-skin contact.If a person has scabies, get them to a dermatologist immediately. Not only can severe cases cause hospitalization, but scabies aren't treatable without medication available by prescription.
Creams, such as 5% permethrin cream and lindane lotion, are most commonly prescribed to solve the scabies infection. In more severe cases, such as crusted scabies, an oral medication such as ivermectin may be prescribed.
Untreated scabies can continue the infection throughout an at-risk environment. If you think you have scabies, go see a doctor immediately to avoid passing it onto others.

See your primary care physician.,
Stop taking medications that could be to blame.,
Alter your hormone replacement therapy.,
Ask your doctor for a prescription hydroquinone cream.,
Talk to your doctor about a second skin lightener.",How to Treat Melasma1," Talk to your primary care physician about any hormonal medication changes and creams you can try for melasma before going to see a dermatologist. Treatment for melasma may be considered elective and it may not be covered by your insurance. Find out the costs of any treatments and procedures before you schedule them.;
, Certain medications, like birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy, can affect your hormones and induce melasma. Talk to your doctor about stopping these medications.Even though pregnancy is the condition most commonly associated with melasma, melasma has also been known to occur with medications and conditions that impact your hormones. Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy are the next two most common causes of melasma, after pregnancy. You can stop use or try switching to a different product to determine if your melasma will fade naturally afterward.

, Often, it is impossible to stop a hormone replacement therapy. Consider why you are on hormone replacement therapy to determine if you may be able to stop or adjust the dosage. However, there are ways that you can change your therapy so that it is less likely to cause melasma. Consult with your doctor before making any changes.


Begin taking hormone replacements at night. If you take the hormone replacement in the morning, it will be at its peak potency when the sun is out, maximizing the risk of melasma. Shifting your regimen to the night can help alleviate the problem.
Creams and patches might be slightly less inclined to cause melasma than oral versions of the treatment.
Ask your doctor to administer the lowest dose feasible., While some treatments containing this ingredient can be purchased over-the-counter, your dermatologist or primary care physician can prescribe a stronger version that will be more effective at lightening the skin.


Hydroquinone comes as a cream, lotion, gel, or liquid. It works by blocking the natural chemical process in your skin responsible for creating melanin, and since melanin produces dark skin pigmentation, the amount of dark pigmentation related to melasma will also be reduced.
Prescription hydroquinone typically has a concentration of 4 percent. Concentrations of hydroquinone higher than 4 percent are unlikely to be prescribed in the United States and can be dangerous. They can cause ochronosis, a permanent form of skin discoloration. , While hydroquinone is used as a first treatment in many cases, your dermatologist might be willing to prescribe a secondary skin lightener that can help enhance the effect.Tretinoins and corticosteroids are among the most frequently used secondary treatments. Both are used to speed up the body's process of shedding and replacing skin cells. Some dermatologists may even prescribe ""triple creams,"" which contain tretinoin, a corticosteroid, and hydroquinone in one formula.
Other options include azelaic acid or kojic acid, which slow down the production of skin-darkening pigment.

Apply a mixture of herbs and oil to your skin.,
Be careful with certain herbs.,
Wash your skin with colloidal oatmeal.",How to Clear Up Rosacea Without Medication2," Most herbal remedies used to treat rosacea are primarily anti-inflammatory agents. These include lavender, chamomile, ginger, holy basil, cinnamon, garlic and turmeric. You can use either dried herbs or essential oils mixed with the oil that you use for your cleanser.


To use these herbs, add ½ teaspoon of dried herb or one to two drops of essential oil to a carrier oil. The carrier oil can be the same one used for your cleanser.
Mix the herb or essential oil well with the carrier oil and apply directly to the skin.
Leave on overnight if possible, or, leave on for 30 minutes to one hour twice a day.
Gently rinse off with warm water.
Pat your skin dry with a clean cotton towel.

, Some herbs, such as turmeric and cinnamon, may stain your skin yellow or brown. Take care when using these herbs and be prepared for your skin to have a slightly yellowish or brownish tinge to it.

, Colloidal oatmeal is a special type of oatmeal that is commonly used as an emollient (moisturizer). It can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent to soothe and protect skin.Put a small amount of oatmeal on your fingers and massage it into your skin. Use a soft, circular motion. Gently rinse off and pat dry."

Try following an anti-inflammatory diet.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Avoid foods and beverages that cause your skin to flush.,
Consider taking supplements.",How to Clear Up Rosacea Without Medication3," Since rosacea has inflammatory components, following an anti-inflammatory diet can be beneficial. The anti-inflammatory diet emphasizes whole foods, preferably organic foods if possible. It also avoids all preservatives and additives.Some foods that are known as “anti-inflammatory” include salmon (with omega-3 fats), spinach. garlic, whole grains, beans and legumes, berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, blackberries), fruit and fresh vegetables like kale, collard greens, spinach and broccoli.
Avoid all processed and prepared foods, sugar and sugar substitutes, and red meat (unless it is grass-fed).

, Increase the number of fruits and vegetables so that they constitute about half your food. Include a variety of fruits, berries, nuts and seeds. Make sure to include a variety of vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables such as Swiss chard, spinach, mustard greens, broccoli, Brussel sprouts and field greens.

, Hot beverages, alcohol, coffee and hot spicy foods can open up the blood vessels and cause flushing. Avoid them to reduce redness in your skin.

, Many supplements boost your body’s natural abilities to fight inflammation, strengthen your blood vessels, and provide other benefits to your skin. Consider increasing your intake of the following supplements:


Riboflavin: B vitamins will correct a deficiency that can occur in people with rosacea. It can help the growth of skin cells.Pancreatin (8-10× USP): Take 350 to 500 mg before meals. Pancreatin is a digestive enzyme that may decrease inflammation.Zinc: Take 60 to 75 milligrams of zinc every day. Be careful, however. Do NOT take this amount of zinc for over three months. High zinc levels can be toxic. Or, you can try topical zinc. This can be used as a 15% azelaic acid gel, which is a natural acid that can help treat rosacea. Talk with your healthcare provider about using azelaic acid.
Vitamin C: Take 500 milligrams of vitamin C every day to help strengthen blood vessels.

Know the different types of rosacea.,
Examine your skin for signs of rosacea.,
Determine if you are more prone to developing rosacea.,
Get diagnosed by a dermatologist or doctor.,
Tell your dermatologist if you are trying home remedies.",How to Clear Up Rosacea Without Medication4," Rosacea is a common skin disease that appears as a tendency for reddened skin, primarily on the nose, cheeks, forehead and chin. It can also appear on the ears, chest and back. There are four main types of rosacea:Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea: This type involves redness and visible blood vessels that appears like a spider web
Papulopustular rosacea: This type involves redness and swelling along with acne-like breakouts.
Phymatous rosacea: In this type of rosacea, the skin gets thicker and bumpy.
Ocular rosacea: The eyes are involved in this form of rosacea where the eyes are reddened and irritated. The eyelids can be become swollen. Ocular rosacea is often described as if the person has a sty., There are a number of symptoms that are commonly associated with rosacea. Take a look at your skin in the mirror to see if you are experiencing any of the following:Flushing and redness in the center of the face.
Spider veins (broken blood vessels)
Swollen skin
Sensitive skin
Skin may sting and burn.
Skin may be dry with some roughness or scaling.
In Papulopustular rosacea, acne like breakouts are common, especially in areas where the skin is very red.
In Phymatous rosacea, the skin and nose can become very bumpy and the skin pores may be very large.
In Ocular rosacea, the eyes appear watery or bloodshot and may sting, burn and feel like there is a foreign blood vessel. The eyes can be very sensitive to light.

, Rosacea is quite common and generally occurs between the ages of 30 to 50 years. Individuals tend to be fair-skinned and have someone in their family with rosacea. Women are slightly more likely to be diagnosed with rosacea. Also, people who tend to blush more easily than other people are more likely to develop rosacea.

, Rosacea is diagnosed primarily by a physical exam. A doctor may recommend treatment with medications, moisturizers and antibiotics. You do not need to use these treatments, but a professional diagnosis is a good idea.


If thickened skin is present, laser surgery may be used to remove the extra layers of skin.

, Even if you are trying natural remedies and skipping medications altogether, you should still inform your dermatologist or doctor about your skincare routines. He or she can work with you to find a good solution and to caution you about adverse effects of certain natural remedies."

Know the stages of bruising.,
Deal with bruises due to medication.,
Get medical help.",How to Care for a Bruise Naturally2," Bruises can takes days or up to months to disappear. The stages of bruise healing are:


Day 1: The blood appears under the skin, which makes the area reddish.
Day 1-2: The bruise begins to turn darker blue-purple because of the hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying substance in the blood, gets darker.
Day 5-10: The bruise begins to change color, turning yellowish or greenish.
Day 10-14: As the bruise is healing, it turns lighter and lighter, turning a yellow-brown or light brown color. It will then eventually fade., If you are taking any anticoagulant (blood thinner) such as Warfarin, Coumadin, aspirin, Heparin, Rivaroxaban/Xarelto, or Dabigatran/Pradaxa, bruises may look worse than they used to before you started taking the medication. This is because part of the process of bruising is the clotting of the blood leaking out of the broken vessels. Your blood thinner is preventing or inhibiting that clotting, so it will take longer for the blood to start leaking.


Follow the methods suggested while on these medications, but contact your physician if the bruise is spreading or if there is significant pain or swelling., Bruises may be a way of your body telling you something bigger is going on. If any of the following apply to you, call your physician for an appointment:


There has been no improvement after 2 weeks.
You seem to get bruises all the time and they don’t heal quickly.
You don’t know why you have a bruise.
You experience painful swelling or a lump over the bruise.
You can't move a joint under or near the bruise.
You think a bone may have been broken.
There is abnormal bleeding elsewhere, such as your nose or excretions.
Your eye is bruised and you are having difficulty moving your eyes or having trouble seeing normally."

Get a chemical peel.,
Discuss microdermabrasion and dermabrasion.,
Be careful with lasers.,
Try treatment with platelet-rich plasma.",How to Treat Melasma2," A chemical peel is a procedure that uses glycolic acid or another similar chemical abrasive to peel the melasma-affected top layer of skin away.The liquid chemical is applied to the skin, creating a mild chemical burn. As the burned layers peel off, they leave behind fresh, melasma-free skin. This will not, however, prevent melasma if you have not treated underlying hormonal imbalances.
While glycolic acid is one of the most common options used, another common option is trichloroacetic acid, which is a compound similar to vinegar. Peels done with this chemical can be slightly more painful afterward, however, but they may present a good option for severe cases of melasma.

, During these treatments, the top layer of skin is gradually stripped away, leaving clean, melasma-free skin in its place.Both dermabrasion and microdermabrasion are medical procedures that essentially ""sand off"" the surface layer of skin using abrasive materials. During microdermabrasion, fine crystals are vacuumed across the skin. These crystals are abrasive enough to forcibly strip away dead skin cells, thereby lifting away the affected skin.
You can usually get about five procedures done, each two to four weeks apart. You may also opt for a maintenance treatment that every four to eight weeks if the underlying cause of your melasma has not been treated.

, While some laser treatments might be able to help strip away the skin affected by melasma, some can worsen the mask. Only get a laser treatment if it is administered by a credentialed professional. Look for a restorative or fractional dual laser that only targets pigmentation on the surface of the skin


Fractional laser treatments tend to be expensive and may cost $1000 or more. Keep in mind that you will probably need three to four treatments over the course of three to six months., For this treatment plasma that has been enriched to encourage recovery is injected into the body. It is an experimental recovery, still not well understood. Early evidence, however, suggests that it might not only be able to treat melasma, but even help prevent against its recurrence."

Protect your skin from the sun.,
Calm down.,
Look for an over-the-counter hydroquinone cream.,
Try a cream containing cysteamine.,
Use a cream containing kojic acid or melaplex.,
Take tretinoin.,
Try paper mulberry.,
Experiment with other holistic treatments.,
Wait it out.",How to Treat Melasma3," Apply broad spectrum sunscreen and take other measures to protect your skin from the sun. Doing so can prevent an outbreak of melasma and may reduce the risk of current melasma getting worse.Apply sunscreen 20 minutes before you anticipate being out in the sun. Look for a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, and consider getting one with added nutrients, like zinc, to benefit your skin.
You could try “double” sun screening, as well. Layer an SPF 15 sunscreen on beneath an SPF 30 sunscreen for even more protection.
Wear a wide-brimmed hat and large sunglasses to provide your face with additional protection. If your melasma is especially bad, you might also want to consider wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants. Try to stay out of direct sunlight as much as possible.

, Stress can worsen hormonal imbalances, and if a hormonal imbalance is the cause of your melasma, finding ways to stress less can help treat your melasma.If you have difficulty relaxing, try techniques like meditation or yoga. If these do not work for you or do not appeal to you, simply make time for more things you enjoy—whether that includes walks through the park, reading, or taking a bubble bath.

, These medicated ointments lighten the skin, causing melasma outbursts to fade.Hydroquinone comes as a cream, lotion, gel, or liquid. It works by blocking the natural chemical process in your skin responsible for creating melanin, and since melanin produces dark skin pigmentation, the amount of dark pigmentation related to melasma will also be reduced.
There are even hydroquinone creams that contain a little sunblock, so if you want to protect your skin while treating it for melasma, these options provide an all-in-one opportunity for you to do so.
Nonprescription hydroquinone creams usually have a concentration of 2 percent or less.

, Naturally present in human body cells, cysteamine is safe and proven to treat melasma.Cysteamine, is the natural product of L-cysteine metabolism in the human body. It acts as an intrinsic antioxidant and is known for its protective role against ionizing radiation and as an antimutagenic agent. Cysteamine acts via the inhibition of melanin synthesis to produce depigmentation.

, Both ingredients are skin brighteners, but they tend to be less harsh and less of an irritant than hydroquinone. These ingredients slow down the production of skin-darkening pigmentation in your skin. As a result, new skin cells being produced will be less dark, making it more difficult for melasma to set in., This is a type of vitamin A that increases the rate at which your skin sheds dead cells. This can help patches of melasma fade faster.Note, however, that this alone may not cure your melasma if the underlying cause has not also been remedied. The affected skin will shed quicker, but that will have no impact if your new skill cells are all affected.

, This plant grows as a small tree or shrub, and while it has many non-medical uses, the extract or products containing the extract can be used orally and topically to treat melasma, as long as you follow the instructions provided on the product., Other ingredients that have been known to help when applied topically include bearberry, watercress, mandelic acid, lactic acid, lemon peel extract, apple cider vinegar, and Vitamin C. These are all capable of relaxing pigment-producing compounds in your skin without completely nullifying them and causing irritation or sensitivity to light.

, If your melasma has been induced by pregnancy, it will pass when the pregnancy is over. However, it will be more likely to occur in subsequent pregnancies.


Cases of melasma not caused by pregnancy can last longer and might require more active intervention to treat."

Understand how the Chickenpox virus spreads.,
Protect yourself from droplet transmission.,
Wash your hands before and after touching the patient.,
Keep the patient confined to one room to reduce the chance that the virus will spread.,
Use contact precautions for extra protection.",How to Avoid Getting Chicken Pox While Helping an Infected Person1," The virus is highly contagious and spreads in the air through airborne particles that come from the lesions on the skin or from the upper respiratory tract. You can also contract the virus from contact with open lesions when you touch your face, nose, or mouth.The disease takes 10 to 21 days after exposure to develop.
From studies of transmission across household members, approximately 90% of people with close contact with infected individuals will develop the disease.
The person with varicella is contagious from one to two days before the rash breaks out on the skin and will continue to be contagious until ALL the lesions have crusted over.
Some people who get vaccinated may suffer from breakthrough varicella, which is a mild form of the chickenpox that includes a rash of less than 50 lesions and a slight fever. These individuals are also contagious. However, those with breakthrough varicella are only one third as contagious as those who were not vaccinated.;
, Take precautions when caring for an individual with chickenpox to reduce the risk of droplet infection. The varicella zoster virus is spread through droplet transmission or from direct contact with the individual or touching objects or clothing that were in contact with the infected individual.Droplets may come from a sneeze, cough, speaking, nasal secretions, and saliva.Wear a facemask to prevent secretions from entering your mouth and nose. A facemask should always be worn before being in the same room with the patient and a new mask should be used each time you wear one.
Wear gloves, a gown, and goggles or a face mask if the individual is sneezing, coughing, or producing a lot of nasal secretions. Droplets from a sneeze can travel through the air for up to 200 feet, so it is crucial to protect yourself., You should make sure that you wash your hands before and after touching the patient or after having any contact with the objects, materials, or secretions of the patient. Use soap and warm water to wash your hands.Lather your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.
Be sure to scrub the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
If you need a timer for 20 seconds then hum “Happy Birthday” to yourself twice.
Rinse your hands well under warm water and pat dry with a clean towel or use hot air to dry them.

, The patient’s bedroom is often the best room. If possible, have the patient use only one of the bathrooms in the home and be sure that no other person in the home uses that bathroom.Have the patient put on a mask when he or she leaves the bedroom to go to the bathroom. Any sneezing or coughing while out of the room may also spread the virus.

, Contact precautions include wearing a gown and gloves for any physical contact with the individual or other inanimate objects that may have had contact with the patient.When changing the bed sheets, entering the room, touching the patient, or handling any other objects, make sure that you are wearing goggles, gloves, and a gown.

Avoid a comb-over style.,
Avoid alcohol-based styling products.,
Part your hair in the direction opposite your natural hair growth.,
Grow some facial hair.,
Embrace accessories to accentuate your appearance.,
Avoid hats, which can clog your hair follicles and prevent hair growth.",How to Bald Gracefully," Use clippers to buzz your hair tightly to your head. This makes areas of baldness less obvious and is a good option if you’re balding near the crown of your head or around your hairline. This is a very wearable style if you’re nervous about shaving your head completely.You can do one short length all over or you can ask your barber to go a little tighter on the sides.
Most people who buzz their hair like to start out with a number 2 blade with a guard on their clippers. You can then go shorter (a lower number blade) to your taste.This cut works great for round and oval face shapes or those with long faces.;
, Follow George Clooney’s lead and embrace the classic Caesar haircut, which is shorter on the sides and longer on top. This style is best for a thinning top and receding hairline, as the short bangs are styled forward. Bring photos to a professional stylish to execute this cut properly.This cut is great for any face that is longer than it is wide, but particularly oval and heart face shapes., Use shaving cream and a new razor to shave your head completely against the grain using warm water. This will hide any hair loss, by removing your hair completely. It is also is the most low maintenance hairstyle possible.All face shapes look great with fully shaved head.

, Then, create a part on top to naturally hide some hairline recession. The effect is one of a very deep part, rather than balding. This style is best if you have lots of hair on top, but have a receding hairline.This cut is great for square and rectangular faces, much like Roger Sterling’s., The greater the difference between the longest and shortest hairs on your head, the more noticeable any areas of baldness or thinning will be. Avoid longer hairstyles, instead opting for short styles that deemphasize bald spots., If your hair has just begun to thin, use texturizing spray or volumizing powder to give the illusion of thicker strands. These products separate your hair less, helping to hide areas of thinner growth. Texturizing and volumizing products should be applied per the manufacturer’s directions on dry hair.Most texturizing sprays are applied much like hairspray, a fine, dry mist you can work through your hair evenly or concentrate in areas you want more texture.Apply volumizing powder to your roots and work through for oil absorption and lift., Many regular shampoos can clog your hair follicles if used too frequently. To keep your hair follicles clear in order to allow new growth, switch to a cleansing conditioner, such as Biolage. This will cleanse your hair while keeping healthy, natural scalp oils.Use the conditioner much as you would a shampoo. Work a dime-sized amount into your hair then rinse as normal. Additional conditioner is not required., Trying to camouflage your bald spot by combing your hair over it simply never works. It draws more attention to your baldness, isn’t convincing, and doesn’t look attractive. Avoid any creative combing to cover thin areas. Ultimately, this will be more attention grabbing than baldness, which is at least natural., Alcohol-based styling products remove moisture from your hair and can leave your already thinning strands prone to breakage. Opt for moisturizing products when possible to keep the hair you do have strong and in good condition., Parting your hair against the way it prefers to grow creates volume and an illusion of fullness. If your hair naturally likes to lay against your scalp to the left, for example, try parting to the right for some face-framing lift. This technique will make your hair appear thicker., Attract attention to your face rather than your head by growing some classic facial hair. Stick to timeless styles, such as mustaches and goatees in shorter lengths, for a trim and polished look. Avoid very long facial hair, such as a long beard, as this can emphasize the lack of hair elsewhere., Some accessories simply look better with a bald head. Accentuate your newfound baldness with a bold pair of earrings or a printed scarf. You may find that you can sport more adventurous accessories near your face now that you don’t have to style your hair.Statement necklaces and large, colorful earrings can make a bald head look stylish and chic.
Bold eyeglasses or an interesting necktie are also great options.

, Let the sweat glands on your head breathe by foregoing hats. While it’s tempting to cover up your baldness, wearing a hat all the time can clog your hair follicles and keep new hair from growing. An occasional winter hat to stay warm is all you need."

Take an over the counter medication.,
Try over the counter antihistamines.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat soft, gentle foods.,
Stay home.",How to Treat Chicken Pox1," When you or your child has chickenpox, it will likely be accompanied by a fever. To combat fever and reduce any pain, use over the counter fever reducers such as paracetamol or acetaminophen. Read all packaging information before taking any medication. If you are not sure if the medication is safe to take, do not give or take it before talking to a medical professional.



Do not give aspirin or aspirin-containing medication to treat fever or other symptoms of the chickenpox. Taking aspirin while you have the chickenpox can cause Reye's syndrome, which affects the liver and brain and can be fatal.Talk to your doctor about ibuprofen use. In rare instances, it can cause adverse skin reactions and secondary infections.;
, The major symptom of chickenpox is intense itching at the site of the pox. There may be times when the itching is unbearable or causes too much discomfort. When this happens, take over the counter antihistamines such as Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Claritin to help relieve the itching. Talk to your doctor about dosing of these medications for children; they may be especially helpful at night when you want to sleep.


If you find that you or your child are in severe pain or discomfort, see a medical professional. The doctor might be able to provide a prescription strength antihistamine., It is important to stay hydrated while you have the chickenpox. There is a possibility of dehydration while you have the chickenpox. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Also drink other hydrating liquids, such as sports drinks.


Popsicles are a great way to help children stay hydrated if they don't want to drink enough water., Sores may develop on the inside of the mouth when you or your child get the chickenpox. These can be very irritating and cause you pain, especially if you eat the wrong foods. Try soft, gentle foods such as warm soup, oatmeal, pudding, or ice cream. If there are especially painful sores inside the mouth, avoid eating foods that are salty, spicy, acidic, or too hot.


You or your child can occasionally suck ice cubes, popsicles, or suckers to ease the pain of sores inside the mouth., If you or your child has chickenpox, stay at home or keep them at home as much as possible. Do not go to work or school or let your children who are infected go to school. You do not want to spread the virus to anyone else — chickenpox is easily spread through the air or contact with the rash. Plus, you do not want to make the symptoms worse through overexertion.


Once the sores have scabbed over and dried up, the virus is no longer contagious. This generally takes five to seven days."

Understand how male pattern baldness works.,
Try Minoxidil (Rogaine).,
Ask your doctor if you should take finasteride.,
Get a hair transplant.",How to Treat Male Pattern Hair Loss1," Although androgenic alopecia is linked with the presence of male sex hormones (androgens), its exact cause is unknown.Male pattern baldness is caused by genetic predisposition and the main androgen believed to be associated with baldness is dihydrotestosterone (DHT).Increased level of DHT in hair follicles is believed to shorten the hair's growth cycle and delay growth of new hair.Over time, the hair follicles stop growing new hair; however, the follicles remain alive, suggesting that they may still be able to grow new hair.;
, Minoxidil is an FDA approved topical treatment to treat male pattern baldness. It is a solution that stimulates the hair follicles to grow and is applied directly onto your scalp.Minoxidil slows hair loss and some men experience growth of new hair. However, hair loss usually returns if the medication is stopped, so you must continue using minoxidil to continue to see results.
Adverse events associated with Minoxidil include itching, skin rash, acne, burning, inflammation, and swelling.Serious side effects that may indicate too much of the medication has absorbed to your body include blurred vision, chest pain, dizziness, fainting and irregular heartbeat., Finasteride (marketed under Propecia and Proscar) is an oral prescription pill and somewhat more effective than minoxidil. It works by binding to the enzyme that would otherwise convert free testosterone to DHT.Finasteride slows hair loss as long as you take it. However, as soon as you discontinue therapy, hair loss typically returns within a year.Side effects associated with finasteride include chills; cold sweats; confusion; dizziness; hives; swelling in the legs, arms and face; tingling; erectile dysfunction; decreased libido; and ejaculatory dysfunction; and weight gain., During a hair transplant, tiny patches of hair are moved from one part of your scalp to the balding area. Hair transplants are usually done during several sessions and although they can be expensive, the results are effective and permanent. Before the procedure, you will receive local anesthesia to numb the scalp.
During the procedure, a small section of a hairy scalp is removed (donor area) and the remaining skin is stitched together. Then, small groups of hair are carefully separated out from the donor area and inserted into the bald area.Thousands of hairs may be transplanted during one session
Hair transplants can cause scarring and bleeding, and there is a risk of infection.

Visit your doctor.,
Use a topical cream.,
Undergo phototherapy.,
Receive prescription medication for severe cases.",How to Achieve Psoriasis Remission1," If you have been unable to get your psoriasis in remission, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor can suggest medication and lifestyle changes that may help reduce your symptoms and help your psoriasis go into remission.


Finding the right treatment is pivotal to achieving remission. You have a better chance of getting proper treatment if you are working closely with your doctor.;
, Topical creams or lotions are usually the first medical treatment a doctor will recommend. You can get some topical treatments over-the-counter, and others can be prescribed by your doctor.Corticosteroids are a common topical treatment for psoriasis because they reduce the inflammation of lesions.

, Phototherapy is a treatment for psoriasis that shines sunlight or ultraviolet light on your skin. The process is conducted under medical supervision in a doctor’s office or clinic. After discussing with your doctor, you can also do the treatments at home with an at-home phototherapy unit.One type of phototherapy uses psoralen, a medication that makes you more sensitive to certain kinds of UV light. This is used with certain types of psoriasis, like plaque or guttate psoriasis.
Laser treatments can be used for localized psoriasis.
Phototherapy is not the same as using a tanning bed. You should not use a tanning bed when you have psoriasis. It may trigger symptoms.

, Prescription medications are available for severe cases of psoriasis or for those who don’t respond to other treatments, like topical creams or phototherapy. These medications can be take orally or intravenously.The two types of drugs prescribed for severe cases are biologic or systemic drugs. Systemic drugs affect the whole immune system while biologics only target certain parts of the immune system.Your doctor will not prescribe these drugs unless no other treatment has worked.

Determine if you have ever had the chickenpox.,
Decide whether you should have the vaccine.,
Ask your doctor about getting vaccinated against the chickenpox.",How to Avoid Getting Chicken Pox While Helping an Infected Person2," If you don’t remember whether you had the chickenpox or not, you were born after 1980, and you do not have family members who can remember, your doctor can draw a blood titer. This is a blood test that measures the antibodies in your blood for the chickenpox virus.


If you were exposed to the chicken pox and had the illness, even if it was a very mild case, then you will have antibodies in your blood that will protect you from getting it again.

, There are some people who should not have the vaccine to protect from chickenpox because of other medical issues.You can discuss your medical history with your doctor to determine if you should not have the vaccine. In general, you should not get the vaccine if you:


Have had an allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine
Are pregnant
Have allergies to gelatin or neomycin
Have an immune system disease
Have received a high dose of steroids
Are undergoing any treatments for cancer with x-ray, drugs, or chemotherapy
Have had a transfusion or received blood products within the last 5 months

, Getting vaccinated against the chickenpox can also protect you from contracting the disease. Although most research has been done on vaccinations prior to exposure to the virus, vaccination after exposure does offer some effective protection.However, it is important to get the vaccine within five days of exposure to the illness for best results.If you have not had the chickenpox nor received the vaccination, speak with your physician about being vaccinated.
Some people who get the vaccine will get a mild case of chickenpox with fewer blisters than normal and often no fever at all.The vaccine is made from live or weakened viruses.Children get the vaccine at 12-18 months and another dose between 4 to 6 years old. The most common side effects of the vaccine are pain, redness or swelling at the site of the injection. A small percentage of the children and adults who get the vaccine will also develop a mild rash around the spot where the shot was given."
"
Recognize the risks for specific populations of people who get the chickenpox.,
Be aware of the potential complications associated with severe chickenpox.,
Discuss treatment options with your doctor.,
Know when to seek medical attention.",How to Avoid Getting Chicken Pox While Helping an Infected Person3," There are several populations of people who are at higher risk of developing significant complications that can be life threatening. These people include:Newborns and infants whose mothers have not had the chickenpox or the vaccine
Adults
Pregnant women who haven’t had the chickenpox
People whose immune systems are impaired by medications
People taking steroids
People taking drugs that suppress the immune system

, In some cases, the chickenpox can have serious complications that require emergency medical interventions. Complications from varicella infections include, but are not limited to:Bacterial infections of the skin or soft tissue
Pneumonia
Septicemia (infection in the blood)
Toxic Shock Syndrome
Bone infections
Septic arthritis (joint infection)
Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)
Cerebellar ataxia (inflammation of the cerebellum in the brain)
Dehydration
Joint infections

, Treatments for the chickenpox are usually supportive and done at home. If you are at higher risk and develop other conditions with the chickenpox, then you may need hospitalization for treatment of the secondary infection and supportive therapy. At home treatments will help the individual to recover more comfortably.Common at home treatments for the chickenpox include:


Calamine lotion and colloidal oatmeal baths to help dry out the lesions and relieve the itching.
Non-aspirin medications, such as acetaminophen, to relieve fever. Aspirin products have been associated with Reye’s syndrome which is a severe disease that affects the liver and brain, leading to death.
Antiviral medications for people in a high risk group who may develop secondary infections. Those antiviral medications include acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.

, If the individual is being treated at home, it is important to know what situations require immediate medical attention.Call your doctor or take the individual to an emergency room if the individual:


Is older than 12 years of age for preventative supportive care
Has a weakened immune system
Is pregnant
Has a fever that lasts longer than 4 days
Has a fever above 102 °F (38.9 °C)
Has areas of the rash that becomes very red, warm or tender
Has an area that leaks thick discolored fluid
Has difficulty waking up or appears confused
Has difficulty walking
Has a stiff neck
Has frequent vomiting
Has difficulty breathing or a severe cough

Don't scratch.,
Cut the fingernails.,
Cover the hands.,
Dress appropriately.,
Stay cool.,
Apply calamine lotion.,
Take a cool bath.",How to Treat Chicken Pox2," The most important thing to remember about chickenpox is that you or your child shouldn't scratch the pox. Scratching them will make them worse and cause even more irritation and possible infection. If they are scratched too much, the sores can develop into scars that might remain after the chickenpox has cleared up.


This will be hard, but you have to try or make your child try., Although you should avoid scratching or letting your child scratch the sores in general, it is typically difficult to avoid all the time. Since you or your child will likely scratch yourself, keep the fingernails short and filed smooth. This will help prevent the nails from scratching the sores, which can open the skin, prolong the healing process, be more painful, and possibly cause infection., If you or your child is still scratching with short fingernails, consider covering the hands with gloves or socks. This will help to prevent injury. If you or he attempt to itch with covered hands, there will be minimal irritation and problems because the fingernails will be covered.


Even if you or your child are good about not scratching during the day, cover the hands at night because it is possible to scratch the skin while asleep., The skin will be sweaty and irritated during the chickenpox. To avoid skin irritation, don't wear tight-fitting clothing. Choose looser, cotton-based clothes that keep the body at a comfortable temperature and that will move softly against the skin. These are best to prevent discomfort.


Don't wear harsh fabrics such denim and wool., The skin will get aggravated and hot during the chickenpox, both from the fever and the sores. Stay away from locations that are too hot or humid because this will make you or your child hotter and make the skin itch even more. This means you or your child shouldn't go outside in hot or humid weather and you need to keep your house at a cool temperature.


Also avoid activities that will increase body temperature and cause too much sweating., Calamine lotion is a great remedy for itchy skin and can help heal the sores. Apply it as often as needed if the itchiness and pain are too uncomfortable to handle. The lotion will soothe the skin and provide an element of relief.You can also try other types of skin cooling gel to help with the pox. You can put hydrocortisone cream or ointment on bumps that are especially red, itchy, or inflamed for a few days
Do not use lotion with Benadryl in it. Frequent reapplication can cause toxicity as too much of the medicine is absorbed into your bloodstream., To help ease the itchiness of your or your child's skin, take a cool or lukewarm bath. Do not use soap that might irritate the sores. If your or your child's fever is bad, make sure the water does not cause discomfort and that it will not induce shivering.


Add uncooked oatmeal grains, baking soda, or oatmeal bubble bath to the water to help soothe the sores and calm the irritation.After the bath, apply skin calming lotion or moisturizer before reapplying calamine lotion.Apply cool compresses to extra itchy areas of the skin between baths.

Visit your doctor if you are older than 12 years old or if your child is less than 6 months old.,
See a doctor if your symptoms worsen.,
Seek immediate medical attention if you are pregnant.,
Get checked out if you have immune issues.",How to Treat Chicken Pox3," Chickenpox will generally run its course without medical help if the infected individual is under the age of 12. If you are older than 12, however, you need to see a doctor as soon as you notice the pox appear. Major complications can arise.


Your doctor will likely prescribe you Acyclovir, which is an antiviral medication that helps shorten the duration of the virus. Try to see your doctor within the first 24 hours after the pox appear for this medicine to be the most effective. An 800 mg pill of it should be taken four times a day for five days, but the dose may be different for smaller or younger teenagers.Antivirals may be particularly helpful for people with asthma or eczema, especially children.

, There are certain situations where you need to see a doctor, no matter how old you are. If you have a fever for more than four days, have a fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit, if you develop a serious rash that oozes pus or gets near or in your eyes, become confused, have a hard time waking up or walking, have a stiff neck, have a severe cough, vomit frequently, or have difficulty breathing, you need to see a doctor immediately.


Your doctor will examine you and decide the best course of action. These symptoms may be from a severe form of chickenpox, a bacterial infection, or another virus., You are at risk of secondary infections if you are pregnant and get the chickenpox. You also may pass it to your unborn child as well. The doctor may give you Acyclovir, but you also may be prescribed immunoglobulin treatment. This treatment is a solution of antibodies from healthy individuals that is injected to help people who are at high risk of getting a severe case of the chickenpox infection.


These treatments can also help prevent the mother from spreading it to the unborn child, which can have serious effects on the baby., There are individuals need to get special treatment from the doctor if they get chickenpox. If you have an immune disease, are immunocompromised, have HIV or AIDS, or are being treated for cancer or with steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs, you should get checked out immediately. Your doctor may give you intravenous acyclovir, but immune disorders may cause you to be resistant to the medicine.


If you are resistant, your doctor will give you foscarnet as a substitute, but the dosage and length of treatment will depend on your case."

Eat hair-loss fighting power foods.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eliminate stress in your life.,
Get a physical exam.",How to Treat Male Pattern Hair Loss2," Nutritional imbalances are often the cause for hair loss. Poor diet can lead to macronutrient (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) and micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) deficiencies which in turn can make your body unhealthy and cause hair loss. To support the health of your hair and your overall well-being, add some or all of the foods listed below to your diet:Eat red, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables (such as carrots, sweet potatoes, peppers, and cantaloupe) that are packed with vitamin A or beta carotene. Some research suggests that vitamin A promotes the growth and health of cells, including hair follicles.Promote healthy hair by eating fatty fish (such as salmon and sardines) that are packed with omega-3 fatty acids.Eat yogurt and other vitamin B5-rich foods that may increase blood flow to your scalp and consequently, promote hair growth.Make a salad with spinach that is packed with vitamin A, iron, folate, and vitamin C. This vitamin and mineral cocktail helps support healthy scalp and hair.Make sure you get enough protein by eating lean meat (such as chicken or turkey), low-fat dairy products, and protein-rich vegetables (such as beans). Hair is made of a protein molecule called keratin and thus, proper dietary protein is needed to nourish hair.Eat foods that contain vitamin B7 (also known as biotin), which may help promote hair grow. Foods to eat include eggs, fortified cereals, milk products and chicken.Eat zinc-rich foods, such as oysters, lobster and fortified cereals. Zinc deficiency can cause hair loss which is why you should ensure you are getting enough of this mineral from your daily diet., If your body isn't hydrated, your skin and hair cells won't be able to grow and flourish. To keep your hair healthy and growing, drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration.Aim to get at least eight cups of water a day and more during exercise or hot weather.
Caffeinated drinks (such as coffee, tea, and sodas) are dehydrating and thus, drinking these can actually cause water imbalance. Try to stick to water and unsweetened teas and juices and limit your caffeine consumption to one to two drinks a day.

, Although androgenic alopecia is not reported to be stress related, stress can cause hair loss. In order to keep your hair healthy, avoid factors that trigger stress in your life. Three types of stress-related hair loss conditions are recognized:Telogen effluvium is a condition in which stress forces a large number of hair follicles to go into a resting phase and fall out within months.Trichotillomania is a stress-induced condition in which you have an irresistible urge to pull out hair and is often triggered by stress but can also result from tension, loneliness, boredom or frustration.Alopecia areata is a condition caused by the body's immune system attacking hair follicles, which results in hair loss.Unlike male pattern baldness, stress-induced hair loss is not necessarily permanent. If you control the stress, your hair might grow back., Some health conditions and diseases can cause hair loss that is not related to male pattern baldness. If you are losing hair, visit your doctor who can diagnose the cause of hair loss and rule out any underlying conditions.Hormonal imbalances and changes (such as during pregnancy, after childbirth or during menopause for women) and thyroid conditions can cause temporary hair loss.
Scalp infections, such as those caused by ringworm, can invade the hair and cause scaly patches and hair loss. Hair generally grows back when the infection is treated.
Other disorders, such as lichen planus and some types of lupus and sarcoidosis, may result in permanent loss.

Try onion juice.,
Try scalp massage.,
Try fenugreek seed paste.,
Try other home remedies.",How to Treat Male Pattern Hair Loss3," Although more scientific studies are needed, onion juice may promote hair growth in patients who suffer from alopecia areata. According to a small study of 23 participants, applying crude onion juice to the scalp twice a day promoted hair regrowth within six weeks in 20 participants.Although this study was done in patient with alopecia areata, you may want to give it a try if you suffer from androgenic alopecia.
Extract onion juice by grating an onion and then straining the juice.
Apply onion juice to your scalp twice a day for 30 min, then wash off. Try this for at least six weeks to see if this natural method will help your hair loss.

, Massaging your scalp will increase blood flow to the hair follicles, which can promote scalp health and strengthen your hair’s roots. However, this method has not been scientifically proven to reduce or prevent hair loss and you should try it with that in mind.


Use coconut or almond hair oil, or other oils such as olive, castor, or amla (Indian gooseberry) oil. Optionally, you can add a few drops of rosemary oil or lavender oil to make a mixture.
Apply the oil by lightly massaging it into your hair and scalp. If you are using coconut oil, do not try to melt the oil using a microwave, use your hands instead. Coconut oil does not need much heat to melt. Repeat at least twice a week for a minimum of two months to see some results.

, Fenugreek (also called methi) seeds contain ingredients that may stimulate hair growth and enhance rebuilding of hair follicles.


Mix one cup of fenugreek seeds and water. Let it soak overnight.
Grind the mixture and make a paste that you then can apply to your hair.
Cover with a plastic bag or shower cap and let it sit for about 40 minutes. Rinse your hair and repeat every morning for a month.
As with the other natural therapies for hair loss, this method has not been scientifically proven to reduce or prevent hair loss and it might not work for you.

, There are numerous other home or natural remedies you can try. However, keep in mind that these are not scientifically proven methods and might not work. Always consult your doctor if you have doubts about a home remedy.


Try aloe vera gel, which may help optimize your scalps pH and promote healthy hair growth. Massage aloe vera gel to the scalp and leave it on for an hour. Wash off and repeat three to four times a week.
Try licorice root paste, which has properties that may help soothe the scalp and help reduce irritation. Mix ground licorice root (1 tablespoon), saffron (quarter teaspoon) and a cup of milk. Apply the mixture on bald areas, cover and leave it on overnight. Rinse off in the morning and repeat once or twice a week.
Try Chinese hibiscus flower that may help promote hair growth, cure dandruff, and thicken hair. Mix flowers with coconut oil, heat until charred and strain to collect the oil. Apply to the scalp at bedtime and leave it on for overnight. In the morning, wash your hair and repeat a few times a week.
Other remedies you can also try include beetroot, flaxseeds or coconut milk.

Find the right treatment.,
Be aware that a treatment may stop causing remission.,
Know that psoriasis remission is not permanent.",How to Achieve Psoriasis Remission3," Psoriasis remission occurs either spontaneously without any known cause or due to the right treatment. If you find the right treatment, your symptoms may temporarily disappear, which will put you into remission.Finding the right treatment may take some time. Work with your doctor to try different treatments until you find one that works for you.
The dosage and treatment prescribed by your doctor may affect how you achieve remission.

, When you find a treatment that puts your psoriasis into remission, it may work for awhile. However, your body may adjust to the treatment or what you need for your condition may change. This means you may have to change treatments after awhile.Work with your doctor to continue treating your psoriasis. If your symptoms return even while you are under the same treatment that has been working, your doctor can adjust your treatment to try to find one that will put you into remission again.

, If you find the right treatment, you may achieve remission. However, remission is only a temporary state for your psoriasis. Even if your symptoms go away, they will more than likely return.If your symptoms start to return, begin treatment again immediately. Early treatment can deal with the symptoms before they get too severe.

Schedule vaccinations between flare-ups.,
Receive vaccinations in warm weather.,
Get vaccinated before starting biological therapy.,
Try other vaccines.,
Avoid contact with the recently-vaccinated.",How to Avoid Psoriasis Vaccine Complications1," Receiving a vaccination while you're experiencing a psoriasis flare-up dramatically increases the risk of having an adverse reaction. Let your doctor know that you have psoriasis and try to work around your flare-ups to lower your risk of having complications.The psoriatic flare-up that can happen after you receive a vaccination is called a Koebner response.;
, Studies have shown that people with psoriasis are more likely to experience skin lesions in winter months than in summer.If at all possible, try to schedule your vaccinations during warmer months., Individuals with psoriasis who need a vaccination are more likely to experience flare-ups if they receive the vaccination after beginning biological therapy (biologics). If you've already begun biological therapy, your doctor will need to evaluate your case to determine if the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.


Never get live vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines if you're already receiving biological therapy.
Some live and live-attenuated vaccinations that should be avoided while receiving biological therapy include the vaccines for chicken pox, shingles, oral typhoid, yellow fever, intra-nasal influenza, and mumps/measles/rubella.

, Sometimes your options are limited with regards to which vaccine you receive. However, if you have the option, you should talk to your doctor about finding a vaccine with a lower risk of psoriasis complications.Not all vaccines will have alternatives available, though antimalarial medications are one type of vaccine for which alternatives do exist.


Many antimalarial vaccines cause psoriasis flare-ups. However, some are more likely than others to cause significant complications.
The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, for example, is the least likely vaccine to cause complications for people with psoriasis.
Your doctor is the only person who can safely make recommendations for or against a given vaccine, and it will most likely be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

, Some people with severe psoriasis may experience flare-ups after close contact with someone who has gotten vaccinated. These individuals can suffer psoriasis vaccine complications, even if they themselves have not received a vaccination.This type of flare-up is unlikely, but it might happen if you make contact with someone who received a live vaccination.

Reduce stress.,
Treat your hair well.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Incorporate herbs into your diet.",How to Reduce Hair Loss1," Having high stress levels can lead to particular types of hair loss.Try to stay relaxed. Practice meditation, take walks, or do yoga. Consider writing in a journal to help sort through daily stresses. Hair loss from stress need not be permanent. If you can reduce your stress levels, your hair might regrow.The following types of hair loss result from excess stress:


If you have telogen effluvium, significant stress pushes large numbers of hair follicles into a resting phase. Within a couple months, affected hairs fall out suddenly when you comb or wash your hair.
With trichotillomania, you have an irresistible urge to pull hair from your scalp, eyebrows or other areas of your body. You might do this to deal with stress, tension, loneliness, boredom, or frustration.
Stress also can cause alopecia areata. With this condition, your immune system attacks your hair follicles, which causes hair loss.;
, Avoid tight hairstyles, such as braids, buns, or ponytails. Do not twist, rub, or pull your hair excessively. Be gentle when washing your hair with warm (not hot) water. Do not brush your hair too hard. A wide-toothed comb can help you avoid pulling out excess hairs. Minimize harsh treatments on your hair like hot rollers, curling irons, hot oil treatments, and permanents., You hair shaft is comprised of 25% water. Drink at least sixty-four ounces of water (eight cups of 8 oz.) per day. This will help you stay hydrated and assist hair growth.

, Sage is thought to increase hair density while rosemary may stimulate hair growth. You can cook with both herbs. Try to use them weekly and buy fresh rather than dried rosemary if possible.Eating a nutritionally balanced diet will also help prevent hair loss.You also can mix rosemary with almond oil. Apply the concoction directly to your scalp in bald areas."

Limit your use of hair dryers.,
Avoid perms.,
Cut down on dyes and chemicals.,
Don't bleach your hair.,
Don’t pull your hair too tight.",How to Prevent Hair Loss1," Heat weakens hair proteins. Constant heating and drying can lead to brittleness and fragility that can cause hair loss that would not have occurred otherwise.Natural drying is best for you hair, so aim to dry it naturally more often than drying it with heat.


Other devices that heat your hair, including hot curlers, hot brushes and hair straighteners, can also have this effect.
If you do use heated tools be careful, because continually burnt scalps can permanently damage hair follicles!;
, Perming refers to either chemical straightening or chemical curling, both of which can damage your hair. It works specifically by breaking the inner bonds of your hair, and then reforming them in a different way to straighten or curl your hair. This weakens your hair, making it dull, dry and brittle.Over time dry and brittle hair can contribute to hair loss.

, Frequent use of hair colouring chemicals increases the chances of serious damage being done to your hair. Never colour your hair more often than every four to six weeks. When it comes to going gray, it's a lot kinder to your hair to let it turn grey than to dye it.

, Bleaching your hair removes your natural pigment when the cuticles are penetrated by chemicals. By doing this you are changing the structure of your hair and making it more susceptible to damage. You are making it weaker, so bleaching coupled with blow drying and styling can really damage your hair., Some hairstyles that require tight pulling and elastics or clips can be a cause of hair loss if done on a daily basis. For example, tight ponytails, tight braids, cornrows, and plaits can lead to significant hair loss when done daily.Winding hair tightly onto rollers, especially heated rollers, is also liable to cause more hair loss.The medical name for loss of hair due to hairstyles that are too tight is known as ""traction alopecia"" and it is completely preventable as a cause in and of itself!"

Try over-the-counter dandruff shampoo that contains zinc or salicylic acid.,
Apply the shampoo according to the label instructions.,
Use over the counter medicated creams to treat your dandruff.,
Apply mineral oil before using a medicated shampoo.",How to Prevent and Treat Dandruff1," If your dandruff is severe, you can try anti-dandruff shampoos that contain certain ingredients that kill the fungi partly responsible for dandruff. Look for shampoos at your local drugstore or pharmacy that contain:Zinc pyrithione: This ingredient helps to kill the malassezia fungi that is partially responsible for the development of dandruff. You can find zinc pyrithione in the brands like Head & Shoulders, Jason Dandruff Relief 2 in 1, and SHS Zinc.
Salicylic acid and sulfur: This ingredient helps to soften dead skin cells on your scalp, causing them to shed and release from your scalp and can be found in Neutrogena T/Sal and Sebulex. Be aware you may experience dryness on your scalp after using a shampoo that contains salicylic acid. You can use a conditioner after the shampoo to keep your scalp moisturized.
Selenium sulfide 1% to 2.5%: This ingredient helps to slow down the production of skin cells on your scalp and kill dandruff causing fungi. It can be found in Exsel, Selsun Blue, and Reme-T. However, this shampoo is not recommended for individuals with blonde or chemically treated hair, as it can discolor your hair.
Ketoconazole 1% shampoo: This shampoo has a powerful antifungal effect that can treat and prevent dandruff. This ingredient can be found in Nizoral A-D shampoo.
Coal tar shampoo: These shampoos can help to slow down the production of dead skin cells and prevent dandruff. This ingredient can be found in Neutrogena T/Gel, Tarsum, and Tegrin.
You should not use certain types of anti-dandruff shampoo if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Always read the instructions on the label of the shampoo before use and talk to your doctor if you have concerns about using the shampoo.;
, Once you decide on an anti-dandruff shampoo, it’s important that you apply it properly for the most effective treatment. You can apply all of these shampoos once a day or every other day until your dandruff is under control. The exception is Ketoconazole shampoo, which only needs to be applied twice a week.Apply the shampoo by massaging it into your scalp and leaving it on for at least five minutes so the ingredients have time to work. If you notice one type of shampoo has lost its effectiveness, try alternating between two different types of dandruff shampoos.
If the dandruff shampoo appears to be working, reduce your use of the shampoo to two to three times a week. If the shampoo does not work after several weeks and your dandruff is still severe, you should talk to your doctor about prescription treatments.

, In addition to anti-dandruff shampoos, you may want to try medicated creams that you can apply to your scalp to treat dandruff. There are two creams you can use:Corticosteroid creams: These can reduce any inflammation or dry skin and are available over the counter in either 0.5% or 1% concentrations. You can use them on your scalp on damp hair after you have used anti-dandruff shampoo.
Antifungal creams: These creams are effective as they can reduce the amount of yeast organisms living on your skin, including your scalp. Look for over the counter creams that have 1% clotrimazole and 2% miconazole cream. You can apply antifungal creams one to two times a day.

, If you have copious dandruff on your scalp, then you can also apply warm mineral oil at bedtime to help loosen up the scales. Cover your hair and scalp with a shower cap and wear it overnight. Then, shampoo your hair with a medicated shampoo in the morning."

Use topical retinoids.,
Apply topical corticosteroids.,
Ask about calcineurin inhibitors.,
Consider anthralin.,
Try vitamin D analogues.,
Consider cyclosporine.,
Take methotrexate.Methotrexate is a prescription-strength oral medication that can help slow skin cell growth and reduce inflammation.,
Look into biologics.",How to Avoid Psoriasis Vaccine Complications2," Some prescription-strength retinoids like tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage) can help treat psoriasis flare-ups.This medication reduces inflammation and helps stabilize DNA activity in your skin.Topical retinoids may cause photosensitivity in some individuals. You can reduce these complications by wearing sunscreen whenever you apply topical retinoids.
Some topical retinoids carry a risk of birth defects. Avoid using these medications if you are pregnant or nursing or if you intend to become pregnant while treating your psoriasis.

, This type of prescription medication can help treat mild to moderate psoriasis outbreaks by acting as a topical anti-inflammatory.Be aware, though, that overusing strong corticosteroids or using them for long periods of time can irritate your skin and reduce the effectiveness of this medication.Use low-potency corticosteroids on the face, genitals, and other sensitive areas.
You can use mid-potency corticosteroids on your torso as well as your arms and legs, as these areas are less sensitive.
Corticosteroid ointments work best for dry, scaly skin, but they can be oily and difficult to wash off.
It's generally recommended that you use lotions and gels to treat psoriasis on your scalp and apply corticosteroid creams to other areas of the body.

, Calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to help treat psoriasis in some individuals.This medication works by disrupting T cell activation to reduce inflammation in the skin and prevent plaque buildup.However, calcineurin inhibitors carry a risk of serious side effects. Ask your doctor if short-term use of calcineurin inhibitors may be right for you.


Some common calcineurin inhibitors prescribed for the treatment of psoriasis include tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel).
Be aware that calcineurin inhibitors may increase the risk of skin cancer and lymphoma. For this reason, most experts advise against long-term or continuous use of these medications.

, Anthralin can help stabilize the activity of DNA in your skin cells. It can also remove scales from the skin, leaving a smoother complexion. This medication is only available with a prescription, so ask your doctor if anthralin may help your psoriasis.Anthralin may cause skin irritation. It can also stain the skin and any surfaces it comes in contact with.Some people have experienced patchy hair loss after using anthralin.Doctors generally recommend short contact anthralin treatment to avoid staining. Leave anthralin on your skin for brief periods of time (generally between 10 and 30 minutes), then thoroughly wash it off., Some synthetic forms of vitamin D are known to slow skin cell growth, which may help certain individuals with psoriasis.These medications are only available by prescription. Be aware, though, that some vitamin D analogues may further irritate the skin.Common vitamin D analogues prescribed for psoriasis include calcipotriene (Dovonex) and calcitriol (Rocaltrol).
Some studies suggest that calcitriol may be less irritating than calcipotriene, but it can be very expensive.

, This medication helps reduce your body's immune system response, which may help improve psoriasis symptoms. It can also slow skin cell growth and reduce inflammation, much like methotrexate.Cyclosporine, like many other immunosuppressant drugs, can increase the risk of health problems. Do not take cyclosporine if you have cancer, compromised immune system, severe gout, kidney disease, high blood pressure, or if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or undergoing radiation treatment.The risk of adverse side effects dramatically increases when cyclosporine is used at high doses or for prolonged periods of time.

, Most doctors recommend taking methotrexate at low doses and for short periods of time, as methotrexate has been known to cause side effects.High doses of methotrexate may cause an upset stomach. Prolonged use can lead to liver damage and reduced blood cell production.
Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of methotrexate.

, Biologics are immunomodulator drugs that alter the immune system and improve moderate to severe psoriasis. This prescription medication is administered intravenously, particularly for individuals whose psoriasis has not improved with other treatments.Common biologics include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira) and ustekinumab (Stelara).
Keep in mind that taking biologics poses a high risk of infection, especially in patients who smoke, are older, have a history of infections, or who have diabetes."

Use medicated shampoos and solutions.,
Try coal tar.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Avoid Psoriasis Vaccine Complications3," Many over-the-counter shampoos and solutions can help remove dead skin cells and reduce the incidence of skin scales. These products typically include salicylic acid and are most effective for treating psoriasis of the scalp., Coal tar is made from petroleum products. It can be used topically to relieve itching and inflammation and reduce the incidence of skin scales. However, coal tar products have a strong odor and may stain your clothing and bedding.Coal tar comes in shampoos, creams, and oils. It is available in many pharmacies without a prescription.
Most experts advise that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use coal tar products.

, Moisturizing your skin is an essential daily task when treating psoriasis. Depending on the severity of your psoriasis, you may need to moisturize repeatedly throughout the day. Talk to your dermatologist about how to keep your skin healthy.Choose a moisturizer that is ointment-based, as this will help treat your skin better than creams or lotions.
If you have very dry or irritated skin, you may find moisturizing oils even more effective than ointment.
Moisturize your skin after bathing, during cold or dry weather, and any other time your skin feels dry or irritated.

Lower your stress levels.,
Protect your skin.,
Take a bath every day.",How to Avoid Psoriasis Vaccine Complications4," Stress makes an individual more likely to have a psoriasis flare-up after receiving an injection. Finding ways to manage your stress may help reduce psoriasis complications.Relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, and Tai Chi can help reduce your stress levels.This may, in turn, reduce the incidence of psoriasis flare-ups.
If at all possible, try to schedule vaccinations during periods of relative calm in your life.

, Some individuals experience psoriasis flare-ups after any skin irritation. This may include overexposure to the sun's UV rays and minor abrasions to the skin.Wear long sleeves/pants for several days after receiving a vaccination. Try to limit your overall exposure to the sun.

, When you bathe, you're removing scales and simultaneously soothing your skin. This can dramatically reduce the symptoms of a psoriasis outbreak and improve your skin's appearance.Try adding colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts, or Dead Sea salts to your bath water.
Use lukewarm water instead of hot water to soothe your skin and reduce the chances of irritation.
Do not use harsh soaps/oils, as these may further irritate your skin. Instead, use mild soaps with added fats and oils.

Apply topical, crude onion juice.,
Make a garlic and coconut oil concoction.,
Take a capsaicin supplement.,
Massage your scalp with jojoba oil.",How to Reduce Hair Loss2," Applying onion juice to one’s scalp has been proven to treat patchy hair loss.The sulfur content in onions boosts collagen production and helps your hair to grow.Researchers believe onion flavonoids might have anti-inflammatory effects.Although you can purchase onion juice in the store, to make and use your own, follow these steps:Chop an onion into fine pieces.
Squeeze out the juice with your hand or use a juicer machine.
Apply the juice to your scalp for about 15 minutes.
Gently wash your hair.
Repeat two to three times a week.

, Like onions, garlic has a rich sulfur content that can help regrow your hair. Coconut oil has plentiful essential fats, minerals, and proteins, which decrease hair loss and breakage. Garlic’s iron and potassium levels make your hair stronger.To make a garlic ointment, do the following:Gather several garlic cloves and coconut oil.
Crush the garlic cloves with a garlic press.
Mix the garlic together with one teaspoon coconut oil.
Boil this mixture for a few minutes. Stir gently.
After the mixture cools, apply it to your scalp in a gentle, massaging motion. Repeat two to three times a week.

, A study in Growth Hormone & IGF Research showed that capsaicin, the compound in peppers that make them hot, stimulated a growth factor associated with hair growth. Test subjects took a 6 mg supplement daily for five months. Talk to your doctor about incorporating the supplement into your diet., Rub the oil into your scalp and hair. Especially focus on areas with existing hair loss. Jojoba oil is an anti-inflammatory,which may be why it can help with some kinds of hair loss. You can find jojoba oil in health and wellness stores and in some grocery stores."

Visit a doctor.,
Take medications.,
Consider surgery.,
Use laser therapy.",How to Reduce Hair Loss3," If you are concerned about your hair loss, visit your doctor to discuss treatment options. There are a variety of alternatives, including medication, laser treatment, and surgery. Which option you pursue will depend on your budget, severity of hair loss, and available time.


In some cases, hair loss is due to estrogen deficiency or thyroid issues. Identifying and treating these underlying issues may correct the problem, reducing or ending your hair loss.

, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved two drugs to combat hair loss. The first, Minoxidil (Rogaine), is a non-prescription liquid or foam available at drug stores. Both men and women can benefit from this drug. For women, this is the only approved hair loss medication. Twice a day, you rub the product into your scalp. The product works to grow new hair and/or to prevent additional hair loss. Finasteride (Propecia) is a prescription drug available only to men. One takes a daily pill. Many finasteride users experience slowed hair loss and some may have new hair growth. With both drugs, you must continue use for the effects to last.Possible side effects of Minoxidil include scalp irritation, undesired hair growth on your face and hands, and a rapid heart rate.Some uncommon side effects of finasteride include reduced libido, decreased sexual function, and a higher risk of prostate cancer. Women who are potentially pregnant should not touch broken tablets., For long-term hair loss, hair transplant or hair restoration surgery are options. If you pursue this treatment, your surgeon would remove small skin plugs, which each contain a couple hairs, from your scalp. She would then put the plugs into your bald spots.


Your doctor might ask you to take hair loss medication prior to and following your surgery to improve your results.
Surgery for baldness is costly and can cause significant pain. You could end up with infections or scarring., Both women and men can treat pattern baldness with low-level laser combs like HairMax Laser comb. The procedure is FDA-approved.To treat your hair at home, you move the laser comb slowly from the front of your scalp to the back and then from the sides to the center. A beep sounds every four seconds to let you know when to move. A recent scientific study proved that laser combs (applied three times per week) do improve hair growth.Each treatment takes ten to fifteen minutes. You should treat your hair three times a week.

Identify how you are losing your hair.,
Discover the root cause of your hair loss.,
Be aware of risk factors associated with baldness.",How to Reduce Hair Loss4," You might have gradual thinning on the top of your head or circular or patchy bald spots. Does your hair come out in fistfuls? Are you losing hair on your head or all over your body? Do you have patches of scaling on your scalp?Noting your symptoms will help you diagnose what is causing your hair loss.

, Hair loss can happen at any time in one’s life due to many reasons. Changes in hormones, illness, burns, and trauma all might cause hair loss. A family history of androgenetic alopecia, or baldness caused by variations in the androgen dihydrotestosterone, also is a contributing factor.Hair loss is not caused, however, by poor circulation to the scalp, vitamin deficiencies, dandruff, or excessive hat or cap-wearing. Furthermore, it is untrue that a gene passed from a person’s maternal grandfather causes baldness.Androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness) affects both men and women. In men, hair begins to recede from the forehead in a line resembling the letter M. Women usually keep their hairline but their part widens.
Patchy hair loss, which appears as smooth, coin-sized bald spots usually on the scalp can indicate that one has alopecia areata.If you are experiencing significant changes in your hormones, like if you are a woman going through menopause, you may experience hair loss. Talk to your doctor about treating your hair loss at the hormonal level.
Physical or emotional shocks can cause hair to loosen. You might lose handfuls of hair when combing or washing your hair. Generally, your hair will feel and look thinner overall. Patches of baldness are unlikely.
Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, may cause hair loss.Treating the hypothyroidism may halt your hair loss.
If you have lost hair all over your body, this could be a result of some medical treatments like chemotherapy for cancer. Your hair usually will grow back with time.
Ringworm is another cause of hair loss. Patches of scaling can spread over your scalp. Further symptoms are broken hair, redness, and oozing., If you have androgenetic alopecia rather than hair loss caused by illness or trauma, understand associated risk factors. Men with alopecia are more likely to suffer from coronary heart disease, prostate enlargement and cancer, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Women who suffer from androgenetic alopecia have an increased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)."

Wash hair with mild shampoo.,
Choose a suitable shampoo for your hair type.,
Look at the ingredients to find a mild shampoo.,
Use a good hairbrush.,
Try a scalp massage.,
Test your hair for thinning if you're concerned.",How to Prevent Hair Loss2," Hair washing helps prevent hair loss as it can keep your hair and scalp clean (preventing the chances of infections that might cause hair loss). You should try not to wash your hair every day, since shampoo can strip hair of its natural oils — aim for every other day at the most. Provided you use a mild shampoo, clean hair will give the impression of more volume than dirty hair, which tends to sit flatter and more parted than clean hair., Getting a good shampoo will really help you to have a healthy head of hair, so take some time to find that matches your hair type.Consider if you have fine, dry, greasy or normal hair and try a few different ones to find what works. If you have dandruff or colour your hair, get a shampoo that is specifically meant for this.Protein-enhanced shampoos and conditioners that boost volume make hair smoother and thicker temporarily because they fill in gaps on the hair shaft, but they don’t repair damaged hair., Using a mild shampoo can help you maintain a healthy scalp and head of hair. Checking the ingredients in your shampoo can give you a good idea of whether or not it is mild. Avoid anything with sulfate, parabens, and/or sulfonate. Instead look for Isethionate or Glucoside to be the first ingredient after water.Common ingredients that contribute to a mild shampoo include sulfosuccinates, sultaines and amphoacetate.
Silicones, polyquaterniums, and “guar” can be good conditioning ingredients., How you brush your hair can have a big impact on the condition of your hair. Go for a soft brush made from natural fibres, and don’t brush from the top down, but from the underside out.Be as gentle as you can and don’t pull too hard.


It’s best to avoid brushing your hair when it’s wet, use a comb instead., A scalp massage with a nourishing oil (such as coconut, rosemary, lavender, or almond oil)will increase the blood flow to the surface of the skin on your head and your hair follicles. Rubbing and kneading your scalp warms the skin and boosts circulation so the cells in the follicles get plenty of nutrients which in turn maximise hair growth potential.A scalp massage can also relax you which will help your overall body function., Testing whether or not you're suffering from hair loss can be done using what is known as the ""tug test"". Take a small bunch of hair, about 20–30 hairs, and hold it between your thumb and index finger. Pull slowly but firmly; if more than six hairs come out at the same time, you may have a hair loss problem..


This is not a proven test, so be sure to visit your doctor or a trichologist if you think you're losing more hair than normal, remembering that we lose a lot of hairs each day naturally.

Have a healthy balanced diet.,
Consume plenty of iron.,
Eat enough protein.,
Consume Vitamin C. Foods with plenty of vitamin C help in the good absorption of iron, so try to combine iron-rich foods with those that are high in vitamin C to get the most out of the iron.,
Ensure you get enough Omega-3 fatty acids.,
Eat foods rich in biotin.,
Consider taking supplements.,
Know what to avoid eating.,
Make sure you are getting adequate calories.",How to Prevent Hair Loss3," Nutritional responses to preventing hair loss are simple common sense approaches to keeping you, your hair, and your scalp healthy. A healthy body is more likely to have healthy hair than an unhealthy one. It is possible that hair loss can be slowed by a healthy diet filled with vegetables and fruits.There are some vitamins and minerals (listed in the following steps) that can be especially helpful in promoting healthy hair and thus preventing hair loss.

, Iron is an essential mineral that is known as heme iron in animal food sources and non-heme iron in plant sources. Too little iron can lead to anaemia which disrupts the supply of nutrients to your follicles, potentially increasing hair loss.To avoid this, be sure to make iron-rich foods are regular elements in your diet.


Red meat, chicken and fish are good sources of iron.
So are green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach and kale.

, Protein is essential for strong hair. A deficiency in protein can lead to dry and weak hair, and ultimately, hair loss.Adequate protein can help to provide the amino acids that strengthen hair. It is often included in shampoos, but it's protein from your diet that will help improve the condition of your hair and prevent hair loss if you eat it in large enough quantities.


Get protein by eating seafood, poultry, milk, cheese, yogurt, eggs, beans, pork tenderloin, soy, lean beef, and protein bars.Vegans, dairy-free consumers, and others can get good non-animal protein from tempeh, tofu, whole wheat bread, peanut butter, brown rice, lentils, quinoa, nuts, seitan, beans, and broccoli., Vitamin C also help with your body’s production of collagen, which in turn strengthens the capillaries which supply your hair shafts.Good sources of vitamin C include:


Citrus fruit, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, baked potatoes and tomatoes.Blueberries, blackberries and strawberries are also good sources.

, These fats keep hair healthy and have a role in preventing hair from becoming dry and brittle.They are found in the cells that line your scalp, and also help keep your hair and scalp hydrated. They are important fats that your body cannot make itself, but have to be obtained through your diet.Include plenty of deep sea fish that contain Omega 3 in your diet, such as tuna, salmon, and mackerel.
You can also get these acids through seeds and nuts, particularly flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts.

, Biotin is a B vitamin that is water soluble. It is of particular importance for your hair, as a deficiency can cause your hair to become brittle and could accelerate hair loss.Good sources of biotin include whole grains, liver, egg white, soy flour, walnuts and yeast.


Whole grains are also a good source of zinc. A deficit of zinc can contribute to a dry, itchy scalp and hair loss., Talk with your medical practitioner first, but you might like to consider using supplements to prevent hair loss. The types of supplements to inquire about include biotin, inositol, iron, vitamin C, and saw palmetto.These are not proven to prevent hair loss, but some anecdotal evidence suggests they work.

, As well as knowing what’s good to consume, it’s best to know what to avoid too. The basic rules of a healthy balanced diet always apply, but there are a few particular things that can contribute to hair loss. The artificial sweetener, aspartame, has been cited as a cause of hair thinning and hair loss. Food additives can also have a negative effect.Raw egg whites contain a substance that binds biotin, which prevents its absorption., A low-calorie diet may lead to temporary hair loss. Your body needs minerals and vitamins (like those listed above) to build and maintain your hair. Cutting back on your food intake may remove these essential nutrients. In addition, cutting out too many calories can lead to major stress, causing your hair to stop growing, or go into the resting or hibernation phase.Avoid crash diets or you may find yourself shedding hair as you shed the pounds.

Know when to visit the doctor.,
Prepare for your appointment.,
Know the treatments for men.,
Know the treatments for women.",How to Prevent Hair Loss4," It's important to know when your hair loss could be a symptom of a more serious medical complaint, in which case you should see a doctor as soon as possible. Contact a doctor if you are losing hair in an unusual pattern, or rapidly at an early age, such as in your teen or twenties.Other symptoms to look out for are:


Pain and itching with hair loss, or a red, scaly scalp.
You have bald spots on your beard or eyebrows.
If you are a woman and you are experiencing male pattern baldness, abnormal hair growth on your face and body, or an irregular menstrual cycle. There may be an underlying hormonal disorder responsible for your hair loss.
You have been gaining weight, suffering fatigue, muscle weakness, or intolerance to cold temperatures., Before you go to your appointment, it's a good idea to think about the symptoms you are experiencing so you can describe them clearly to the doctor. Consider when you first began experiencing hair loss, and whether has been occasional or continuous.Also ask yourself:


Have you noticed poor hair growth, breakage or shedding?
Has anyone in your immediate family experienced hair loss?
Are you taking any medications or supplements?, Hereditary-pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss. In men, it is most commonly characterised by a receding hairline that forms a rough ""M"" shape. Although it is not a disease and is based on your genes, there are treatments that your doctor can prescribe to you.The two medications most commonly used are:



Minoxidil (Rogaine) is a topical solution that is applied to the scalp to stimulate hair follicles. It comes in 2% and 5% solutions and is applied once daily.
Finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) is a pill that interferes with the production of a form of testosterone that is linked to baldness.Women of child-bearing age should not touch or handle crushed or broken tablets.

, About a third of women experience some hair loss. As many as two thirds of menopausal women experience hair thinning or bald patches. Women rarely suffer a receding hairline, but a thinning at the part line develops into increasing diffuse hair on the top of the head.Some of the most common medications for female pattern hair loss include:


Minoxidil (Rogaine) is applied topically and massaged into the scalp. Minoxidil is excreted in breast milk following oral administration, so it should not be used while breastfeeding.
Anti-androgens are receptor-blocking drugs which are only very rarely prescribed.
Iron supplements are prescribed for some women, especially vegetarians, those with a history of anemia, or those who have heavy menstrual bleeding."

Apply aspirin to your scalp.,
Use natural oils to moisturize your scalp.,
Rinse your hair with apple cider vinegar.,
Use baking soda.",How to Prevent and Treat Dandruff2," Aspirin contains salicylates, which is an active ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos that contain salicylic acid. Aspirin is a quick and easy way to treat dandruff at home.Take two tablets of aspirin and crush them into a fine powder. Then, add them to your shampoo.
Apply the shampoo with the aspirin to your hair, lathering and massaging it into your scalp. Let it sit on your hair for one to two minutes and then rinse it out.
Wash your hair again with just shampoo to remove any lingering powder.

, Natural oils like coconut oil, almond oil, and olive oil can help to keep your scalp moist and prevent the development of dandruff.Warm up one cup of your chosen natural oil in a bowl so it is warm to the touch but not boiling hot. Then, apply it to your entire scalp, massaging it in well.
Use a towel to wrap your hair and scalp and leave the oil in overnight.
In the morning, rinse your hair out, removing the oil.

, Apple cider vinegar is a natural astringent and can prevent your scalp from becoming flaky and full of dandruff causing fungi. You can rinse your hair and scalp with apple cider vinegar after you have shampooed your hair.Mix two cups of apple cider vinegar with two cups of cool water.
Bend over a sink or tub and rinse your hair with the mixture.
You can also apply white vinegar to your scalp and wrap your head in towel. Leave the vinegar in overnight and then rinse your hair with regular shampoo the following day.

, Baking soda is a great home treatment for dandruff.Instead of using shampoo, use baking soda to wash your hair. Simply take a handful of baking soda and rub it into your hair and scalp. Rinse well with warm water.
You can continue to use baking soda instead of regular shampoo to wash your hair and treat your dandruff.

Try to wash your hair once a day, especially if you have an oily or irritated scalp., Styling products like hair spray, hair gel, mousses, and hair wax can lead to a build-up of oil on your hair and scalp, leading to the development of dandruff. Cut down on your use of styling products, especially if you already have an oily scalp or are starting to develop dandruff., Studies have shown that sunlight can help to prevent dandruff. But you should always put on SPF or sunscreen on your whole body before you go outside to avoid unhealthy sun exposure., Stress has been shown to trigger dandruff or make your dandruff worse.

Always get clearance from your doctor before starting to work your back. Ask her when you can start exercise, what type of exercise, what resistance weight and if there are any other restrictions.
Also ask her what types of pain are to be expected. Some generalized muscle soreness is typical and usually doesn't signify you've injured your back. However, more acute pain or pain similar to a past injury should signify you need to stop exercising and call your doctor immediately.;
, Poor form during exercise is one of the most common reasons for injuries.Since back injuries can be severe and debilitating, it's very important to ensure you always use correct form.


Consider talking with a personal trainer, exercise specialist or a staff member from your local gym. They'll be able to tell you how to do exercises, use the machines and have correct form throughout your exercise workout.
Try doing some of your exercises in front of a mirror. Watch yourself as you perform the move. Make sure you're using correct form and make any changes to your form as necessary.

, Whether you're recovering from an injury or are just trying to prevent one, it's recommended by fitness professionals to tone and strengthen more muscles groups besides your back.More than one muscle group assists or aids your back muscles in a variety of activities. Since your back muscles are smaller compared to others (like legs), it's the union of two muscle groups that helps make you stronger.
Focus on also strengthening your core, pelvis and hips. Many movements require the use of all of these muscles groups.Also work your legs. Whenever you're lifting (either at the gym or at work), you need to use mostly your legs with the addition of some back muscles to effectively and safely lift objects., Stretching is an important way to maintain your health and fitness, especially if you haven't exercised in awhile.It's important to stretch warm muscles. Do a light warm up and then do your pre-workout stretch. Also stretch your entire body, not just your back.Do a 90/90 neutral back stretch. This will help open up the muscles in your back, readying them for your workout. The stretch will also help your chest muscles open up and reduce tension in muscles and ligaments overall.
You might also like to consider a thoracic stretch. Place the back of a chair facing you to serve as a stable support. Stand behind this, placing your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees slightly. Push back through your backside; you should feel a stretch along your upper back. Hold for a count of 10, then move back up gently.
Another thoracic stretch: Sit on a chair and place your feet flat on the ground. Roll your upper body slowly forward from the waist. Place your hands beneath your legs and grip the chair legs. Then curl back up slowly.

, The plank exercise is an all-in-one movement that works a variety of muscle groups. Including your back, the plank also works your shoulders, legs and abs.This is a great combination pose for your body.


To start, lie face down on the floor. Push yourself up into a typical push-up position however rest your body on your forearms instead of your hands. Make sure elbows are bent and aligned with your shoulders.
Engage your core by rotating your pelvis forwards towards your head. Keep your body in a straight, rigid line for as long as you can hold the position.
Release pose and repeat as necessary.

, The bridge exercise functions as a back bend, a core strengthener and a balance pose.You should do this exercise on a yoga mat or other springy surface, since you'll be supporting all your weight on your hands and feet in order to stretch out your back.


Lie flat on your back on the ground. Bend your knees at a 90 degree angle while keeping your feet flat on the ground. Lay your arms by your sides.
Push your body upwards through your pelvis towards the ceiling. Your body should be in straight line slanting downwards from your knees towards your head.
Press to hold this position with your buttocks and back. Hold for a few seconds, lower back down almost to the starting position and then push back up to the top.
Repeat as many times as necessary.

, This yoga pose is a great exercise to help strengthen and stretch your entire back.Start this position on your hands and knees with your fingers pointing away from you.
Tuck in your toes and lift your knees off of the floor. Push up through your pelvis and point your buttocks towards the ceiling. Your body should look like an upside down V.
Straighten your legs however leave a slight bend in them.
Push your pelvis up and away from the floor and push firmly with your heels and hands.
Keep your core, arms and legs firm to hold your body in place. Let your head dangle in between your arms in front of you.
Hold this position as long as you can and repeat as necessary.
The downward facing dog is a fairly straightforward stretch, so if you want to challenge yourself you should take a look at the whole sun salutations series. This pose is a good resting position stretch at any time during the workout.

, This is an easy-to-do strengthening move that can help tone the entire back side of your body including your back.Lie face down on an exercise mat. Stretch your arms forward so they are laying straight out in front of you.
Lift your legs, with toes pointed away from your body, up straight in the air. At the same time, lift your shoulders, head and arm off of the floor as well. Your body should look like you're flying or in a slight U shape.
Hold this position as long as you can and then relax and repeat as necessary.

, In order for this exercise to activate your back muscles, focus on keeping it as straight as possible. This also assists in building arm and chest strength.


Lie on the floor face down. Lift your body up into a straight line balancing on your toes and hands. Make sure your hands are shoulder width apart and wrists are under shoulders.
Lower your body down (keep your body straight) by bending your elbows out away from your body.
Slowly lower your body until your chest is about an inch or two away from the ground. Push yourself back up to the starting position and repeat as necessary.

, This low-intensity exercise improves flexion and extension of the spine. Try to do the movements of this exercise as smoothly as you can in order to maximize its effectiveness.


Get down on the floor on your hands and knees. Use an exercise mat to make this exercise more comfortable on your hands and knees.
Flex your back so that it's curved up towards the ceiling. Press through your lower back upwards. Drop your head down towards the floor. Hold for a few seconds.
Slowly release the position and push your lower back down towards the floor so your back is concave. Extend your face upwards towards the ceiling. Hold this position for a few seconds.
Repeat this sequence as many times as necessary.

, Reverse flys help strengthen your shoulders and upper back. This exercise can also help you maintain proper posture.Stand up straight with feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees ever so slightly. Make sure to keep the spine neutral and core engaged —don't let the back arch.
Hold a small dumbbell in each hand. Lift arms out to your sides so they are parallel to the ground. While engaging your core bend your torso over in front of you until your body is close to a 90 degree angle.
Lower the weights and your arms down until they are straight in front of your face with arms straight. Lift arms back up until they are parallel to the floor. Repeat as necessary.

, Doing single-handed cable rows can help strengthen your back and specifically target each side of your body at a time. This can also help correct any strength imbalances.Set up a cable machine so that the handle is at chest-height. Sit down in front of the machine with your legs straight out in front of you and stabilized by the machine.
Grab the cable handle and pull your arm back towards your body. Pull until your upper arm is flush with the side of your body and your arm is bent at a 90 degree angle.
Pull with your shoulder and back muscles, not your arm. Do not twist your body during the exercise. Repeat this exercise multiple times with each arm.

, This exercise uses a barbell to create resistance in your back muscles.Hold a barbell with both hands about shoulder width apart. Make sure your palms are facing down.
Bending your knees slightly, bend over at the waist until you're close to a 90 degree angle at the waist. Ensure that you keep your back straight.
Pull the barbell in towards your body around belly button level. Hold the barbell here for a second or two and then lower back down to the starting position. Repeat as many times as necessary.

Visit your physician for an examination.,
Familiarize yourself with the symptoms associated with tailbone injury.,
Consider potential causes of your tailbone pain.,
Ask your doctor about prescription drugs.,
Consider surgery if all else fails.",How to Alleviate Tailbone Pain1," Your doctor will know what to look for when evaluating tailbone pain. He may take x-rays or order CT scans or an MRI. The two most effective tests in diagnosing coccydynia are the injection of a local anesthetic into the tailbone area, to see if that temporarily relieves the pain, and comparing x-rays taken sitting and standing, to see if the coccyx is dislocating when you sit.


Your doctor could also look for pilonidal cysts, which are cysts that occur only in the tailbone region, and are caused by infection of ingrown hair follicles.Successful treatment of these kinds of cysts may help relieve pain or remove pain altogether.;
, You will need to visit your doctor for a diagnosis, but knowing the symptoms may help you determine if your tailbone is causing the problem. Identifying symptoms could also give your doctor valuable information. Symptoms of tailbone injury include:symptoms:


Pain in the tailbone or coccyx without pain in the lower back
Pain when rising from a seated position to a standing position
Frequent need to defecate or pain while defecating
Relief of pain when sitting on legs or only on one buttock

, If you injured your tailbone in some way, tell your doctor about it during your appointment. It may help your doctor to determine the correct treatment for your situation.


By some estimates, coccydynia is roughly five times more common in women than it is in men. This may be due to injuries to the tailbone that may occur during childbirth., Some medications may help to alleviate pain in your tailbone. For example, anti-epileptics and antidepressants have been found to be effective at alleviating tailbone pain.Ask your doctor about the possibility of taking one of these medications.


Keep in mind that narcotics are not typically given unless there is a fracture to the tailbone. If you have fractured your tailbone, your doctor may prescribe a prescription painkiller to help alleviate the pain. An x-ray would be required to determine if you have a fracture in your tailbone., Most patients who undergo surgery to relieve coccygeal pain have already tried nonoperative treatments with little effect. Exhaust the nonoperative options before you move on to painful, and sometimes debilitating, surgery.


If the pain is severe enough, occurs daily for 6 months or more, and/or it interferes with your quality of life, then request a referral to an orthopedist who specializes in removal of the coccyx."

Understand how an ICD works.,
Learn about your condition and the reason(s) why you need this device.,
In the first few weeks after the surgery, avoid putting your arm on the side the device was inserted over your head.,
Be prepared for changes.,
Carry an ID card indicating you have an ICD.,
When possible, stay away from anything that may cause interference to your ICD.,
Avoid rough sports that use constant body contact.,
Beware of driving, especially within the first few months of implantation.,
Respond calmly to shock experiences.,
An ICD may be a good choice for you at one time in your life, but sometimes health status changes over time (due to heart or other disease progression) can make the ICD less beneficial.,
Attend your regular appointments with your cardiologist.",How to Live With an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator,"


There are two main parts that make up the device: the leads, which are thin wire electrodes attached to your heart that monitor the rhythm, and the generator (often referred to as the actual ICD), which provides and delivers the electricity during a shock. Most ICDs also have a pacemaker function, as well.
The electrodes are attached to your heart, either in one or both ventricles, and continuously monitor the electrical impulses of the heart. When it detects a potentially life-threatening rhythm (arrhythmia), the ICD will provide one of three possible treatments:


Cardioversion: Giving a shock at a specific time during the cardiac cycle to try to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

Defibrillation: Shocking a large mass of the heart muscle to depolarize it, reset the cells (therefore, terminating the arrhythmia), and allow the SA node to reestablish NSR. This procedure is often depicted in the media with paddles/pads and the patient violently jerking.

Pacing: Using the built-in pacemaker, a series of short bursts of electricity are given in time with the heartbeat to slow it down.

;
,


People who survive cardiac arrests, have been diagnosed with an arrhythmia, and are at a high risk of sudden cardiac death are often candidates for an ICD implantation. Survivors of heart attacks may also get ICDs.
The two arrhythmias that ICDs treat originate from the ventricles of the heart. These are:


Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach/VT): An abnormally fast heart rate (over 100 beats per minute). This is treated with cardioversion if a pulse is found. However, if left untreated, it could degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (see below).

Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib/VF): The heart muscle is uncontrollably contracting, making the heart quiver rather than pump blood. It is an extremely dangerous arrhythmia because blood flow to the brain is stopped, depriving it from oxygen. This is treated with defibrillation. However, if left untreated for more than a few seconds, it's likely to degenerate into asystole (""flatline""); brain damage and even death occurs if this continues for more than 5 minutes.


Before the procedure, make sure that you fully understand your condition and the reason why an ICD is needed. Ask your doctors, read pamphlets, or even talk to other patients who have ICDs.

, Do all such actions with your other hand.

, Although your lifestyle will remain unchanged, there are a few considerations you'll have to make. For example, you may have to adjust your seat belt shoulder harness if the ICD was implanted in your upper chest. If you find an item of clothing creates pressure around your upper chest, you may have to stop wearing it. Adjust your lifestyle according to such things becoming apparent to you when going about your normal activities.

, When you're having any procedure done, tell your doctor, dentist, or other health care professional about your ICD.


Since it's made of metal, the ICD may set off metal detectors and other security devices found in airports and other places. Show your card to security personnel––keep it with your other travel documents for ease of retrieval.

, This consists of objects emitting radio waves or magnetic fields. Often, you will receive a booklet containing a list of electronics to watch out for. Some examples include:


MRIs (strongly avoid), radio-transmitting towers and ham radios.
Common household items such as cell phones, kitchen appliances, microwaves, hairdryers, and electric blankets are safe to use as long as they are 6 inches (15 cm) away from the device.

, Examples include football, wrestling, and boxing. Be alert and watch for any balls that could hit the implantation site. This may even include taking precautions as a spectator where there is a possibility that a ball could leave the field or pitch and end up in the audience area.

, You could suddenly become unconscious or startled when a shock appears, causing you to lose control of your car.

, A third to a half of ICD recipients experience an ICD shock in the first year of implantation.While it's likely that you'll be unconscious before the shock occurs, many patients often describe them as painful kicks to the chest. If you get a shock, contact your cardiologist promptly.


Planning is vital for dealing with ICD shocks. Being aware that they're a possibility and knowing the difference between when you need to seek emergency help or to make a doctor's appointment is important for reassuring yourself about the effects of the shock. It is recommended that you discuss post-shock actions with your doctor or cardiologist and rehearse your response so that when it happens, it feels normal to respond in a certain way.
Always have your ICD identification card and information with you or easily accessible, a list of your current medications and your doctor's contact details. This will reassure you and it can also help anyone else who needs to use the information to help you.
Train your family and friends in what to do if you experience a shock. Explain to them what to look for when it happens and how they can help you. Having a supportive team with you can make an enormous difference to staying positive after the shock.
Practice deep breathing and relaxing responses to help you to stay calm when shock occurs. Becoming hyper-aroused (such as panicking, shallow breathing, etc.) can escalate the impact unnecessarily. Some people recommended meditation as a daily action to help you stay mindful of your reactions to stressful situations.
Seek help for psychological responses to ICD shock. It is normal to feel anxiety or depression, worry and fear with respect to an ICD shock. These psychological effects are often associated with the uncertainty of when a shock will appear or what the outcome of it might be (including fear of death). These fears will slowly decrease as you get more used to your ICD but it's important to get help through talking to people who can reassure you.
For many people an ICD is better than no ICD; if and when a shock occurs, it is at least reminding you that you have the best care keeping you healthy. Consider your personal values, and ICD benefits and burdens, when deciding if an ICD is right for you.

, Discuss a plan for this possibility with your doctor, before the ICD is implanted.

, It is very important to get your ICD checked on a regular basis. During appointments, you will undergo an ECG to examine your heart's electrical activity. Depending on your condition, checkups may range from every 4-6 months to a yearly appointment. These times are also good for asking your doctor questions or if you have concerns.

Blood pressure checks are also part of a routine doctor's visit.


Make sure the right sized cuff is used. If the cuff is too large for the arm, the results will be falsely low. If the cuff is too small for the arm, the results will be falsely high.
Make sure that the cuff is at the same level as the heart.
Be still when the cuff is inflated. Agitation will raise peripheral resistance and falsely elevate the blood pressure measurement.;
, This is the blood pressure in vessels during a heartbeat, when the heart is pumping.If a manual cuff is used, the cuff is inflated until no pulsation is heard with the stethoscope over the brachial artery, then the cuff is slowly deflated and the highest pressure at which pulsation is heard is the systolic blood pressure.

, This is the pressure between heartbeats, when the heart is resting.If a manual cuff is used, after noting the systolic blood pressure, the cuff is slowly deflated further until no more pulsation is heard, which marks the diastolic blood pressure.

, Realize that one reading does not confirm you have hypertension. A diagnosis of hypertension requires at least three measurements above 140/90 at least three weeks apart between the first and third measurement. Blood pressure should be consistently elevated to diagnose hypertension., Your doctor can confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and order additional tests to look for possible etiology and evidence of organ damage. Basic tests include:Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine and urinalysis to look for kidney damage;
Serum sodium, potassium, calcium, and thyroid-stimulating hormone to look for an endocrine cause for the hypertension, such as Conn's syndrome;

Fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides to look for presence of a metabolic disorder, such as diabetes mellitus or hypercholesterolemia;
Electrocardiogram and chest radiograph to look for evidence of hypertensive heart disease.

, This occurs when your blood pressure spikes in the setting of a clinic or doctor's office (the ""white coat"" refers to the white coats doctors sometimes wear), but is relatively normal in other settings.Some believe this is caused by the stress of going to the doctor's office, but some believe it is a sign that you may develop hypertension later on.If you experience white coat hypertension, ask your doctor about the possibility of wearing a blood pressure monitor outside of the office. The data collected by this monitor, when worn for 24 hours, can help determine if you are at risk for hypertension as a long-term issue., There are usually very few, if any, symptoms of hypertension. Usually, hypertension is diagnosed by getting your blood pressure tested at the doctor’s office. The symptoms that do appear for hypertension are not the same for all people and often only surface when the hypertension has reached a critical level. These symptoms could include:Headaches
Shortness of breath
Nosebleeds
Fatigue

, If your blood pressure is above 120/80, you are considered to have hypertension, or high blood pressure. There are several stages of high blood pressure that change depending on the levels of pressure impacting the blood as it is pumped by your heart.120–139/80–89 — Blood pressure in this range is considered prehypertension which tends to get worse over time but is not cause for much alarm as long as it remains at these levels.

140–159/90–99 — Blood pressure in this range is considered Stage 1 Hypertension. This range of blood pressure is concerning, but manageable. You should begin considering lifestyle changes like eating a low sodium diet, losing weight, limiting alcohol consumption, and speak with your doctor about other preventative steps, including medication.

160 or higher/100 or higher — Blood pressure in this range is considered Stage 2 Hypertension. This is a very dangerous level to remain at and you should schedule an appointment with your doctor immediately.

, For most people, high blood pressure just develops gradually over a period of years with no identifiable cause. This is called primary/essential hypertension., Secondary hypertension is high blood pressure that is caused by some underlying condition. It develops more suddenly and has more drastic effects than primary hypertension. Some preexisting conditions that can lead to secondary hypertension include:Thyroid problems
Drug or alcohol abuse
Certain kinds of medications (like birth control pills, decongestants, etc.)
Kidney problems
Obstructive sleep apnea

, Smoking and chewing tobacco raises a person's blood pressure while they are using these products, but they have long term effects on blood pressure as well. The chemicals in these substances can damage the lining of artery walls which can cause arteries to narrow, thereby increasing blood pressure.

, Drinking too much can severely damage many parts of your body including your heart and liver, but it can also lead to high blood pressure.Drinking alcohol can also interfere with medication you might be on to control your high blood pressure.

, Too much sodium in a person's diet can cause them to retain fluid, which may increase blood pressure.Limiting junk food and other foods that are high in sodium may help lower your blood pressure.

, Potassium helps your cells balance out their sodium content/intake. If you don't consume enough potassium, your cells may hold on to too much sodium which can lead to higher blood pressure.


If you have high blood pressure, try eating more foods that are high in potassium like bananas, potatoes, yogurt, orange juice, lentils, pistachios, etc., Vitamin D can effect enzymes produced by your kidneys that affects high blood pressure,so taking a vitamin D supplement can help lower your blood pressure.

, High levels of stress can seriously affect your body, including your blood pressure. This is especially true if you use tobacco, alcohol, or food to combat the effects of your stress.


Try relaxing more without these substances by reading a book, taking a bath, going for a walk, etc. This can help lower your blood pressure.

Gently return to standing erect.",How to Do a Lower Back Stretch Safely1," Breathe deeply in preparation for your stretch - this will help oxygenate your muscle tissue, promoting healing and minimising lactic acid formation, which causes soreness.


Find a stretching area where you have privacy and are unlikely to be surprised. Although unlikely, a jerking motion while stretching can hurt your back.;
, Allow your arms to relax. They should drop and hang below you.









Pay attention to the way your lower back feels. It's normal to feel light tension like you might feel in any other stretch. If you encounter any pain while leaning forward, stop immediately and try a different stretch.

, At this point, stop leaning forward and maintain your position.









Be comfortable--do not bend to the point of feeling pain.
Do not bounce to get farther downward.

Try to crack your back while standing upright.,
Use a chair to crack your back.,
Lie on the floor.",How to Crack Your Upper Back1," This is a fairly safe means of cracking your back, and it can be done at your convenience during the day. However, you do need some range of motion with your arms to do this stretch because you need to place both hands on the center of your back.


To start, place your hands behind your back, one on top of another, at the center of your spine.Press both hands against your spine, and as you do so, lean backward.
Keep going until you hear and feel a slight pop. However, do not lean back past the point where it feels comfortable to you. If you feel pain or discomfort, then stop.;
, If you need to crack your back quickly at work or school, you can do so while seated. This works best if you are sitting in a chair with a short back. While seated, slide your butt toward the front edge of the chair. Then, lean back until your back is touching the back of the chair.








Place your palms on your forehead and exhale slowly.
This will cause your head and shoulders to sink down behind the chair.
Eventually, you should hear a crack.
Do not lean back past the point where it feels comfortable to you. If it hurts or feels uncomfortable, then stop.

, If you're struggling to crack your back while seated or standing, you can try doing it while lying on the floor. However, this exercise will require some more range of motion. You need to be able to grab your toes.









To do this stretch, lie on a padded or carpeted floor. Then, turn over onto your side and bring your knees in towards your chest. Then, extend your legs and grab your feet with your hands.Hold this position until your back cracks, and then turn over to your other side and repeat the stretch.
Do not attempt this exercise if it is painful for you to reach your feet. If you feel pain or discomfort when you attempt the stretch, then stop immediately.

Plan for a period of rest and recovery.,
Refrain from straining during bowel movements.",How to Alleviate Tailbone Pain2," Applying ice to your tailbone may help to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.For the first 48 hours after an injury to your tailbone, you can apply ice once per hour that you are awake. Apply a towel wrapped ice pack to your tailbone for 20 minutes at a time. After 48 hours you may apply ice for comfort, three times daily in the same manner.

, Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to reduce pain and swelling. These over-the-counter (OTC) products, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be purchased at any pharmacy or drugstore.Take 600 mg of ibuprofen every eight hours, or take 500 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours. Do not exceed 3500 mg of acetaminophen in a 24 hour period.

, Poor posture may be contributing to your tailbone pain. Try to sit upright, with your core engaged, your neck straight, and your back slightly arched. If you get a sharp pain when getting up from a sitting position, lean forward and arch your back before rising., Special cushions, with a section cut out underneath the tailbone, are designed especially for patients with tailbone pain. This may help relieve some of the pain associated with sitting down. It is possible to make your own cushion from a piece of foam rubber. Just cut out a hole in the center so it is shaped like a toilet seat.


Cushions shaped like a doughnut are not found helpful by most patients, as they are designed to relieve pressure on the genitals rather than the tailbone. Talk to your doctor about use of a wedge-shaped pillow.

, Studies show that applying heat to the tailbone area may decrease pain.Use a heating pad up to 4 times per day for 20 minutes each time.


Try a warm compress or hot bath if you do not have a heating pad.

, If it turns out that you have a tailbone fracture, there is no cast that can be placed on the tailbone. You will just have to rest and avoid any strenuous activities for about eight to 12 weeks.If you have a physical job, you may need to arrange to take some time off from work while your body heals.

, Some people experience pain while defecating as a result of tailbone pain. Do your best to avoid constipation by getting plenty of fiber and fluids in your diet. If necessary, take a mild stool softeners while your tailbone is healing."

If you cannot do four reps of any of these exercises at first, don’t worry. Do what you can without straining your muscles. You will find that you naturally build up to more reps with time.
Be sure to consult with a physician or physical therapist before adding more than the recommended amount of reps to avoid the possibility of straining your hands.

, Place your hand palm-down on a table. Flatten the hand against the table’s surface as much as possible. Hold that pose for thirty second to a minute,then release. Begin with four reps of this if possible.








, For a grip-strengthening exercise, hold a soft ball in your palm and squeeze it hard for five seconds before releasing your grip. Work your way up to 10–15 repetitions, performed two to three times weekly. It is important to give yourself two days’ rest between grip-strengthening sessions.









Do not perform this exercise if you have a thumb injury.

, Then bend your fingers so that the tips rest against the base of your finger joints. Your hand will resemble a cat’s paw. Hold for thirty seconds to a minute before releasing.Do four reps if possible.








, One at a time, touch the pad of your thumb to the tip of each finger. Make sure that each touch makes an “O” shape. Do four reps of this exercise if possible.









You can also do this exercise by touching your thumb to the pad of each finger. The shape made by your fingers will be more of an oval or egg shape.

, To perform this exercise, pinch a bit of silly putty or a soft ball between the tips of your fingers and your thumb. Hold the pinch for thirty seconds to a minute. Build up to 10–15 repetitions if possible. You can perform two to three times each week with a two-day rest period between sessions.








Do not perform if you have a thumb injury., Place your hands flat on a table with your palms down. Lift up one finger at a time, then lower it. At the end, lift up all four fingers and the thumb then lower them. Do four reps of this if possible.








, Wrap a rubber band around your hand at the base of the fingers. Extend the thumb and hold it before bringing it back in. If possible, work up to 10–15 reps. It is safe to do these exercises two to three times a week, but give your hands two days to rest between sets.







, Hold out your hand in front of you. Extend the thumb away from the hand as far as comfortable. Bend the thumb across the bottom of your hand to touch the base of your pinkie finger. Hold each pose for thirty seconds to a minute. Work up to four reps to begin with.







, This involves squeezing the fingers together and pulling the fingers apart from each other. Interlock your fingers and try to pull one hand away while the fingers of the other hand are squeezing towards each other trying to maintain the interlock.









For strengthening the thumb to the pad of your fingers, you can put a piece of paper between thumb and pad, squeeze, and with opposite hand try to pull the paper from between your thumb and finger.

Utilize both isometric and dynamic strength-training activities.,
Focus on tendons.,
Exercise with a high focus on grip.,
Use a hammer grip when lifting weights.,
Increase the girth of your grip.,
Use handgrips.,
Train progressively.",How to Exercise Your Fingers3," Climbers, bodybuilders, and others who use their hands and fingers for strenuous physical activity may also want to exercise fingers to increase strength. Two key components for exercising fingers include a balance of isometric and dynamic training activities.


An isometric activity means holding a static position for an extended period of time.A rock climber hanging by a particular grip while choosing his or her next move is an example of an isometric activity.
A dynamic activity means moving a part of the body while supporting a load with the same part.A push-up is a great example. You can see how you’re moving your arms during a push-up while supporting the load of your body on them as well.
Going from a dead hang (isometric) into a pull-up (dynamic) is an example of an exercise that offers both. You can even tailor pull-ups to include exercising your fingers by keeping your grip on the bar closer to your fingertips than the palms of your hands.
Make sure the when you are doing exercises where the hand/palm is holding the body up (push ups, planks, etc.), you are pressing through your knuckles and fingertips and not sinking into your wrists; this can cause wrist injury.

, Tendons are the sinew that connect muscles to bones and transmit force between them. Finger strength has more to do with the strength of the tendons that connect your finger bones to your forearm muscles than anything else.Tendons take longer to strengthen and less time to degenerate, so you must stick to a disciplined workout regimen.


For a general overview, you can find information at: How to Strengthen Tendons


, One of the easiest ways to exercise fingers is to keep the emphasis on your grip rather than simply the forearm and bicep muscles. When you transition too much of the load onto your arm muscles, then your fingers don’t get as intense of a work out, even when your hands are involved in holding the weight.








, A hammer grip is when you keep your palms facing one another during the range of motion while lifting a weight.Used most commonly with dumbbells, a hammer grip keeps the load on your fingers instead of resting it on the palms of your hands. This forces you to squeeze hard to keep your grip over several reps, which works both the finger tendons and associated forearm muscles.








, Another way to keep the attention of your finger tendons and forearm muscles is to use a wider grip.A wider grip means you will have to squeeze harder to maintain your grip. You can purchase a specialty strength-training item such as Fat Gripz to go over a pull-up, dumbbell, or barbell to add more circumference, or you can simply wrap a household item such as a towel around the bar.

, They may not be as glamorous as lifting large weights, but a plain old pair of handgrips with the metal tension coil between them can help you exercise your fingers as well. If you cannot find a pair, you can also squeeze a tennis ball, racquetball, or another household item with some give to it.








, Do not start by training to do chin-ups with only a few fingers on each hand or anything else beyond your training level. Tendon injuries require long periods of rehabilitation and often never return to pre-injury levels. The best thing you can do is train progressively.Finger strength will develop slowly, so start easy and develop a more difficult routine over several months rather than weeks."

Lower yourself onto all fours on an exercise mat.,
Breathing deeply, arch your back like a cat.,
Gently return to resting position.,
Repeat stretch as needed.",How to Do a Lower Back Stretch Safely3," Keep your arms and thighs at approximately right angles to your torso. Don't let your knees slide behind you as if you were about to do a knees-down pushup.








, Hold this position for fifteen to thirty seconds.


You should feel a light stretch in your lower back. You can fine-tune the stretch by making small adjustments in the way you arch your back.
Because you utilise your abdominal and back muscles to arch your back, this stretch doubles as a core-strengthening exercise. It's normal to feel a very light ""burn"" in the back and abdominals while performing this stretch.

, Allow your torso to bend toward the floor, forming a downward curve. Hold this position for fifteen to thirty seconds, feeling a light stretch in the lower back.








, An average cat-camel session consists of two to four repetitions.









Because of its core-strengthening properties, the cat-cow is a good addition to a well-rounded core workout.

Lay face down on a firm surface.,
Have them apply pressure to your spine.,
Ask the person to apply pressure as you exhale.,
Instruct your friend to move down your back.",How to Crack Your Upper Back2," To have someone else crack your back, you will need to lay down on a firm surface. The floor or a firm mattress work well. Lay on your stomach and place your arms at your sides. Have the person who is helping you stand just in front of your head.







, The other person should place one hand over the other, and then, they should place their hands in the middle of your shoulder blades. Have them apply just a light amount of pressure to start.







, Make sure that the person can hear your breathing. They should only push down once you have exhaled. It may be a good idea to have the other person instruct you when to breathe out and in, just to make sure.








The person should apply pressure between your shoulder blades as you're exhaling.
You will not hear a pop yet. The other person will have to gradually move down your back to produce a popping noise.

, The other person should keep moving their hands downward. Repeat the process of having them apply pressure as you exhale. The two of you should eventually find a spot that will produce a few good cracks.








Be very careful having someone else crack your back. It can be dangerous as the other person cannot gauge your comfort level. Communicate with the person throughout the process.
If you feel discomfort or pain at any time, ask the person to stop immediately.

Use an exercise ball.,
Do the leg-over-leg back stretch.,
Stretch using your bed.,
Perform a rocking stretch.,
Try the floor crack.",How to Crack Your Upper Back3," An exercise ball can be a great way to stretch your back, and it may also result in some cracking as well. To start, sit on an inflated exercise ball. Then, slowly walk your feet out in front of you and lower yourself onto the exercise ball so that your back is resting over it. Allow yourself to completely relax on the ball. Slowly bend and extend your knees to move your body forward and backward over the ball, so the ball rolls over different parts of your back.








This stretch is not guaranteed to crack your back, but your back may crack on its own while you lay on the ball. Try to be patient though because it might take a few minutes. Just relax on the ball and enjoy the stretch.

, Sit down on a mat with your back straight and your legs flat on the ground. Bring your right leg gently up and, keeping it bent, rest it over the left leg. Your left leg should be flat on the ground, and the right leg should have only the foot resting on the ground, near the left hip.









Bring your left arm across your body and wedge it on the right side of your right leg. You should feel the tension already. Using your left arm to push off of your right knee, twist your spinal cord gently back and to the right.
Once you have felt a pop, release the pose, loosen out some of the tension, and repeat, using the opposite leg.

, Lie down on the bottom of a bed, with everything above your shoulder blades hanging off the edge of the bed. Relax and slowly let your upper back and arms sink towards the floor. After you've fully stretched downward, do a full sit-up to bend your spine in the opposite direction, going back downward, sliding your shoulder blades farther and farther off the edge of the bed each time.








, This is a Pilates stretch used to loosen the muscles in the spinal column. Lie down on a mat and bring both knees to your chest, hugging them with your hands. Slowly rock forward and backward on the mat, building momentum as you go. Aim to feel each piece of your spine on the mat as you rock back and forth.








, Lay down face-up on some hard flooring (not carpet), with your arms stretched out. With your feet flat on the floor, bend your knees about 45 degrees, or enough to rotate your hips so that your lower spine is flat against the floor. You're trying to get your entire spine aligned with the floor.









Put your hands on the back of your head and push your head forward, so that your chin goes in the direction of your chest.
Press gently on the back of your head. Your vertebrae should pop gently in one to three places between your shoulder blades with very little pressure.
If you feel pain or discomfort, then stop right away!

See a doctor if you have persistent back pain.,
Do not crack your back too often.,
Opt for stretches over cracking you back.",How to Crack Your Upper Back4," Cracking your back can temporarily relieve back pain. However, persistent back pain should be evaluated by a medical professional.








Back pain can come in response to sitting in an uncomfortable position or strain during exercise. In most cases, it goes away on its own with time. However, back pain that persists beyond a few weeks should be evaluated by a doctor.
Depending on the cause of your back pain, your doctor will recommend a treatment. Back pain is usually treated with things like physical therapy and possibly medication. In rare cases, surgery may be required for back pain.

, Cracking your back can be fine once in a while to alleviate discomfort. However, cracking your back constantly can unnecessarily stretch out the muscles in your back. This can result in a condition known as hyper-mobility.








Hyper-mobility will loosen your back muscles, resulting in you losing function in your spine and the muscles and ligaments surrounding your back.
If you feel the need to constantly crack your back due to pain, see a doctor instead of repeatedly cracking your back.

, Stretching is usually better than cracking your back to alleviate mild pain. To stretch your back, flex forward and then backwards. Then, bend from side to side. This should relieve some tension.








This is best done in the shower after about five minutes of showering.

Ascend slowly.,
Get rest.,
Take prophylaxis medications.,
Try dexamethasone.,
Test your red blood cells (RBC).,
Purchase coca leaves.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat appropriately.,
Learn the different types.,
Recognize acute mountain sickness.,
Notice high altitude cerebral edema (HACE).,
Watch out for high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).,
Deal with symptoms.,
Take emergency drugs.",How to Prevent Altitude Sickness," When you are traveling to places in high altitudes, you should try to get there slowly. Your body typically needs three to five days at altitudes above 8,000 feet to acclimate it to the environment before traveling higher. To help with this, especially if you are traveling where there are no altitude markers, purchase an altimeter or a watch with altitude meter in order to know how high you have traveled. You can buy these online or from a mountain sport shop.


There are some other behaviors you should avoid. Do not go over 9,000 feet in altitude in 1 day. Do not sleep 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the altitude you slept at the previous night. You should always spend an extra day acclimating for every 3,300 ft.;
, Another way to combat altitude sickness is to get plenty of rest. Domestic and international travel can alter normal sleep patterns. This can cause you to become tired and dehydrated, which increases your risk for altitude sickness. Before starting your ascent, plan a day or two of rest to get used to your new environment and sleep patterns, especially if you are traveling internationally.


In addition, during your three to five day acclimation to your new altitude, take the first day or two to rest before exploring the area.

, Before you go on a journey where you will ascend to high altitudes, get some medication to help. Schedule an appointment with your doctor to get prophylaxis medications before you leave. Discuss your past medical history and explain that you are going up to elevations greater than 8,000 to 9,000 ft. If you're not allergic, a prescription for acetazolamide may be given to you by your doctor.


This is an FDA approved drug for the prevention and treatment of acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide is a diuretic, which increases urine production, and is known to cause an increase in respiratory ventilation that allows more oxygen exchange in our body.
Take 125 mg as prescribed twice daily starting one day before your trip and take for two days at your highest altitude.., If your doctor advises against acetazolamide or you are allergic, there are other options. You can take other non-FDA approved medications such as dexamethasone, which is a steroid. Studies have shown that the drug reduces the incidence and severity of acute mountain sickness.


Take this medication as prescribed, which is usually 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours starting the day before your trip and continue until you are fully acclimated at your highest altitude.
600mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours may also help prevent acute mountain sickness.
Ginkgo biloba has been studied for treatment and prevention of altitude sickness, but the results are varied and not recommended for use., Before you leave on your trip, you may need to have your RBCs tested. Schedule an appointment with your doctor for this test before you leave. If you are found to have anemia or low red blood cells, your doctor may advise you to correct this before going on your trip. This is important because RBCs carry oxygen to your tissues and organs and are needed for survival.


There are many reasons for low RBC, the most common is iron deficiency. B vitamin deficiency can also lead to low red blood cells. If low, your doctor may advise you to take iron or vitamin B supplements to correct your RBC., If you are traveling to Central or South America for mountain climbing, you may wish to purchase coca leaves while you are there. Though this is an illegal substance in the US, domestic people living in Central and South America use this to prevent mountain sickness. If you are traveling to these areas, you may purchase the leaves and either chew on it or make tea.


You should be aware that even one cup of tea can result in a positive cocaine drug test. Coca is a stimulant and studies have revealed that it induces biochemical changes that enhance physical performance at high altitude., Dehydration reduces your body’s ability to acclimate to new altitudes. Drink two to three liters daily starting the day before your trip. Keep an extra liter of water on you during your ascent. Make sure you drink as needed on your way down.


Do not drink any alcohol and avoid it for the first 48 hours of your trip. Alcohol is a depressant and can slow down your breathing rate and cause dehydration.
You should also avoid caffeinated products, such as energy drinks and sodas. Caffeine can lead to the dehydration of your muscles., There are certain kinds of foods that you should eat to get ready for your trip and prevent altitude sickness. High carbohydrate diets have shown in some studies to alleviate acute mountain sickness symptoms as well as improve mood and performance.Other studies have shown improved oxygen saturation in the blood during simulated high altitude experiments from the carbohydrates as well.It is believed that carbohydrate diets can improve energy balance. Eat a high carbohydrate diet before and during the acclimation periods.


This can include pastas, breads, fruits, and potato based meals.
In addition, excess salt should be avoided. Too much salt will cause the dehydration of your body’s tissues. Look for food and meals labeled with low salt or no salt added at the supermarket.
Physical endurance and conditioning may appear to be a good idea before mountain climbing. However, studies have shown there is no evidence that physical fitness protects against altitude sickness., There are 3 types of syndromes that comprise altitude sickness: acute mountain sickness, high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).


Acute mountain sickness is due to reduced air pressure and oxygen.
High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is a severe progression of acute mountain sickness caused by brain swelling and the leaking of dilated brain vessels.
High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) can occur with HACE, on its own after acute mountain sickness, or develop one to four days after traveling above 8,000 ft. This is caused by swelling in the lungs due to fluid leakage into the lungs caused by high pressure and constriction of blood vessels in the lungs. , Acute mountain sickness is a relatively common disease in certain parts of the world. It affects 25% of travelers over 8,000 ft in Colorado, 50% percent of travelers in the Himalayas, and 85 % of those in the Mount Everest region. There are many symptoms of acute mountain sickness.


These include a headache within two to 12 hours of new altitude, trouble falling or staying asleep, dizziness, tiredness, lightheadedness, increased heart rate, shortness of breath during movement, and nausea or vomiting., Since HACE is a severe extension of acute mountain sickness, you will start with those symptoms first. As the condition escalates, you will contract other symptoms. These include ataxia, which is the inability to walk straight, or the tendency to wobble when walking or walking diagonally. You may also suffer from an altered mental state, which can manifest as drowsiness, confusion, and changes in your speech, memory, mobility, thoughts, and attention span.


You may also lose consciousness or go into a coma.
Unlike acute mountain sickness, HACE is rather rare. It only affects from .1% to 4% of people., Since this can be an escalation of HACE, you may experience the symptoms of acute mountain sickness and HACE as well. Since it can come up on its own, however, you should watch out for the symptoms as a standalone condition. You may experience dyspnea, which a shortness of breath at rest. You also may feel chest tightness and pain, wheezing breath on the exhalation from your lungs, increased breathing and heart rate, weakness, and coughing.


You may also notice a physical change as well, such as cyanosis, which is a condition where your mouth and fingers turn darker or bluish in color.
Like with HACE, HAPE is relatively rare, with incidences from .1% to 4%., Even if you try to prevent altitude sickness, it may still happen. If this is the case, you should be careful not to make it worse. If you have acute mountain sickness, wait up to 12 hours for symptom improvement. Try also to descend immediately at least down 1,000 feet if symptoms do not improve in 12 hours or sooner if your symptoms are severe. If you are unable to descend, treatment with oxygen should help your symptoms within a few hours if it is available.. At this point, reassess symptoms for improvement.


If you are dealing with signs or symptoms of HACE or HAPE, descend immediately with as little exertion as possible so as not to aggravate the symptoms. You should then reassess symptoms for improvement periodically.
If descent is not possible because of weather conditions or other reasons, administer oxygen to increase oxygen pressure. Place the mask on yourself and the tube of the mask in the tank nozzle. Release the oxygen. You can also be placed in a portable hyperbaric chamber. If these are available, then descent may not be needed if the symptoms are not severe and you respond to treatment. These are lightweight machines usually carried by rescue teams or at rescue stations. If radio or phone is available, report incidences to the rescue team and give them your location and wait for arrival. , There are some medications that may be given to you on an emergency basis by your doctor. For acute mountain sickness treatment, you may be given acetazolamide or dexamethasone. For HACE treatment, you may be given dexamethasone. Take pills immediately and swallow with water.


Your doctor may also prescribe you emergency drugs in case of HAPE, which are non-FDA approved drugs for prophylaxis and HAPE treatment. Small studies have shown some drugs reduce the incidence of HAPE if taken 24 hours before your trip. These include nifedipine (Procardia), salmeterol (Serevent), phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (tadalafil, Cialis), and sildenafil (Viagra)."

Affected joints will swell and the skin may look read or inflamed.Any joint can be affected by gout, and sometimes two or more joints can be affected at one time.;
, Putting any pressure on the affected joint will be very painful if you are experiencing a gout attack, and even the weight of a sheet or a blanket can hurt the affected joint. You may also have limited mobility or be unable to move the affected joint at all.Sometimes, gout is mistaken for other forms of arthritis. If you are not sure if you are suffering from gout, you should get checked by your doctor to confirm your diagnosis., If you experience sudden, intense pain, you should call your doctor immediately. If left untreated, gout can lead to worsen pain and joint damage. You should seek immediate medical care if you have a fever and a joint is hot and inflamed, as these are signs of a possible infection.If left untreated, a gout attack can last several days, but usually goes away completely within 7-10 days.
Some people only ever experience one gout attack in their lifetime, while others may experience a gout attack weeks, months, or even years after their last attack.

No one really knows why this works, but it's kind of like you are 'swallowing down' your hiccup. This method tends to work best (meaning it only takes a few gulps to work) on young people and children, while adults may have to try it a few times.;
, Get a glass of water and two straws. Put one straw inside the glass as usual and the other straw pressed up against the side of the glass on the outside. Put both straws in your mouth at once, drink the water like you would normally, taking as big of gulps as possible.

, Put a cup of water on a chair, and sit on another chair in front of it. Bend down and drink as much of it as possible without using your hands to touch, hold, or tilt the glass.

, Fill a regular glass or plastic cup with water halfway full. Then, either lie upside down (over the side of your bed or couch, for example) or bend at the waist. Take a gulp or two of water (don't spill) and straighten out. If they're not gone, drink a bit more (also upside down). Like a charm!

, Overloading the nerve endings in the mouth with a sweet sensation may do the trick. Have a teaspoonful of sugar, the sugar overload will pack the most punch.  This has not been proven to be the best method though so think about trying it as a last resort if you are desperate.

, Bite into the wedge, sucking in the juice. Sugar may be added to the lemon to ease the taste.


The taste elicits a similar reaction as to someone scaring you. It's your body's way of going oh my goodness when it tastes the lemon.
Place 4 or 5 drops of Angostura Bitters on a lemon wedge, if you want to play bartender. This helps the taste and some people think it works more effectively.

, Drink about a half a teaspoon of either every 7-10 seconds until your hiccups stop. Don't like pickle juice or vinegar? Well, hey, that's even more motivation!

, Not only does it make the medicine go down, but it could get rid of your hiccups too. Take a spoon and fill it with brown sugar (or honey), holding the spoon in your mouth for five seconds. Swallow and take a sip of water.


If this doesn't work straight away, it's not advisable to ingest spoonful after spoonful of sugar. Switch methods if you need.

, Get a big tablespoon of peanut butter and put it in your mouth and hold it for 5-10 seconds. Then, swallow the peanut butter without chewing. The saliva should've broken down the peanut butter a bit, making it easier to swallow.


Alternatively you can use Almond Butter or Nutella. Anything with a sticky gooey consistency similar to peanut butter will do.

, Swallow 1 teaspoon (5 g) of salt, followed by a small sip of water. Make sure to follow it up with slow breaths, staying relaxed.

, Make sure you are not drinking other beverages than water because it doesn't work as effectively as water.  This may not always work."

Recognize a runny nose as a viral symptom.,
Consider a viral cause for your cough.,
Notice if you start improving within four days.,
Get tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) if you have constant fatigue.,
Check the roof of your mouth for a rash.,
Feel for tenderness over your spleen.",How to Differentiate Bacterial Tonsillitis and Viral Tonsillitis1," If a virus causes your tonsillitis, you’re more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. A general feeling of being unwell and a fever can occur with either viral or bacterial infection, but the fever is usually lower if you have a virus – closer to 100.4°F (38°C) than 102°F (38.9°C)., You may have a cough with either cause, but a cough and a husky voice are more commonly associated with viral illness. Coughing and voice changes can be caused by laryngitis, usually a viral ailment that goes along with tonsillitis., Tonsillitis caused by a virus usually goes away or at least begins to improve within three to four days, so if you start to feel better after that time you likely have a passing viral infection. Bacterial tonsillitis can last much longer, or even until medically treated.See your doctor if you see no improvement in symptoms after four days — you may have a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics.
Even viral tonsillitis can last up to two weeks, so a longer illness isn’t a definite sign of a bacterial infection., EBV is the usual cause of mononucleosis, or “mono.” Mono is a common cause of tonsillitis in young adults and teens. Mono can last for weeks, and is often associated with fatigue, sore throat and tonsillitis, fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, and headache.Mono will pass on its own and usually doesn’t require treatment, but you should still get diagnosed. This can be done with a simple blood test.

, Some people with mono also get a pinpoint red, speckled rash on the roof of their mouth. Open wide and look at the top of your mouth in a mirror. Red speckles can indicate mono.Mono can occur with or without a skin rash, too.
While looking in your mouth, also check for a gray membrane covering your tonsils. This is another sign of mono., Gently feel over the area of your spleen — under your ribcage, above your stomach, on the left side of your torso. Your spleen may enlarge if you have mono and feel tender when pressed. Be gentle! A swollen spleen can rupture if handled roughly."

Strain the tea and enjoy.",How to Cure Stomach Ache with Ginger1," Before you get started preparing your ginger tea, it's a good idea to gather up all of your ingredients and tools. Having everything in front of you can help making the tea to be both easier and faster. Take a few minutes to make sure you have the following ingredients and tools:A ginger root.
Something to peel the ginger with.
About 2 cups of water.
Honey or other optional ingredients you might want to add for flavor.;
, Washing the ginger before you prepare it can help remove any pesticides, dirt or other material from the ginger. You'll also want to remove the outside skin of the ginger root before you brew it as a tea, as it can affect the flavor.Make sure you scrub the ginger thoroughly.
Peel the entire skin off of the ginger root.

, After you have washed and peeled the ginger root, you can cut it into slices to prepare it for the blender. Cutting the ginger into slices will help it soak into the tea more easily, resulting in a stronger flavor. Try to get the ginger root into the thinnest slices that you can before adding it to the tea.You could also try grating the ginger instead of cutting it.
You will only need to use about one or two inches of prepared ginger root.

, Once you've prepared the ginger, you can get the tea water ready. Add about two cups of water to a tea kettle. Turn the heat on and bring the tea water to a boil. Add your ginger to the boiling water and continue the boil for around three minutes before removing everything from the heat.Don't leave anything on the stove-top unattended.
You can experiment with how much ginger and water you use to find the perfect flavor.

, Once you've removed the tea from the heat, all that's left to do is strain out the ginger pieces. Run the tea water through a strainer to catch the larger pieces of ginger, leaving you with only the ginger tea water. Add any other flavors you might want, wait for it to cool a bit and enjoy.You might want to add honey to sweeten the flavor of your tea.
Adding a pinch of sugar can be a quick way to sweeten the tea.

, Sitz baths technically only have a few inches of water to soak the anus but if you prefer a full bath, it can accomplish the same thing. If you prefer the traditional Sitz bath, just fill the tub with a few inches of water or buy a Sitz bath at any pharmacy or medical supply store. Some of the commercial bags come with tubing and vents to allow water to constantly circulate. These provide a constant supply of water that is useful but not essential; the same effects can be accomplished at home using the tub. These baths allow for better circulation in the anal area and for relaxation and healing of the tissues around the anus.Add about one cup of epsom salts to a full bathtub or two to three tablespoons of epsom salts for a few inches of water in the tub. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. Repeat two to three times a day.
Fill your bathtub with about 6 inches (15 cm) of warm water and add a handful of Epsom salt to the mix, stirring it up so it dissolves. Now sit in the bathtub with your knees flexed for fifteen minutes. Flexing the knees will expose your anus to the water and the warm water will soothe the pain and the inflammation.

, Get a clean, cotton wash towel and soak it in warm (but not hot) water. Apply the compress for about 10 to 15 minutes, directly on the pile. Repeat four to five times a day., Ice packs can help reduce the swelling of piles. You can use already-made ice packs or place some ice into a plastic bag and wrap in a piece of cloth. Place it onto the hemorrhoid region.Only use ice packs for five to ten minutes at a time. Do not apply ice directly onto your skin because it can had adverse affects on your skin (like frostbite).

, Maintaining hygiene is important for anyone who is suffering hemorrhoids because it prevents complications from arising, like infections or blistering of anal mucosa due to excessive dryness. To prevent these complications you can use unscented cotton wet wipes to gently wipe the anal region after every bowel movement.After a Sitz bath — and in general — avoid wiping with regular toilet paper or hard towels. One must use soft and gentle methods of cleaning. Baby wipes are one of the most effective and soothing wipes to use.
In addition, avoid perfumed toilet paper or colored toilet paper. The chemicals that lend it the pleasant scent or the color can cause local irritation.

, Witch hazel is a natural antioxidant and astringent, which helps soothe the engorged hemorrhoids and makes them less sore. It can be applied directly with cotton swabs. It also helps to reduce the itching of piles significantly.Repeat as often as needed. Try to apply witch hazel at least four to five times a day.
Warm olive oil is an alternative to witch hazel. Olive oil also takes care of the dryness of the region by being a superb lubricant rich in antioxidants.
You could also apply warm, wet tea bags to sooth the pain in the anal region. Take care to ensure that the tea bag is not too hot. Tea contains a natural astringent which helps to reduce swelling, while the warmth of the tea bag works to relieve pain.

, After having a bath and letting yourself fully dry off, use a small amount of aloe vera gel or Preparation H to help with hemorrhoidal pain and/or discomfort. Apply as often as needed.Aloe vera gel contains components that have been shown to inhibit infection and help in healing minor wounds. You can use the gel straight from an aloe plant by taking a large leaf and cutting it open to release the gel. Alternatively, you can purchase 100% all natural aloe vera gel from the drugstore.
Preparation H ointment, available in most grocery stores, contains petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrine — the phenylephrine acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid.

, Beetroot and carrots can be crushed to extract their juice. A thick piece of cotton or a big gauze piece can be soaked in the juice and then applied on the swollen veins. Initial research has shown beetroot can reduce high blood pressure and might help reduce swelling of the engorged hemorrhoids., There are different types of herbs that can act as natural laxatives. Some good options include:



Senna: A natural and gentle stool softener. You can take senna as tablets (following manufacturer’s instructions) or as a nightly tea.Psyllium: A natural bulking and softening agent. Adults can take between 1/2 and two teaspoons of psyllium (such as Metamucil) in 8 ounces of water once daily. The psyllium should be added to the water, stirred and drunk immediately (the mixture thickens quickly). You may want to start with 1/2 teaspoon and increase the dose by 1/2 teaspoon the next day if passing stool is still uncomfortable.Flaxseeds: Add as a bulking agent to foods such as cereals, salads, soups and smoothies. Adding two to three tablespoons of flaxseed daily can ease the passage of stools., You might have a few things in your kitchen that you didn't know could help with piles. Here are some ideas:


Bitter gourd leaves, when crushed, can be applied locally to relieve the pain caused by piles.Baking soda can be applied as a powder or as a paste on the swollen veins (use one tablespoon of baking soda and mix with water). Make sure to only leave it on for 15 minutes as the paste could dry out the area and worsen the situation.About five millimeters of the latex or juice of the banyan tree, when added to a glass of milk and consumed once daily (especially in the morning), is beneficial for patients with piles.
A mixture of ginger and honey, boiled to make a decoction (an extraction through boiling) and then spiced with a dash of sweet lime and mint leaves helps detoxify the body and cool the system. It will ensure a good blood supply to the piles.
Three teaspoons of honey boiled with two teaspoons of pepper and two teaspoons of fennel along with 500 millimeters of water makes an excellent decoction that can be consumed over the day.

, To make a mixture, add two to four drops of the essential oil of your choice to 2 fluid ounces (59.1 ml) of a base oil, such as castor or almond oil. Mix well and apply directly on external piles. You can use one oil or up to two to three oils in your mixture.Lavender oil can help relieve pain and itching.
Cypress oil is used to sooth and help heal the tissues.
Tea tree oil is used as an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory oil.
Avocado oil can be used as a base or added to other oils. It moisturizes, soothes and accelerates healing.

, Preventing difficult or straining bowel movements by softening the stool is a major method of both preventing and getting rid of piles. Fiber is very important in this regard. It helps keep water in the stool and bulks it up so that the stool passes through the rectum and anus more easily and, in the case of hemorrhoids, with less pain. Good sources of fiber include:Whole grains, including brown rice, barley, corn, rye, bulgur wheat, kasha (buckwheat) and oatmeal.
Fruits, especially cherries, blueberries, plums, prunes, apricots, raspberries and strawberries.
Vegetables, such as leafy vegetables like Swiss chard, collard greens, spinach, lettuces, beet greens.
Beans and legumes. Note: Eating beans and legumes can increase intestinal gas.

, An adequate consumption of water cannot be emphasized enough. A minimum of eight to 10 8-oz glasses per day is recommended. Sufficient water intake helps keep the bowel movement soft and keeps the area well hydrated and lubricated. Not to mention water is good for your skin, hair, nails, and organs, too., Vitamin C along with anthocyanins helps keep your veins strong and can protect against straining or tearing in the anus.Citrus and other fruits often also contain bioflavonoids, which help strengthen your veins. Fruits rich in flavonoids are lemons and limes, apples and tomatoes. Anthocyanin-rich foods include onions, red cabbage and carrots and fruits like berries, grapes and cherries.
All varieties of berries, owing to their anti-inflammatory properties and being rich in vitamin C and flavonoids, ensure smooth passage for the stool. They're also excellent sources of antioxidants.

, Drinking beetroot juice has shown to reduce blood pressure by about 2% and may be helpful in reducing the swelling of hemorrhoids. You might try having a glass each week or eat a boiled beetroot each day for a month and see if you notice the difference.


Alternatively radish juice is one of the best options to flush out the toxins from the body as well as ensure that the stool passes through without any pain and discomfort. One must be careful with the quantity consumed, as ¼ cup of radish juice once a day is more than enough. More than ½ a cup can aggravate the symptoms. A little juice of turnip leaves can also be added to the radish juice or can be had by itself too.

, Piles can easily be aggravated by certain foods. For example, heavily seasoned food with spices and chilies must be avoided at all costs as it can greatly increase the discomfort and bleeding of piles.Processed food, canned food, and food with preservatives should also be avoided as they are very low in fiber and typically contain chemical additives that can aggravate the condition of piles. Fatty or deep fried food like meat, fast food, and french fries can also intensify the symptoms of piles due to their poor fiber, high-fat content and chemical additives involved.

, Straining is one of the main causes of hemorrhoids. Allow gravity to help, but let your bowels do most of the work. If nothing happens, put it off for an hour or so, but most importantly, don’t strain!, See if you can arrange a regular time to use the bathroom without interruptions. Regular bowel movements at around the same time every day tend to make bowel movements easier. Moreover, having regular bowel movements is a great predictor of overall good health.Don’t wait once you feel the urge to have a bowel movement. Go as soon as you can, but don’t sit for too long waiting since sitting is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhoids.Use baby wipes to clean yourself after a bowel movement., If you suffer from piles or hemorrhoids you should use 100% cotton underwear. Cotton is very gentle on the skin, which means it will minimize any irritation that you may feel from other materials such as polyester or silk. Cotton prevents itching in the piles, is absorptive and gentle on the sensitive piles.Avoid wearing thongs which may irritate the tissue surrounding the piles.

, The exercise can be aerobic, endurance, cardiovascular or just walking. The idea is that body movement can help keep your bowels moving by essentially massaging them. In other words, as your body moves, your internal organs move and get massaged as well. This can help with circulation to the piles and also help keep your bowels regular in general.It is essential that a healthy circulation be maintained in the piles, which are nothing but engorged anal veins. If the blood supply reduces, they might become gangrenous and lead to an emergency.

, Not sitting for long periods of time can be beneficial for people who suffer from hemorrhoids. Sitting can actually develop excessive intra-abdominal pressure and may aggravate the hemorrhoids. If you have a desk job, get up every hour and go for a short walk.Find a foam cushion or a doughnut cushion (a coccyx cushion) to sit on if you do need to sit for a bit of time. This can help relieve some of the pressure.

, Alcohol is one of the first things you should cut down on because it dehydrates you and causes your stools to be hard. Alcohol use can negatively affect piles and will not only hamper the chances of recovery but can increase the bleeding as well. It has been proven that prolonged use of alcohol leads to portal hypertension (swelling of the liver) and hemorrhoids.Try to limit yourself to a maximum of one to two drinks per day. This is the recommended amount, but you might want to try to drink even less than that if you are currently battling piles.

Loosen your clothing after meals.,
Do not lie down immediately after a meal.,
Drink a mix of baking soda and water.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for heartburn.,
Elevate your mattress.,
Go for a walk.,
Eat modest portions at mealtime.,
Avoid foods that trigger your heartburn.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Quit smoking.",How to Cure Heartburn1," While loosening your belt after a meal seems like a silly cliche, it can help in this case. Increased pressure on your abdomen and lower esophageal sphincter help push up the stomach acids that cause heartburn.Looser clothing, especially after big meals, will help relieve heartburn.;
, Sometimes heartburn symptoms are caused by plain old gravity. By lying down after a meal — when those stomach acids are most active — they can flow more easily toward your esophagus and get past your esophageal sphincter.Avoid lying down for 30 – 60 minutes after a meal.


Generally avoid late meals as well since you should wait at least three hours after a meal before going to bed., If you prefer not to take medications, then you can often alleviate your heartburn with simple baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). Mix one teaspoon in a glass of water, and drink it after your meal or when signs of heartburn begin.Do not exceed five teaspoons of baking soda in a day without first talking to your doctor., You can choose from a wide array of OTC products that target heartburn. The three most common classes of these drugs are antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors.Antacids (products such as Tums) provide quick, short-term relief for heartburn by neutralizing your stomach acid.H2 blockers—ranitidine (Zantac) and famotidine (Pepcid)—slow the production of stomach acid. These products take up to an hour to work, but they work for a longer period of time.Proton pump inhibitors—omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR)—slow your body’s production of stomach acid even more. These products are generally used for heartburn that isn’t controlled by antacids or H2 blockers and that occurs more frequently than two days a week., Sometimes people experience heartburn when they go to bed even after waiting several hours after dinner. If heartburn disrupts your ability to sleep, try slightly angling the head of your bed. By lying at a gentle slope instead of parallel to the ground, you can help alleviate heartburn symptoms.You can elevate the head of your bed by elevating the entire frame on one end, or you can simply put a wedge-like object between the boxspring and mattress.People report this method being more effective than just adding more pillows behind your head alone.By only using more pillows, you can strain your neck or simply roll off them in the night, defeating the purpose.

, While vigorous exercise after a meal can increase your risks of heartburn, some gentle physical activity can help alleviate symptoms.Try going for a walk or a calm bike ride when your symptoms start to see if the physical activity helps eliminate heartburn symptoms.


Stress and anxiety can both make heartburn symptoms worse as well.Daily physical activity is a great way to combat stress, making it effective against heartburn for multiple reasons.

, Choosing large meals instead of moderate portions increases the risk of heartburn.With more and more food in your stomach, your stomach acids have a higher chance of passing into your esophagus. Opt for smaller servings to see if it decreases your occurrences of heartburn.

, Though heartburn has mostly to do with your esophageal sphincter, many people do experience an increased occurrence of heartburn from eating certain foods. One of the easiest ways to stop getting heartburn is to cut out foods that trigger it for you. Some common foods associated with heartburn include:Spicy foods
Onions
Tomatoes (or tomato products such as ketchup and pizza sauce)
Acidic foods such as those containing citrus
Chocolate
Alcohol
Peppermint
Fried or overly fatty foods
Coffee, soda, and other beverages containing acids.

, Carrying around excess weight puts additional pressure on your stomach that can help force stomach acid into your esophagus.Even losing a few pounds can begin aiding to alleviate that pressure. Diet and exercise are the two best ways to help yourself shed extra pounds.


A healthier diet will also mean cutting out fried and fatty foods, which often worsen heartburn symptoms.A healthy exercise routine includes thirty minutes of moderate cardio activity (such as jogging, cycling, swimming, etc.) five days a week.
Note that pregnancy is a common cause of GERD in women. Always check with your doctor before attempting any weight-loss routine if you are pregnant.
Those more than 100 pounds overweight may be candidates for bariatric surgery to help improve GERD symptoms., Smoke from tobacco products damages your lower esophageal sphincter, impairing its ability to function normally.This makes it easier for the stomach acid that causes heartburn to get passed and into your esophagus. You should quit smoking to decrease your risks of many smoking-related illnesses but especially after meals to help decrease the chances of heartburn.

Uncover and elevate the affected limb.,
Apply an ice pack to the limb.,
Continue to apply the ice pack for 20 minute intervals.",How to Cure a Gout Attack2," Remove all surrounding clothing or bedding from the limb so it is open to the air. Raise the limb by sliding a cushion under the limb. Avoid knocking around or damaging the affected limb when you elevate it., It’s important to keep the affected limb cool to ease any pain or swelling. Wrap an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas in a towel before applying it to the limb., Only apply the ice pack to your limb for 20 minutes at a time. Do not apply it directly to your skin or for longer than 20 minutes at a time as this could damage your skin.Touch the affected limb to make sure the temperature of the affected limb has returned to normal before reapplying the ice pack.

Get a prescription for anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs).,
Take one anti-inflammatory painkiller at a time.,
Ask your doctor for proton pump inhibitors (PPI).,
Try colchicine if NSAIDs are ineffective.,
Talk to your doctor about corticosteroid tablets.",How to Cure a Gout Attack3," Many people who suffer from gout will have a supply of NSAID tablets ready at home in case an attack occurs. The painkillers will ease most gout attacks and soothe your symptoms within 12-24 hours. There are several types and brands your doctor may prescribe, including diclofenac, indomethacin , and naproxen.Most people can take these drugs without any complications, but some side-effects may occur, including:


Bleeding from the stomach. This is more of a risk if you are over 65 years old or have a stomach ulcer. If you have either of these risks, you avoid taking these tablets and talk to your doctor about other possible medications.
Some people with asthma, high blood pressure, certain kidney problems, and heart failure may not be able to take anti-inflammatory painkillers.
If you are taking medication for other conditions, they could interact negatively with anti-inflammatory painkillers. Talk to your doctor if you are on other medications before taking the painkillers.

, Follow the dosage prescribed by your doctor and don’t take too many painkillers at once. Continue to take this medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours after the attack has finished., NSAIDs should be prescribed together with PPIs, which reduces the risk of the NSAID causing indigestion, stomach ulcers, and bleeding from the stomach.These medications will also protect your stomach if you have already taken aspirin and then experience a gout attack. Aspirin plus an anti-inflammatory medication will increase the risk of stomach bleeding. PPIs will help to counteract this risk.
Your doctor may also try interleukin-1 inhibitors (IL-1) to control pain. IL-1 may rapidly reduce pain for those who do not respond to NSAIDs., Colchicine is a medication that is derived from the Autumn crocus plant. It is not a painkiller, but it works to reduce the ability of the urate crystals that inflame your joint lining, thereby reducing some of the inflammation and pain during a gout attack.Colchicine will be prescribed by your doctor and can be an effective treatment for gout if taken in the first 12 hours of the attack. But it should only be used at low doses as it can cause side effects like nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.Always follow the recommended dosage. For most people, this means no more than 2-4 colchicine tablets a day.

, These are a type of steroids for people that do not respond to other treatments and are unable to take an NSAID or a colchicine. A short course of steroid tablets provides relief but can’t be used long-term in high doses as they can cause side effects such as:Weight gain
Osteoporosis, or thinning of your bones
Bruising and thinning of your skin
Muscle weakness
Increased vulnerability to infection
Corticosteroids can also exacerbate diabetes and glaucoma, an eye condition that can cause blindness if left untreated.
Do not use corticosteroids if you have impaired kidney function, impaired liver function, or a risk of heart failure.

Breathe in as much as you can.,
Try the open-mouthed swallowing method.,
Imagine breathing in a figure eight.,
Try to stretch your diaphragm.,
Use your tongue and ears.,
Simulate breathing.",How to Cure Hiccups2," Without letting any air out, swallow. If you can breathe in a bit more, do so. Keep swallowing and inhaling until you can't swallow or inhale any longer.


When you absolutely can't swallow anymore, exhale all the way in a controlled fashion. Your breath should be reset.

, Open your mouth and keep it open for a couple of minutes. If you feel the need to swallow, do so, but try to keep your lips apart when you do.


Keep gulping every few seconds, especially when you feel a hiccup might be coming. A couple of hiccups might escape, but with continuous gulping, hiccups should be gone within 3 minutes.
Make sure you are not wearing anything tight around your chest. If you are, loosen it.

, As the out-breath reaches the end, slow the breath and twist it around so that it becomes the in-breath. Then simply create a figure eight of continuous breath.


The hiccups will subside almost immediately. It usually works within 10 cycles.
Another way to visualize this is to inhale as much as you can hold, then exhale all but a small amount of air. Continue doing this for 15-20 seconds, or until the hiccups have gone.

, Slowly breathe in until you feel like you can't inhale any more, trying to get a feel for extending the breath down towards your abdomen. You are trying to stretch your diaphragm to interrupt the hiccups.


Hold your breath for 30 seconds. Exhale slowly until your lungs are empty. Repeat 4 to 5 times or until you feel better.

, Inhale and exhale once slowly. As you exhale, push as much air out as possible (until your body forces you to inhale again). Then, inhale deeply and stick out your tongue. Hold your breath and your nose for 40 seconds with your fingers in your ears.


Exhale slowly. If you feel as if it is not going to work, try again. After all, 3 times is the charm.

, Take a deep breath and hold it. While doing so, plug your nose and close your mouth. Now begin to move your diaphragm as if you were breathing in and out rapidly.


Exhale once the hiccups disappear or you need more air. Repeat if hiccups persist.

Breathe using a singer's breathing support (Mezza di voce).",How to Cure Hiccups3," First, pinch your nose together. Then, spin around in a clockwise direction, while singing ""Row, row, row, your boat.""


Continue this until you've sang the song 5 times. Once you've finished with that, immediately begin spinning around in a counterclockwise direction while singing ""Mary had a little lamb."" Singing the songs is for timing as well as inhaling as well as exhaling in a powerful manner.

, Lie down for a long period of time. Then, stand up suddenly. That is, if that's not how you got the hiccups in the first place!


If this doesn't work, stand up for a long period of time and lie down quickly instead.

, Find a straight-backed chair and sit down with your back fully pressed into the back of the chair. Slowly bend over in the tuck position with your arms crossed over your body - the same way you would when instructed by an airline stewardess to ""get in the crash position."" Do this until you feel slightly uncomfortable.


Slowly squeeze your arms and try to squeeze your body and hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds, and release. Slowly sit back up and repeat if necessary.

This is not advised for those with back problems.



, Swallow air until you burp. Eventually, that air will want to come up in the form of a burp. It should reset your vagus nerve, ending your hiccups.

, Count the number of seconds between hiccups. Around the time a hiccup should be coming up, or when you feel it coming up, cough loudly and/or scream! Repeat 3 or 4 times, if necessary.

, To do this, breathe inwards quickly until you cannot do so anymore. Then, look downwards so your neck is bent. Stay like this for 10-20 seconds, forcing the air downwards.


Return to normal position, and think of the air staying down in your lungs. This disrupts the hiccup cycle, and you will no longer have hiccups!

, If you're ticklish, that is. The sensation will totally distract you from your hiccups and you'll forget all about it -- especially if the person doesn't stop! Not cool.


They may have to do this for 30 seconds or longer. Can you tolerate it? If not, just have them scare you. But it's got to be good! You have to be legitimately surprised, so you gasp and reset your breathing pattern.

, About time, right?! What are they there for anyway? Drink a normal-sized gulp of water, but don't swallow! Leave the water in your mouth. Then, pull down both your earlobes and tilt your head back. Swallow and tada! Hiccups, vamoose!

, Place your thumbs on the little flap in front of the ear canal (called the tragus) and press inward, closing the canal. Then, close your nose with your pinkie fingers. Finally, close your eyes, then take a deep breath and hold it as long as possible.


Try to breathe normally after coming out of the exercise. The natural reaction is to breathe hard or pant, resetting your breath.

, Stand upright with your feet hip-width apart. Lock one thumb in the palm of your other hand with fingertips outstretched. Then, lift your chin, look up and stretch your arms over your head (reaching for the sky). Pull your abs in as if trying to let your pants fall off your hips and breathe deeply several times.


If you don't have hiccups, this may induce yawning.

, Hiccups are caused by temporary muscle contractions of the diaphragm, so if you can manage to maintain a balance between the contraction and the expansion of your diaphragm, you can cure the hiccups.


Slowly breathe in.
Then slowly breathe out on 'Si' ,following a gradual crescendo and diminuendo, while sustaining the breath flow (namely, it starts from a quiet volume, gradually and smoothly made louder until it reaches a high volume, then similarly made quiet again). Done.

Check your tonsils for white spots.,
Feel your neck for swollen lymph nodes.,
Consider an ear infection an indication that bacteria are present.,
Watch out for an abscess by your tonsil.,
Notice the development of any skin rashes.",How to Differentiate Bacterial Tonsillitis and Viral Tonsillitis2," Your tonsils are the glands that sit at the back of your mouth on both sides of your throat. Bacterial tonsillitis may cause small, white, pus-filled spots on your tonsils.Look in a mirror, open your mouth wide, and look closely at the tissue on either side of the back of your throat. If it’s too hard to see, get a family member to look for you and try shining a light back there.


It’s normal for your tonsils to look red and swollen with bacterial or viral tonsillitis – the white, pus-filled spots are more common to bacterial infections.

, Use your pointer and middle fingers to gently press along both sides of your neck, on your throat under the angle of your chin, and behind your ears. Feel for a hard or tender lump about the size of your pinkie fingernail. This could be a swollen lymph node. Though your lymph nodes can swell any time your body is fighting an infection, swollen nodes are more common with bacterial infections., Sometimes, bacteria from a throat infection can spread to the fluid in your middle ear, causing a middle ear infection (or otitis media).Symptoms of a middle ear infection include ear pain in one ear, difficulty hearing, balance problems, fluid draining from the ear, and fever., A peritonsillar abscess, also called quinsy, is an almost sure sign of bacterial tonsillitis. An abscess is a collection of pus – this occurs on one side between your tonsil and the wall of your throat. Pay attention to the following signs and symptoms that may indicate a peritonsillar abscess, and see your doctor right away if these symptoms are present:Sore throat that is getting progressively worse on one side
Difficulty swallowing
A change in voice — called “hot potato voice” — in which vowels may sound muffled
Swollen lymph nodes
Large, red swelling on one side of the tonsils
Difficulty opening your mouth
Bad breath that was not present previously
The uvula — the dangling tissue at the back of your throat — may look like it’s being pushed to the unaffected side (no longer midline)

, Some complications of bacterial tonsillitis include scarlet fever and rheumatic fever, though these usually only occur if the infection is left untreated. Both of these infections can cause a skin rash. If you notice any new rashes while you have a sore throat, consider it a likely indication of a bacterial infection and see your doctor right away.Rheumatic fever can also cause widespread joint pain.

These tests are not always accurate, and can show inaccurately negative results a third of the time.This is a good first test, but a throat culture is often required for accurate diagnosis.

, The most accurate way to determine the cause of your tonsillitis is for your doctor to check the results of your throat culture. This is when your throat swab is sent to the lab and a lab technician determines what, if any, bacteria are present on your tonsils. Then your doctor can prescribe you the right antibiotics to treat the cause of your tonsillitis., Mono can only be diagnosed with a blood test. Because it’s a virus, mono will pass on its own — stay hydrated and get a lot of rest. You should still see your doctor for diagnosis if you have symptoms of mono because mono can cause an enlarged spleen, which can rupture if you overexert yourself. Your doctor will explain what you need to do in order to stay safe and get better."

Discuss surgical options.",How to Cure Heartburn2," If your frequent heartburn symptoms persist for more than two weeks despite efforts with OTC medications, then make an appointment with your doctor., Since recurrent bouts of heartburn are often indicative of gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), your doctor may ask you to submit to some diagnostic testing to help determine the best way to treat you.These tests will also examine you for a complication of GERD called erosive esophagitis, which is when your stomach acid has done actual damage to your esophagus.Tests for the condition include:X-rays to look at the shape and condition of both your esophagus and your stomach
An endoscopy, which will check for abnormalities along your esophagus caused by long-term esophageal erosion due to stomach acid, especially if you are over fifty or have had GERD for longer than five years
An ambulatory acid probe test, which measures when acid backs up into your esophagus and for what duration
Your doctor may also biopsy some of the cells found in your lower esophagus to test for a condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which is a precancerous condition resulting from long-term GERD symptoms. However, this is only a small percentage of those with GERD., Both H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are available in prescription strength from your doctor.If OTC strengths of these drugs haven’t controlled your symptoms, then your doctor will likely first recommend a prescription option to control your symptoms.

, For GERD that isn’t controlled by medication and which has developed into erosive esophagitis, your doctor may even discuss surgical options with you. These options include:Fundoplication, which is when your surgeon wraps a small section of your stomach around your lower esophageal sphincter, which helps strengthen the muscle, allowing less stomach acid to pass through it
Inserting a device (such as a Linx) that is implanted along your lower esophageal sphincter to help strengthen it

"
Know that acid reflux is the most common cause of esophagitis.This is when stomach acid flows upward into your esophagus causing irritation to the bottom of the esophagus.,
Remove any trigger foods from your diet.,
Quit smoking.,
Lose weight.,
Remain upright for at least 30 minutes after eating.,
Take over-the-counter reflux medication.,
Monitor how long you take these over-the-counter medications for.",How to Cure Esophagitis1," Common symptoms include:


Pain with swallowing
Difficulty swallowing, particularly solid foods
Heartburn
A cough
Occasionally nausea or vomiting, a fever, or abdominal pain.;
, Acid reflux is often brought on by foods that are causing your stomach and esophagus duress--these foods are also known as trigger foods. Try removing these foods from your diet to see if your reflux will benefit. If you want to try this method, don’t remove only one food at a time; there is commonly more than one trigger food, and it will be hard to figure out which foods are harming you. Instead, remove all of the trigger foods for at least two weeks, then add back one food at a time every three days; any foods that cause reflux symptoms should be permanently removed from the diet, or greatly limited.Common trigger foods include caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, peppermint, tomatoes, oranges, spicy foods, and high-fat foods.
It is also better to eat smaller more frequent meals rather than larger meals.This can help to diminish feelings of heartburn.

, If you are a smoker, now may be the time to consider quitting or at least cutting back. Smoking has been shown to contribute to esophageal disease, including feelings of heartburn.Speak to your doctor if you would like support in quitting smoking (including the option for nicotine replacement and/or medications such as Wellbutrin that can diminish cravings).

, Being overweight or obese has also been correlated to increased heartburn, so now may be the time to get our for a walk each day and to begin an exercise program.Weight loss is not only helpful for your esophageal problems, but also benefits your overall health and wellbeing in many other ways.


Speak to your physician if you would like support or guidance getting started on an exercise program, and always consult your doctor first if you are worried you may have any health restrictions that hold you back from exercise.

, When you have a big meal and then lie down, it makes digesting the food much more difficult. If your esophagus is damaged, there is also a much larger chance that acids from your stomach will leak back up to your esophagus when you lie down.If you find you have symptoms of heartburn at night, it can be helpful to raise the head of your bed of to sleep with more pillows.Elevating your head more while you sleep keeps you in a more upright position, which can significantly diminish feelings of heartburn.

, Tums is a good first choice, and if this doesn't work for you there are stronger options available over-the-counter as well.Another option is something called Zantac (Ranitidine), which is an ""H2 anti-histamine.""You can also try Prilosec (omeprazole), which is a ""proton pump inhibitor"" and helps to diminish the acid in your stomach so that any reflux becomes less irritating to the esophagus., If you are taking any of these over-the-counter medications for two weeks or more, make sure to visit your doctor and tell him or her about the medication use. If your reflux is still occurring after changing your diet and using the over-the-counter medications, visit your physician for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.


At this point, your physician may offer you stronger prescription anti-reflux medications to help with your esophagitis. (examples)It is also key to establish the correct diagnosis, for different diagnoses require different forms of treatment.This is why it is key to see your doctor if you do not notice any improvement on over-the-counter medications.

Drink water and other fluids to restore vitamins and minerals.,
Get extra sleep.,
Switch to the BRAT diet.,
Complement the BRAT diet with other options.,
Avoid foods that can worsen symptoms.,
Take a zinc supplement.,
Resume your normal diet.",How to Cure Diarrhea1," When you have diarrhea, your body sheds fluids that contain needed vitamins and minerals. It is important to get those minerals back in fluids, especially water and sports drinks.Combatting dehydration is your primary medical concern with diarrhea. If you are vomiting in addition to having diarrhea, be sure to take frequent, small sips of liquid instead of drinking lots of liquid at a time.
Other liquids that you can consume to combat dehydration include chicken or beef broth, flavored mineral waters, or rehydration solutions such as Pedialyte.Caffeine-free liquids are best. Caffeine is a mild diuretic, meaning that it can have a dehydrating effect.If suffering from diarrhea, stick to liquids that don't have the possibility of dehydrating you even more.;
, Not so much a remedy as a common sense treatment supplement, sleep is very necessary when it comes to treating diarrhea. Since diarrhea is a symptom, it is a good indicator that your body is trying to fight off a problem such as a virus. Sleep and rest are among the best ways to help your immune system.

, If you’re no longer vomiting (or your symptoms never included vomiting), then your can start taking advantage of the BRAT diet—bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These are all low-fiber foods that will help to increase the firmness of your stools.They’re also fairly bland in a way that won’t risk further upsetting your stomach.


The bananas in this diet also help replace potassium your body has lost through the diarrhea., Though effective as a base to help treat diarrhea, the BRAT diet is not a well-balanced diet.Saltine crackers, boiled potatoes, clear soups, skinless baked chicken, cooked carrots, and other somewhat bland food choices can also help while you’re still experiencing an upset stomach.Some people may also try yogurt. However, the lactose in yogurt can be hard on your stomach while you have diarrhea. If you turn to yogurt, choose a probiotic variety (with live bacterial cultures) to help return helpful bacteria to your stomach and assist with your recovery., Knowing what not to eat can be just as important as knowing what to eat. In general, you should avoid greasy, spicy, or sweet foods, as well as those high in fiber.Milk and other dairy products can also be difficult for some people to digest while experiencing diarrhea.Also avoid:


Gum with sorbitol. Sorbitol is a laxative.
Spicy foods, fruits, and alcohol until at least forty-eight hours after diarrhea has subsided.Foods with caffeine such as chocolate since caffeine has a dehydrating effect., Studies have shown that zinc supplements can improve the outcome when treating diarrhea.Zinc is a micronutrient that aids in the synthesis of protein and the transport of both water and electrolytes in the intestines.The World Health Organization recommends taking zinc supplements by mouth—10 mg daily for children under six months, 20 mg daily for children over six months of age.Adults should take according to the manufacturer’s suggested dosing.

, Roughly twenty-four to forty-eight hours after your symptoms have subsided, you can return to your normal diet.Reintroduce foods slowly to see the best result.


Use common sense. Start with mild fish or chicken instead of a spicy plate of seasoned pulled pork.

Drink lots of water.,
Gradually increase fiber intake.,
Eat fewer low-fiber foods.,
Avoid milk.,
Watch out for other foods that may cause constipation.,
Consider magnesium supplements.,
Be cautious with other home remedies.",How to Cure Constipation1," Drink at least eight glasses of non-caffeinated fluids a day while you are constipated. Dehydration is a common cause of constipation, and can make it worse if you continue to drink too little water.Once you're back to normal bowel movements — at least three a week, passing them comfortably — you can stop measuring your water intake. Just drink enough fluids that your urine is colorless or pale yellow, and drink whenever you are thirsty.;
, Dietary fiber is the most significant component of your diet for encouraging healthy bowel movements. Adults should eat 20–35 grams of fiber each day, but gradually work your way up to this amount to avoid gas and bloating. Try getting your fiber from multiple sources for a healthy diet:Bread and grains: 100% bran cereal (9g per ⅓ cup/80 mL), shredded wheat (3.5g per ½ cup/120 mL), oat bran muffin (3g)
Beans: 6–10g per ½ cup/120mL cooked, depending on type
Fruits: pears (5.5g with skin), raspberries (4g per ½ cup/120 mL), or prunes (3.8g per ½ cup/120 mL stewed)
Vegetables: potatoes or sweet potatoes (3–4g, baked in skin), green peas (4g per ½ cup/120 mL cooked), or green vegetables (3g per ½ cup/120 mL cooked).

, Adding fiber to your diet won't help as much if you simply add it to the rest of your diet. Meat, cheese, and processed foods contain little to no fiber, and can lead to dry stools if they make up a large portion of your diet.Eat these in small portions only while you are constipated, and try to replace some of them with fiber foods in your regular diet.

, Try doing without milk and other dairy products for a few days, to see if it helps. Many people have trouble digesting lactose, which can give them gas or constipation.Most lactose intolerant people can still enjoy pro-biotic yoghurt and hard cheeses.

, The following foods are usually fine in moderation. If they make up a large portion of your diet, however, they are probably contributing to your constipation:High-fat meats
Eggs
Rich, sugary desserts
Processed foods (typically low in fiber)


, Hard evidence supporting this is thin, but many doctors and patients report that magnesium helps. Take no more than 350 mg a day in pill form, or 110 mg for children aged four to eight.Bran contains both magnesium and fiber, making it an excellent choice of food.
Magnesium may be dangerous for people with kidney disorders.

, In almost all cases, changes to food and drink are enough to help the constipation pass and avoid it in future. Dietary supplements (besides fiber supplements) and home remedies are rarely necessary, and may be unwise to take without talking to a doctor.


The most common home remedies are mineral oil and castor oil. These are effective, but should only be used as a last resort. Overuse can cause vitamin deficiency or damage your intestine, causing further constipation down the road. Do not take these if you are on blood thinners, antibiotics, heart medication, or bone medication."

Limit your consumption of certain painkillers.,
Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol.,
Learn to manage stress.",How to Cure Gastritis1," If you are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen for pain control, discuss this problem with a doctor and treat it separately.


If you are hurt or undergo surgery and need to take something for the pain, ask your doctor to prescribe you an alternative to NSAIDs. Abusing these painkillers can result in ulcers and reduce a substance called prostaglandin that protects the stomach.
If possible, stop taking pharmaceutical drugs altogether. Instead, choose natural anti-inflammatories like chamomile, ginger, and turmeric.
Do not self-medicate. Although there are over-the-counter drugs available for controlling the symptoms of acute gastritis, the relief they provide is temporary. A doctor can prescribe you something that will decrease and/or neutralize acidic secretions and effectively protect the mucosae.;
,


Never drink alcohol on an empty stomach, as this will increase your chances of getting stomach ulcers.
Serve yourself one drink only. At events and parties, limit yourself to one drink for the night and dilute it with seltzer. Alcohol erodes the stomach's mucous membrane and increases the production of gastric acids.

, Emotional or nervous gastritis is an acute illness experienced by people under high levels of stress, and can, in some cases, cause superficial hemorrhages.


Avoid stressful people, places, or situations. Stress increases the production of gastric acid and deteriorates the stomach's mucous membrane.
Exercise regularly. Physical activity stimulates the production of endorphins, also known as ""happy hormones.""
Meditate. Nowadays, you can find a wide variety of information, products and courses related to meditation almost anywhere. If that isn't your style, just take a few minutes each day to enjoy a personal moment of peace and quiet.
Try aromatherapy. Angelica, spearmint, and lavender are just a few of the essential oils that you can try out in order to better control your stress level.

Get a pencil and bite down on it.,
Use bargaining tactics.,
Try the toothpick method.,
Get out the brown paper bag.,
Whip out the paper towels.",How to Cure Hiccups4," It should be sitting horizontally between your teeth. Then, drink a glass of water with the pencil still in your mouth. Easier said than done, huh?


Drink as much of the water as you can without the pencil falling out. You do not have to drink the whole glass, just a couple sips will do.

, If you're friends with someone with a case of hiccups, wait until they hiccup. Tell him or her you will pay them $20 for a hiccup right now. They'll most likely find they aren't able to do it, both curing them of hiccups and saving you $20, or at worst giving them money as consolation for not being able to stop.


This is a situation where it's appropriate to renege. Unless the hiccups hurt, in which case you should at least give them a hug.

, All you have to do is break a toothpick in half and place half in a glass of water. Drink the water slowly while watching the half toothpick (and not swallowing it). For some reason, the concentration while drinking keeps you from hiccuping.

, Experts say breathing into a paper bag increases the amount of carbon dioxide you're taking in, forcing your body to get rid of it instead of lapping in the luxury of producing hiccups. When your body has other things (much, much more important things) to do, your hiccups will subside.Breathe slowly and deeply! The last thing you want is to hyperventilate on top of having hiccups. What a hot mess you'd be.

, Try getting a glass of water and putting a napkin/paper towel over the cup. Now drink the water through the paper towel until the water is gone. The idea is that it takes more suction from you to get out the water, forcing your inner bits to work harder, abandoning the hiccups.

Try a method that has been called the ""African Way"".,

Wet the back of a piece of paper.
Put it on the forehead of the patient. Hiccups should stop.

Ask the patient for their middle name. Do not tell him why you want to know it.
Ask him to spell it.
Say, ""Your hiccups are gone."" If it worked they will be gone immediately.

"
"
See a doctor if the hiccups haven't gone away after 48 hours.,
Eat slower.,
Eat and drink in moderation.",How to Cure Hiccups6," A number of prescription medications can be used for treatment of hiccups. These include:


Chlorpromazine (marketed under the name Thorazine) - This is the one of the most widely-used medications for hiccups, and it is suitable for short-term therapy.
Metoclopramide (marketed under the name Reglan) - This is a drug most commonly used to help the stomach empty, but it works for hiccups as well.
Baclofen - This is a muscle relaxant which can treat hiccups.
Other less commonly used drugs include anti-seizure medications, amitriptyline, stimulants, and anti-arrythmic drugs.

Two days is nothing. Charles Osborne, from the great, great Hawkeye state of Iowa had them for 68 years. He died a year after they went away.Maybe they were keeping him alive?



, For some reason, not chewing our food well enough can lead to hiccups. The theory behind it is that air gets trapped between pieces of the food, gets swallowed, and results in the nasty side effect. Eating more slowly means you'll chew more, eliminating the possibility.


Eating slow can also help your waistline. Hey, that's killing two birds with one stone!, Some scientists (and moms) believe that eating too much and getting the hiccups is the body's way of saying, ""Stop! I need time to process."" If you find that you often get hiccups after a meal, considering eating less (eating more slowly will help with that, too).


Same goes for drinking. If you drink too much, the esophagus gets irritated and is forced to expand. Neither of those are good things for you or your body. And just like spicy foods, alcohol irritates your esophageal lining, so it's best to keep moderation in mind."

Seek medical attention immediately.,
Get checked for an infection.Infectious colitis results from any type of infection — bacterial, viral, or parasitic.,

Think about whether you have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).,
Look for signs of ischemic colitis.When local arteries get too narrow or are otherwise blocked, it reduces blood flow to the large intestine, causing ischemic colitis.,

Try alternative treatments.Probiotics are useful bacteria found naturally in the digestive tract.",How to Cure Colitis," This condition is an inflammation or swelling of the large intestine and colon.It's often the result of other underlying conditions like infection or autoimmune disease. However, colitis is a serious condition in its own right, and you should always inform a healthcare professional if you develop symptoms. Treatment of colitis depends on the cause, and can range from home care to prescription medications.;
, The different types of colitis have different causes, and therefore different symptoms and treatments. However, there are some general signs for colitis that can let you know that you need to look more closely for the specific diagnosis. The general symptoms of colitis include:Abdominal pain and bloating.
Bloody stools. These could appear either dark, tar like or red.
Fever and/or chills.
Diarrhea and/or dehydration.

, Colitis is a serious, potentially fatal condition that requires expert evaluation as soon as possible. Provide the doctor with a detailed list of your symptoms, as well as how long you've observed them. Be able to list any other medical conditions you may have, as well as any medications you're taking. Depending on the cause your doctor suspects, he may run a number of different tests. For example:


Bacterial infection: The lab will analyze stool samples to identify the bacteria causing the infection. They may also test for your white blood cell count, which is usually increased if you have inflammation or infection.IBD: If your doctor suspects inflammatory bowel disease, the lab may do a blood test for anemia (low red blood cells) or signs of infection.
They may also analyze stool samples rule out other causes or check for the presence of white blood cells in your stool, which points to colitis.
You may also need a colonoscopy, biopsy, or imaging scans to rule out other conditions or determine the extent of inflammation., Infection is the most common cause of colitis in children.Common infectious causes include:


Bacterial: food poisoning from Escherichia coli, Shigella, or Salmonella.
Viral: cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
Parasitic: Entamoeba histolytica.

, C. diff may develop after taking clindamycin, fluoroquinolone, penicillin, or cephalosporin. Antibiotics are often prescribed for a bacterial infection, but most antibiotics do not kill off C. diff because it has a spore form that is not effected by antibiotics. This bacterium can cause intense intestinal toxins and inflammation. Though treatable, pseudomembranous colitis is potentially fatal, so alert a doctor immediately if you develop symptoms:


Watery or bloody diarrhea
Abdominal cramps and pain
Fever
Pus or mucus in your stool
Nausea/loss of appetite
Dehydration

, This is a general umbrella term that covers three more specific conditions that cause inflammation in the intestines. IBD might refer to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or indeterminate colitis.Other symptoms of IBD include:Cramping
Irregular or bloody bowel movements
Weight loss
Fever or sweats
Fatigue

, Although you can feel pain anywhere in the colon, most patients feel it on the left side of the belly. Symptoms of ischemic colitis include:


Abdominal pain, tenderness or cramping (sudden or gradual)
Bright red or maroon-colored blood in your stool
Rectal bleeding without stool
Urgent bowel movements
Diarrhea

, It occurs more rarely in full- and near-term babies, but symptoms can show up from one to three days after birth through the first month of life. NEC can be incredibly dangerous, with a mortality rate of 50% or more, so report symptoms immediately:


Vomiting
Diarrhea
Delayed bowel movements
Distended and/or tender stomach
A decrease in bowel sounds
Erythema (redness) of the stomach in advanced stages
Bloody stool
Sleep apnea (stopping breathing during sleep)
Lethargy
Trouble breathing

, There are several types of medications that are used to help control IBD.Aminosalicylates target colon inflammation, but are less effective at treating the small intestine. These drugs are usually used to treat mild to moderate colitis.
Sulfasalazine is effective, but side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, and headache.
Corticosteroids fight inflammation, but suppress all immune response instead of focusing on the colon. These drugs (prednisone, methylprednisolone) are used for moderate to severe colitis. Side effects include weight gain, excessive facial hair growth, mood swings, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, bone fractures, cataracts, glaucoma, and an increased risk of infection.
Azathioprine and mercaptopurine act slowly, so they're usually prescribed alongside a corticosteroid.
Immunomodulators, like corticosteroids, suppress immune response to calm inflammation. They're usually used only when aminosalicylates and corticosteroids have failed.
Cyclosporine is a very strong medication that begins to work within one or two weeks. Since it is so strong and comes with a range of severe side effects, it is generally only prescribed until less toxic medications can take effect.
Infliximab and adalimumab fight intestinal inflammation specifically. Infliximab can cause problems in people with cancer or a history of heart disease.

, Antibiotics don't treat the colitis itself. If intestinal ulcers cause infection though, antibiotics will prevent further complications.


Antibiotics can treat abscesses of fistulas (abnormal connections between organs or vessels) seen in Crohn's Disease and usually occurring in the small intestine.Tell your doctor if you develop a fever, which could indicate infection.

, This treatment targets the chemicals responsible for inflammation. These fairly new medications are used for moderate to severe colitis if other treatments have failed.


They're also known as anti-TNF agents. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a naturally produced chemical responsible for inflammation.
Biologic therapies produce antibodies that attach themselves to the TNF, so that it can be destroyed by the body.
Your doctor must test you for tuberculosis before you can begin TNF.

, If your colitis is so severe that no medication, home cure, or alternative treatment can keep it in check, you might need to have a colectomy. During this surgery, part or all of your colon will be removed. Removal of your colon will lead to lifestyle changes.Although most people will be able to do most of the routine activities they did before, you have to live with a stoma (a hole in your abdomen from which waste is expelled).The only way to cure colitis completely is to have a total colectomy performed. Since a total colectomy can come with adverse side effects (like small bowel obstruction), though, a partial colectomy is sometimes done instead.
The surgeon may also opt to perform a procedure that links the small intestine to the anus, thereby producing more normal bowel function.

, Usually, this type of colitis will go away on it’s own in two to three days. But if the infection is severe, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic depending on the type of organism causing the infection. If an antibiotic is prescribed, it's important to complete the full course of antibiotics and not skip doses, even if symptoms go away.

, Get plenty of rest, and seek medical attention if any of these symptoms grows severe. You can also ask your doctor whether he recommends an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal like Imodium.Caution: If you have a C. diff infection and use Imodium for more three days to try to stop diarrhea, you will be retaining dangerous toxins caused by C. diff which can seriously effect the kidneys, liver and intestines, etc.







, While diet is not the cause of colitis, certain foods can agitate your symptoms and make the condition worse. Foods that are rough on your stomach or intestines should be cut out of your diet as much as possible.Dairy can make symptoms dramatically worse, especially if you are lactose intolerant. When you do have dairy, take an enzyme product that can help break down the problematic lactose in dairy.
Avoid high fiber foods (fruits and vegetables), or cook them to break down the fiber.
Cut out gas-producing foods (carbonated drinks or caffeine), as well as fatty, greasy, or fried foods.
Instead, eat digestible, bland foods like clear soup, crackers, toast, bananas, rice, and applesauce.If you're actively vomiting, you should stick with clear liquids alone until you can hold them down., Small meals are less likely to trigger your symptoms. Large meals, on the other hand, can overwhelm your digestive tract and cause a colitis flare-up. Switch from two or three large meals each day to five or six small ones. Give your digestive system a week or so to adjust, and continue on this schedule if it improves your symptoms. If not, you can probably switch back to your previous routine.

, Hydration is important both for bacterial infection and IBD. The diarrhea from bacterial infection can dangerously dehydrate the body. If you have IBD, fluids ease the passage of waste through your intestines, causing less pain and fewer complications.Water is the best option. Try to drink six to eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water daily to maximize your colon health.
Avoid beverages that can dehydrate you, like those containing alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine also stimulates the intestines, often worsening symptoms in the process. Carbonated drinks can agitate symptoms by producing gas.

, Colitis can make it difficult for your intestines to absorb enough nutrients, even if you eat a nutritious diet. A multivitamin might be able to supplement some of the vitamins and minerals your body's missing out on.While multivitamins might be able to help you supplement missing nutrients, do not rely on multivitamins instead of actual food and drink.
Multivitamins do not provide your body with the protein and calories it needs to run.

, Stress can trigger colitis flare-ups, so you should take lengths to minimize it, though you can't cut it completely out of your life. Stress can make your stomach empty slowly and produce more acid than usual. It can also change the rate at which food passes through the intestines or affect intestinal tissue.Mild to moderate exercise (jogging, cycling) can quickly and dramatically reduce your stress levels.
You could also try yoga, meditation, or other exercises that ask you to focus on your breathing.
If none of these options help or seem appealing, you could simply set aside a little time each day to do something you enjoy. That one simple action, in itself, can reduce your stress levels.

, Look at the side-effects for all your medications (including over-the-counter ones) to see whether they irritate the digestive tract or not. Avoid any over-the-counter medication that mentions stomach or intestinal irritation. Never stop taking a prescribed medication without first consulting your healthcare provider.


Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in particular, have been known to cause flare-ups of colitis., Getting more of them through yogurt or supplements can replace those lost through colitis, normalizing digestive health. The effectiveness of fish oil is debated — though a known anti-inflammatory, it's not been proven useful for intestinal inflammation. It could also loosen stools, and worsen colitis-induced diarrhea.


Some evidence suggests that aloe vera might help as an anti-inflammatory, but the evidence is weak at best. Like fish oil, it's a known laxative.
Acupuncture is used to treat a variety of conditions involving pain and inflammation. Always go to a licensed, rather than amateur, acupuncture specialist when trying this treatment.
Turmeric has a compound called curcumin. When used in conjunction with other colitis therapies, some evidence suggests that this compound can improve symptoms.

Drink a full glass of water when you take the medication.,
Talk to your doctor about finding an alternative prescription.,
Stop taking over-the-counter pain killers.",How to Cure Esophagitis2," If you are suffering from esophagitis because of a medication you are taking, you may be able to combat the problem by drinking a full glass of water when taking the pill. Sometimes, “pill esophagitis” is due to the medication remaining in the esophagus for a period of time and irritating it, rather than passing directly to the stomach.Another option is to opt for a liquid form of the medication you are taking, rather than pill form, if it is available in liquid form as well.This can help to reduce pill-related symptoms of esophagitis.
It is also advised to sit or stand for at least 30 minutes after taking your pill. Lying down immediately after has been shown to increase symptoms of heartburn., If drinking a glass of water with each pill does not work, you may need to stop taking this prescription and start on a different treatment plan. It is very important that you talk to your doctor before you stop taking your treatment.


Many medical conditions are able to be treated with more than one type of medication; speak to your doctor if alternate treatments are available that are less irritating to the esophagus., If you are taking aspirin or NSAIDs on a regular basis and are suffering from esophagitis, you should stop taking these. Visit your physician first, to make a plan for stopping the medications gradually; stopping them suddenly may cause “rebound” inflammation and pain, while slowly weaning off of them can avoid this situation. You should also discuss the symptoms that caused you to be taking these medications, so that a diagnosis and an alternate treatment plan can be devised.Over-the-counter pain killers have been reported to cause increased symptoms of heartburn in some patients, which is why it is important to be careful about taking these and to consult your doctor if you think they may be worsening your condition.

Steroid medication helps to reduce or eliminate unnecessary immune reactions such as occurs with eosinophilic esophagitis.
Similarly to how inhaled steroids are used to treat asthma, ""topical oral steroids"" are thought to coat the surface of your GI tract in a way that prevents irritation.The other advantage of ""topical oral steroids"" is that they are not absorbed into your bloodstream, so you avoid the typical side effects of steroid medications., In order to determine the ""culprit food,"" it is recommended to remove suspicious foods from your diet (your doctor can tell you which foods are most likely to be culprits), and to add them back in slowly, monitoring for any reactions or signs of heartburn.It is important to add back only one food at a time, otherwise you will not be able to tell which one caused you symptoms of heartburn.

, For infectious esophagitis, medications will be prescribed according to the organism causing the infection.If it is yeast Candida, the treatment is fluconazole or an echinocandin. The chosen medication depends on the strain of Candida and on the individual patient, including how ill he or she is, whether other illnesses are also present, allergies, and other factors.
If the patient has a viral esophagitis, acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir will be prescribed. Again, the particular choice depends on the patient and on the virus.
If it is caused by a bacteria, antibiotics will be prescribed."

If using an absorbent, it is important not to take any medication within several hours of taking the absorbent. Absorbents can cause the medication to bind to the intestine and colon, diminishing their medicinal power. For best results, take absorbents and medications separately.

, Bismuth compounds, found in common products such as Pepto-Bismol, are reputed to have antibiotic-like properties that counteract the bacteria that produce diarrhea.It's not exactly known how bismuth compounds combat diarrhea. They may only be beneficial for patients suffering from traveler's diarrhea or those battling the H. pylori bacterium.

, Anti-motility medications cause a slowdown in the movement of the intestine and colon. This slowdown relaxes the bowel organs, which gives the organs more time to absorb water, resulting in less watery stool. Two common anti-motility medications include loperamide and diphenoxylate. Loperamide is available without prescription in various forms (such as Imodium A-D).Individuals with infectious diarrhea (such as from E. coli) should avoid anti-motility medications., If the medications you're taking, in conjunction with bland food and plenty of water, don't seem to improve your case of diarrhea after seventy-two hours, see your doctor. They may prescribe an antibiotic medication, which will help treat diarrhea caused by a bacterium or parasite. Antibiotics will not help diarrhea caused by a virus.It is very important to see your doctor if OTC options have proven ineffective because diarrhea from bacterial or parasitic infections can actually worsen due to these medications.Your doctor will determine the specific antibiotic to prescribe for your symptoms after using a stool culture to identify the bacteria causing the symptoms.

See your doctor.,
Eat probiotics.,
Drink chamomile tea.,
Try psyllium.,
Try a marshmallow root supplement.,
Drink a mix with slippery elm powder.,
Try apple cider vinegar.,
Try using an astringent herb.",How to Cure Diarrhea3," For diarrhea caused by certain types of infections, herbal remedies can actually worsen instead of improve your symptoms.Consult your doctor before turning to an herbal remedy.

, The living bacteria in probiotics boost the number of healthy bacteria in your gut, which are often lost due to diarrhea. By reintroducing these healthy bacteria, your digestive tract can get back to normal functioning more quickly.Probiotics are available as supplements, and they’re also found in probiotic brands of yogurt.

, Chamomile tea is has traditionally been used to treat inflammation, including in the GI tract.Drink up to three cups a day, sipping in small quantities to help your body absorb the liquid.


Note that chamomile can lead to reactions in those allergic to ragweed, and it can also interfere with some medications, including hormonal medications., Psyllium is a soluble fiber (meaning that it absorbs water). It can lead to firmer stool while experiencing diarrhea.Always drink psyllium with a large glass of water.


Speak to your doctor before taking psyllium if you have inflammatory bowel disease., Marshmallow has also traditionally been used as an inflammation-reducing herb.Follow the manufacturer’s directions for a supplement.


You can also cold brew this herb as a tea by putting two tablespoons in one quart of water overnight. Strain before drinking.This herb can interfere with some medications—such as lithium—so consult your doctor before taking., Slippery elm powder has also been used traditionally to soothe inflamed GI tracts.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.


Steep four grams of the powder in two cups of boiling water, and allow it to steep for three to five minutes. You can drink this up to three times each day while you have diarrhea.Some herbalists believe that slipper elm can lead to miscarriage.Consult with your doctor before taking slippery elm if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding., Apple cider vinegar is believed to have antimicrobial properties.If used to combat diarrhea, try stirring two teaspoons into one warm cup of water. You can drink this mix several times a day.If taking vinegar with other probiotics, wait several hours in between drinking the ACV and eating the probiotics. Yogurt, for example, contains good bacteria and is generally considered beneficial for diarrhea. Wait one or two hours after you've had ACV until you go for the yogurt.

, Astringent herbs are believed to help dry out the mucous membranes located in the intestines, helping to reduce the amount of loose stool.Most of these options are available as supplements or teas, and they include:Blackberry leaf
Raspberry leaf
Carob powder
Extract of bilberry
Agrimony

See to your bathroom needs promptly.,
Give yourself time on the toilet.,
Test a different toilet position.,
Exercise regularly.,
Try stretching or yoga.",How to Cure Constipation2," Visit the toilet as soon as you feel the need for a bowel movement. Delaying the visit worsens constipation., Straining on the toilet can lead to painful complications such as hemorrhoids or anal fissures. Go easy on your digestive system by giving it time to move on its own.


Try visiting the toilet 15–45 minutes after breakfast each day.You may not pass a bowel movement daily (even when healthy), but this is a good time to encourage it.

, One study shows that squatting makes bowel movements easier and faster.For people who cannot feasibly squat over their toilet, try the following:Lean forward with your hands on your thighs.
Put your feet on a step stool to bring your knees above your hips.
Instead of straining, take a deep breath with your mouth open. Let your stomach expand, then tighten muscles slightly to hold it in place. Relax your sphincter.
Repeat this breathing exercise no more than three times. If there's still no bowel movement, get off the toilet or pick up some reading material.

, Exercise can stimulate your bowels, even if it's just a 10 minute walk several times a day. Aerobic exercise such as running or swimming is particularly effective.


Wait one hour following a big meal before strenuous exercise (enough to increase your heart rate), or you could slow your digestion., This is another form of light exercise that can aid digestion. Some people find yoga particularly effective, perhaps because it stretches the abdomen.

Talk to a doctor if you are at risk for complications.,
Start with a bulk-forming laxative.,
Use lubricant laxatives for quick relief.,
Try osmotic agents for general relief.,
Use stool softeners for short-term issues.,
Take a stimulant laxative for severe cases.,
Visit a doctor for prescription medicines.",How to Cure Constipation3," It's generally a good idea to talk to a doctor before taking a laxative. People in certain circumstances should always do so, to avoid health complications:Pregnant or breastfeeding women
Children 6 years old or younger
Anyone taking other medication. (If you are already taking a laxative or mineral oil, wait for at least 24 hours before switching to a different laxative.)
Anyone with severe stomach pain, abdominal cramps, nausea, or vomiting should avoid laxatives entirely, and visit a doctor immediately.

, Also called fiber supplements, these have the same effect as an increase in dietary fiber. Unlike other laxatives, these are safe to use daily, but may take two to three days to work.They sometimes cause painful bloating and gas, especially during a severe case of constipation or in people who normally have a low-fiber diet. Minimize this risk by drinking 8-10 glasses of water daily, ramping up to the recommended dosage gradually, and avoiding this type of laxative before bed.Some people are allergic to psyllium, found in some bulk-forming laxatives., These cheap laxatives grease your stool with mineral oil or similar substances to ease passage. They typically take effect within 8 hours, but are only suitable for quick relief. Overuse can lead to vitamin deficiency.If you are taking any other medication, talk to a doctor before taking lubricant laxative. The hastened passage of stool can decrease the amount of medication that is absorbed.

, This type of laxative helps your stool absorb more water and pass more easily, taking effect within two or three days.These require a great deal of water to be effective, and to avoid gas and cramps.The elderly, people with diabetes, and people with heart or kidney issues should be monitored regularly for electrolyte imbalance and dehydration while taking this drug.Saline laxatives are one type of osmotic laxative.

, Stool softeners (emollients) are usually prescribed after childbirth or surgery, or for patients who need to avoid straining. These have a weak effect, but still require plenty of water and should only be used for a few days., This is a more powerful laxative that may not be available over-the-counter in all areas. It can provide relief within 6–12 hours by causing muscle contraction in your intestines.This should only be used rarely, as repeated use can damage intestines and make you dependent on the drug for normal bowel movements.Check the label for phenolphthalein, which has been linked to cancer.This type of drug can also cause cramping and diarrhea.

, If an over the counter laxative does not work within three days, visit a doctor right away. He may suggest the following treatments or tests:


A prescription laxative, such as lubiprostone or linaclotide. These may be suitable for longterm use.Enemas can deliver laxatives directly to the location of the problem, or flush out compacted stool. While available over the counter or as home remedies, they are best used sparingly and while following medical advice.If your doctor suspects a more serious problem, he may ask for a blood test, stool sample, X-rays, bowel examination, enema test, or colonoscopy."

Talk with your doctor about how to detect chronic gastritis.",How to Cure Gastritis2," The majority of chronic gastritis cases are caused by the presence of a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, which can be identified via an endoscopic biopsy. The treatment for this type of gastritis is based on a regimen of anti-acids and antibiotics.


Many other cases of chronic gastritis are linked to the prolonged use of NSAIDs, chronic bile reflux, diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and Crohn's disease, among others.
First, undergo medical treatment to control your primary illness, and then, talk with your doctor about how to cure chronic gastritis.

Avoid spicy food.,
Incorporate oatmeal and tapioca into your diet.,
Choose low-fat dairy products.,
Drink carrot juice.,
Stay away from caffeine.,
Say NO to fast food and processed foods.,
Sweeten your drinks with bee honey.",How to Cure Gastritis3," Hot spices and condiments stimulate the production of gastric acids and can irritate the stomach.

, Both of these foods protect the stomach's mucous membrane because of their mucilage content, a thick, gluey substance produced by some plants.

, Full-fat dairy can generate inflammation and burning in the stomach.


A lot of people consume dairy products in order to counteract stomach acidity, but the relief is only temporary and the symptoms will come back even stronger.
Choose low-fat dairy and moderate your consumption of these products.

, Carrots have natural anti-inflammatory and painkilling properties. Thanks to their high concentration of beta-carotene and fiber, they neutralize excess acid and regulate acidic production. You can eat them raw or cooked; either way, they will help to control your symptoms.

, Even decaffeinated versions of coffee or soft drinks can damage your gastrointestinal membranes, causing gastritis and ulcers.


Replace these drinks with water and natural non-citrus drinks. Custard apple and soursop are capable of repairing and protecting stomach lining.

, These products digest slowly and increase the production of gastric acid.


Make homemade foods with lots of green, leafy vegetables.
Avocado and squash neutralize excess gastric acid while simultaneously protecting and reducing inflammation in the stomach's mucous membrane. Include these vegetables in your recipes.
Incorporate rice into your diet... and use the leftover water! Rice has a natural anti-inflammatory effect on the stomach and the intestines. One home remedy for gastritis is to slow boil a handful of rice. Drink the remaining liquid at least three times per day.

, Honey has a healing effect on gastric ulcers, and it also combats heartburn. Use it to sweeten all of your drinks throughout the day.


You can also add 2 tablespoons of honey to lukewarm water and drink it daily on an empty stomach. You will gradually start to feel better.

Herbal remedy for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Many herbs have been used for centuries to correct digestive disorders including Irritable Bowel Syndrome.",How to Cope With Irritable Bowel Syndrome," Only a doctor can diagnose IBS. IBS symptoms can also be caused by other health conditions, so your doctor will probably want to run some tests before giving you an IBS diagnosis.;
, Often the ""trigger foods"" that cause IBS attacks are unique to the individual, but the most common triggers are high fat foods such as red meat, dairy and fried foods. After learning what foods set off your IBS, you can avoid them or eat them in moderation.

, Bulkier stool is softer and easier to pass through your digestive system. Be cautious with insoluble fiber, such as wheat bran, which can worsen IBS symptoms.

, Foods rich in lecithin are egg yolks, soybeans, cow milk butter and animal brains. You can also buy soy lecithin granules in most supermarkets or health food stores. Lecithin helps restore the endothelium which is often damaged in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

, Caffeine and nicotine serve as muscle stimulants and may aggravate sensitive bowels, contributing to IBS symptoms. Alcohol is known to be a gastric irritant.

, Large meals often set off bouts of IBS.

, Exercise helps your body to deal with stress and promotes good bowel function.

, Stress can be a trigger for IBS attacks.

, Your doctor may prescribe an anticholinergic agent to lower your intestinal activity, or a mild tranquilizer or sedative.

,


Anacardium
Asafoetida
Nux Vomica , Herbs are potent sources of antioxidants, which help to counter the effects of inflammation, improve digestion and bowel movements. Herbs also act to reduce the stress, which is the main culprit behind the pathology of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

Understand the symptoms of the stomach flu.,
Understand how the illness is spread.,
Assess whether you have a stomach flu.,
Contact your doctor if your illness is very extreme or persists for a long period of time.,
Know when to get emergency care.,
Be aware that dehydration can be more life-threatening in certain people.,
Try to avoid infecting others.,
Keep infected children isolated.",How to Cope with a Stomach Flu1," This illness affects each area of the gastrointestinal tract. Its symptoms can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and general malaise. Keep in mind that these symptoms can occur from a low grade fever instead, such as one caused by the influenza virus (the ""actual flu,"" unrelated to the stomach flu).


The stomach flu is self-limited, meaning the symptoms usually end in 2-3 days, but can last up to 10 days.There is no cure, so focus on preventing it from spreading and making yourself as comfortable as possible while the virus runs its course.;
, The virus is spread by coming in contact with contaminated food, water, utensils, and other objects such as doorknobs that an infected person has touched.

, Have you come into contact with someone who has the stomach flu? Do you have any of the symptoms of the stomach flu? If your symptoms are mild-moderate nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, you most likely have a garden variety stomach flu caused by the three most common viral pathogens: norovirus, rotavirus, or adenovirus.


In most cases, you do not need medical care to recover from these viruses.

, This is especially important if your symptoms don't lessen over time. Call a doctor or visit a clinic if you're experiencing the following symptoms:


Increased or constant vomiting for more than a day
Fever over 101 °F (38 °C)
Diarrhea for more than two days
Weight loss
Decreased urine production
Confusion
Weakness, If you experience any of the following symptoms, you may have severe dehydration or another serious medical condition. Visit an emergency room or call for emergency services immediately:


Fever higher than 103 °F (39 °C)
Confusion
Sluggishness (lethargy)
Seizures
Difficulty breathing
Chest or abdominal pains
Fainting
Blood in vomit or stool
No urine in the last 12 hoursFeeling faint or lightheaded, especially upon standing
A racing pulse
Severe or localized abdominal pain (this could indicate appendicitis or pancreatitis)

, Infants and toddlers are at an increased risk complications such as of dehydration as are diabetics, the elderly or those with HIV.Babies and children are at a higher risk of severe dehydration than adults. If you suspect that your child is suffering from dehydration, seek help immediately. Some common symptoms include:


No wet diapers for 5 or 6 hours
Sunken spot at the top of the skull (fontanel)
Dark urine
Drier-than-usual mouth and eyes
A lack of tears during cryingSkin tenting (if you pinch the skin, it holds the shape)

, Wash your hands a lot. Prevent the flu from spreading through your household by washing your hands repeatedly. Studies show that you should use regular soap (there is no need for antibacterial soap) and warm water for between 15-30 seconds to wash your hands in order to be highly effective.Don't touch people if you don't have to. Avoid unnecessary hugs, kisses, or handshakes.
Try not to handle frequently-touched surfaces such as doorknobs, toilet handles, faucet handles, or kitchen cabinet handles. Cover your hand with the sleeve of your shirt, or put a tissue over your hand first.
Sneeze or cough into your elbow. Bend your arm at the elbow and bring it up to your face so that your nose and mouth are in the crook of your arm. This will prevent germs from getting on your hand, where they're more likely to be spread around.
Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently. If you've recently thrown up, sneezed, or handled any other bodily fluid, sanitize your hands.

, Children should be kept out of school and childcare to prevent the spread of infection. Those affected with Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) are shedding bacteria in their feces for as long as they have diarrhea, so until that stops, they should be kept away from others. When diarrhea stops the child is free to return to school, as he or she is no longer contagious to others. Your school, however, may require a doctor's note to return, but that is specific to school policy.

Stop taking certain medications and supplements seven days before the procedure.,
Stop taking blood thinners at least five days before the procedure.,
Avoid certain foods from three days before your procedure.,
Start a low residue diet two days before the colonoscopy.",How to Cleanse Your Colon for a Colonoscopy1," This is important, as the following medications are known to cause bleeding during the procedure: iron supplements, Motrin (ibuprofen), Aleve (naprosyn), sulindac and any other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). If necessary, Tylenol for pain is acceptable.


Discontinue the use of fiber supplements, including FiberCon, Metamucil and Citrucel. Also discontinue taking all non-prescription Vitamin E and herbal supplements.
The medications Aggrenox and Plavix are designed to keep your blood from clotting. It is important that you ask your physician if you can stop taking these medications for some time before your colonoscopy. You should be able to resume taking your medication after your procedure is complete.
If you take an aspirin regimen due to a history of heart disease/stroke, continue taking it, otherwise discontinue use of aspirin until after your procedure.;
, You should stop taking blood thinners like Coumadin five days before your colonoscopy procedure. However, you should always contact your physician before discontinuing any prescription medication.

, Three days before your procedure, you should discontinue eating popcorn, nuts and seeds, as these can become lodged in the colon and affect the outcome of your colonoscopy.

, A low residue diet consists of foods that are low in fiber. Fiber is more difficult for the body to digest.


A low residue diet restricts the consumption of foods that are known to leave a residue in the gastrointestinal tract. which is why this diet is beneficial for the colon cleaning process.
Foods that are encouraged on a low residue diet include: Fish, eggs, chicken, soup, clear fruit juice (apple or white grape), limited consumption of coffee or tea (no milk products added), sports drinks – lemon, lime and orange (no red), bouillon, crackers, bread, pasta, plain yogurt, broth, gelatin (Jell-o) – lemon, lime and orange (no red), potato (minus the skin), popsicles (no red)
On the other hand, the following foods should be avoided because they can leave a residue in your colon, which can make it difficult to get accurate results: all vegetables, orange juice, dried fruits, fresh fruit, seeds, nuts, raisins, cloves, all meat except chicken and fish.

Consult a doctor.,
Rely on prescribed antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).,
Take PPIs.,
Use antacids.,
Keep a pain journal.,
Prevent yourself from overeating.,
Stay away from fried and spicy foods.,
Avoid drinks that might aggravate your ulcer.,
Stay away from alcohol.,
Stop smoking.,
Manage your stress level.,
Eat foods containing flavonoids.,
Choose foods containing polyphenols.,
Consume probiotics.",How to Cope with an Ulcer," Schedule an appointment with your medical professional. Most ulcers are caused by a type of bacteria, H. Pylori, which damages the lining of the stomach and exposes it to harmful stomach acid. Some ulcers of the digestive tract are caused by autoimmune disorders, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor will diagnose you or refer you to a specialist who will advise you on medical treatments.;
, If your doctor diagnoses your ulcer as caused by a H. pylori bacterial infection, they will probably prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics and PPIs. The antibiotics will fight the bacteria, and the PPI will lower the amount of acid your stomach produces. PPIs are generally prescribed for several weeks and include:


Omeprazole.
Pantoprazole.
Lansoprazole.

, If your stomach ulcer is just caused by taking NSAIDs, a course of PPI medication might be recommended. The PPIs will lower the amount of acid your stomach produces, and allow your ulcer to slowly heal. In addition, your medical professional will probably evaluate your use of NSAIDS and potentially prescribe an alternate painkiller., Your doctor might recommend taking antacids. Antacids are medicines that neutralize the acid in your stomach. Neutralizing the acid in your stomach will, in many cases, relieve pain and help the healing process. Some antacids also contain a medicine called an ""alginate,"" which produces a protective coating on the lining of your stomach. Remember, always tell your medical professional about any medicine you are taking to treat your ulcer.

, Once you suspect that you have an ulcer, you should consider writing down when you feel the pain intensify. Make a daily log as to what you are eating. Also keep notes about your daily activities. Try to identify common patterns, as this will help you and your medical professional come to a proper diagnosis. It will also give you an idea of what foods and activities to avoid., Overeating will make your stomach work harder, and increase your stomach acid. Instead, prepare smaller portions, drink water, and stop eating when you begin to feel full. But remember, although eating less might reduce pain, it will not cure your ulcer by itself.

, Greasy and acidic foods can increase the level of acid in your stomach. This will aggravate your ulcer, and cause you discomfort. Instead of fried foods, try to bake or grill your food. As for spicy food, you don't have to give it up, just tone it down until you get your ulcer under control.

, Some drinks might contribute to higher acid levels in your stomach. These drinks will aggravate your condition, cause pain, and increase the length of your healing process. Instead, consider green tea, milk, or water. Avoid the following:


Caffeinated drinks like coffee and black tea.
Sugary drinks.
Carbonated drinks.
Citrus-based drinks.

, Alcohol can potentially make your condition even worse. It is associated with H. pylori infections. There is a good chance it could contribute to stomach ulcers. Limit alcohol consumption to as little as possible.

, Smoking is associated with peptic ulcer disease in people who are infected with H.pylori. Smoking also increases the production of stomach acid. Stopping smoking will not only decrease acid, strengthen your body against H. pylori, but it will make you generally healthier over time., While most ulcers are caused by bacteria or other factors, for a small group of people, stress is a major factor in triggering ulcers. Regardless of which group you are in, lowering your stress level will make you a happier person and help your body heal. Ways to reduce stress include:


Yoga.
Exercise
Other relaxing activities.

, Flavonoids may be an effective treatment for some stomach ulcers, because they coat and protect the lining of the stomach and could allow ulcers to heal. Flavonoids occur naturally in many fruits and vegetables. But beware, some foods and drinks that contain flavonoids — such as citrus fruits — can irritate a stomach ulcer. Foods and drinks rich in flavonoids include:


Legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, soybeans, and peanuts.
Broccoli.
Apples.
Berries.

, Polyphenols are antioxidants and may protect your stomach from ulcers. They might also help ulcers heal. Foods that contain polyphenols include:


Dried rosemary.
Dark chocolate.
Blueberries.
Black olives.

, Probiotics are living bacteria and yeast that help keep your digestive system working properly. Studies have shown that probiotics might fight H. pylori bacteria. There is also evidence that they may help the ulcer healing process, too. Consider the following foods that contain probiotics:


Buttermilk.
Yogurt.
Miso.
You can also take probiotics in supplement form."

Treat nausea.,
Treat diarrhea.,
Treat dehydration.,
Pay particular attention to dehydration symptoms in babies and kids.,
Treat abdominal discomfort or pain.,
Don't take antibiotics.",How to Cope with a Stomach Flu2," Focus on keeping fluids down. This means if you are vomiting everything out, your primary objective should be to alleviate the nausea and to prevent the vomiting. Without fluids, your illness could cause dehydration and will slow your recovery.


Many people like to drink a plain carbonated beverage, such as lemon-lime soda, to treat their nausea. Others advocate the use of ginger to calm nausea., Diarrhea can be described as liquid stool, frequent stool but watery stool here really is the definition of the term. Patients may experience it differently. However, if you are losing fluids via diarrhea you will need to replace these losses with electrolytes containing formulas such as ( Gatorade, Pedialyte) as well as water. Because electrolytes specifically, potassium, are key in the electrical conduction of the heart, and potassium is lost with diarrhea, you must be especially alert to keeping electrolytes on board. There are different opinions as to whether it is better to let the viral illness “out” or to stop it with constipating anti-diarrheal agents. Most doctors agree that anti-diarrhea medications can make the symptoms last longer. Consult your doctor before taking one.

, The combination of vomiting and diarrhea will make dehydration your primary complication. Adults that are dehydrated will notice that they are dizzy when they stand, have a racing pulse when standing, have dry oral mucosa, or a feeling of being very weak. Part of the problem with dehydration is that it brings with it a lack of important electrolytes, such as potassium. Replace these losses with fluids that contain electrolytes, such as Gatorade or Pedialyte, as well as drinking water.


If you are losing a fair amount of fluids and your diarrhea is severe, you should see your physician. They will help determine if you are in fact only suffering from viral gastroenteritis and begin treatment. There are other illnesses, such as bacterial infections, parasitic causes, or an intolerance to lactose or sorbitol that could also be causing your illness., Babies and toddlers are at particular risk of dehydration. If they won't drink fluids then you should take them to a doctor for assessment, as children fall victim to dehydration more quickly than adults., You can take any over-the-counter painkiller that makes you more comfortable for the few days you are sick. If a warm bath helps you, do that.


If an over-the-counter pain reliever is not handling the pain, seek treatment from a medical professional.

, Because gastroenteritis is typically caused by a virus, not a bacteria, antibiotics won't help you feel better. Don't ask for them at the pharmacy, and don't take them if offered. Taking antibiotics when they are not necessary encourages antibiotic-resistant bacteria (""superbugs"").

Avoid unnecessary stress.,
Accept that you're sick and temporarily unable to work.,
Get help with errands and daily tasks.,
Drink lots of liquids.,
Avoid foods that will not make you feel better.,
Eat bland foods.,
Rest when you can.,
Set up camp.,
Do not take a sleep aid if you're vomiting frequently.,
Don't try to ignore it when you feel like you're going to vomit.,
Cool yourself down if you have a fever.,
Rely on lighthearted entertainment.,
Slowly ease back into your routine.",How to Cope with a Stomach Flu3," Remember, the point of relaxing and recuperating at home is to remove yourself from stressors that might slow down your recovery. Doing everything you can to get rid of tension will help you feel better faster.

, Don't blow your precious energy on trying to keep up at work or school. Illness happens, and your superiors will probably be understanding and accommodating as long as you have a plan in place to make up the work later. For now, focus on feeling better.

, Ask a friend or relative for help with things that must still be done, such as doing a load of laundry or picking up medication from the pharmacy. Most people will be delighted to take any extra stress off of you.

, In order to hydrate yourself you should drink as much fluid as you can keep down. Stick to water or an electrolyte solution purchased at the pharmacy. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, or anything too acidic (such as orange juice) or basic (such as milk).


Sports drinks (such as Gatorade) will rehydrate you and replenish electrolytes, although unlike the options available at a pharmacy they are not guaranteed to give you all the electrolytes you need.Do not give sugary sports drinks to young children.
Make your own oral rehydration solution. If you're struggling to stay hydrated or you can't leave the house to buy an electrolyte solution at the pharmacy, make your own. Mix 4.25 cups (1 litre) clean water, 6 tsp (30 ml) sugar, and 0.5 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and drink as much as you can., If you're vomiting a lot, try to avoid foods that could be uncomfortable or painful coming back up, such as chips or spicy food. In addition, avoid dairy products for the first 24- 48 hours, as they can exacerbate symptoms of diarrhea. When you are able to advance the diet, go slowly to soups and broths and then soft foods. , Try sticking to a BRAT diet, in which you eat bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. This will be bland enough that you can hopefully keep it down but will give you the nutrients you will need to recover quickly.


Bananas will pull double duty in providing bland nutrition and also in being rich in potassium, which will counter diarrheal losses.
Rice is bland and even nauseated folks can keep this down. You may want to try rice water, mixed with a bit of sugar, but this is still anecdotal.
Applesauce is also bland and sweet, tends to be tolerated, even if a teaspoon every 30 minutes. This requires patience, especially if treating children, as they may often only tolerate small sips or spoonfuls. You want to stick to small amounts, as large amounts will trigger vomiting, thereby countering your efforts.
Toast is bland source of carbohydrates that most can keep down.
If all else fails, eat baby food. Commercially-produced baby food is meant to be gentle on the stomach, easily digestible, and loaded with vitamins and nutrients. Give it a shot if you can't keep anything else down.

, With a few important caveats, it's vital that you get enough sleep while your body tries to fight back the stomach flu. Make time to get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day, if not more.


Take naps. If you're able to stay home from work or school, go ahead and take a nap in the afternoon if you feel tired. Don't feel bad about being unproductive — sleeping is actually necessary for your body to repair itself and recover.

, If you're most comfortable hanging out on the couch where you have easy access to food and entertainment, consider setting up blankets and pillows so that you can fall asleep there whenever you're ready, instead of moving everything to the bedroom.

, As tempting as it may be, stay away from the sleeping pills while you're still actively sick. Being passed out on your back and vomiting over your nose and mouth can be life-threatening.

, As soon as you start to feel like you're going to throw up, move quickly. It's better to get up for a false alarm than to make a mess on the couch.


Stay near a bathroom. If you can make it to the toilet, flushing is a lot easier than having to clean a floor.
Vomit into something you can clean easily. If you have a few large, dishwasher-safe mixing bowls that you use infrequently (or don't plan to use ever again), consider keeping one with you throughout the day and when you go to sleep. Afterward, you can simply rinse out the contents in the sink, and wash it by hand or put it into the dishwasher.

, Set up a fan so that the air blows over your body. If you're really hot, set up a metal bowl of ice in front of the fan.


Put a cool compress on your forehead. Wet a strip of cloth or a dishrag in cold water, and dampen it as often as you need to.
Take a lukewarm shower or bath. Don't worry about soaping up, just focus on cooling down.

, If you can't do anything but lie down and watch a movie or television show, avoid the weepy dramas and select something cute and humorous. Laughter can help ease feelings of pain and speed your recovery.

, As you begin to recover, add your usual tasks back to your daily life. Start with taking a shower and getting dressed as soon as you're able. Then move on to doing chores, driving, and getting back to work and school when you're ready.

Make the final preparations on the day of the colonoscopy.",How to Cleanse Your Colon for a Colonoscopy2," In order to prepare for a colonoscopy, you need to cleanse your colon. Some physicians give their patients ‘prep kits.’ If your physician gives you a prep kit, follow the directions for that particular kit.


During the prepping phase, you can only drink clear fluids. If you consume anything besides clear liquids and the prep products listed below (or given to you by your physician), the radiologist may not be able to provide your physician with accurate results.

, Some patients suffer from dehydration while prepping for their colonoscopy, so make sure you drink plenty of clear fluids.


The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI-established in 2004) recommends men have a daily water intake of approximately sixteen 8 oz. cups a day. The DRI recommends women drink eleven 8 oz. cups of fluid daily.
The best way to determine if you are getting enough water/fluids is to look at the color of your urine. If your urine is straw colored, you are hydrated; dark urine is an indication that you are dehydrated.
Your body will also help you determine if you are drinking enough fluids. If you feel thirsty, your body is telling you that you need more fluids.

, If your physician did not give you a prep kit, you will need to purchase the following non-prescription items:


A package of 4 Bisacodyl tablets – 5 mg (Dulcolax, Correctol, Bisacolax or Doxidan).
64 oz of a non carbonated, clear liquid drink (Propel, Gatorade or Crystal light). If you are diabetic, you can use sugar-free Gatorade.
8.3 oz (238 grams) of Polyethylene glycol 3350 powder (Clearlax, MiraLAX, GaviLAX or Purelax). You can find these products in the laxative section of your local pharmacy or department store.

, If you have diabetes, use sugar-free beverages for your prep. If you take insulin, take half of your evening dose the day before your procedure and the other half on the morning of your colonoscopy.


If you do not take insulin, do not take your diabetic medicine on the morning of your procedure.
Monitor your blood sugar throughout the prepping process.

, At 4 p.m.on the evening before your colonoscopy, take all 4 of the 5 mg Bisacodyl tablets (Dulcolax, Correctol, Bisacolax or Doxidan).


At 6 p.m. take a pitcher and fill it with 64 oz of the clear, non-carbonated beverage you purchased (Gatorade, Propel or Crystal Light).
Mix in the 8.3 oz of Polyethylene glycol 3350 (Clearlax, MiraLAX, GaviLAX or Purelax). Stir well, until the powder dissolves completely.
Drink ½ (32 oz.) of the mixture. You should drink 8 oz. every 15 minutes. If you want, you can drink it through a straw.

, 5 hours before your colonoscopy, drink the remaining 32 oz. of the clear, non-carbonated mixture. Unless otherwise directed, you will take nothing by mouth (food or drink) for at least 3 hours leading up to your colonoscopy. Additionally, you should:


Wear comfortable, loose clothing.
If you are taking heart or blood pressure medication, take it by mouth with a sip of water.
Leave your valuables at home (including jewelry).
Make a list of all your medicines so they can be added to your chart.

Set aside time each day for meditation.",How to Control Heartburn with Exercise," Vigorous, intense exercise can actually exacerbate, rather than control, your acid reflux. Particularly if you're a beginning exerciser, taking a brisk walk around your neighborhood is a good place to start.Weight lifting, particularly at the level of intensity associated with body building, is not recommended for people who suffer from frequent heartburn.
If you do want to do strength training, try using low-impact exercise machines rather than working out with a weight bench or with free weights.
Walking or light jogging is a good way to exercise if you have heartburn. However, keep in mind that jogging or running can upset your stomach because of the jostling and bouncing involved.
Yoga or pilates also can be good forms of exercise if you suffer from frequent heartburn. You may want to avoid poses that require you to recline or bend at the waist, or that cause undue pressure to your abdomen, as these may upset your digestive system.;
, Walking is generally an easy way to keep your body active and increase your overall fitness. It also is an easy exercise to fit in to your everyday life, even if you don't have time for an extensive workout regimen.For example, when you're running errands, park in a space further away so you can get a little walking in, rather than hunting for the closest possible parking spot.
When you have a choice, take the stairs instead of using the elevator.
If you're a beginner, start with a 5- or 10-minute brisk walk per day. Gradually work up to a 20-minute brisk walk each day.
To work walking into your regular routine, go for a brief walk around the block for 5 or 10 minutes within an hour or two after each meal.

, When you have heartburn, particularly if you've been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), strengthening your LES and diaphragm can decrease your heartburn.One important breathing exercise is to practice ""diaphragmatic breathing."" To do this, expand your abdomen, and relax your abdominal muscles as you inhale. Then contract your abdominal muscles as you exhale to force the air out.
This breathing exercise makes your breathing conscious and activates your diaphragm. In contrast, typically when you breathe you simply use the muscles in your chest wall.
As you practice diaphragmatic breathing, place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen.
As you inhale, check to see that the hand on your abdomen is rising higher than the hand on your chest. This signifies that you are drawing air into your lungs with your diaphragm.
Inhale and exhale slowly and completely. You should complete this exercise two or three times a day. Each time you perform this exercise, take at least 20 deep, conscious breaths.

, Maintaining a generally active lifestyle is essential to controlling heartburn. This doesn't mean that you have to exercise for 30 minutes straight. However, you should try to fit in physical activity throughout the day.If you're a beginner who's never done much concentrated exercising before, starting with a 30-minute exercise routine can be too stressful for your body and actually increase your heartburn.
However, fitting in a few minutes of exercise throughout the day will add up. For example, if you went for a 10-minute walk in the morning, another around lunch time, and a third in the evening, that would add up to 30 minutes.
You might want to consider downloading a fitness or exercise app for your smart phone so you can better track your progress, particularly if you're trying to spread your exercise out over the course of the day.

, If you want to control your heartburn through exercise, talk to your general physician or your gastrointestinal specialist about which particular exercises and routines will work best for you.Certain exercises or types of exercises may not be helpful for you, based on your particular situation and the details of your chronic heartburn.
Your doctor will better understand the causes of your heartburn and be able to point you toward exercises that will help you.

, You can avoid heartburn during your workout by putting enough time between your meal and your workout to allow your food to digest properly.While many people can benefit from having a small snack about a half hour before exercising, particularly if they plan to engage in more strenuous exercise, this is not recommended if you suffer from chronic heartburn.
To avoid heartburn during exercise, it's generally best to exercise on an empty stomach or nearly empty stomach.
Allow food you eat at meals to digest before you start even moderate exercise. Keep in mind this doesn't necessarily apply if you're just taking a brief 5- or 10-minute walk. This sort of activity normally can be done without worrying about when you last ate.

, Exercises that require you to perform them from a reclining position can exacerbate heartburn. This includes exercises that require you to bend over from the waist, such as sit-ups or crunches.Walking or biking are good exercises for people with frequent heartburn precisely because you can do them in an upright position. You may have problems with acid reflux if you use a recumbent stationary bike.
Many basic exercises can be modified for people suffering from acid reflux, so they can continue to work out the same muscle groups without being bothered by the pain of heartburn.
If you plan to do strength training, you'll generally have fewer problems with heartburn if you lift weights from a standing position or sitting upright at a weight machine, rather than reclining as you would to do exercises such as bench presses.

, Many ab workouts and strength-training exercises put pressure on your abs that can cause a flare-up of chronic heartburn.This is not only true with exercises such as sit-ups and crunches, but also exercises that require you to bend at the side or the waist from a standing position.
Rowing machines also can put significant pressure on your abdomen, potentially causing acid reflux.
If you're looking for a good exercise to strengthen your core without exacerbating your heartburn, try doing planks. Get on the floor in a pushup position, then bend your elbows 90 degrees and put your hands and forearms flat on the floor.
When your elbows are directly beneath your shoulders and you're on your toes, your body should look like a plank (hence the name of the exercise). Hold the position as long as you can, breathing into it. Aim to increase your time with each plank you do.
Deep breathing exercises also can strengthen your core muscles, although it will take you a lot longer to get a trim tummy than if you were doing sit-ups or crunches every day.

, Drinking plenty of water during your workout will help to keep you hydrated and it may also improve your digestion.Keep a water bottle with you during your workout and take sips throughout your workout as needed.
Make sure to drink a glass or two of water after your workout as well.

, Provided your daily schedule can accommodate, you'll have fewer problems with heartburn if you consume small meals five or six times a day rather than eating three big meals.Ideally, you can control heartburn by eating small portions once every two hours, with your last meal occurring at least two or three hours before you plan to go to sleep.
In some cases, your work schedule won't permit you to change your eating schedule significantly.
If that's the situation for you, focus on eating smaller portions at meal times and try to supplement your smaller meals with snacks throughout the day.
Even if you're not able to alter your eating schedule significantly, you still should avoid working out within two hours of eating, and avoid lying down within two or three hours of eating.

, If you are currently a smoker, make a plan to quit as soon as possible if you want to control your heartburn. Tobacco use of any sort weakens and relaxes your lower esophageal sphincter, which exacerbates heartburn.Smoking also causes you to intake air, which can cause pressure in your stomach and exacerbate acid reflux.
Other tobacco use such as dipping or chewing can damage your esophagus, wearing your esophageal muscles and leading to heartburn.
If you're ready to quit smoking, talk to your doctor and develop a healthy smoking cessation plan that can reduce the chances you'll return to smoking.

, Both caffeine and alcohol can cause or worsen chronic heartburn. Have a cup of coffee in the morning if you must, but eliminate soft drinks or energy drinks from your diet.Alcoholic beverages also can exacerbate heartburn, particularly carbonated beverages such as champagne or beer.
Try to limit yourself to one or two alcoholic beverages once or twice a week, or only on special occasions.
If you have addiction issues, seek treatment with a certified addiction professional, or join a treatment program or support group.

, Meditation has a number of health benefits and can reduce overall stress. Just 10 minutes of meditation a day can improve your digestion and help you control your heartburn.Create a quiet, relaxing place to perform your meditation each day. Try to find a place that is away from any distractions, such as the corner of a bedroom or even the bathroom.
During the time you'll be meditating, get rid of any devices that might make noise or buzz with notifications.
Focus on breathing deeply. Your mind likely will wander to other things, but let these thoughts go and return to thinking about your breath.
Sit or lay down in a comfortable position, and aim to remain still in that position for at least 10 minutes. As you practice longer, you can start meditating for longer periods of time.

Eat more fiber.,
Ingest more prebiotic foods.,
Have more probiotic foods.,
Try more fermented foods.,
Incorporate more foods with healthy enzymes.,
Consider taking digestive enzymes.",How to Choose Foods to Improve Digestion1," One of the best ingredients in food that will help with digestion is fiber. If you are running from a low level of fiber, start slowly.Start by increasing your daily intake of fiber by about 10% every week until you hit the recommended goal. This is 25 to 38 grams (0.88 to 1.3 oz) of fiber a day, depending on your age and gender.Vitamin-rich foods include:Green vegetables, such as mustard greens, collard greens, kale, spinach, turnips greens, beet greens, Swiss chard, dark green lettuces, and broccoli
Other colored vegetables, such as eggplant, carrots, cauliflower, celery, Brussels sprouts, and peas
Whole grains, such as whole wheat bread and pasta, brown rice, and quinoa
Fruits, such as plums, apricots, prunes, peaches, apples, and all berries. Keep the rinds on to increase the amount of fiber
Beans and legumes;
, Prebiotic foods are those that help support the creation of good gut bacteria.These foods can be eaten everyday as part of your diet. Eating them raw is the best way to get the prebiotics, but if you need to cook them, try to cook them as little as possible. These foods include:Artichoke
Garlic
Onions
Leeks
Asparagus
Chicory root

, Probiotics are also helpful for digestion. Probiotic foods contain much needed gut bacteria that will help with digestion. These can be incorporated into your diet as much as you can. For the dairy based products, make sure you do not have a lactose intolerance before eating them. Foods high in probiotics include:Yogurt
Kefir, which is a type of fermented milk
Miso soup
Tempeh, which is a type of fermented soybeans

, Fermented foods provide your body with both prebiotics and probiotics. It is the best to make these foods at home or to buy all natural or organic varieties of them.This will ensure they have more of the ingredients your system needs. These foods include:


Pickles
Other pickled foods
Sauerkraut
Buttermilk
Kimchee, which is Korean sauerkraut
Kombucha, which is fermented tea

, There are some foods that naturally have enzymes that will help you digest foods better. These foods include pineapple, which contains the enzyme bromelain, and papaya, which contains the enzyme papain.


Have these as snacks or incorporate them into recipes every day., Enzymes are the substances naturally found in humans, plants, and animals that can help break down foods. Digestive enzyme supplements can be taken if you want to help your digestion. Ask your doctor which enzyme is right for you to ensure it will not affect any condition you have. Take these enzymes as directed about 15 to 20 minutes before a meal. Common digestive enzymes include:Bromelain
Papain
Trypsin
Chymotrypsin
Amylase
Lipase

Don’t take it personally.,
Use positive self-talk.,
Practice gratitude.,
Practice stress management techniques.",How to Cope with the Stigma of Crohn's Disease1," Although people may occasionally make rude or insensitive comments, they may not intend to hurt your feelings. Sometimes people stigmatize others because of lack of understanding about a situation or condition.Sometimes they may do it just to make themselves feel better. Instead of letting their comments or actions bother you, remember that you’re a good person and don't let them get to you.


If someone says something negative about you, view it as a reflection of them, not a reflection of you. People usually say these types of things as a way to make themselves feel better about things they are insecure about. For example, if someone makes a rude comment about how often you use the bathroom, don’t feel bad about yourself. Recognize that the person obviously knows very little about you or Crohn’s disease.
Or, for instance, if someone is being insensitive, remember that they can help their bad attitude, you can’t help having Crohn’s disease.;
, It can be easy to begin believing the negative self-thoughts you have, as well as the comments you may hear other people say. Don’t do this. Instead, constantly and consistently say positive things to yourself and think positive thoughts about yourself.Using positive self-talk can help boost your self-confidence and help you ignore it if someone else says something negative about you.


Make a list of all of your positive qualities. Include your personality traits, talents, skills, interests, and hobbies. For example, you might list your piano skills, sense of humor, and fashion sense. You can even ask a trusted friend or family member to help you with your list. They might think of some things to add that you had not considered.
Refer to your list when you are having negative thoughts. For instance, if you catch yourself thinking no one could like you because of your health issues, instead, think to yourself, “I’m unique, funny, and kind. Everyone has challenges and Crohn’s disease is mine.” Try posting your list somewhere that you will see it often, such as on a mirror or your closet door.
Make a point of starting your day with positive self-talk by giving yourself a compliment or two.

, You may sometimes find yourself thinking about all the challenges of having Crohn's disease. Don't allow yourself to give in to negativity. Make a conscious effort to think about all the things that you have to be grateful for. Practicing gratitude may boost your self-esteem and help you realize that you have many other positive things going on in your life besides the stigma you may experience.Start a gratitude journal and write about all the things you have to be grateful for. Include large things as well as small things. For example, you might write that you are grateful for your family and for your short commute to work.
Write in your gratitude journal each day. For instance, you can start each day by adding two to three things that you are grateful for.

, On top of the stress of coping with Crohn’s disease, you may have other things going on in your life that are stressful. For example, you may have financial, relationship, career, or school responsibilities that are stressing you. When you're overly stressed it can be hard to maintain your self-confidence and manage the stigma associated with Crohn’s disease. Do things to help you manage your stress.


Practice deep-breathing techniques. Slowly inhaling and exhaling a few times can help calm you in tense and stressful moments. Practicing deep-breathing regularly may help you reduce your stress overall.
Meditate as a way to manage your stress and boost your physical and mental health. Start with just a few minutes a day and try to increase the time over the course of a few weeks.
Delegating some of your responsibilities might also help to reduce your stress. Think about what you have on your plate right now and decide if there is anything that you could let someone else handle. Remember that it is okay to say no and don’t set unrealistic expectations for yourself. Try to be realistic about what you can accomplish.

Get the crown out of your mouth.,
Call a dentist as soon as possible.,

Be cautious until you can reattach the crown.,
Clean the crown.Carefully pick any old cement, food, or other material off of the crown if you can, using a toothbrush, a toothpick, or dental floss, and rinse the crown with water.,

Tap your teeth together.Gently bite down to test the position and fit of the crown, and to get it exactly into place.,
Floss carefully to remove any excess cement between the teeth.,
Schedule an appointment to see your dentist.,
Eat and drink with caution until the crown is repaired by a dentist.,
Deal with any pain.",How to Fix a Lost Dental Crown," Carefully retrieve the crown from your mouth so that you do not drop it or swallow it. If you have already swallowed it, you are not in danger, but the crown will need to be replaced.If you have lost the crown, you can coat the tooth surface with an over-the-counter dental cement (available at many pharmacies) to temporarily seal the area until a dentist can repair it.;
, Losing a crown is not a true dental emergency.Still, you should contact the dentist so the crown can be repaired. The dentist can tell you what to do and how to care for it until you can get it fixed.Your tooth will be weak, possibly sensitive, and at a greater risk of decay until the crown is fully prepared so do not delay in contacting your dentist for a solution., If no pieces have chipped off of either the tooth or the crown, you should be able to set the crown temporarily back in place.Contact a dentist and do not attempt to reattach the crown if the crown is filled with hard material or a portion of your tooth, rather than mostly hollow.Your crown may be attached to a metal post, and it is hard to fit the sharp tip into the right place, especially if the crown is on a molar. Contact your dentist for the best guidance.

, Keep the crown in a secure place until you can reattach it, so that you don't lose it. Avoid chewing on tooth that lost the crown until you can reattach it. This will help prevent tooth decay and any further damage to the tooth.

,


If you clean the crown and tooth over a sink, make sure to plug it first so that you don’t accidentally drop it down the drain.

, The tooth will likely be sensitive, which is normal.

,, Testing the crown with a dry fit will help you make sure that you can put it back in place. Set the crown in place and bite down very gently.


The crown should not feel like it is sitting higher than your other teeth. If it does, it may need to be cleaned further.
If the crown does not seem to fit right one way, turn it and try another way. It is designed to fit securely, so it may take some time to get it properly in place.
If you cannot fit the crown in place without cement, do not try to fit it in with cement.

, If you are successfully able to set the crown in place in a dry fit, then you can try to adhere it to the underlying tooth. Dental cements are designed for the job and will secure the crown best, though other materials will work in a pinch. Choose an adhesive based on what is available to you.


Use dental cement. You can probably find this at a pharmacy.This is different than denture cream; the container of dental cement should be labeled as a fix for a crown or cap that has fallen off. Some cements have to be mixed, while others are pre-mixed. Follow directions carefully.
You can also use temporary dental filling material. This is also widely available at pharmacies.
Denture adhesive will also work.If you can’t get denture cement, a loose slurry of flour and water can be used instead.Mix a small amount of flour and water together to make a smooth, loose paste.
Do not use superglue or household adhesives to hold the crown in place.While many people are tempted to do this, it can irritate your tissue and tooth. Doing this is worse than going without a crown for a little while.

, Just a small dab of adhesive spread on the interior surface of the crown should be sufficient.A mirror can be useful to help you see where to place the crown, especially if the tooth is hard to reach. You can also ask someone else for assistance.

,


Before fitting the crown, dry the area with gauze or a towel to clean any saliva in that area. You want the area to be totally dry.
Depending on the directions provided with the particular cement you are using, you may need to clamp down on the crown for a few minutes, then carefully remove any excess cement from around the tooth or gum.

, Don’t pull up on the floss to get it out—instead, slide it between the teeth while biting down gently. This will stop you from accidentally removing the crown again.

, Although the temporary crown may hold for a few days or even weeks in the best-case scenario, you will need to see a dentist as soon as possible for a more permanent reattachment or replacement., Avoid eating on the side of the mouth with the crown.Remember that the crown is only held temporarily in place, so avoid any excessively hard or chewy foods until you can see a dentist.

, If your tooth or jaw is sensitive or in pain because of the temporary crown fix, dab clove oil onto a cotton swab and gently apply to the gum and tooth area. This will numb the site. You can often find clove oil in pharmacies or in the spice aisle of supermarkets.

Use retainers for minor problems.,
Have your orthodontist fit a retainer for you.,
Adjust to the retainer.,
Take out your retainer while eating and brushing your teeth.,
Keep it in its box.,
Clean your retainer daily.,
Don't stop wearing your retainer.",How to Fix Crooked Teeth2," Retainers can be used to fix problems like minor tooth gaps or a single crooked tooth. They're less expensive than other options, especially since you generally must wear a retainer after having braces removed anyway.Retainers require a certain amount of attention and excellent oral hygiene because the metal wires scratch the enamel surface of your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay.

, Your retainer is designed specifically for you because it has to accommodate your particular problem.During the process, the orthodontist will make a mold of your mouth with a thick substance called alginate. They will use the mold to make your retainer., It may take you a couple of days to get used to the retainer, so don't be alarmed. It can affect your speech and cause you to produce more saliva.Try reading aloud to yourself to become accustomed to talking with the retainer.If you experience moderate to severe pain or the retainer is cutting into your gums or pulling too hard on your teeth, contact your orthodontist., Removing your retainer makes both processes easier. You should also take it out if you play contact sports, as it can cause injury., Make sure to protect your retainer by keeping it in its box when not in use.It also needs to be kept moist when not in your mouth so it doesn't crack. Your dentist should tell you how to soak it.Avoid keeping it near a heat source, as that can also crack it., Your retainer should come with instructions on how to clean it, but you can usually use mouthwash or denture cleaner to remove any build-up on it., Wear your retainer as long as your dentist recommends. You may need to wear it for years, depending on your teeth.If you stop wearing it too early, your teeth will move back to the previous stage and you will need to repeat the process all over again.

Use porcelain veneers to correct minor problems.,
Ask your orthodontist if veneers are right for you.,
Have your a cosmetic dentist put in veneers for you.,
Brush your teeth like normal.,
Protect against grinding.,
Replace in five to 10 years.",How to Fix Crooked Teeth3," Veneers essentially cover up problems with a porcelain or resin shell, rather than correcting them.Veneers are stain-resistant (if porcelain) and look much like natural teeth.It is suggested you get them after the age of 35, as this getting them at a younger age can affect the pulp in your teeth and decrease the longevity of the veneers.

, They are a simpler option than braces or retainers because the orthodontist will put them on you and leave them. You don't need to have them removed. They can also cover stains, chips, and gaps.Veneers are permanent and can't be repaired. They're also more expensive than getting a crown, but they will definitely provide you the perfect ""Hollywood"" smile.If you are practicing serious contact sports such as boxing or hockey, veneers may not be even an option. You will definitely need to protect your teeth with a mouthguard when playing these sports, regardless.

, A cosmetic dentist is the most appropriate dental specialist for this procedure. They will remove part of your enamel first, in essence to make room for the veneer. The dentist will already have created the veneer. He or she will examine how the veneer looks in place and then bond it to the tooth.You will likely have a follow-up visit to check on placement, but if you notice a problem, such as cracking or misalignment, contact your dentist., Veneers don't need special attention, but you do need to floss and brush as you normally would., Porcelain veneers can be broken, so if you grind your teeth, you may need to wear a guard at night.You will also need to be very careful when biting hard food such as nuts, hard candy, baked bread, hard biscuits, etc.

, Veneers do not last forever, and you will need to replace them within a decade."

Choose the braces you want.,
Have your orthodontist put in your choice.,
Brush and floss your teeth and braces.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Visit the orthodontist on a regular schedule.,
Have them removed.,
Wear your retainer.",How to Fix Crooked Teeth4," Braces can correct crooked teeth, overbites, underbites, and crossbites, for example., He or she can let you know what the best type of braces are for your particular problem.

, You have the options of visible, invisible, and nearly invisible braces.Visible braces are the type of braces you probably think of when someone says ""braces."" These braces are brackets attached to the front of teeth and connected by metal wires. The brackets can be metal, plastic, or ceramic, and these braces are often cheaper than other types of braces. Visible braces are best for severe problems.Nearly invisible braces are plastic trays that fit over your teeth. The main brand of this type of brace is Invisalign. Like retainers, you can take out these braces to eat, and they are are also not as painful as other braces. However, they don't work as well on severe problems, and you must wear them for at least 22 hours a day. These braces may be slightly more expensive than traditional braces.Invisible braces attach behind the teeth, much as visible braces attach to the front of teeth. Each bracket is customized to your teeth, so it works faster; however, it can be difficult to adjust to these braces, such as making it harder to speak. Also, these are more expensive, as they are made from gold (this allows them to be customized to your teeth)., Remember, most orthodontists do provide financing, so if you cannot afford to pay for the procedure all at once, you can make payments. Alternatively, you may want to get dental insurance, which can cover part of the procedure, though usually not all of it. , If you have elastics, take them out before brushing. With traditional braces, you need to brush both your teeth and the braces themselves to remove plaque and food. Once clean, put the elastics back on.Make sure you also floss and use an interdental toothbrush (with a bristle shaped like a pine tree), which allow you to clean around the brackets and between your teeth.

, Especially with traditional bracket braces, you need to avoid foods, such as hard foods (nuts, hard candies, etc.) and sticky foods (caramel, gum, etc.). You also need to cut up hard fruits and vegetables into smaller pieces.These foods can harm or break your braces.You should also avoid crunchy foods, such as chips, and acidic foods, such as sodas or vinegars.


Since you can take invisible braces out to eat, these foods aren't as much of a problem, though acids on your teeth can still affect them.

, The orthodontist will adjust the braces as you go and be on the lookout for any problems.

, How long your braces are on depends on the severity of the problem. You'll be fitted for a retainer after having your braces removed.

, After your braces are removed, you must wear a retainer to help keep your teeth in line.The advice in the past was you needed to wear a retainer for a year after having braces, but now the advice is you may need to wear a retainer for much longer, though you may only wear it at night."

Chew your food very well.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Cook more food at home.,
Eat mostly vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Avoid triggering beverages.",How to Choose Foods to Improve Digestion2," Your digestion starts in your mouth. This means you need to make sure you are chewing your food as thoroughly as possible before you swallow it. This helps break up large pieces of food, which will make them easier to digest later.


Your saliva also contains enzymes that will start breaking up your food in your mouth.
Chewing also stimulates the secretion of stomach acid, which will help your stomach digest your food, especially proteins., If you find yourself overly full or bloated after a big meal, you may benefit from eating smaller meals throughout the day. For some people, eating smaller meals more frequently during the day can help give your body more time to digest the food you ingest before it gets even more food.


For example, eat three smaller basic meals each day, with two smaller meals in between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner. This will keep the amount of food in your body to a minimum and give your body more time to digest.

, Some digestive problems have been linked to the use of additives and preservatives like MSG, which is common when you eat out or buy prepackaged foods. Instead of relying on this method of eating, cook your meals from fresh ingredients at home.

Talk to your physician.,
Turn to family and friends.,
Join a support group.,
Consider seeing a therapist.",How to Cope with the Stigma of Crohn's Disease2," Sharing your experiences with stigma with your healthcare provider is an excellent way to cope with it. Not only does your physician have knowledge of your specific history of Crohn’s disease, they also have experience helping others cope with the stigma of the disease.Tell your physician what’s been going on, how you feel about it, and ask for support coping with it.


You might say, “Recently I’ve been experiencing some stigma related to my disease. Can you suggest any ways for me to handle it or could I come in to the office so that we could talk about it?”
Ask your healthcare provider for handouts or other resources related to coping with the stigma of your disease. You can say, “Could you give me some information about coping with emotional and social parts of having Crohn’s disease?”
You might even want to ask a close friend or family member to accompany you and help you take notes so that you can review the information later.

, Some people may try to hide their Crohn’s disease from their loved ones for a number of reasons. You may feel embarrassed about the symptoms or you may not want to be a burden on your friends and family.Don’t try to hide your illness or make it seem as though your Crohn’s disease doesn’t affect you as much as it does. Instead be honest with the people that care about you and turn to them for support in dealing with the stigma of your illness.


Surround yourself with supportive loved ones and reduce the time that you spend with people who have a negative effect on you.
Let your loved ones know how Crohn’s disease affects you. For example, you might say, “Having Crohn’s disease is a major challenge for me even though I try to remain positive.”
Ask them to help you cope with the stigma you may feel. For instance, you could try, “Sometimes having Crohn’s disease makes me feel bad about myself. Could you help me cope with this?”
Tell the people that care about you exactly how they can support you. For example, you could tell your best friend, “Could you help me educate people when they say something negative about Crohn’s disease?

, It can be a great relief to talk with others that have Crohn’s disease as well. They can understand and relate to the experiences that you are having. They may also be able to offer you specific strategies and techniques for coping with the disease. They can provide guidance in handling the stigma associated with it.Take some time to research support groups in your area or online.


Ask your physician about support groups for Crohn’s disease in your area. You might say, “Could you recommend some support groups in the community that could help me handle the stigma of this disease?”
In the U.S. you can visit Crohn’s and Colitis Federation of America (CCFA) at http://www.ccfa.org/mobile/support-groups/find-a-support-group.html to find a Crohn’s disease support group near you.
You can also look into online support groups if there are no groups in your area or if you just prefer to connect with people online.

, Sometimes the stigma associated with having Crohn’s disease can cause serious problems in your day-to-day life. You may feel anxious or develop depression. If this is the case you should consider talking with a therapist about what you are feeling. A therapist can provide you with strategies, tips, tools, techniques, and support for dealing with your Crohn’s disease and the stigma that comes with it.Talk to your health care provider about therapists near you. For example, you could say, “I’ve been experiencing some negative feelings lately because of the stigma of my Crohn’s disease. Can you recommend a therapist to help me work through this?”
Ask the people close to you if they can recommend a therapist. For instance, you might ask your best friend, “Can you recommend a therapist in our neighborhood?”

Research more about Crohn’s disease.,
Share what you know.,
Address misconceptions about Crohn’s disease.,
Become an advocate.",How to Cope with the Stigma of Crohn's Disease3," You may already know quite a bit about Crohn’s disease, but new research is always being conducted and information about the disease being updated. The more you know about the disease, the better you’ll be able to manage it.Researching Crohn’s disease and learning more about it will also help you address misperceptions people have about it.


Talk with your physician about the latest developments in Crohn’s disease research. For example, you might say, “Could you tell me about the latest developments in this area?”
Frequently check websites like CCFA’s at http://www.ccfa.org/research/ to keep up-to-date with recent findings and updates about the disease.
You might also consider subscribing to an academic research journal, such as the Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis.

, Some research suggests that educating the public is one effective way to decrease the negative opinions and stigma associated with Crohn’s disease.When you hear someone say something about Crohn’s disease, or the symptoms and effects of it, make a point of speaking up. Sharing what you know about the disease can help you feel good about yourself, can correct misperceptions, and may prevent someone else from being stigmatized.


For example, if you hear someone make a comment about you frequently excusing yourself, you might take them aside and say, “Yes, I do. It's because of my Crohn’s disease. It can be a hassle, but it’s a part of my life.”
Or, for instance, if a co-worker asks about your ‘condition’, don't just say, “It's no big deal.” Tell them a little about Crohn’s disease.
Think about whether you are comfortable using social media as a platform to do this. It may be an effective way to reach lots of people, but only engage this way if you are comfortable doing so.

, A lot of the stigma related to Crohn’s disease comes from misunderstandings and misperceptions about the illness. You can cope with the stigma and educate others by correcting misperceptions you and others may have about the disease.For example, many people believe you can control or cure Crohn’s disease by having a selective diet. You can explain that while avoiding certain foods can help alleviate some symptoms, there is no dietary treatment or cure.
Or, for instance, you might challenge the misperception that if you just relax you’ll feel better. You might say, “Reducing stress can help me feel better in general, like anyone else. But, like anyone else, relaxing more won’t make my disease go away.”

, You can take sharing what you know a step further and work actively in your community to address the stigma of Crohn’s disease. Doing this is a way to cope with the personal stigma you experience, boost your confidence, and educate others all at one time. Take advantage of opportunities to advocate for yourself and other people with Crohn’s disease.


Take part in or organize informational activities in your area. For example, if your school is holding a health fair, you can advocate for Crohn’s Disease by setting up an informational booth.
Talk with the members of your support group about ways you all can advocate for Crohn’s disease. You might say, “Are there any ways they we, as a group, can advocate for ourselves and other people with this disease?” You can also discuss fundraising ideas and opportunities with members of your support group. Many organizations rely on donations to advance their research and public awareness efforts.
Be creative! For example, a group of UK ladies created a calendar to show that you can be sexy and have Crohn’s disease."

Brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day.,
Floss once a day.,
Use antibacterial mouthwash to clean your whole mouth.,
Snack on ""gum-friendly"" foods.,
Stay hydrated.,
Visit your dentist and oral hygienist every six to eight months.",How to Get Healthy Gums1," This is the number one step you can take to care for your teeth. Using a soft or medium bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste, be sure to brush in the morning and evening every day. Set a timer for two minutes or listen to a short song to keep time.


Don't ""scrub"" your teeth hard — hold the brush like a pencil and brush in light circles and vertical strokes which will prevent gum recession. Focus on the gums as well. Your gums are a delicate tissue that act like a barrier against bacteria.Hold the brush at a 45 degree angle, just along the edge of the gum line.
Be sure to brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth as well.
Replace your brush every two to three months or when the bristles become worn.;
, Flossing is still the most effective way to remove food and plaque from between your teeth, where it can irritate your gums if not removed. Be sure to get each tooth from each side.


The floss should form a ""C"" shape around the tooth.
Do not push too far into your gums — goes as deep as the gum line but no further.
Do at least four vertical movements which will extract the bacteria underneath your gums.

, Your teeth only make up 25% of your mouth, and you need to keep the whole thing clean to prevent infections that lead to unhealthy gums. Use antibacterial mouthwash a few times a week, but avoid mouthwash with alcohol in it, as this causes more harm than good.Another option is a chlorhexidine mouthwash. Do not use it for longer than two weeks in a row as it might stain your teeth

, Sugary snacks, gum, and sodas all promote the growth of unhealthy bacteria in your mouth which lead to gum disease. Potato chips, crackers, and dried fruit can also stick to your teeth, and the residue can cause damage if it is not wiped away quickly. Since most people do not brush their teeth after snacking, these particles can remain on teeth for hours.


Foods rich in calcium, like dairy, are great for tooth health.
Vegetables, hummus, and fresh fruit are all healthy alternatives for your mouth.
If you do eat sugary foods, rinse your mouth out with water afterwards.Wait at least half an hour before brushing if you ate sugary food or fizzy drinks.

, Saliva is crucial for keeping your mouth healthy and the bacteria in balance. Drink 4 – 8oz of water every hour — especially when you feel thirsty or your mouth is dry., They are trained to notice any problems with your gums and can give you personalized suggestions to help you keep your gums happy and healthy. Be sure to make regular appointments, even if you don't think you have any problems.

Be aware of your triggers.,
Start reading food labels.,
Look out for high-fructose corn syrup.,
Be aware of sugar alcohols.,
Watch out for vegetable juices.,
Go for mostly water.,
Drink decaf tea.,
Use caution when consuming dairy products.,
Make your own fruit or vegetable juices.,
Make your own bone broth.,
Stay away from sweetened beverages.,
Drink little to no caffeinated beverages.,
Limit carbonated beverages.,
Steer clear from alcohol.",How to Choose IBS Friendly Beverages," IBS is a very hard condition to manage and control. Everyone has different symptoms and may have different triggers.To help you find IBS-friendly beverages, be aware of your own trigger foods.


You may want to consider keeping a journal or a note pad. You can write down different foods, beverages or meals that you've had and what symptoms you experienced after ingesting them.
Over time, you may be able to notice a pattern or be able to pick out certain foods or ingredients that will trigger your symptoms.
When looking for IBS-friendly beverages, keep this list of triggers in the back of your mind and make sure they do not pop up on the ingredient list in any beverage you're going to purchase or consume.;
, If you have IBS it's important to start reading food labels. This is where you'll find information on the nutritive value of the beverage, but also the ingredients.For many people that suffer with IBS, certain foods or ingredients can trigger the onset of symptoms. Reading the food label, especially the ingredient list, can help you avoid symptoms.
Although the nutrition fact panel is helpful and informative, it will not provide you information on ingredients or the types of added sugars in a beverage. You'll need to review the ingredient list.
The ingredient list is found next to or below the nutrition fact panel. The ingredients listed are ordered from the one in greatest quantity to the one in the least quantity. Review this list to look out for certain trigger items.

, One particular ingredient that has been implicated in more frequent IBS flare ups is high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).This ingredient is found in many foods, so watch out and read your labels carefully.


HFSC is a sweetener that is found in many, many foods. Some studies have shown that higher intakes of HFCS has triggered IBS symptoms like bloating or diarrhea.
Most food manufacturers do not advertise that they use HFSC in their products. You'll need to review the entire ingredient list and look for high-fructose corn syrup in the list. If it is listed, do not purchase or consume this product.
HFSC is frequently found in the following beverages: regular sodas, fruit juice cocktails, chocolate milk, sweetened sports drinks, lemonade and fruit drinks. Note that not all brands of these items do contain HFSC, so you'll need to read the label on your favorite brands.

, You should try your best to remove all processed drinks (including sodas) from your diet. If you think going for ""diet beverages"" is the best bet (especially when trying to avoid high-fructose corn syrup), think again. Many of these diet beverages have additives that also can trigger an IBS flare up.


Many diet beverages contain artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols to make their beverages taste sweet without the use of sugar. They're typically found in diet sodas, teas and diet fruit juice.
However, many studies have shown that sugar alcohols in particular are a significant cause of IBS flare ups.There are a variety of sugar alcohols that can be used to sweeten drinks. However, a key way of picking them out of an ingredient list is to look for words that end in ""-ol"".
Sugar alcohols to watch out for include: sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol, and isomalt.
If you see a diet beverage that lists any of these sugar alcohols as an ingredient, do not purchase or consume it.

, One of the proposed causes of some IBS symptoms are foods that are high in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). These foods include a variety of vegetables, and when consumed, can bring on IBS symptoms.Vegetable juice may sound like a nutritious and healthy beverage to have. Although it does contain a variety of vitamins and minerals, some of the vegetables used to make the juice may cause a flare up in IBS symptoms.
When you're considering a vegetable juice, look at the ingredient list to see what exact vegetables and what juices are used to make that particular blend.
Don't drink any juices that contain beets, cabbage, fennel, legumes, peas, avocados, cauliflower, or snow peas.
You can and should drink juices that contain carrots, celery, chives, broccoli, cucumber, ginger parsley, pumpkin, spinach, zucchini, squash, yams, turnips and eggplant.
Specifically watch out for juices made with: garlic, onions, beets or celery. Do not purchase vegetable juice blends that contain these ingredients.
If possible, try to make your own juices rather than buying commercial ones. Carrot and potato juice are especially good for reducing inflammation.

, When you're trying to choose beverages that will be good for IBS and not cause symptoms, your best choice is water. It's all natural and hydrating which is the right combination for those suffering from IBS.


Most health professionals recommend that adults drink about 64 oz or eight glasses of water daily. However, some people may need up to 13 glasses daily based on gender and activity level.If you experience diarrhea as a symptom of IBS, you'll need to replace the fluids lost in your stool with additional water. In times of IBS flare ups, drink closer to 13 glasses daily.
You can try some water flavorings that use stevia or truvia as these no calorie sweeteners haven't been shown to aggravate IBS symptoms in most people.
You can also try making infused waters at home. These give your water an all natural flavor without the use of any sugars or no calorie sweeteners. Mix fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs and let water sit overnight.
Drink room temperature water, not ice water.
Drink water about 30 minutes before a meal, because it dilutes and deactivates digestive enzymes in your stomach.

, Since caffeine is a known gastrointestinal stimulant which can irritate your GI tract, pick decaf tea instead. Decaf tea can be an enjoyable beverage to choose if you suffer from IBS.Decaf coffee still contains some traces of caffeine, so it should be avoided.
Herbal tea is naturally decaffeinated. Try to drink it warm or room temperature to avoid upsetting your GI system. Chamomile tea can also be soothing for people with IBS.
Ginger tea is something you may want to consider having more often. It's decaf but also can help soothe an upset stomach.

, Dairy products are a questionable group of foods for those suffering with IBS. Although dairy products do not bother everyone, it's quite common to have lactose intolerance with IBS.Dairy foods can be problematic for those with IBS for two reasons. To start with, dairy products, especially whole milk products, contain a higher amount of fat. This may cause IBS symptoms — especially diarrhea.
The lactose in dairy products is a natural sugar but is frequently not tolerated well with those who have IBS. Gas, bloating and cramping are common side effects after consuming these foods.
Stay away from milk (especially whole milk), chocolate milk (especially if it contains high-fructose corn syrup) and other milk based beverages (even decaf lattes).
Try incorporating dairy-free milks like rice milk or almond milk. If fat doesn't bother you, try lactose-free milk instead.

, Try not to drink commercial juices. If you enjoy the occasionally glass of fruit or vegetable juice, consider making fresh juice at home. This allows you to choose specific fruits and vegetables and feel confident that they won't affect your IBS.


If you drink juices regularly or would like to, consider buying a juicer at home. This will allow you to make a variety of juices right in your own home with whatever fruits and vegetables you like.
Many fruits do not cause a problem for those with IBS. You can generally include fruits like: cranberries, bananas, grapefruits, grapes, pineapples and lemons. If you want to sweeten your juice, choose honey, agave syrup or regular white sugar.
Vegetable juices should only be made from foods that don't cause symptoms. Stay clear from onions, garlic, and beets. However, most other vegetables shouldn't cause a problem.

, Bone broth can help soothe IBS symptoms. Bone broth is easy to digest and full of nutrients.Here's a quick way to make your own bone broth:

Put the following ingredients in a pot: 3 pounds grass-fed beef bones; 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, preferably Bragg's; 1 tablespoon whole dried peppercorns; 1 tablespoon sea salt; enough water to fill the pot mostly (this is not an exact measurement); and any other spices you want to add, such as bay leaves, onions, carrots, celery, or sage.
Let your ingredients sit for an hour, unheated.
Turn on the heat and bring your broth to a boil.
Next, you should move your entire broth to a crock pot. Be careful when moving the bones; you might want to put them in first. Then pour your entire broth into the crock pot.
Let your broth simmer in the crock pot for anywhere between 4-72 hours, depending on how concentrated you want your broth to be. Try starting by letting it simmer for 5-8 hours.
Let your broth cool and then store it. You can also keep the bones and store then for later use.
Drink your bone broth! You can add some butter to it to make it more palatable on its own, or you can use it in soup., Since high-fructose corn syrup is a common sweetener found in many sugary beverages, it's best to try to limit or avoid these types of drinks.


Not only are sweetened beverages linked to increased IBS symptoms, they are also linked with weight gain and other chronic health issues.Eliminate regular soda, sweetened coffee drinks, milkshakes, chocolate milk, fruit drinks, fruit juice cocktails, lemonade and sweet tea.
Remember that diet drinks can also be an issue due to the sugar alcohols they contain. Regardless of what you choose, always read the label.

, Caffeinated beverages are something people swear by to get their GI systems going. This stimulant is something that causes increased symptoms in those suffering with IBS.Caffeine, whether from coffee or tea, acts as a stimulant as it passes through your GI system. For those with IBS, this can cause intestinal cramping, pain and diarrhea.
Limit or avoid beverages with caffeine. Always choose decaf beverages if possible.
You can try caffeinated tea that has been watered down a bit. However, try only a small quantity of this to see if you can tolerate it well.

, Another large group of beverages that you should consider limiting are carbonated beverages. Anything that has a little fizz to it could set off symptoms.Many people think some carbonated beverages, especially ginger ale, are good for your stomach. Although sometimes ginger-based sodas can soothe an upset stomach, this is not true for those that have IBS.
The carbonation found in these fizzy beverages can cause additional cramping, bloating and stomach upset. They generally do not cause diarrhea or constipation.
Avoid sodas, tonic water, seltzer water, sparkling flavored water, sparkling iced tea, beer and sparkling wines.

, The occasionally alcoholic beverage isn't usually a problem for most people. However, this is an irritant and causes increased symptoms for those suffering with IBS.


It's typically never recommended for women to have more than 1 drink daily and men to have 2 drinks daily.Most IBS sufferers can have very small quantities of alcohol without experiencing symptoms.
However, a study showed that with alcohol intake at 4 drinks or greater, there were increases in symptoms like indigestion, diarrhea, stomach pain and nausea.It's OK to have the occasional glass of wine (especially since it's not carbonated) if it does not trigger unwanted symptoms. However, keep it to a 4 oz serving every now and again instead of daily or in larger quantities.

Floss once a day.,
Visit the dentist regularly.,
Limit thumb-sucking in kids.",How to Fix Crooked Teeth5," Gingivitis can lead to crooked teeth, which is generally caused by not taking proper care of your teeth.You should brush at least twice a day.Often crooked teeth are caused by genetic problems and cannot be prevented.
If gingivitis gets more serious and it is not treated, it will lead to periodontitis, which makes teeth change their position and become loose.

, Flossing also helps prevent gingivitis., Not only does visiting the dentist help prevent gingivitis, he or she will recognize if you have problems that could lead to crooked teeth., Thumb-sucking can lead to crooked teeth over time.Also limit the use of pacifiers and bottles after age three."

Know if you are at risk of gum disease.,
Avoid smoking cigarettes.,
Get a professional cleaning twice a year.,
Know the symptoms of gum disease.,
Take action with your dentist before gum disease progresses.",How to Get Healthy Gums2," There are several risk factors for gum disease that are out of your control. If you have any of the following factors, be sure to talk to your dentist about ways to prevent gum disease:


Diabetes
Family history of gum disease
Hormonal changes in women and girls
Medications that lead to dry mouth
Immune-affecting diseases like cancer or AIDS
Poor oral hygiene habits, Smoking is one of the biggest risk factors for gum disease in the world, and can prevent successful treatment. The easiest way to avoid gum disease is to quit smoking.Combined with alcohol, the effects get much worse. Avoid smoking and drinking simultaneously.

, Almost all gum disease can be prevented by cleaning away plaque from your teeth, and your dentist or oral hygienist is the best equipped person to do so. Be sure to keep you your regular visits and you respect the indications given after the treatment.

, Unchecked, gum diseases can damage the tissue and cartilage in your mouth and lead to tooth decay. If you experience any of the following symptoms chronically you should make an appointment with your dentist immediately:


Bad breath that won’t go away
Red or swollen gums
Tender or bleeding gums
Painful chewing or a burning feeling of the gums
Loose teeth
Sensitive teeth
Receding gums (teeth appear ""longer"" than usual), Gingivitis is when the gums become inflamed or swollen, and is not particularly dangerous by itself; however, if it is not cared for soon enough it can progress to periodontitis, where the gums detach from the tooth, allowing bacteria to enter and damage your teeth. If your gums don't feel better with regular brushing and flossing then you may need antibiotics or surgery to prevent disease.

Get quotes from several dentists.,
Look at new dental practices.,
Check into dental schools.,
Look for clinics with just the basics.,
Ask friends, family, and co-workers for recommendations.",How to Find Low Cost Dental Implants1," Pricing on dental implants can vary from dentist to dentist. Just as you would shop around for a quote on car repairs, you should also compare pricing between dentists to find the best rate. Talk to each dentist about the details of the procedure, including any necessary x-rays and CT scans, anesthesia, modeling, surgery, what kind of materials will be needed, and what other procedures may be involved. You should get a comprehensive breakdown and cost estimate for each part of the process.Your general dentist is not the only professional qualified to perform dental implant procedures. Periodontists and oral surgeons are also qualified. Gather pricing information from these types of practices as well.;
, Newer dental practices will often offer reduced pricing to bring in new patients. Contact some of the newer practices in your area and obtain price quotes from them as well.


Ensure you verify the credentials of newer practices since they probably don’t have many customer reviews from which to judge their ability., You may also want to consider getting your implant work done at a dental school. Many of these schools offer dental implant clinics in order to provide recent graduates the opportunity to gain hands-on experience performing dental implant surgery. The work is watched closely by instructors and other students so you will still receive high quality work, but at a fraction of the price.


Be aware that many schools of dentistry only offer this option to low-income individuals and there is often a waiting list.
In addition, you may need to go for multiple visits and the hours, which are usually during typical work hours, are often inconvenient., Many times, the cost of your procedure can increase because of the luxuries provided. While nice, these luxuries aren’t necessary. Check into clinics that focus solely on providing affordable dental work, skipping the unnecessary bells and whistles. Be sure, however, to make sure the clinic provides not only affordable, but high-quality work. Do some research to find testimonials from previous patients that have undergone similar procedures so you can see how their experiences have been., Personal recommendations are also a good way to find a dentist that can perform your implant for a reasonable price. Some dental offices even offer discounts on services to new referrals and those who have referred them. Check with your friends, family members, and co-workers to see if they’ve had any similar work done and if they can suggest a dentist who can perform the procedure at a reasonable rate.

Try oral laxatives for relief.,
Use rectal laxatives for quick relief.,
Consider combination laxatives.",How to Choose an Over‐the‐Counter Laxative1," There are several different types of oral laxatives you may want to try. They relieve constipation in different ways and have different side effects. They work by triggering muscle contractions or softening your stool. You may want to take an oral laxative if you want something that works slightly slower than a rectal option or if you don’t want to insert it in your anus.The following types of oral laxatives may work best for you:


Oral osmotics, such as Milk of Magnesia or Miralax. These draw water into the colon and allow easier stool passage. They may have side effects such as bloating, cramping, and gas.
Oral bulk formers such as Benefiber, Citrucel and Metamucil. These absorb water to form a soft, bulky stool for normal intestinal contraction. They may have side effects such as bloating, gas, or cramping.
Oral stool softeners such as Colace and Surfak. These add moisture to your stool and provide strain-free bowel movements. They may cause electrolyte imbalances, especially if used longer-term. These types of medications have fewer side effects, but they are also less effective than other types of laxatives.
Oral stimulants such as Dulcolax and Senokot. These trigger your intestinal muscles to contract and evacuate stool. They may have side effects such as burping, cramping, and nausea.;
, Rectal laxatives are often used as enemas or suppositories to stimulate a bowel movement in a short period of time. Some companies that make oral laxatives also make rectal versions. Some common rectal laxatives include Colace, Dulcolax Bowel Cleansing Kit, Fleet Glycerin, and The Magic Bullet.All rectal laxatives may cause cramping, rectal irritation, and stomach discomfort.You may want to try:Hyperosmotic laxatives such as glycerin (polyethylene glycol) and sodium phosphate. These draw water into the bowel and increase its action.Lubricants such as mineral oil. These coat the bowel to make your stool more slippery. This makes evacuating your bowels easier.Stimulants, or contact laxatives, such as bisacodyl and senna. These increase muscle contractions that help move the stool mass out of your bowel.These are the harshest type of laxatives.Emollients, or stool softeners, such as docusate. These help prevent dry and hard stool masses that allow you to evacuate your bowels without straining., Some companies offer products that combine different types of laxatives. One example is a stimulant and a stool softener. Combinations may be more effective than a simple oral or rectal laxative. They are also more likely to cause side effects. Consider combined laxative if you are badly constipated."

Know the risks.,
Try a nail file.,
File off tags with a rotary tool.,
Try dental adhesives.,
Put your dentures in the freezer.,
Try a pain cream.,
Remove your dentures.",How to File Down Dentures1," If you try to file your dentures yourself, you risk damaging them beyond repair. As dentures are expensive, you risk losing a large amount of money if you try filing them yourself. It's always best to ask your prosthodontist or dentist to adjust them., Some people do not like the length of certain teeth on their dentures, and they use a nail file for this purpose. Lightly rub it against the teeth you want to shorten, filing on the point or edge of the tooth. However, be sure to make small adjustments. You don't want to go too far when filing your teeth because it's difficult and expensive to repair them after you've filed too far.As you file them down, keep stopping to check how far you've filed. Try not to go to far.
Clean the dentures before putting them back in your mouth and checking your adjustments.

, Sometimes, your dentures will dig into your gums because they don't fit properly. They may also have small tags leftover from manufacturing. Some people use rotary tools to make adjustments. Make sure to keep it on a very low rotation. The heat of a high rotation may damage your dentures, although any kind of repair can damage your dentures.Identify where the problem is. When you have the dentures in, pinpoint exactly where they dig into your gums. Try to be very precise and gentle.
Take them out of your mouth. Use the rotary tool to gently rub against that area, filing it down. Make sure to only take away a little at a time. Be sure to clean the dentures before putting them back in your mouth and testing the adjustment.
You can use a fingernail drill, for instance, or a crafting rotary tool. Use a bit that will let you sand off edges, such as a round- or oval-shaped bit.

, When you first get dentures, your mouth needs time to adjust to the new teeth. To help your mouth out, you can use dental adhesives to hold them in place for the first few days. Eventually, though, the muscles in your mouth should adjust to keep your dentures in place, so you should only need to use them for a short time. Adhesive is helpful when you have pain as it holds your denture still in your mouth. Movement against an already sore spot will lead to an ulcer.


You an also use adhesives as a temporary measure when they start to become loose after years of wearing. However, you need to have your dentist reline your dentures when they become loose, so you should only use the glue for a short while.Every adhesive is a bit different. However, in general, you take the dentures out of your mouth and clean them. Shake some of the powder onto the gum side of the dentures. Put your dentures back in. Cream adhesive must be applied to a dry denture in order to work, rinse your mouth and then place denture onto a wet gum and wait five minutes before eating or drinking anything.

, One option some people use for helping to relieve pain, especially with new dentures, is to place them in the freezer. When you take them out, the cold will help soothe the pain in your gums., Creams such as benzocaine topical can provide temporary relief from pain. Simply rub the cream on the painful area in your mouth, and it will numb the pain. Baby teething gel is available in most supermarkets. There are much stronger medications available, but if cost is a problem, or accessibility, then the baby gel is a good option. It is very safe and gives reasonable relief to sore spots on your gums., If other options don't help, go ahead and take your dentures out for a bit. That will at least provide pain relief. See your dentist for help.

See your dentist for a cleaning.,
Brush your teeth correctly.,
Floss daily.,
Use antibiotics or antiseptic rinses.,
Use herbs to massage your gums.,
Limit sugars and processed starches.,
Use honey or stevia in place of sugar.,
Pay attention to the amount of citrus you eat.,
Chew your meals slowly and drink water.,
Take a mineral supplement.,
Get more vitamin D. Vitamin D and calcium work together to strengthen your bones and teeth.",How to Fix a Loose Tooth," You should see your dentist at least twice a year if you don't have dental issues, like gingivitis.Your dentist and dental hygienist will deep clean your teeth, taking care to deep clean the pockets that otherwise can't be cleaned by brushing or flossing.Calculus gets under the gums creating a constant deposit of aggressive bacteria, which leads to inflamed gums, gum recession and bone loss.
If you have gingivitis or periodontitis, talk with your dentist about getting more frequent cleanings.;
, Take a toothbrush with soft bristles and set it against your gums at a 45-degree angle. Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of your teeth using small short strokes. Brush each surface about 10 times using gentle pressure. Don't forget to hold the brush vertically and brush up-and-down to clean the inside surfaces of your front teeth. Brush your tongue, spit out the toothpaste, and leave the foam in your mouth without rinsing.Brush your teeth and tongue with a tartar-control toothpaste at least twice a day.
Leaving the toothbrush foam on your teeth gives the minerals some time to be absorbed into your teeth, especially if you use a fluoride toothpaste which has more than 1200ppm.

, Unwind about 18 inches of dental floss and wind most of it around the middle finger of one hand with the rest around the middle finger of your other hand. Firmly hold the floss between your thumb and forefinger. Guide the floss between each tooth, gently using a back and forth and side to side motion to gently move the floss between your teeth without causing it to snap. Be sure to rub each side of each tooth before unwinding more floss and moving to the next tooth.Or, you can use a ""water pick"" (a handheld device that steadily sprays water between your teeth and gums). Consider using a ""water pick"" if you don't like flossing, have braces, have bridges, or can't floss. Fill it with a 50:50 solution of mouthwash and water to increase the antibacterial protection.

, Your dentist might prescribe one of these to use daily if you have gum disease. You may need to take oral antibiotics like low-dose doxycycline to control bacteria that damages the gums, which may last for up to three months. Or, your dentist could recommend that you use an antimicrobial rinse as a mouthwash.You may be told to place antiseptic chips or gel packets in the deep pockets between your gums and teeth. If you are not too handy ask a member of your household to help you, or schedule an appointment with your dentist. These can control harmful bacteria.

, Natural anti-inflammatory herbs and oils can treat bacteria, reducing gum inflammation. Try gently massaging your gums with one of these to get the following benefits:


Turmeric: anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibiotic.Aloe Vera: anti-inflammatory, which is good for those who suffer from gingivitis or periodontis.
Mustard oil: antibiotic, anti-inflammatory.Peppermint oil: antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, breath freshener.Oregano oil: antibiotic, immune-booster.Amla (Indian gooseberry): anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, high levels of vitamin C.Sea salt: prevents bacterial growth and tightens gums around the teeth., Bacteria feeds off of sugar, so reduce your sugar intake to keep bacteria from thriving.Avoid processed and pre-packaged foods, and sweetened drinks. Read labels and avoid the product if sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, cane syrup, or another sweetener is listed as one of the top five ingredients. Reduce or avoid the following, which can have an even worse effect if you are consuming more than one of these items on a regular basis:


Pre-packaged snacks, crackers, chips.
Breads or cakes.
Soda, fruit drinks, sweet tea.

, When you do eat something sweet, use honey which has antibacterial properties and stevia. Stevia is an herb that is 200 times sweeter than sugar and has no calories.Avoid using artificial sweeteners like aspartame which can cause glucose intolerance (prediabetes) by changing the balance of your gut bacteria., Eat citrus fruits in moderation and be sure to rinse out your mouth with water and never brush immediately after eating. This will decrease the amount of acid in your mouth.The natural sugars in fruit, fructose, don't feed bacteria and are not found in high levels in fresh fruit like apples, pears, or peaches. Don't be afraid to eat fresh fruits., Take the time to chew each bite completely so that your mouth produces saliva.Saliva can naturally remineralize your teeth during meals and the more you chew the more saliva will be released. You should also drink 6 to 8 eight-ounce glasses of pure water a day. You don't need to drink mineral water; get your minerals from your diet instead. It's fine to drink well or tap water, which contain minerals unique to your area.Tap water in much of the US is treated with fluoride to help prevent tooth decay. Though many people choose bottled water over tap water, most bottled water does not have much (if any) fluoride. If your water is ""de-ionized, purified, demineralized, or distilled,"" then any naturally occurring fluoride has been removed.Drinking water is simply a way to stay hydrated without ingesting substances that damage your teeth.
If you eat sour acidic foods, chew even slower to increase the amount of saliva you make.

, Your multivitamin should contain minerals, especially calcium and magnesium. Magnesium is important in preventing calcium loss, which can weaken your bones and teeth.Try to get at least 1000 mg of calcium and 300 to 400 mg of magnesium every day if you do not consume products such as milk, cheese or yogurt. Otherwise you will have an increased rate of calculus deposits. If you're a man over 71 or a woman over 51, try to get 1200 mg of calcium every day.


Children taking children's vitamins have different magnesium needs. From birth to 3 years old, they need 40 to 80 mg a day; for kids between three and six years old, they need 120 mg a day; and for kids up to 10 years old, they need 170 mg a day., Vitamin D can also help destroy bacteria that causes dental decay.Try to get about 600 IU (international units) of vitamin D every day. Adults over 70 years should bet 800 IU every day. Or, you can spend about 10–15 minutes every third day in the afternoon sun without sunscreen. Expose your arms, legs, and back, if you can. To get vitamin D from your diet eat foods rich in vitamin D. These include:Fish (salmon, snapper, whitefish, mackerel).
Soymilk fortified with vitamin D.
Coconut milk.
Cow’s milk.
Eggs.
Yogurt.

Check nearby cities.,
Look into traveling abroad.,
Ask your dentist about different materials.,
Ask about anesthesia options.,
Negotiate a deal for multiple implants.",How to Find Low Cost Dental Implants2," Where you live can also affect the price of dental implants. For example, dental practices located in urban areas tend to have higher prices than those in more rural areas. If you live in a city, expand your search to include several of the smaller towns surrounding you., Dental implants may be much cheaper abroad than they are in your home country. For example, the average cost of getting dental implants in the U.S. is approximately $4,000, whereas it can be as little as $1,600 in Mexico and $850 in India.According to Patients Beyond Borders, dental tourism is becoming increasingly popular. For instance, more than 1.2 million Americans traveled abroad for heath or dental treatment in 2014.Some of the most popular destinations for dental implant surgery are Europe, India, and the Philippines, but other options include Argentina, Costa Rica, Africa, Hungary, Poland, and Spain. You can get dental implant work done in a wide variety of countries, but where you choose will depend on many different factors.When researching a clinic abroad, get several different quotes and include the following in your final calculation: How many visits to the country are required? How much will you spend on flights, hotel accommodations, food, transportation to and from the clinic, and time taken off work? Also, if you have insurance, will it cover this procedure if it’s done abroad?There are also risks associated with dental tourism that must be taken into consideration. Keep in mind, you’ll be a long way from home so if you need to return to get anything repaired you’ll incur travel expenses again or may have to pay out-of-pocket to get it fixed back home. In addition, the materials used may be incompatible with equipment in your home country. Also, you may be exposed to diseases that are not common where you live and you could be dealing with an inexperienced dentist if the country holds a lower standard of training and education. In addition, if something goes wrong, you may not be able to take legal action.The cheapest place to get dental implants, on average, is Hungary. The average price for one dental implant is $480. Hungary is well-known for its high quality cosmetic dentistry care and attracts patients from many countries.Also be careful to check credentials on dentists in foreign countries, just as you would on dentists in your home country. It is a good idea to consult an international dental referral service that is informed on dental practices in foreign countries and can guide you to a qualified practice abroad., The type of material used in dental implants can depend on myriad factors—the severity of your situation, how long you want to have the implant before you need to replace it, the placement of your implants, and so on. Ask your doctor for suggestions on lower-cost materials and brands that will still satisfy your needs and leave you with a quality result.


Keep in mind that, while lower-cost materials may be less expensive at the time of surgery, they may need replaced sooner or cause complications, costing you more money in the long-run. Be sure to weigh out the pros and cons of each material in regards to your particular situation., Dentists use either general anesthesia, where an anesthesiologist needs to be present to put you under, or local anesthesia, where the dentist can numb only the part of your mouth they’ll be working on. General anesthesia is going to be significantly more expensive, so ask your doctor if it is safe to use only local anesthesia in your situation., If you need more than one dental implant, dentists are often willing to negotiate a deal to make the second or third implant cheaper. Include this question when you are getting quotes on your implants if you are planning to get more than one dental implant. It can also save money on doctor’s visits and procedure costs, like anesthesia, if you get all of your implants taken care of at the same time."

Inquire with your insurance about your options.,
Ask your dentist about financing options.,
Check into discount dental plans.,
Inquire with local dental associations and charitable organizations.,
Create a fundraising campaign.",How to Find Low Cost Dental Implants3," Check with your insurance company to see if dental implants are covered on your plan. Although many insurance companies consider this a cosmetic procedure and don’t cover it, more and more insurance companies are beginning to offer coverage because of the long-term benefits of dental implants over alternative treatments.


If your insurance does not cover dental implants, ask if they will cover part of the cost that would be covered under an alternative treatment, like dentures or a bridge., If your implant is not covered under your insurance policy, check with your dentist to see if they offer a payment plan of some kind. Some dental practices offer payment plans for expensive procedures under these circumstances.Keep in mind that you will likely have to pay interest and other fees if you go with this option.There are also organizations like DentalLoans.com that can help you finance your dental implants if your doctor does not offer a payment plan. These types of services will give you a loan to cover expensive dental work (provided you meet their qualifications), splitting the cost into more manageable monthly payments, rather than one big lump sum., Discount dental plans are membership-based plans that require the patient to pay a yearly fee, normally ranging from $100 to $300. In exchange for this fee, members receive discounts between 10 to 60 percent on dental procedures.


You will be required to go to an affiliated dentist when using this type of plan. These dentists may not necessarily be located in your area.
Beware of offers that sound too good to be true. They might be. Check the terms of the plan in addition to the qualifications of the dentist thoroughly., Many dental associations offer low-income patients discounted care. They may also offer assistance to those in certain demographic groups, such as victims of domestic abuse and people with disabilities. In addition, there may be charitable organizations in your area that offer grants for dental work.For example, Cosmetic Dentistry Grants Program offers grants to people for cosmetic dental procedures that may not be covered by their insurance. To receive this grant, you must go for a free dental assessment by a qualifying dentist to determine what work you need done, and complete any general dentistry work, like fillings and root canals, that is necessary before the cosmetic procedure can be completed., If you were not able to find an affordable solution, you may consider starting a fundraising campaign to help cover your costs. Websites like Indiegogo.com and GoFundMe.com allow you to start a campaign to raise money for a personal matter.


If you choose to go with this option, you’ll need to set up a page explaining your situation and containing a link for people to donate to your cause.
Make sure you include a detailed explanation of your situation and how being able to afford dental implants will change your life for the better.
You can then share this page with your friends and family through social media sites like Facebook and Twitter."

Figure out the effect you desire.,
Read package labels.,
Determine the best options for you.",How to Choose an Over‐the‐Counter Laxative2," There is a wide variety of over-the-counter laxatives available. Each has different effects on your intestinal tract and body. Taking the time to figure out what effect you want the laxative to have can help you choose the right product for yourself. Ask yourself questions such as:How long have I been constipated?
Did I try to relieve my constipation with diet, beverages, or exercise?
Did I use any other methods to relieve my constipation?
Do I want a laxative I take orally or rectally?
Do I want a laxative with a stimulant?
Do I want a laxative that works very quickly or within a few hours?
Do I have any special health considerations?

, It’s important to read the package labels for any type of laxative that you may choose. Read the label to ensure that you are getting the kind of laxative you want, such as a combination. This also minimizes the risk that you use an over-the-counter laxative that has contradictions or may interact with your current medication.Ask a pharmacist or doctor any questions you may have about specific laxatives. You can also call the manufacturer or access information on the company’s website. Most companies will provide this information on the product packaging.
Check the Food and Drug Administration’s website on product recalls, market withdrawals and safety. This can let you know if there are any potential problems with a laxative you are considering to help relieve your constipation., Figure out a few types of laxatives that may work for you. Then compare the types and make a final choice. Consider factors such as:Overall health.
Medical conditions.
Allergies.

Use laxatives with caution.,
Be aware of the risks with laxatives.,
Follow dosing instructions.,
Watch for warning signs.",How to Choose an Over‐the‐Counter Laxative3," Many people may not need a laxative to relieve constipation.Consider making lifestyle changes such as drinking more water, eating more fiber, or trying some gentle exercise. If nothing else has worked, consider a laxative. You should be especially cautious with combination laxatives.


Talk to your doctor or medical professional to see if laxatives are a safe choice for you. You should be especially careful if you haven’t used laxatives before.Watch out for stimulant laxatives because they can cause extreme abdominal pain and discomfort as they stimulate your digestive tract. Continuous daily ingestion of stimulant laxatives can cause hypokalemia, protein loss, and salt overload. These drugs should be used with extreme caution.

, Like any medication, laxatives come with risks. This is particularly true if you use laxatives in the longer-term. Understanding the potential risks of taking laxatives can help you take your chosen laxative in the safest way. Risks of laxative use include:Electrolyte imbalances.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
Weakness.
Confusion.
Complicating conditions such as appendicitis.Decreasing colon function.

, It’s important to read the dosing instructions of your chosen laxative. Take the amount suggested on the packaging and don’t exceed it unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Doing this can minimize your risk of side effects including making your constipation worse.Contact your doctor or ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about dosing instructions. Let either professional know the recommended dose and make sure it’s appropriate for your purposes.

, If you take your chosen laxative and don’t see results, look out for warning signs of potential problems. Noticing certain signs or symptoms of things such as dehydration or not evacuating your bowels quickly can ensure you get prompt medical attention and treatment.Observe if you have any symptoms of electrolyte levels or dehydration. These include: dry mouth, thirst, reduced urine output, and lightheadedness.
Pay attention to how long it takes to evacuate your bowels after a rectal laxative. If it takes longer than 30 minutes, contact your doctor right away.
Notice if you have any signs of kidney injury including drowsiness; lethargy; decreased urine; or swelling of the ankles, feet and legs. It is especially important to seek medical attention if you experience these symptoms after taking sodium phosphate laxatives.

Go to the emergency room as a last resort.",How to Find an Emergency Dentist," If you bit into something hard and felt pain, it’s possible that the pain will go away if you wait momentarily. A visit to an emergency dentist may incur expensive bills. Some indications that you have an emergency dental issue include:A severe toothache that does not respond to painkillers
An abscess (an infection in the gum, usually marked by a painful, pus-filled, pimple-like swelling)
An object stuck in your mouth
A lost filling that causes intense pain
Bleeding that will not stop
Broken braces or wires
A tooth knocked out, broken, or fractured
A broken or cracked crown
If you are bleeding profusely, are in severe pain, or have a fever over 104°F (40°C), call 911 or go to the emergency room. Don’t pause to contact a dentist.;
, If you have knocked out a tooth or have an abscess or open wound, dirty hands can cause an infection. You shouldn’t handle broken teeth without washing your hands with soap and water first.Though you may be feeling panicked, it is important you take this step. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds under warm, running water.

, It’s possible that your dentist can repair broken teeth using the pieces that fell off, but you must keep them moist.


A small container of milk (preferably whole milk) will keep the tooth moist very effectively.
If you don’t have milk, you or a friend can spit into a small container. Place the tooth inside, and try to cover it with the saliva.
Water does not work well for this. It starts to break down the tooth after a short amount of time. If you have no other choice, mix a spoonful of salt into the water to make a saline solution, which is much better for storing your tooth.
If you don’t have a container, you can keep the tooth moist inside your mouth. Give the tooth a quick rinse under water, then place it next to your cheek, and be very careful not to swallow it., If a tooth fell completely out, your best chance of saving it is to get it back into your mouth quickly. This will prevent it from drying out. Make sure the end of the root is rounded and there are no sharp edges. Move fast as the blood in the socket may clot — there is a very brief amount of time in which the root surface of the tooth can be kept alive.Pick up knocked-out teeth by the tops (the parts that you chew with), not the roots.
Rinse it off using only water. Do not use chemicals or soap. It doesn’t need to be sterile, just be sure it’s not covered in dirt. If the tooth never left your mouth, you can skip this step.
Place it gently back into the socket.
Hold it in place until you get to the dentist by gently biting down on gauze or keeping your fingers on it.
If the tooth that came out is a baby tooth, do NOT try to replace it in the socket. You could damage an adult tooth that is coming in under it.

, Wear gloves if you can. Use gauze or a similar cloth if possible. As a last resort, you can apply pressure with your bare hands, but clean, dry cloth is preferable.


Apply pressure for at least 15 minutes. Resist the urge to peek.
Apply additional cloths if the blood soaks through. Do not remove the blood-soaked cloth, as this may disrupt the clotting process., This is the best place to start in a dental emergency. If you are calling during normal business hours, your dentist may be able to fit you. If you are calling after hours or on weekends, your dentist’s answering service may have a number for you to call in an emergency.

, Use a search engine and type in the name of your city and “emergency dentist.” Try searching in neighboring large cities if you don’t get many results with your own city, consider typing in the name of a neighboring large city with “emergency dentist.”


Try using something like Yelp or Google Maps. Typically, a search for “emergency dentist” and your city will yield a map of dentists in your area in the search results. Use this map to determine which ones you can get to quickly. Especially if you have lost a tooth, it is best to get to a dentist within half an hour. Sometimes a dentist can save your tooth up to an hour after you lost it, but sooner is best.If you are in too much pain to drive safely, and if you cannot get a ride from a friend or family member, you may want to prioritize calling the emergency dentists closest to you so that you can walk or take a cab.
Some dental clinics advertise their services on Facebook, so this may be another resource to locate an emergency dental office.

, If your search didn't help you come up with a good list of options, you may need to look into other possibilities. Some sites exist purely for the purpose of locating dentists. Such sites often include a number to call for an emergency dentist. Others will give you the numbers of many local dentists. Try:


1-800-Dentist: http://www.1800dentist.com/

Emergency Dental Care USA: https://www.emergencydental.com/

Emergency Dentists USA: http://www.emergencydentistsusa.com/


, Many companies continue to advertise in print media, particularly if they want to attract business from clients who do not have access to the internet.

, Before you waste your time calling every dentist that appears in the search results, click on the actual websites to confirm that they offer emergency services. Then, call the dentist closest to you. Move outward to those less conveniently located.


Unless you are in a position to pay out-of-pocket, it’s also a good idea to use the websites to determine whether the dentist you find will accept your insurance. You can usually determine this from the website. If not, you can confirm when you call.
If you reach an answering service, leave your name and number, and describe your emergency. Do not assume that leaving a message will get you an appointment. Move on to another number after you have left a message, because you never know how long it will take the answering service to get back to you.
Don’t stop calling until you have reached an actual human being and made an appointment, preferably with a dentist who will accept your insurance.

, Sometimes they offer reduced rate clinics, and in rare cases they take on patients for free. Experienced dental faculty supervise students., If you cannot find an emergency dentist, a general practitioner may at least be able to provide you with painkillers and other temporary solutions until you can make an appointment with an actual dentist.


You could also go to an urgent care center. Odds are good that if your dentist office is closed, many general practitioners are as well.

, If you have exhausted all other options, the ER may be able to help. Though they likely will not have someone who can perform extensive dental procedures, the ER can probably help manage your pain.

Try rebasing.,
Check the fit.",How to File Down Dentures2," If you just got your dentures and they are not fitting properly, your prosthodontist should work with you to get them adjusted properly. You shouldn't be experience sharp pains, at the very least. Tell your dentist where it is hurting, and ask him or her to look for small surface tags or irregularities that may need to be filed down. You should also inform your dentist if you've had any bleeding or gum pain in the first few days of wearing the dentures.

, After your dentist identifies any issues with your dentures, he or she may recommend trimming them down. He or she will likely use a trimmers or trimming bur to adjust your dentures.Low-speed hand-pieces generate less heat and, therefore, won’t harm your dentures. And your dentist will have a variety of acrylic trimmers available, with varying degrees of roughness, so he or she will be able to customize the repair.

, After trimming, your dentist can polish the dentures (except for the tissue surface, which would alter the fit). Polishing will make your dentures smoother and shinier., After you wear dentures for a period of time, they wear down your jaw bone, which means they won't fit as well. Most of the time, your dentist can reline them to fit better again. Sometimes, you may need new dentures.Relining just means that your dentist adds material to the dentures to make them fit better.
You can have soft lining or hard lining put in. The soft lining will only last a few months, but it can be good if you have trouble with harder dentures. It can be reapplied. Hard linings are made of resin and are meant to last longer.

, Another, less common, procedure is rebasing. Basically, your dentist makes a new base for your dentures. The downside to this process is your dentist must keep your dentures for a few days. However, they should fit better when they come back to you.

, Once the dentures have been examined, trimmed, and polished, your dentist will evaluate the fit. First and foremost, let your dentist know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Then he or she will check for a variety of issues, including the extension of the flanges, the lip support, proper height, and your dentures affect your pronunciation

An abscess occurs when the infection spreads all the way past the ends of the roots of the tooth, affecting the bone. In addition to an abscess, an infection in the root canal of a tooth can cause:


Facial swelling
Swelling of the head or neck
Bone loss at the tooth root
Drainage problems
Damage to the jawbone which could require extensive surgery.
Oral bacterial infections have been linked to more serious medical conditions such as heart disease, such as endocarditis.;
, This includes the following steps:After an x-ray reveals the shape of the root canals to determine if there are any signs of infection in the surrounding bone, you will be fitted with a rubber dam (a sheet of rubber) around the tooth. This keeps the area dry and free of saliva during treatment, preventing bacteria from reaching the area.
Your dentist or dental surgeon will drill an access hole into the tooth. They will then remove the pulp, bacteria, debris, and any decayed or remaining nerve tissue using a root canal file. They will periodically use water or sodium hypochlorite to flush away the debris and disinfect the roots.
After the cleaning process is complete, your dentist will apply a sealant. If there is an infection, your dentist may wait up to a week, sometimes two, to apply the sealant. If you do not have the root canal on the same day, the dentist will place a temporary filling in the hole to protect it from contamination until your root canal.
At the root canal appointment, your dentist or dental surgeon will seal the interior of the tooth with a sealer paste and fill the tooth’s root canal with a rubber compound called Gutta-percha. They will also place a filling in the tooth to seal the hole that has been made by the decay. This prevents the future infiltration of bacteria. The filling is the most important aspect of a long-lasting root canal treatment.

, An antibiotic will most likely be prescribed to either treat the previous infection or prevent a new one.

, A tooth that has had a root canal is no longer living and its enamel will become brittle. Because of this, your dentist will protect it with a crown, crown and post, or other type of dental restoration.

, If you are in the dentist’s chair for another procedure and they recommend you get a root canal and that you can or should do it right then — don’t. Never make a decision under duress unless absolutely necessary. Tell your dentist you’d like to discuss it either after your current appointment or at a later date after you’ve had time to think about and research the procedure.There may be some cases when there is no other solution, especially if you have been in pain for several days, and you will not want to postpone treatment.

, Once you’ve had time to think and do research, nothing can give you more peace of mind during and after a root canal than knowing exactly how your dentist views the procedure and what they plan on doing. Have your questions ready and have them answered before you’re sitting in the dentist’s chair. Questions can include a wide variety of topics, such as:Is the procedure absolutely necessary?
Can the tooth recover without a root canal procedure?
Should you (the dentist) do this procedure, or should I have a specialist do it?
How many appointments will I need to make?
Will I be able to return to work that day? The next day?
How much will it cost?
What will happen if I don’t get a root canal? Will the infection spread? Will my tooth break?
How urgent is my situation? Can it wait a month? Does it need to be done immediately?
Are there alternate methods currently available to fix/heal my tooth?
What happens if the bacteria is not 100% removed before the tooth is sealed?

, If the pain scares you, be honest and upfront about it. Their office and assistants can make the experience as positive and comforting as possible

, It’s possible that your anxiety at the thought of going to the dentist can be more severe than just being uncomfortable or nervousness. If you suffer from a more acute anxiety, there are four types of sedation used by dentists today to help ease or eliminate that condition. In three cases, these methods also require a local anesthetic to provide pain relief during the procedure. The types of sedation are:


Oral sedatives. These can be taken anywhere from the night before the procedure to 30 – 60 minutes prior. These are to relieve anxiety prior to an injection of local anesthetic to alleviate pain.
Intravenous (IV) sedation. These relieve anxiety in the same way as an oral sedative. An injection of local anesthetic before the procedure is required to alleviate pain.
Nitrous oxide sedation. This gas (aka laughing gas) is a conscious inhalation sedation that produces a state of relaxation. An injection of local anesthetic is given simultaneously for pain elimination.
General anesthesia. This is the use of an anesthetic to produce unconsciousness. There is no need for a local anesthetic as the patient is unconscious.

, During the procedure you shouldn’t feel any pain. If you feel even an inkling, even a twinge, let your dentist know and they will adjust the local anesthetic to put that pain to rest immediately. Modern dentistry has eliminated almost all pain from the equation altogether.


You may feel a short impulse when the file passes through the end of the root in the bone. That's the sign that the entire root canal was cleaned and your dentist can calculate exactly the length of the root.

, You will have your mouth open for several hours so you’ll need to occupy your mind during that time. If you’re good at meditating already you will also get the added benefit of not really feeling anything that’s happening.Try guided imagery meditation. Picturing yourself in a peaceful setting is a great form of meditating for the dentist’s chair. Imagine a quiet and motionless place, such as a deserted beach or mountaintop. Fill in all of the details: the sights, sounds, and smells. Soon enough, this peaceful image will replace the world around you and leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed.

Deep breathing exercises are another great way to meditate and take your mind off of your current location/situation.
Some dentists also use hypnosis as a form of patient relaxation, though this does not work for everyone.

, Listening to music is a great way to take your mind off of the procedure. Your favorite tunes on a playlist will keep your attention occupied.An audio book of a favorite author can pass the time in a hurry. You can also choose to learn about a subject you’ve always wanted to investigate but have never gotten around to. You have a few hours; you might as well make the most of it.
Listening to your favorite podcasts is another great way to keep your mind occupied.

, The local anesthetic — assuming you do not opt for general anesthesia — will be potent. It will keep the area numb not only during the procedure but also for many hours afterward. Be cautious about chewing because you could actually bite your own tongue or cheek and not even know it.


Local anesthetics can affect each of us differently. Be aware of your physical condition before you decide to operate a vehicle or take an important business meeting.
Make sure you also eat something before you arrive at the dental office, as local anesthesia might case nausea if your stomach is empty.

, Your tooth may be sore for two to three days after the procedure, but it’s also normal to have no soreness at all. Your tooth is likely to be more painful if you had a significant infection or inflammation prior to the root canal.

, There might be some pain but it should not be severe, particularly after 24-hours. If you have lingering pain of any severity you should immediately contact your dentist or endodontist as this could be a sign of a bigger post-operative issue.

, You can take over-the-counter pain relievers or anti-inflammatories to ease the discomfort.

, A root canal, just like any other medical procedure, has red flags that can put a halt to the proceedings. Your dentist may find during the procedure that it is either unwise or unsafe to continue with your root canal. The reasons may vary, but they more than likely will be among the following:One of the dental instruments breaks off in your tooth.
Your root canal is calcified. This is a “natural root canal”, your body’s way of performing the procedure on its own.
A fractured tooth. This makes it impossible to complete the procedure because the fracture will compromise the integrity of the tooth even after your root canal is finished.
If the root of your tooth is curved it could be impossible to guarantee being able to clean all the way to the tip of the root. Since the entire canal must be cleaned, this is an untenable situation and the procedure needs to be halted.
Should this happen, discuss what your options are moving forward and, as before, take a day or two to research and consider the alternatives before speaking with your dentist or endodontist about the next step.

Chew on both sides of your mouth.,
Avoid chewing with your front teeth.,
Break your dentures in with a liquid diet.,
Transition to a soft diet.,
Use denture adhesive.,
Cut tough foods into smaller pieces.,
Steam your vegetables.,
Abstain from solid hard foods.,
Avoid sticky foods.,
Don't eat foods with small particles.",How to Eat with Dentures," The food should be in the back sides of your mouth or in the front corners. Chew slowly on both sides at the same time. This way, your dentures will more likely stay in place and will even out the chewing pressure in your mouth., If you try to bite food with your front teeth, you run a high risk of displacing your dentures. Instead, bite the food using the side teeth and use your tongue to bring food to the back of your mouth. Chew thoroughly and slowly before you swallow., For people who have never worn dentures before, it may be very difficult to eat any sort of solid food. Drink nutrient-dense liquids like juiced fruits and vegetables or milk (animal- or plant-based). Then, work your way up to puréed fruits and vegetables, such as applesauce or compote.Other good choices include:


Tea or coffee sweetened with honey
Soups, broths, or bisques without chunks of other foods

, These foods are easy to chew and swallow. Cut or mash your food before eating, if necessary.In addition to the foods you could eat on your liquid diet, you can also eat:


Soft cheese, eggs, mashed potatoes, ground meat, cooked legumes
Soft fruits, boiled rice, and pasta
Breads and cereals softened with milk or water

, Adhesive protects against food particles getting stuck between your dentures and gums. Make sure your denture is clean and dry. Then, squeeze the adhesive in short strips on the side facing your mouth. Avoid getting the adhesive too close to the edges to prevent it from oozing. Start with a small amount and gradually add more if you need it.This might be especially necessary for your lower denture, which your tongue could loosen. Ask your dentist for specific recommendations based on your diet., Slice your apple or raw carrot into manageable pieces instead of biting into the whole thing. Remove corn from the cob with a sharp knife. Tear the crust away from your pizza or garlic bread. When you learn to eat most foods differently, you don't have to give them up., This will maintain their flavor while giving them a softer, yet somewhat crispy, texture. Pour about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water into a large pot. Place it on a burner set to high and let it come to a rolling boil. Place a steaming basket into the pot above the water and add your fresh vegetables. Cover the pot and allow the veggies to soften for about 10 minutes., Dentures can easily break if you put excessive pressure on them. Stay away from foods that require added force to chew them properly. Some of these foods include croutons, crispy granola bars, and nuts.You could substitute nuts with pitted olives, which are also a good source of healthy fats., They can get trapped and stick in between your dentures and gums. Sticky foods can also dislodge your dentures and cause pain and discomfort. Steer clear of chewing gum, taffy, chocolate, caramel, and peanut butter.Hummus is a good alternative to peanut butter. It's spreadable and provides protein without the sticky texture., Fruits with seeds could easily get caught between your dentures and gums. Avoid strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and seeded grapes. You should also stay away from baked goods with seeds on the crust. This includes poppy seed muffins, sesame seed buns, and kaiser rolls.


Substitute seedy fruits with blueberries and seedless grapes. If you must have seedy baked goods, opt for breads, buns, muffins, etc. with baked-in seeds or grains that have been ground."

Use a peroxide rinse.,
Apply one type of vegetable.,
Chew mint leaves.",How to Ease a Toothache1," One of the first things you want to do is make sure that your mouth is clean and that there isn't bits of food bothering the painful spot. Water that is too cold or too hot can hurt your mouth, so definitely go for lukewarm to warm water.Floss gently between your teeth. Flossing gets rid of the food and bacteria still lingering in your mouth, and increases the gum protection against harmful species that can insert in the gum sulcus. Avoid flossing too roughly around the affected area because this could cause it to hurt more and to bleed.;
, Sometimes the best way to deal with the pain is to mask it with pain medication until you can see a dentist. Most over the counter medication will work fine for your toothache and if it's so severe that the medication doesn't work, you should see someone right away.









Aspirin is especially helpful for problems in the joint of the jaw in adults.
Acetaminophen (not aspirin) should be used for children and teenagers.

, This can help to ease the toothache by numbing the pain. Using this in conjunction with over the counter medication can help ease your pain until the painkiller can kick in.








, Saltwater can kill bacteria and make your toothache feel better. It can also ease it so that it doesn't get infected. Mix 1 tsp (5 g) of salt in a medium-sized glass of warm water.








Swirl it around in your mouth for a maximum of five minutes and spit it out. Make sure that you don't swallow!

, Soak a cotton ball in a mixture of a few drops of garlic clove oil and a small amount of olive oil, and apply the cotton ball to the area of pain.







, The natural tannins already in the tea can help to numb the pain. This is particularly good for the swelling or irritation of your gums. Make sure that the teabag isn't too hot otherwise you'll simply hurt the area more.









Constant exposure can stain teeth so use sparingly.

, As with salt water, a peroxide rinse helps remove contaminants and limits the growth of bacteria. It's particularly good for impacted teeth or infections in your mouth and you can use it periodically throughout the day until you can see an emergency dentist.









This should not replace your regular brushing and flossing.
Do not sue a peroxide rinse more than three times in a day for more than five days in a row, otherwise your teeth may get very sensitive.

, There are several types of vegetables that you can cut up and place on the injured area. These can help ease the pain and the chance of infection, but they shouldn't replace actually visiting the dentist if your pain persists.








Place a slice of cool cucumber over the sore area.
Cut up a piece of raw, fresh potato and hold in place on the sore spot in your mouth. Make sure that you've peeled it too.
Hold a slice of freshly cut onion inside your mouth against the injured area. It needs to be freshly cut so that there's a bit of juice.

, You can either chew on fresh mint leaves, or hold some dry mint leaves in place over the sore area. If your tooth hurts too much to chew, then you should place some mashed or dry mint leaves over the infected area.

Floss to remove food particles and plaque.,
Dab clove oil onto the affected tooth.,
Use a cold compress.,
Try using a damp tea bag.,
Ease your toothache with turmeric.,
Know what to avoid.",How to Ease a Toothache Naturally1," The first thing you can do at home to ease the pain of a toothache is to rinse out your mouth salt water. One of the most common causes of tooth ache is infection, and salt can work as a cleaning agent that tackles the infection. Salt can draw fluids from the site of the infection, relieving tension in the soft tissues and reducing pain.To prepare the salt solution, take a glass full of warm water and add one teaspoon of common table salt, or sea salt. Mix thoroughly to completely dissolve the salt.
Make sure the water is warm and not hot, as you don't want it to burn your mouth.
Rinse with the warm saline solution by taking a mouthful and swishing the water all around the mouth, and specifically near the sore tooth. Do this for a minimum of 30 seconds before spitting the solution out - do not swallow.
Repeat this every hour and you may ease your toothache.If you don't have salt, just washing your mouth out with warm water will help.;
, After you have washed out your mouth you should continue to clean it by carefully removing any plaque or bits of food them are lodged between your teeth. Using dental floss, carefully clean around and between your teeth. Be careful not to irritate a sensitive tooth, but it's important to remove anything that might exacerbate the infection., Clove oil is an old remedy for toothache, as it has antibacterial and pain-relieving properties. It can reduce inflammation and also works as an antioxidant. It can help you to numb the area around your tooth that is causing you discomfort and ease the pain.Dab a couple of drops of clove oil onto a cotton ball and gently rub onto the aching tooth. You should feel the pain starting to subside. Repeat this treatment three times a day for best results.Although safe in small amounts, heavy use of clove oil can cause health problems so be sure to follow the instructions on the packet.You can buy clove oil in a pharmacy or health food store, but if you wish to make your own, just crush two cloves and mix them with olive oil.

, If the pain you are experiencing was caused by a trauma to the tooth, use a cold compress to ease the pain. Wrap an ice cube in a clean cloth or tissue and apply it directly to the outside of your cheek adjacent to the sore tooth for about 10 minutes.The cold provides a numbing sensation, which helps to relieve pain. Instead of an ice cube, you could also you an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables.
Never apply the ice cube directly onto the gum, as this could damage the delicate tissue.

, Place a damp tea bag over the affected tooth. A damp tea bag is a very simple remedy which is easily available in every household. This will not treat the infection or the cause of your toothache but it can reportedly help ease some of the symptoms. Simply moisten a tea bag in a cup of warm (not hot) water, squeeze out the excess water and place it on the sore tooth for about 15 minutes.


The tea bag contains tannins which have strong astringent properties and can provide temporary pain relief.
Eucalyptus or peppermint could be especially effective.Doing this regularly risks staining your teeth and gums., Turmeric is not only a fragrant spice used in the kitchen, there is some evidence that it has medicinal uses. Turmeric contains curcumin, an active ingredient that is responsible in lowering the histamine level, which in turn can help to reduce pain.In eight ounces of boiling water, dissolve five grams of turmeric, two cloves of garlic and two dried guava leaves. Boil the mixture for 5 minutes.
Pass the mixture through a sieve to strain it. Let it cool, then rinse your mouth with the turmeric solution for one minute to relieve pain.
Alternatively, take two tbsp. of ground turmeric and roast on a pan. Let it cool, then apply the roasted turmeric gently onto the aching tooth using a clean q-tip., As well as trying to relieve your pain from a toothache, you should also take care to avoid certain things which are likely to irritate your tooth and cause you greater pain. This will vary from person to person and you will have to judge what causes you discomfort and try to avoid it. Most typically, very hot or very cold food and drinks will be painful for someone with a toothache."

This examination will help your dentist determine the best course of action., Some dentists recommend extracting them even if they do not cause problematic symptoms.,, During a consultation with your dentist, they can explain what the procedure will entail, how it will help you, any potential risks or complications, and how to recover from the surgery. This will also be an opportunity for you to ask any questions you may have.The procedure can be performed at a dental surgeon’s office. It should take about 30 – 60 minutes, and you will be allowed to go home the same day.
You will be given local anesthesia and perhaps sedatives for the procedure. Gum and connective tissues attached to the tooth will be removed, and the tooth will be carefully extracted. Finally, the opening left by the tooth will be closed with stitches., Your dentist will provide you with specific instructions for recovering from your surgery. You should be prepared for a few things:There may be slight bleeding during the first day after the extraction of your wisdom teeth. Your dentist will give you guidance on stopping the bleeding.
Some swelling and soreness in your jaw is to be expected for a few days following the extraction. In some cases even small bruises may appear on the cheek if the surgery was complicated. Your dentist will inform you of pain medications to take that will give you relief.

Close your mouth normally.,
Look in a mirror and smile.,
Diagnose the type of overbite.,
Have your teeth checked by a dentist.",How to Diagnose an Overbite1," Place your teeth together naturally making sure your jaw remains relaxed without forcing your teeth together. This helps your teeth to position naturally and you can identify if your teeth overlap at the bottom.


Do not force your teeth together as this may produce exaggerated results.;
, In order to self-diagnose an overbite, you need a mirror to help you visualize your teeth. While standing in front of a mirror, smile and reveal your teeth.


Position yourself as close to the mirror as possible and smile so that you spread your lips away from the teeth.
Check to see if your upper teeth fall over the top of your bottom front teeth.
If your teeth noticeably overlap the bottom (more than 3.5 mm), your bite alignment is off and you have an overbite.You may also feel your lower row of teeth biting close to or into the roof of your mouth.

, When your teeth are not properly aligned you suffer from a condition called malocclusion. There are two categories of malocclusion classified as overbite and one classified as underbite.Class 1 is the most common class. If you have a class 1 overbite, your bite is normal; however, the upper teeth overlap the bottom teeth.
Class 2 is when the upper jaw and the teeth significantly overlap the bottom jaw and teeth. When viewed from the side, the chin is behind the normal position.
Class 3 malocclusion (also called underbite or prognathism) is when the lower jaw protrudes so that the teeth overlap the upper jaw and teeth.

, If the home test indicated that you may have an overbite, it is best to have it checked by a dentist who can do it during a routine exam.


If left untreated, an overbite can have some health consequences such as headache, tooth decay, speech difficulties, mouth breathing, and difficulty chewing.It can also lead to TMJ disorders which can influence your posture.

Clean your teeth regularly.,
Prevent tooth decay with fluoride.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Get your teeth checked twice a year by a dentist.",How to Ease a Toothache2," This is really the most important step to keeping your teeth healthy and pain-free. If you don't clean your teeth every day, and floss, the plaque and bacteria will build up and cause problems like cavities and infections.








The saying goes ""only floss the teeth you want to keep."" Flossing really does work to keep your teeth healthy and free of bacteria-causing factors. Make sure that you floss at least once a day.
Brush at least twice a day, 30 minutes before or after meals. Too soon before or after a meal and you can damage the enamel on your teeth as you will brush with the acids formed immediately after the meal, which will cause abrasion of the enamel.

, You can find fluoride in lots of natural things, like water sources or certain vegetables. Check and see if your tap water is fluoridated. If not, talk to your dentist about options for getting more fluoride.









Since a high concentration of fluoride can be toxic, the best way to use fluoride is to apply fluoride gels on your teeth for three minutes and then rinse with water.
Most toothpaste has fluoride as the active ingredient, but check to make sure that you're getting the right toothpaste.

, What you eat makes a huge difference in how healthy your teeth are. Not only that, but certain foods are harder to get off of or out of the areas between your teeth. Pay attention to what you eat so that your teeth will be happier.









Avoid sugars and starches as much as possible. These two substances feed bacteria, especially sugar.
If you're going to eat food that gets stuck between your teeth make sure that you have floss or a toothpick on hand.
End your meals with a salad or an apple because these can act as a natural toothbrush.

, This is actually really important and a lot of people skip out on getting checked over. A dentist will catch early cavities and problems with your teeth so they don't develop into bigger issues.

See the doctor if you have extreme pain.,
Go in if you have pain after a tooth is pulled.,
Seek medical attention if broken teeth accompany the pain.",How to Ease a Toothache3," When the over the counter medication doesn't eliminate your pain (or even if it does) you should definitely see your dentist or doctor, because this could be an emergency.








This is especially true if you have extreme pain and swelling.
Fever along with submandibular lymph nodes swelling is an important sign of infection in dental disease. Basic tooth decay doesn't cause a fever.

, If it's on the second or third day after you get a tooth pulled then you need to see a dentist within 24 hours. This is called ""dry socket syndrome"" and happens sometimes when the tooth socket is being exposed to the air causing an intense pain that is hard to calm down even with medication.








, This could be due to a traumatic injury, in which case you should be seeking medical help as quickly as possible. Things like swallowed teeth and permanent tooth loss are considered dental emergencies

Be cautious with natural remedies.,
Make an appointment with your dentist.,
Understand the cause of toothaches.",How to Ease a Toothache Naturally2," Natural can help you to ease the pain of a toothache and lower your discomfort, but if you are experience persistent toothaches you need to tackle the root of the problem. This will most likely require visiting your dentist. There is a lack of conclusive evidence to support the genuine effectiveness of herbal remedies in dentistry.If you opt for a herbal remedy, discontinue once you feel it is ineffective. Do not continue to apply the remedy to the aching tooth thinking that increasing the dose could make it better. Increasing the dose might even make your worse toothache.
Immediately rinse your mouth with water if you feel a burning or stinging sensation following the use of herbal medicine. Do not use mouth wash because its alcohol content can further irritate the delicate tissues inside your mouth.
Remember that toothache from an infection won't go away until the infection is gone., If you experience toothache that persists for more than one or two days you should make an appointment to see your dentist as soon as possible. Natural remedies may help you to relieve the pain in the short-term, but they will not cure your underlying condition. An untreated toothache could lead to a dental abscess.Painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are likely to be more effective than the natural remedies at easing the pain of your toothache.
Be sure never to place a painkiller directly against your gum as it may damage your gum tissue., If you are experiencing toothache you need to understand why to take steps to prevent aches recurring after treatment. Toothache occurs when the central section of the tooth, known as the pulp, becomes inflamed. The nerve endings in this central section are highly sensitive to pain, which can make toothache incredibly uncomfortable. The inflammation is general caused either by cavities, infection, or trauma.The key to avoiding toothache is maintaining excellent dental hygiene. Keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy by limiting your intake of sugary food and drink, brushing your teeth twice a day, with floss or mouthwash as an extra measure.The next time you feel toothache, it is most likely that you have a cavity or infection. Keep in mind that although you may be able to block the sensation of pain using natural remedies, you will not be able to get rid of the cavity itself.

Go to a dentist.,
Get a dental exam.,
Say yes for an x-ray.,
Consult an orthodontist.",How to Diagnose an Overbite2," Having regular visits to a dentist can correct any teeth problems and is highly recommended at least twice a year. If you experience discomfort or pain associated with the overbite, your dentist can provide the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.


It is estimated that overbite affects up to 46% of children and nearly 30% of children would benefit from treatment. Thus, early diagnosis is essential for the treatment of overbite and to prevent any complications., A typical dental exam or checkup will be done by a dental hygienist followed by a consultation with the dentist.During the checkup, the overall condition of your teeth will be noted and the dentist will take a look at your teeth to assess if you have an overbite.

, Your dentist can usually diagnose overbite by just looking at your bite; however, they may also take dental x-rays to visualize your jaw and teeth. This is especially important in children if their permanent teeth have not yet erupted.Dental x-rays help your dentist to diagnose how your child's permanent teeth are positioned and/or see any damage or dental diseases.If the dentist sees any problems in your x-rays, including cavities or decays, treatment options will be discussed.

, If your dentist will confirm that you have an overbite, they will refer you to an orthodontist. An orthodontist is an expert at correcting and realigning the teeth.


Orthodontists have two to three years more education compared with dentists and are trained to treat overbite and other conditions due to misaligned teeth.During your consultation, treatment options to correct the bite will be discussed.
Treating an overbite is essential for your health as it can decrease your chances of tooth decay or gingivitis, and help lessen the strain malocclusion has on the teeth, jaws, and muscles."
"
Get braces.,
Ask about aligners.,
Ask if you need teeth removal.,
Inquire about teeth repair.,
Ask about surgery.",How to Diagnose an Overbite3," Braces are one of the most common ways to treat overbite in childhood. Braces help with the realignment of teeth by applying pressure and directing the teeth to move in a certain direction.Braces consist of metal brackets and arch wires that are attached to your teeth. Tiny elastic bands will then be used to hold the archwire to the brackets.
It should be noted that teeth will usually be sore once braces are applied. The wire, bands, and brackets may also irritate the tongue, cheeks or lips. Discomfort can last for up to two weeks., Another option in correcting overbite is getting aligners. They function just like a retainer and fit tightly over the teeth.Aligners are invisible, acrylic molds that are preferred by some as they can be removed for eating and brushing.
Since aligners are custom made they are more recommended for teens and adults instead of children.

, If your overbite is caused by overcrowding, tooth extraction may be needed to solve the problem.When a tooth is extracted it is removed from its socket inside the bone. The dentist will take x-rays to isolate which teeth need to be extracted and may administer antibiotics or anesthesia depending on the type of procedure.
There are two types of dental extractions:

During a simple extraction, the dentist will loosen the tooth with an elevator instrument. Once loose, forceps will be used to remove the tooth.During a surgical extraction, the dentist will make a small cut into the gum and the tooth, or the bone around the tooth may be cut to make the extraction easier. This type of extraction is commonly done under anesthesia., When you have an overbite, the misalignment can cause strain on your jaw and muscles, leaving your body to respond by grinding the teeth into a more comfortable position.However, this grinding can cause teeth to wear and chip. Your dentist can help solve this problem by capping the teeth or providing a nighttime mouth guard.
Another option is a TENS machine made specifically to stop teeth grinding. To use this method, you attach an electrode to your jaw. When it senses tension in your jaw due to grinding or clenching, it will deliver an impulse to relax the muscle and stop the behavior.

, Oral surgery is a treatment solution used when orthodontic treatment, such as braces or aligners, do not correct the overbite.


Horizontal maxillary protrusion is the type of surgery done to fix an overbite. During the operation, the jaw is moved and the overbite is corrected.

Know where your new teeth are growing.,
Brush your teeth regularly.,
Take anti-inflammation pain medications.",How to Ease Wisdom Tooth Pain1," Try to be aware of sore locations when you’re going about your daily routines. Be extra careful about brushing and biting on the side where the tooth is growing because you may cause inflammation or even an infection. If multiple wisdom teeth are growing in on both the left and right sides of your mouth, try to identify which spots are the most sensitive, and be gentle with them.Don’t poke and prod with your tongue, as this will aggravate your sensitive and swollen gums, and could lead to infection.;
, It’s important to prevent decay or infection, especially as your wisdom teeth begin to develop. Since your gums may be sensitive or swollen, you might feel the urge to shy away from brushing, but you must keep up with your hygiene routine. New nooks and crannies form with swollen gums and emerging wisdom teeth, and these introduce areas for bacteria to grow. Tooth decay, cavities, and periodontal disease (or gum infection) will only make your pain that much more intolerable and your entire mouth can get sore.
If you don’t keep up with your dental hygiene, your hard-to-reach wisdom teeth might become infected or develop cavities as soon as they fully emerge, which greatly increases the need for their removal. Since they are the last teeth to appear, the enamel is less mineralized. If you have poor oral hygiene, then cavities can easily form and do a lot of harm.

, Ibuprofen and similar over the counter medications are effective for wisdom tooth pain, especially in its initial phases. Always use any medication as directed, and never take more than the directed dosage. Ibuprofen, while effective, also can cause bleeding, so make sure you check in with your doctor or dentist about regular use."

Stretch your jaw.,
Touch your upper and lower teeth together.,
Run your tongue back towards your throat.,
Slowly open your mouth.,
Repeat for a full five minutes.,
Rest your jaw.",How to Do Exercises for Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD) Treatment1," This exercise is recommended by Oxford University Hospitals, to be done for five minutes twice a day when you are most relaxed., Keep your mouth closed, and be sure your teeth are not clenched together. Keep your tongue touching your gums and the roof of your mouth, just behind the front teeth., Push the tongue as far back as you can comfortably stretch it, while keeping your teeth touching together., Keep your tongue pressed against the back roof of your mouth. Stop just shy of the point at which your tongue will be pulled away., Continue this exercise twice daily., Resting your jaw is an important component of dealing with TMD, especially after stretching. Help keep your jaw relaxed by keeping your lips closed, your teeth apart, and resting your tongue on the roof of your mouth rather than between your teeth.Try to avoid strenuous activities such as opening the mouth fully, clenching or grinding your teeth, holding things with your teeth, or cradling your phone between your shoulder and your jaw.

"
"
Use topical anesthetics.,
Use mouth rinses.,
Try clove oil or whole cloves.,
Use ice.,
See a dentist.",How to Ease Wisdom Tooth Pain2," Topical ointments like Oragel, Cepacol, and other products that contain benzocaine are great for numbing pain for a short amount of time. Press a dry cloth onto the affected area, then apply a numbing topical anesthetic. The dry cloth will help ensure the ointment gets absorbed efficiently without getting washed away by saliva. While it’s only a temporary fix, it’ll provide fast comfort for acute pain.Keep in mind that topical anesthetics will not last for more than an hour or so because the saliva washes the substance away.

, Mix one cup of warm water with one teaspoon of salt until the salt as dissolved. Gently swish the rinse around your mouth, then spit. While it’s not too helpful for deeper jaw pain associated with impacted teeth, it’ll alleviate surface swelling and damaged oral tissue that results when wisdom teeth erupt, or break through the gum surface., Cloves are a home remedy that might be able to help tooth pain. Use a cotton swab or ball to apply clove oil to the affected area, and you should experience a gentle, warm, numbing sensation. Try placing a whole clove onto the affected area if you have them handy and as long as the clove’s shape doesn’t cause any discomfort., If the tooth is not sensitive to cold, then you can also try placing a gauze wrapped ice cube on the area of your wisdom tooth that hurts. Leave it on for about 5 to 10 minutes to numb the area and then remove it for a while. Repeat as needed.

, It’s important to visit a dentist to see if the tooth is infected, is coming in on a bad angle, doesn’t have enough room to grow in, is pushing other teeth out of the way, or is causing any damage to your jaw or other parts of your mouth. If any of these apply, it’s possible that you’ll need to have your tooth or teeth extracted.It is also possible that a simple removal of the covering gum will make the pain go away as soon as the next day.

"
"
Get plenty of rest after extraction.,
Use pain medications as recommended.,
Apply ice packs.,
Control bleeding.,
Eat soft, lukewarm foods.",How to Ease Wisdom Tooth Pain3," Curl up and get some sleep immediately following your surgery, and get lots of rest for the next one to two days, depending on your dentist or oral surgeon’s orders. Avoid strenuous activity for at least a week.If you experience persistent bleeding the day of surgery, keep your head and upper body elevated with several pillows while you’re resting in order to prevent choking.

, If your oral surgeon prescribed or recommended medication, use it as directed. If you were not prescribed medication, you can use ibuprofen or another over-the-counter pain medication. Call your surgeon if you experience severe pain and consult with them about another medication option or dosage.

, Apply ice to manage pain, swelling, and bruising. Swelling will reach its peak within 2-3 days of surgery, but regularly using ice packs immediately after extraction can help keep it at a minimum. Apply a zip-lock bag of ice or ice pack to your face where surgery occurred. Keep the ice on for 20 minutes, then take it off for 20 minutes., Oozing bleeding from the surgical site is one of the most uncomfortable parts of wisdom tooth removal. Keep gauze in to protect the surgical site and change it out regularly. Firmly bite the gauze to help control bleeding, but don’t bite so hard that it causes any pain. Keep some sterile gauze on your tooth by biting on it over the extraction site.
If bleeding persists, try biting down on a moistened, cool tea bag: tannic acid in the tea will help to clot blood.
Avoid excessive or forceful spitting or coughing, as this will dislodge blood clots.
Give your dentist or oral surgeon a call if bleeding persists for more than a day.

, Go for creamy soups, smooth yogurts, custard, smoothies, milkshakes, and other nutrient-rich choices that are easy to drink. Avoid foods and beverages that are too hot or too cold. Also stay away from smoothies or purées that contain strawberries or other fruits with small seeds. These can get stuck in wound sockets.

Practice jaw pulls.,
Practice resisted mouth opening.,
Practice resisted mouth closing.,
Move your jaw side to side.,
Practice forward jaw movement.",How to Do Exercises for Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD) Treatment2," This simple exercise can be done any time of day, though participants in one study found it helpful to do one set of jaw pulls (three cycles of stretching per set) after each meal and once while bathing, for a total of four sets daily.Position fingertips on the edge of the front teeth on your lower jaw.Pull the jaw down slowly, until pain is felt on the side of your jaw affected by TMD.Hold that extended position for 30 seconds.Do three cycles of stretching to complete one set of stretches. Aim to do four sets each day., This is a fairly simple exercise, and can be done any time of day.


Position your thumb under your chin.Slowly open your mouth. Continue pushing upward with your thumb to apply resistance.Hold the position for three to six seconds before slowly closing your mouth.Repeat daily to help prevent pain from returning., This is similar to resisted mouth opening, but works the opposite muscles.


Position both thumbs under the chin and both index fingers below your lips, just above the chin. It should look and feel like you are pinching your chin with both hands.Gently push your jaw down for resistance while you try to close your mouth.Repeat daily.

, This is a fairly simple routine that can be modified for increased resistance as you build your jaw strength back up.


Place two tongue depressors or popsicle sticks between your front teeth.Move your jaw slowly from side to side.Gradually increase the thickness by adding additional tongue depressors, once the exercise as gotten comfortable., This exercise is similar to the side-to-side routine, and can also be modified for increased resistance as you strengthen your jaw.


Place two tongue depressors or popsicle sticks between your front teeth.Move the bottom jaw forward, so that your bottom row of teeth are positioned in front of your top row of teeth.Gradually increase the thickness by adding additional tongue depressors as the exercise becomes comfortable."

Understand the symptoms.,
Getting a diagnosis.,
Treat TMD symptoms.,
Wear a bite guard.",How to Do Exercises for Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD) Treatment3," TMD typically involve pain in the temporomandibular joint, located at the intersection of the upper and lower jaws. Other symptoms include:


Radiating pain in the face, as well as through the jaw and neck lineStiffness in the jaw musclesReduced or limited movement in the jawPopping or grating in the jaw, usually accompanied by painA misalignment between the upper and lower rows of teeth, Only a professional medical expert can determine whether you have a TMD. Though there is not a clear-cut ""test"" to arrive at or rule out TMD, a doctor will generally evaluate the symptoms you are experiencing, and may order an X-ray to further examine the temporomandibular joint.Though it may take time to arrive at a diagnosis of a TMD, your doctor may first need to rule out other causes of jaw and face pain, including sinus infections, ear infections and neuralgia, which causes pain in the face due to nerve inflammation., Once your doctor has diagnosed you with TMD, he will probably recommend a course of action. There are a number of options available, and what your doctor recommends will probably depend on your symptoms as well as your personal medical history.


Pain relievers, both over-the-counter and prescription-strength, may be recommended to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.Muscle relaxants may be recommended by your doctor over a short period of time (ranging from a few days to several weeks) to help alleviate pain and reduce muscle tension in the jaw.Sedatives may be prescribed to aid in sleeping at night, especially if TMJ pain flares up during sleep.Corticosteroid injections may be recommended to help ease pain and reduce inflammation., Wearing a bite guard can help reduce pain and may make it easier to live with pain."

Notice any shaking or twitching.When you think of Parkinson’s disease, the first thing to come to mind may be tremors.,
Look for the onset of muscle rigidity.After tremors, rigidity is the most well-known symptom of Parkinson’s disease.,
Track bowel movements.,
Be aware of the signs of micrographia.,
Make note of vocal changes.,
Be vigilant for signs of hyposmia.,
Take note of changes to normal sleep patterns.,
Do not disregard dizziness or fainting spells.,
Keep in mind that none of these symptoms alone indicates Parkinson’s.Each of the symptoms described in this section could either be due to normal stress on the body, or a different underlying medical condition.,
Understand the genetic causes and risks of Parkinson’s disease.,
Approach your general practitioner with your concerns.Parkinson’s disease can be difficult to diagnose, especially in its early stages.,
Complete the doctor’s evaluation exercises.,
Follow up with a neurological specialist.,
Ask about taking carbidopa-levodopa.Carbidopa-levodopa is a medication that treats the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Recognize the Signs of Parkinson's Disease," These can occur anywhere on the body: a shaking finger or leg, a twitching eye, a trembling lip or chin, etc. Note that some shaking and twitching can be perfectly normal — for example, after strenuous exercise or after an injury. Some medications can also cause tremors, so ask your doctor about the medications you are currently taking.;
, Take note if your muscles feel stiff, even if you haven’t over-exerted them recently. You might also see a decrease in flexibility or an increase in muscle pain or cramps.


Muscle rigidity in the face sometimes causes people with Parkinson’s to develop a “mask”-like, blank expression.The Parkinson’s mask is characterized by staring with little blinking, little or no smiling, and the general suggestion that the person is angry, even if he or she feels just fine.
You may also notice the development of slouched posture due to rigidity. This might mean the person hunches forward, or they may bend over to one side more than the other., When you think of the loss of muscle control that comes with Parkinson’s disease, you may think of the decreased ability to walk, talk, eat, and so on. However, the disease also affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls the movements and function of the internal organs — the muscles we never think about using.If the autonomic nervous system is affected, the intestinal tract may not work properly, causing constipation.


Failure to have a bowel movement every day does not necessarily indicate constipation. For some people, it may be normal to go 3-4 days between movements.
Constipation is marked by a significant decrease in movement frequency. They are also drier than usual, and difficult to pass. You may find that you’re straining when you use the bathroom.
Make allowances for other causes of constipation. These might include dehydration, fiber deficiency, excessive alcohol, caffeine or dairy, and stress, among other potential causes., Parkinson’s affects motor skills and causes muscle stiffness, so people who have it often find that it becomes more and more difficult to write. Micrographia is a change in handwriting commonly associated with the disease. Take note if:


Your handwriting becomes small and more cramped than usual
You can no longer write in a smooth, fluid motion
Your hands feel tight when writing
Note that micrographia is usually marked by a sudden rather than gradual change.

, 90% of people with Parkinson’s will experience a decrease in speech ability.The most common early symptom of this is a softening or quieter voice, though speech can also become breathy or hoarse. Some people may find that their speech gets slower, while others — about 10% — speed up their rate of talking, resulting in stumbling, stuttering speech. It might be hard to notice these changes in yourself, so ask the people around you if they notice any change in your speech.

, Over 90% of people with Parkinson’s disease suffer from hyposmia, or a loss of the ability to smell.Research suggests that the decrease in ability to smell is a predictor for the dementia that accompanies Parkinson’s disease, and can precede motor and coordination problems by several years.If you suspect your ability to smell might be decreasing, test yourself with bananas, dill pickles, or licorice before contacting a medical professional.Remember that there are other, completely harmless reasons for the sudden loss of smell. Let a cold, the flu, or a stuffy nose run their course before worrying about hyposmia.

, Trouble sleeping is an early indicator of Parkinson’s, and is usually noticeable before any trouble with motor function.Sleep problems can take many forms, including:


Insomnia (the inability to fall asleep at night)Feeling sleepy during the day (reported by 76% of Parkinson’s sufferers) or having “sleep attacks” (sudden, involuntary onset of sleep)
Nightmares or the “acting out” of dreams while you’re asleep
Sleep apnea (when you stop breathing for a few seconds at a time while asleep), While these symptoms can have a range of causes, in Parkinson’s sufferers, they are due to orthostatic hypotension, a form of low blood pressure that affects 15-50% of patients.Orthostatic hypotension causes your blood pressure to drop suddenly and dramatically when you get up after standing or lying down for a period of time. This causes wooziness, trouble finding your balance, and even loss of consciousness., However, if more than one of these symptoms is observed together for an extended period of time, you should contact a medical professional to be tested for Parkinson’s disease.

, Only 1-2% of Parkinson’s sufferers have genes that directly cause the development of the disease.Most people have “associated” genes, meaning that they are at a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s, but will not necessarily have it even if they have the genetic predisposition for it. If associated genes are combined with other inherited genes or environmental factors, they can trigger the onset of Parkinson’s. About 15-25% of people with the disease have relatives who suffered from it as well.Age also increases your risk of developing Parkinson’s. Whereas 1-2% of the general population suffers from the disease, 2-4% of the population over 60 years in age suffers from it.Be aware of your genetic risk factors and be able to provide them to your doctor.

, However, early detection is very important for maintaining a good quality of life for as long as possible. If you observe more than one of the symptoms listed in the previous section and have a family history of Parkinson’s, ask your internist or family physician to go over your symptoms with you.

, There is no standard diagnostic test for Parkinson’s disease, though scientists are working to find a biological marker — like blood tests or an imaging scan — that can confirm a diagnosis. But because we don’t have that test yet, the doctor will instead draw on his or her knowledge of how the disease manifests and combine it with observations of your ability to complete some simple tasks. The test will likely test for the symptoms that were listed in the previous section:Animation of the facial muscles
The presence of tremors when your limbs are resting
Limb or neck stiffness
Ability to stand up suddenly without dizziness
Flexibility and muscle strength
Ability to regain balance quickly

, Even if your family physician doesn’t see any cause for concern, ask for a referral to a neurologist if you are still worried. A specialist will be more familiar with the signs of Parkinson’s, and may disagree with your general practitioner’s opinion.


Be prepared for additional tests (blood tests, scans) that may be carried out to rule out other causes for the symptoms you’ve observed., If you begin taking the medication and notice an improvement in your symptoms, the doctor can use that information to confirm a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.


Make sure to take the medication as directed. If you space out the doses too much or don’t take a high enough dose, the doctor won’t be able to accurately gauge how much and why your symptoms improved or didn’t improve.

, Because there is not yet a test for a biological marker of Parkinson’s disease, it can be very difficult to get an accurate diagnosis — especially in the early stages. Getting second opinions will help ensure that you’re getting the best possible treatment for whatever is causing your symptoms.


If the doctors say you don’t have Parkinson’s, but the symptoms don’t go away, get retested periodically. This is a progressive disease, and with time, the symptoms may progress to a stage that will allow a doctor to confirm a solid diagnosis."

Plan ahead.,
Start with soft, room temperature foods.,
Keep eating soft foods for the first three days or so.,
Begin with small bites.,
Follow your oral surgeon’s instructions.,
Don’t use straws.,
Avoid vigorous mouth rinsing.,
Try not to chew directly on the wound.,
Avoid smoking.,
Don’t rush your hunger.,
Brush your teeth.,
Rinse your mouth.",How to Eat After Getting Your Wisdom Teeth Removed," Go shopping and stock up on soft, easy-to-chew foods before the surgery. Ideally, make them drinkable like yogurt and soups that don't have big chunks. Remember, your back teeth may hurt and you won't want to be chewing very much with your molars for the first few days and up to a week.Buy food like soup, yogurt, ice cream, applesauce, jello, and mashed potatoes.
Don’t buy anything that could leave residual food pieces in your mouth like cookies, nuts, rice, or pasta.
Drink water and juice, but avoid drinks like soda and alcohol.;
, Eat room temperature, very soft foods the first day after surgery. Try soup that's cooled down, yogurt, or puddings. Applesauce can be good too, just make sure there are no big chunks of apple.Try boiling vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, potatoes, onion and peppers and then smash them all together. Add a little vegetable stock to create a soup. Allow it to cool before you eat it.
You can expect to not be able to open your mouth very wide soon after the surgery, so big spoons can cause problems. Make sure to have spoons that are the right size for you.

, It’s important to maintain an exclusively soft diet for the first three days after surgery. Your mouth needs time to heal, so you need to help this process by avoiding foods that require chewing. After the first few days, you will likely be ready for foods that require a little chewing and don't have to be room temperature, like ice cream.An advantage to eating cold foods is that it can help numb your mouth, causing you to not feel any pain for a short while. The cool temperatures can also work to soothe your mouth after the surgery.

, When you’re ready to start chewing food again, start with really small bites. Work your way up to normal-sized bites. It can take a while to get back to eating normally, but it will improve soon enough. You don’t want to rush into eating regular foods again because it could cause your wounds to re-open, which can lead to pain and bleeding. Then you’ll have to start the healing process all over again.Most people start eating normally again after five to seven days post-surgery.

, After any kind of surgery, it is crucial to follow your doctor’s advice. But with oral surgery it is especially important because you can’t simply leave the wound untouched. You must eat food during the recovery period.


Make sure that you listen to everything your doctor tells you and follow their instructions to the letter.

, When drinking after your surgery, don’t use a straw in your beverage. Sucking through a straw can remove the clot that forms over the wound while it is healing. This can cause excess bleeding and increase the amount of time it takes for your wounds to heal.Instead of using a straw, just drink any liquids as you normally would from a glass. Use extra caution not to drink too much at one time. Take small sips.

, After your surgery, you may feel the need to rinse your mouth — usually because you’ll have dry mouth or because you can taste blood in your mouth; however, rinsing your mouth too much or with too much force can be detrimental to your healing process and should be avoided as much as possible.Just as with using a straw while drinking, rinsing your mouth too much or too vigorously can dislodge the blood clot that forms over the wounds.
Make sure you follow your doctor’s orders regarding mouth rinsing.

, Once you have upgraded from liquid foods to semi-solid foods, you’ll need to be mindful about your chewing. Avoid biting down on food over the wound where your wisdom teeth used to be. Try to chew your foods closer to the front of your mouth if possible.


Chew more slowly and gently than normal so that you can be extra careful about where the food lands in your mouth as you are chewing and you don't put any pressure on areas that are swollen.

, Smoking can be very dangerous for people who have just had oral surgery, especially an extraction like getting your wisdom teeth removed. Smoking transfers all kinds of chemicals inside your mouth and will compromise your healing process. It also greatly increases your risk of infection.If you must smoke, wait at least 48 hours after the surgery and then be sure to rinse your mouth out after every single cigarette.

, Wait until you feel ready to eat something. Right after the surgery you probably won't feel like eating. You don’t want to put something in your mouth until you’re absolutely ready so that your wounds have a little time to heal first. The anesthetic can suppress your appetite for a few hours. Even if your surgery is in the morning you may not end up eating all day. Don't be afraid of not eating for a day — your body will tell you when it's ready to eat.Make sure you are staying hydrated and drinking an adequate amount of water.
By the second day, you should have a bit of your normal hunger returned. But even if you aren’t hungry, you should at least eat a little something from the second day on.

, Avoid brushing your teeth on the day of the surgery, but resume brushing from the second day on. Brush gently, especially around the surgical areas. And be careful not to scrape the wound.Brushing will help keep your mouth clean and assist with the healing process, even if it is a bit uncomfortable.

, Beginning the second day after surgery, you should gently rinse your mouth every four to six hours with a warm salt water mixture. This can be made by adding ½ teaspoon of salt with ½ cup of warm water. Swish it around in your mouth for at least 30 seconds and then spit it out.Make sure you rinse your mouth immediately after you eat something.
You should continue with regular salt water rinses for one week after the surgery.

Make sure you are a good candidate for plasma donation.,
Be aware that donating plasma is completely safe.,
Meet the requirements for donor eligibility.,
Find a plasma collection center.,
Bring proper identification with you.,
Drink plenty of water and eat something beforehand.,
Receive a physical examination.,
Complete a Donor History Questionnaire.,
Begin the donation process.,
Check out and get paid.",How to Get Paid For Donating Plasma," Are you in generally good health? Do you already donate blood? If you answered 'yes' to both of these, you're likely a good candidate for plasma donation, although you will only be able to confirm your eligibility for donation on site at a plasma collection center. If you would like to donate, discuss this with your physician who will be able to advise you further on your candidacy.


If you have Type AB blood, you are an ideal candidate for donating plasma. Type AB plasma is universal. This means that your plasma can be received by anyone, irrespective of whatever that person's own blood type is. In addition, because only 4% of the population has Type AB blood, this makes your plasma even more in need.In addition to getting the okay from your physician, you will also need to meet some minimum requirements on behalf of the plasma donation centers (see Step 3).;
, Plasma donation in certified collection centers takes place in a highly controlled, sterile environment by professionally trained medical staff.All equipment used for plasma collections is sterilized. Moreover, any equipment that comes into contact with you is used only once to eliminate the possible transmission of viral infections.Donating plasma is low-risk and has minimal and often no side effects.These minimal side effects include feelings of faintness or bruising from the needle. If you exhibit any other side effects after donating plasma, you should consult your physician.

, There are a number of eligibility requirements that you need to meet in order to donate your plasma. However, it is important to note that ultimately whether or not you are eligible is at the discretion of the particular plasma collection center you visit. Eligibility requirements include:Age - You must be at least 18 years old.

Weight - You should weigh at least 110 pounds or 50 kilograms.

Medical exam - You must pass a medical exam.

Medical history - You must complete an extensive medical history screening.

Testing - You must test as non-reactive for transmissible viruses (such as hepatitis and HIV).

Diet - You should follow a recommended diet that includes 50 - 80 grams of protein every day.

, There are hundreds of plasma centers in the United States. You can easily locate a center by inputting your city, state, and/or postcode in the Donating Plasma Organization's searchable directory. You do not need to make an appointment in advance of visiting a center.


You can set the radius of the search to within 10 miles of where you live if you want to find one nearby.
You could also check with local hospitals or clinics to see if they can help you locate a center.
Call the center ahead of your visit to find out its hours of operation and the compensation it offers or to ask any additional questions. Each company establishes its own compensation scale, so you may want to check out the different options beforehand., The center will want to be able to confirm that you are who you say you are. You will need:


Current photo I.D. (such as a driver's license)
Social Security or Border Crossing ID
Proof of local address (such as a current lease agreement, a piece of mail (like a phone bill) postmarked in the past 30 days with your name and address on the front, etc.)

, Before heading to the plasma collective facility to donate, make sure you are fully hydrated and that you've eaten something.This will decrease the likelihood of any side effects of faintness or dizziness.Drink a 4-6 ounce glass of water, juice or other caffeine-free liquid before you donate. Avoid consuming any alcohol within 24 hours of your donation.Eat a meal rich in protein and iron about 3 hours before you donate. Protein-rich foods include beans, cheese, eggs, nuts, beef, chicken, milk and yogurt, among others. Iron-rich foods include beans, broccoli, chicken, ham, turkey, beef, and leafy greens, etc. Avoid foods high in fat, like chips, pizza or French fries., If this is your first visit, you will undergo a brief physical and have your vitals assessed. For example, your pulse will be checked, and your temperature taken.A technician will take a sample blood sample from your finger (just a little prick) to check your iron and protein levels.If your iron and protein levels are not considered sufficient, you may be unable to donate your plasma.

, This questionnaire will ask you questions about your medical and family history, sexual habits, drug use, and so on. Notify center personnel if you have had surgery recently, have obtained a tattoo or piercing within the past year or are currently taking any medications or are receiving care for a specific medical condition.It's important that you fill out this questionnaire honestly. This information is to ensure that you are not at risk of transferring any diseases or viruses through your plasma to another person.Some centers may ask you to watch a video that explains the behaviors that could taint your blood, such as unprotected sex or sharing needles.

, If the center personnel deem you eligible to donate, you will be taken to the donation area and to comfortable seating bed. A technician will prepare your arm with antiseptic and then insert a needle to draw blood. You shouldn't feel more than a prick or a pinch. As the blood is drawn, the plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells will be returned to your body through the same needle. This process is called plasmapheresis.During this time, you can read a book, watch TV or listen to music with your headphones in. Some centers also offer free Wi-Fi.A staff member will check on you periodically to make sure you're comfortable. If you feel discomfort or faint at any moment, let a staff member know.Your first visit will take approximately two hours because of all of the medical screening. Return visits generally take only about 90 minutes., Once you have donated, the area where the needle was inserted will be bandaged. Then, you can collect compensation to thank you for your time at the end of the donation process. Though the amount varies according to each facility, the fee is usually between $20-$50.Remember that you can always donate again and that in fact, plasma collection centers encourage committed donors. Some centers may let you come in 48 hours later or twice a week, while others limit donations to once a month.Check with the center to determine the required length of time between visits. There are no known long-term effects if you donate often, although it is important to drink lots of water after donating if you plan to do it again soon. This will help your body replace fluids.In some cases, plasma centers and corporations offer bonuses if you donate a certain number of times a month (e.g., an additional $35 if you make 8 donations in a month) or if you donate during certain weeks."

Move slowly.,
Avoid looking up or down.,
Focus on a distant object.,
Avoid repetitive movements.",How to Alleviate Vertigo1," If vertigo hits, the worst thing you can do is to change your position quickly. Reduce your feelings of dizziness by moving very slowly - we’re talking sloth’s pace. These slow movements will allow you to focus more easily and clear your head a bit better. If you need to, take short breaks between slow movements.;
, As with regular non-vertigo produced dizziness, looking up or down can cause further disorientation and feelings of unpleasantness. Avoid performing any activities that require you to look up or down for a long period of time or quickly. Keep your head level and parallel to the ground whenever possible.

, As a result of human perception, things close up seem to move faster whereas things far away move as if through molasses. Therefore, focus on something in the distance until your dizziness recedes. If necessary, look out a window to do so.

, It may seem obvious, but repetitive movements will worsen your vertigo by shaking up your balance. Keep your movements deliberate and steady in addition to slow and you should notice an alleviation of your vertigo pretty quickly."

Know the federal government regulations on feeds for livestock.,
Know the signs and symptoms of BSE (or TSE, if you have goats and/or sheep as well).,
Avoid purchasing feeds with animal by-products.,
For farms with mixed livestock, ensure feeding areas are separate.,
Keep ruminant feed separate.,
Keep your veterinarian on speed-dial in case anything happens.,
Sell off your animals.",How to Avoid Mad Cow Disease," In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has a mandatory ban in place where it is illegal to feed ruminants (including cattle, goats, sheep, deer, elk and bison) most proteins and animal by-products derived from mammals, especially those that are allowed to be fed to poultry, pigs, horses, and other non-ruminant livestock. This includes poultry litter, which is not prohibited as feed in the United States.


In the United States, the Department of Agriculture's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows for the feeding of chicken litter because it felt it could not find any evidence that it would pose any risk of BSE to ruminants when ""processed properly"" through deep-stacking or ensiling . This is not agreed upon by other countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and those in the European Union simply because no amount of heat treatment will destroy ant potentially existing prions.;
, Diagnosing this neurological disease can be a challenge if you are new to the raising livestock venture, so if you know what to look for as a means to prepare for the unexpected in your flock or herd, you can be ready to expect the unexpected. This is highly recommended if you have a breeding herd or flock of cattle, sheep or goats of animals that reach 8 to 10 years of age and older.

, With exception to feeds for hogs, poultry, horses and fish, all feeds that are made for ruminant animals should be free of animal by-products. However, you should make sure to check the label just in case, particularly if it's a brand you have not purchased before and are not familiar with.


Feed manufacturers are usually really good about producing a sound, reliable product for your animals. However, mishaps and errors can occur, so if you notice anything about the feed you are buying that seems out of the ordinary, talk to your local feed store supplier about your concerns.
An exception should be made with young animals that are cannot be on full feed or fed the same feed as adult ruminants are, such as grain, hay, and silage. Milk replacer and colostrum powder formulas are made with powdered milk from cows, and are much better for young calves than soy milk replacer due to the lower fibre content. Milk replacer nor milk itself is not a significant risk for calves to pick up prions, simply because prions tend to favour nervous tissue, not milk alveoli in the mammary glands, which is why it is still safe to feed to baby calves.
You should know which bag of feed is for which farm animal species simply by seeing the picture, colouring and label of the bag. Some people think it's okay to feed feed to cows that are meant for pigs or chickens, but this is entirely illegal and not a very wise decision. Thus, always make sure the feed your buying is only for the livestock it's meant to be fed to, no exceptions!

, If you have more than one species of livestock that includes a non-ruminant species or two (like chickens or pigs), make sure you are feeding your chickens and/or pigs away from where you feed your cattle. This also applies to goats and sheep as well if you have either one, both or instead of cattle.


This should be areas where your ruminant animals can not get in and have their share of the chicken or pig feed too. Fencing off each species so they have their own feeding area, and developing feeding schedules so that one species that tends to be more nosy and pushy than the other gets to be fed first are highly recommended strategies.
Check fences regularly, and keep an eye on the critters that like to escape or get themselves into where your other stock eat, especially at feeding time.

, As in the above step, if you are one that has more than one livestock species on your farm or acreage, just like with feeding, keep feed bags for your ruminant species separate from those of your non-ruminant ones. This reduces cross-contamination risks and mistakes of feeding a bag meant for one species to another.


Though this step isn't all that crucial, it's still worth doing just to be on the safe side. There's no need to have ruminant feeds a certain distance or an entire room separate from non-ruminant feeds, but it would make sense to store them in separate containers (a big plastic or metal garbage can, for instance) or that you can easily distinguish one feed container from another. Keep these stored and locked up in a ""designated"" feed shed.

Not only do containers help keep feed separate, it also reduces the chance of mice or rats getting in and eating their way into the feed, like what is most likely to happen if you have a wood feed bin to store your bagged feeds in. It also reduces the chance of one of your goats or cattle breaking in to the feed shed and finding some tasty chicken feed to gorge on.


You may also wish to choose to use a separate scoop for each feed to avoid cross-contamination.

, Even though your federal government is doing their part to keep your animals safe from this incurable fatal disease, things can happen. If you have an animal that you suspect may have come down with symptoms similar to BSE or Mad Cow, contact your veterinarian immediately.

, If you are really leery about having your animals coming into contact with BSE, then you may have to consider selling them off. This is the most extreme solution to avoiding BSE or TSE in your herd, though probably not the best solution if you are not keen on doing this step and still wish to raise cattle, sheep or goats regardless the risk.


Keep things in perspective: The risk of animals getting BSE is very low, even more so if you are in a country with stricter feed bans like in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and countries of the European Union. Just using your common sense and following recommendations on feeding and storing feed would and should be enough to reduce the risk of your animals coming down with an infection caused by prions.

Ask your doctor about anticonvulsant medicines.,
Get a prescription for tricyclic antidepressants.,
Avoid analgesics and opioids.,
Try antispasmodic agents.,
Ask about Botox injections.,
Consider alternative medicine.",How to Alleviate Pain Caused by Trigeminal Neuralgia1," Anticonvulsant medications are one of the most common treatments for trigeminal neuralgia. Your doctor may prescribe one or more anticonvulsants until he finds the one that works the best to manage your pain symptoms.Anticonvulsant medications are typically prescribed instead of traditional painkillers (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which are not as effective at blocking the electrical signals from the misfiring neurons that are causing the sensations of pain.Carbamazepine is the is the usual initial anticonvulsant medication treatment. Oxcarbazepine is similar to carbamazepine in effectiveness and may be better tolerated, but is more expensive. Gabapentin and lamotrigine are often used for patients who cannot tolerate carbamazepine.
Baclofen may be a useful medication to take alongside the anticonvulsant, particularly in patients with TN related to multiple sclerosis.
Anticonvulsant medications may lose their efficacy over time as they build up in the bloodstream; at this point, your doctor may switch your prescription to a different anticonvulsant that your body has not grown insensitive to.;
, Tricyclic antidepressants are commonly used to manage symptoms of depression but they can also be prescribed to manage chronic pain.Tricyclic antidepressants are often effective in managing chronic pain conditions, such as atypical facial pain, but are not generally useful in classical trigeminal neuralgia.
Tricyclic antidepressants tend to be prescribed in lower doses for chronic pain management versus when they are used to treat depression.Common tricyclic antidepressants used to treat chronic pain include amitriptyline and nortriptyline., Analgesics and opioids are not useful in managing the paroxysms of pain in classical TN.However, some people with TN2 respond to analgesics and opioids.


TN2 consists of constant pain that can be dampened by these medications as they build up in the bloodstream, while TN1 consists of sharp recurring pain episodes that cannot effectively be lessened by these drugs.Your doctor can prescribe analgesics and opioids such as allodynia, levorphanol, or methadone.

, Antispasmodic agents are used to ease pain sensations caused by trigeminal neuralgia attacks. They are sometimes used in conjunction with anticonvulsants.Antispasmodics, otherwise known as muscle relaxants, are prescribed to treat trigeminal neuralgia because they inhibit involuntary muscle movements that can be triggered by misfiring neurons during a trigeminal neuralgia episode.
Common antispasmodics include Kemstro, Gablofen, and Lioresal; these are all members of the baclofen family of drugs.

, Your doctor may consider Botox injections to treat your trigeminal neuralgia if you become insensitive and unresponsive to anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, and antispasmodic medications.Botox has shown to be effective for pain management in a high percentage of patients with trigeminal neuralgia, especially those with rapid muscle twitching.Many people feel uncomfortable considering Botox injections due to negative connotations from their use in plastic surgery; however, you should not discount this treatment modality because it can effectively help you to manage your chronic facial pain after you have exhausted your other options.

, Alternative medicine options have not been studied enough to be determined as effective for treating trigeminal neuralgia. Even so, many people report some pain relief from modalities such as acupuncture and nutritional therapy."

Find out your parents' Rh factors.,
Ask your doctor for a blood type test.,
Take blood typing test.,
Test blood sample.,
Recognize the importance of your results.,
Be aware of your pregnancy risks.",How to Determine Positive and Negative Blood Types," Located on your red blood cells, the Rh factor is a protein you did or did not receive from your parents. You are Rh positive when you have the protein. If the protein is not present, you are Rh negative.People with positive Rh factors have positive blood types, whether A+, B+, AB+, or O+. People with negative Rh factors then have negative blood types, e.g. A-, B-, AB-, or O-.
The majority of people have Rh positive factors.;
, It is possible that while having other bloodwork done, your Rh factor was tested as well. Ask your primary physician whether he/she has a blood type for you on record. If you have had blood transfusions regularly, your blood type is likely recorded. The same applies if you are a blood donor.


If you have a positive Rh factor, you can receive either Rh+ or Rh- blood during transfusions. If you have Rh- blood, you must receive Rh-. blood(except in certain life-threatening emergencies when you might need to receive Rh+ blood).

, Ask your parents what their Rh factors are. It can be possible to learn your Rh factor by analyzing your parents’ factors.If your parents both have Rh- blood, you will most likely be Rh- (see bullet point for exceptions). If your mother is negative and your father is positive (or vice versa), you could be either positive or negative. In this type of situation, you will need more definite evidence from a lab test performed by your doctor or blood collection centers. It should be noted that if both of your parents are Rh+, you could still be Rh-.Because people with positive blood types can possess either two positive Rh genes (Rh+/Rh+) or one positive and one negative (Rh+/Rh-), there can be instances where both parents have positive blood types but their children have negative blood types., If your parents have different Rh factors (or if they are both positive and you want to know for sure that you are also positive), you can request a blood typing test. This outpatient procedure is fast and should not be very painful. You can go home afterwards.

, A nurse or physician will clean a spot on your inner elbow or wrist with an antiseptic towelette. He/She will locate an easily accessible vein in this area. After wrapping a tourniquet around your upper arm to pool the blood, he/she will stick your vein with a needle. The needle is usually connected to a syringe, which removes your blood. Once he/she has taken enough blood, he/she will take out the needle and gently press the injection site with a sterile swab. You will then receive a bandage.Afterwards, the nurse will label your sample and send it to a lab for testing.


Doctors test children’s blood through the back of their hands.If you feel like you might pass out, tell the medical professional. He/She can help you recline.You might feel a prick, sting, or mild pain when your nurse sticks you. After the test, you might bruise at the puncture site. This pain should not last long., At the laboratory, a technician will test your sample for its Rh factor. He/She will combine a sample of your blood with an anti-Rh serum. If your cells clot, you have Rh+. On the other hand, if your blood cells do not stick together, you are Rh-.It is likely that the lab will run tests to determine your ABO blood type as well during this time.

, Record your blood type in a safe place and share this information with your emergency contacts. You will need this information if you require a blood transfusion or organ transplants. Additionally, if you are or plan to be pregnant, knowing your Rh factor is essential.

, If you are female and Rh-, you will need to have your partner test his Rh factor. If you are Rh- and he is Rh+, you can experience Rh incompatibility. This means that if your baby inherits his father’s Rh+, your antibodies can attack the baby's red blood cells. This can cause extreme anemia and possible death for the baby.During your pregnancy, if you are Rh-, you will take blood tests to see whether your body is producing antibodies against Rh+ blood. The first will happen in your first trimester and the second will occur when you are 28 weeks pregnant. If no antibodies have developed, you will receive a shot of Rh immune globulin. This shot will prevent your body from producing harmful antibodies against your child.If your body has produced antibodies against Rh+ blood, you will not receive an immune globulin shot. Instead, doctors will keep a close eye on your baby as he/she develops. Either before or after his/her birth, your child might receive a blood transfusion.Once your baby is born, doctors can test his/her Rh factor. If your baby shares your Rh factor, you will need no further treatment. If you are Rh- negative, however, and your baby is Rh+, you must receive another immune globulin shot."

Ask about glycerol injection.,
Try radiofrequency thermal lesioning.,
Research stereotactic radiosurgery (or gamma knife).,
Try microvascular decompression (MVD).,
Understand neurectomy.",How to Alleviate Pain Caused by Trigeminal Neuralgia2," Trigeminal neuralgia is a progressive condition. Although medications can help you manage symptoms over time, more aggressive cases of this condition can lead to permanent damage to the trigeminal nerve, which can result in debilitating pain or partial permanent facial numbness.If you do not respond to medication surgery may be considered.


Your doctor will work with you to help you choose the best surgery based on your health and medical background. The degree of severity of your trigeminal neuralgia, prior history of neuropathy, and general health all factor into the options that are available to you.
The overall goal of surgery is to minimize damage to the trigeminal nerve as trigeminal neuralgia advances and to improve quality of life when medications no longer effectively manage pain.

, The goal of balloon compression is to slightly damage the trigeminal nerve branches so that pain impulses cannot be transmitted.During the procedure, a small balloon is inserted into the skull through a catheter and as it inflates, the trigeminal nerve is pressed against the skull.
This is typically an outpatient procedure that is performed under general anesthesia, although sometimes an overnight hospital stay is needed.
Balloon compression results in about two years of pain relief.
Many patients experience temporary facial numbness or weakness in muscles used for chewing after undergoing this procedure, but are generally relieved of pain symptoms., Glycerol injection is used to treat trigeminal neuralgia that particularly affects the third and lowest branch of the trigeminal nerve.During this outpatient procedure, a thin needle is inserted through the cheek into the base of the skull and near the 3rd division of the trigeminal nerve.
Once the glycerol is injected, it damages the trigeminal nerve, resulting in pain relief.
This procedure usually results in about 1 to 2 years of pain relief.

, Radiofrequency thermal lesioning, also known as RF ablation, is an outpatient procedure consisting of coagulating nerve fibers with an electrode to desensitize areas where pain is experienced.During the procedure, a needle with an electrode is inserted into the trigeminal nerve.
Once the area of nerve that causes the pain is located, your doctor sends small electrical pulses through the electrode to damage the nerve fibers, resulting in numbing of the site.
In about 50% of the patients, the symptoms reoccur three to four years following the procedure.

, This procedure uses computer imaging to send focused radiation to the trigeminal nerve.During the procedure, the radiation creates a lesion of the trigeminal nerve, which disrupts sensory signals to the brain and reduces pain.
Patients can often leave the hospital the same day or the day following the procedure.
Most patients who undergo gamma knife report pain relief after a few weeks or months but pain often reoccurs within three years.

, MVD is the most invasive surgical procedure for trigeminal neuralgia. During surgery your doctor makes a hole behind the ear. Then, using an endoscope to visualize the trigeminal nerve, your doctor will place a cushion between the nerve and the blood vessel that compresses the nerve.The recovery time for this procedure varies from person to person and often requires a hospital stay.
This is the most effective surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. About 70-80% of patients have immediate, complete pain relief and 60-70% remain pain free at 10-20 years., Neurectomy involves removing a part of the trigeminal nerve. This invasive,ablative procedure is reserved for patients who are refractory to other treatments or who cannot undergo the alternative surgical procedures. Neurectomies are often performed when a blood vessel is not found pressing on the nerve during an MVD.
During the procedure, different portions of the trigeminal nerve’s branches are removed to grant pain relief.

, The person you are talking to is more likely to be excited about the prospect of donating blood if you are excited about it. Speak with confidence, and remind them that their blood can save another person’s life.


While enthusiasm is key, it is important not to pressure or guilt anyone into donating blood.
Remember that the prospect of giving blood can be scary—especially for first time donors. Explain to a potential donor all that is involved in donating, and answer any questions that they may have. You should also inform them how their donation will help those in need.

, Divide your organization into multiple groups and see who can recruit the most members.

, While you can still offer a sign up table on the day of the event, having scheduled appointments will help avert long lines and wait times.

Are in good health. This means that you are feeling well and are able to do normal daily activities. Those with chronic medical conditions may still be eligible, as long as they are receiving treatment for their condition.;
, Having food in your system will help alleviate the feeling of lightheadedness after you donate. It is recommended to increase your consumption of calcium-rich foods the night and morning before your donation. You should also make sure to drink plenty of non-caffeinated fluids, such as water and fruit juice. It is recommended that you drink 6-8 good-sized glasses in the three hours before you donate.

,, Because platelet donation takes between 1.5 and 2.5 hours, it is helpful to make appointments to avoid long wait times.

Understand the process.",How to Donate Eyes After Death," When you choose to donate your eyes, your cornea is removed and grafted onto a recipient's eye. Sometimes the sclera (the white part of your eye) is also used for repairing eyelids and rebuilding the rest of someone's eye.There are many reasons why people need corneal transplants, but the most common reasons are ocular disease or scarring of the cornea, which would leave the recipient blind or at risk of further health complications.


Your donation could help restore someone's vision.
Donations go to recipients of all ages, from newborn children to people over 100 years old.Your decision to be a donor will not affect the quality of your medical care in any way. Donations are only procured after you've been declared dead, and the physician who certifies your death will not be involved in the collection process whatsoever.;
, It's important to let your family know about your wishes to be a donor. Even though you may have made it official, in some states there is still a mandatory next-of-kin cooperation clause. If you keep your family out of the loop on your decision to be a donor, it may delay or even prevent the process, depending on where you live.In some states, a donor's registration is sufficient, and no next-of-kin consent is required. However, this varies by state.If you're committed to being a donor, let your family know about your wishes no matter what your state laws require.

, Some people feel conflicted on becoming a donor because they fear that there may be some religious objection to donation. The fear is that this may violate some spiritual rule, or it could bar a donor from being buried in the cemetery of her choosing. While no religion prohibits donating your eyes or other organs, you may want to consult with your identified spiritual leader if you're feeling some anxiety about this.Most major religions support the choice to donate eyes, organs, and tissue after death, and those that do not have an official position on the matter usually believe that it is an individual decision.Talking to your priest, rabbi, imam, or other spiritual leader may help you find peace of mind with your decision to donate.

, Every state has different requirements about the donation process, from registering to donate all the way to procuring the donation from the deceased.If you were registered to donate in one state and then relocated, you may have to begin the registration process all over again, and there may be different requirements on how you register.


Every state accepts eye donations and performs corneal transplants.
State laws generally only affect how you register, whether your family needs to give consent, and how/when the donation is collected after you die.
Some states may impose restrictions on the age of the donor, though many do not.To find out your state's specific requirements, including how to register, search online for how to become an eye donor in your state.

, Every state has its own unique registry of who has enrolled to become an organ donor. No matter what other steps you take to ensure that your donations go to a recipient in need, you should begin by signing up in your state's donor registry.You can find your state's registry by visiting the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website at http://www.organdonor.gov/becomingdonor/stateregistries.html.
Click on the interactive map to choose your state and learn how to enroll in your state's registry.

, Some eye banks and non-profit organizations work with your state's organ donor registry.If you haven't already signed up with your state's registry, you can enroll with your state's registry through a non-profit or eye bank in your state.The easiest way is to register with your state's registry, as this will ensure that your donation will be put to use where it is needed.
If you or your family have a dedication to a particular eye bank or non-profit group, you may be more comfortable initiating the process with them.
There is no right or wrong way to enroll in your state's registry. It's more a matter of what you feel most comfortable with as a donor.
Beware of intent registries. While it is still a meaningful gesture, an intent registry is not linked with your state's registry, and your next of kin will still need to give his or her consent., Because some states may require next-of-kin consent, it's a good idea to let everyone in your family know about your wishes to become a donor. You may also want to declare your intentions to be a donor in your advance directives, will, and living will to ensure that your final arrangements are carried out.In addition to letting your relatives know, you should also tell your friends, spiritual leader, and your attorney (if you have one). This will help ensure that there are no uncertainties about your decision.

, While some states allow you to register at the Department of Motor Vehicles, other states may not.However, most states allow you to designate your decision to be an organ donor on your driver's license. That way, if anything happens to you, the medical professionals trying to save your life will see your ID and know that they should preserve your organs and alert the parties responsible for donation procurement in your state if you do not survive.Depending on where you live, your driver's license may be a good way to indicate that you are an organ donor.
Some states also issue donor wallet cards. These are to be kept in your wallet with your regular ID card, so that medical professionals will know of your desire to donate if they cannot save your life., Almost anyone can be an eye donor. There is no age limit (in most states), and your blood type does not have to match your recipient's blood type. Even if you have poor eyesight, your corneal donation can still be used to help restore someone's vision.Your blood and tissue are tested after you die to check for communicable diseases.
Doctors may also review your medical, family, and social history, in addition to examining the condition of your eyes and cornea.
The only conditions that would disqualify your donation is if you had a communicable, life-threatening illness like HIV or hepatitis, or if you died by drowning.Even cancer does not automatically disqualify you from donating your eyes, though further tests may be performed to ensure that ocular cancer would not be a risk to the recipient.In the unlikely event that your donation cannot be used for transplants (due to medical complications), your donation can still be used for medical education and transplant research, with your family's consent., Your donation can help anyone. If you have a specific recipient you would like your family to designate, you may be able to do so.Otherwise, your eye donation goes to whoever needs it the most, usually determined by when a recipient is scheduled for surgery.Surgeons and donation coordinators can usually predict the average number of donations in a given week, and often schedule surgeries in advance knowing that a donation will likely be made in time.
Your donation can help anyone. Donations go to infants, the elderly, and everyone in between, across all races, ethnicities, and genders., When you die, your physician will certify your death. That physician is not involved in procuring donations in any way, and your decision to donate will not affect the quality of your medical care.After you are declared dead, a separate team of medical professionals will test your blood, examine your eyes, and research your medical and family histories.
If you are a registered donor, your donation may be procured more quickly. If you are not a registered donor, your family may be asked about their wishes for your body.
The decision to donate must be made quickly, as there is a time limit of only a few hours after you pass before your eyes are no longer usable for transplants.The collection of your donation will not delay any funeral arrangements you or your family have made.
Donating your eyes (or any part of them) will not affect your appearance for the wake or funeral. You may still have an open-casket viewing, as your appearance will be preserved.
Corneal and ocular donations are only viable for transplant for up to 14 days. However, most donations are used within one to four days due to the great need for donations.The person receiving your donation has the surgery performed at an outpatient facility.Corneal transplant surgeries have an incredibly high success rate, with over 95% of recipients having successfully-restored vision.

Use what you have.,
Make a credible excuse.,
Create a distraction.",How to Cope if You Wet Yourself in Public1," Find materials on and around you that will make the wet spot less visible. Don't be afraid to get a little creative.


Use a sweater to wrap around your waist, or place a purse/bag/hat in the right area.
Use your body. Change up your posture or fold/place your hands over the most visible areas.
If there are other liquids around (juice, soda, etc.) spill them on top of the wet spot. This will cover up any smell or stain, if any, and provide a credible excuse. Only use this method if you are aware it will wash out of your clothing, or if you do not care about staining your clothing.
Wet the entirety of your bottoms, weather permitting, to even out the color. This may be a tad uncomfortable, but it will be less obvious that you have wet yourself.;
, The truth is never a bad option, especially if it’s obvious what has happened. Otherwise keep your excuse simple and believable.


Don’t ramble. The more explanation you provide, the more questionable it will seem.
Use excuses like, you sat in something or spilled, and find a bathroom if you haven’t already.

, Draw attention to something that is away from you and make your escape.


Ask the people around you what you think is happening across the room, or make an outlandish statement that will require them to look away before they answer.

Why are Anna and Ben hugging? I thought they got a divorce.
Look, Jennifer Lopez's new music video is on!

Go to the bathroom when you feel the urge to go.,
Take pyridium (phenazopyridine) to reduce the burning sensation when you urinate.,
Wear loose-fitting, cotton underwear and clothing.,
Take an over-the-counter painkiller.,
Use a heating pad.",How to Cope and Deal With Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)1," When you have a urinary tract infection, you will often feel like you need to go to the bathroom. Do not ignore these feelings. Go to the bathroom right away and empty your bladder as much as you can. Doing so should help you to feel a little more comfortable when you are dealing with a UTI., This common over-the-counter medicine can help to relieve the burning pain that comes with urination when you have a UTI. Pyridium alkalinizes the urine to increase the pH of the urine so that the urine does not burn as much as it travels down the infected urethra.Follow the instructions for how much to take and how often. A common dose is 200 mg three times daily. You will only need to take pyridium for two days until it begins to take effect.
Do not take pyridium for more than two days without discussing it with your doctor.
This medication should only be taken by adolescents 16 and older and adults.
Keep in mind that this medication will cause your urine to turn bright orange. Some may also notice an orange tint to the eyes, and it may stain contact lenses.
Pyridium may interfere with certain lab tests, so let the technician or doctor know you are taking it before giving a urine sample., Wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear and clothing will make it less likely that moisture will get trapped in your underwear and make your infection worse.It will also make it easier for you to remove your pants and underwear if you have to go to the bathroom in a hurry. Furthermore, loose-fitting clothing will help you to feel more comfortable than wearing something tight.


Often times pelvic discomfort can occur with UTIs. Wearing nonrestrictive clothing will avoid excess pelvic pressure from occurring thus increasing comfort.

, Ask your doctor for recommendations on what to take and how much to help ease the pain that comes with a urinary tract infection. Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Motrin (ibuprofen) are good options.


Certain conditions make the use of over-the-counter painkillers unsafe (for instance, if you take blood thinners, then drugs like ibuprofen should be avoided). Talk to your doctor about other medications you are taking and conditions you might have.
Read and follow the package instructions for any over-the-counter medicine that you decide to take.
General recommendations for healthy adults is between 3,000 and 4,000 mg in 24 hours.

, A heating pad may help to reduce some of the pain and discomfort that you feel in your back and lower abdomen as a result of the urinary tract infection. Purchase an electric heating pad to apply to your lower back or abdomen for 10–15 minutes at a time.Make sure that you take breaks from using the heating pad. After you use it for 10–15 minutes. Take it off for an hour.
If you are using an electric heating pad, keep the heat set on low to avoid overheating.

Bring at least two types of photo identification.

,
Allow yourself a three-hour time window.,
Be ready for pre-screening.,
Prepare yourself for a brief pinch as the needle is inserted into your arm.",How to Donate Platelets2,", The physical donation process generally takes between 1.5 and 2.5 hours, and you will need to allow time before and after donating for paperwork, refreshments, and rest.

, You will fill out a health history form and have a confidential interview with a staff member. If everything is OK, you will be given a brief physical in which your pulse, temperature, blood pressure, and iron level are checked. These tests will see if it is safe for you to donate.

, For most donors, platelet donation is a painless process after this point. You may watch a movie, listen to music, or simply sit back and relax while you donate.


During this time, your blood will undergo a process called apheresis (also known as platelet pheresis). This means that whole blood will be drawn from your arm and passed through a machine called a plasmapheris device. The machine separates the platelets from other components of your blood. The non-platelet components are then returned to your body, usually accompanied by a saline solution.

"
"
Expect to be asked to sit down for 10-20 minutes after donating.,
Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for the rest of the day.,
Sign up to do it again!",How to Donate Platelets3," This is to ensure that you’re in okay shape before you leave. During this time you can take advantage of refreshments, if provided, to help get your blood sugar up.

, Low fluids/blood sugar increases your risk of passing out if you exercise, and the donation site in your arm risks being reopened if you lift heavy objects, giving you a painful bruise.

, As platelets do not keep for long outside of a body, a constant supply of them is needed. A person can donate up to 24 times per year.

Don't drink too much before you board the bus.,
See if the bus has a bathroom.,
See if the bus will pull over for rest stops.,
Go while you still have the chance.,

Sit with your legs uncrossed.,
Loosen tight clothing.,
Try not to move around too much.,
Read or watch something to distract yourself.,
Avoid coughing or laughing.,
Don't think about running water.,
Know that holding it for a long time won't hurt your bladder.,
Talk to the bus driver.,
See if you can discreetly pee into a container.,
Avoid peeing in your pants.,
If you do end up peeing in your pants, try to stay calm.",How to Control Your Bladder on a Bus," Staying hydrated is important for your health, but if you're about to board a bus for a long ride, it's wise not to chug water or any other liquid just before boarding. If you can't stand being thirsty, bring a water bottle and wet your mouth with tiny sips throughout your trip, rather than drinking it all at once.


Say no to that large latte or giant soda before you get on the bus! Caffeine is a diuretic, and will cause you to pee more often than usual. If you need your morning coffee, try to drink it well before it's time to get on the bus, so it has time to get through your system.
Even worse than caffeine is alcohol, which prompts your body to produce more urine than the same amount of water would do.Avoid drinking it in any form before or during your bus ride.;
, Most buses that will be traveling for more than a few hours have bathrooms these days. You can call ahead and ask the bus line you're traveling with just to make sure. The problem is that bus bathrooms are often less than clean, being very dirty at worst, as they aren't always cleaned for each new trip, and on a full bus there's frequently a line to use them. If the bus bathroom is very dirty, or if there is likely to be a line, then the best approach is to board armed with tips and tricks you can use to hold your bladder for as long as possible, and think of the bus bathroom as a backup you can use if you really have to go.

, On very long bus rides, there's usually a rest stop or two. Even if the bus doesn't have a usable bathroom, you'll eventually have somewhere to relieve yourself. Again, calling head to check on the situation will help you get mentally prepared. If you know when the next stop is going to be, it'll be easier to distract yourself for the allotted amount of time. If you have no idea when you'll get the opportunity to go, holding your pee will feel like endless torture.

, Remember when your parents made you pee before road trips, even if you didn't have to go? This is especially important when you're about to go on a long bus trip with few or no stops before the destination, and especially if there's not a bathroom on the bus. Take advantage of your last chance to use the bathroom at home so your bus ride will be as trouble-free as possible.

, For both men and women, the amount of urine that's released from your bladder is controlled by your pelvic floor muscles. The Knack maneuver is an exercise designed to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles so you'll have more control when it comes to urinating. If you're on a bus and you really need to go, doing the Knack maneuver can send a message to your brain telling it that now's not a good time to pee, and the urge will become less strong. Try this before your trip:Find your pelvic floor muscles. They're the muscles that tense up when you're holding your pee, or when you stop peeing mid-stream.
Tense the muscles, then cough at the same time. Keep the muscles tensed until you're done coughing, then release.
Repeat 10 to 15 times every day leading up to your bus trip.

, If you have a long trip coming up and you predict you're going to have trouble holding your bladder, there's no shame in protecting yourself in case of emergency! Head to the drugstore and pick out some protective supplies so you don't have an accident. Just make sure you put on the diaper before boarding the bus.


Adult diaper products were designed to help people deal with urinary incontinence, but they're commonly used by people with all sorts of needs, like brides with wedding dresses too puffy to remove for a bathroom break.
You can buy small protective pads similar to sanitary napkins or larger, full-coverage diapers depending on what you think you'll need.

, If you're standing up and you have the urge to pee, crossing your legs can help you hold it in, but when you're sitting down it's better to have your legs uncrossed. Pushing your thighs up toward your abdomen puts pressure on your bladder, so it'll make the urge to go worse. Keep your feet on the ground and your legs in a comfortable position.


Avoid leaning forward for the same reason. Lean your seat back if you can, and try to keep your torso straight and keep yourself from slouching.

, If you're wearing pants or a skirt with a tight waistband, your clothes could be making matters worse by putting pressure on your bladder. Make yourself as comfortable as possible by loosening your tight clothing.

If you're wearing a belt, unbuckle it. Unbutton or unzip your pants or skirt.






To hide the fact that you're unbuttoned, pull your shirt down or place a sweater or another item over your lap.







, Squirming around jostles your bladder and creates an urge that feels more extreme. You might want feel like tapping your feet or shifting from side to side, but that's just going to make matters worse. Try to get in a comfortable position and stay that way.

, This is one of the best ways to deal with having to pee on a bus. If there's really nowhere to go to the bathroom for the next hour or two, make the best of the situation by trying to forget about your uncomfortable physical state. Pick up your reading material or turn on a video absorbing enough to keep your mind off of your urge to relieve your bladder.

, Both of these actions can cause the pelvic floor muscles to give a little, making the urge to pee worse. You probably can't do much about it if you have a coughing fit, but you can make sure the book or video you choose isn't funny enough to make you laugh so hard you pee in your pants., Having an unbearable urge to pee is partly psychological, so thinking about whitewater rafting and spouting geysers really will make you feel worse! Let your mind dwell on deserts (without mirages) and other things that are dry. If you have a mean friend who thinks it's funny to sing ""Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls"" while you're trying to hold it in, tell him it won't be so funny if you pee in your seat right next to them.

, There's no chance that you're going to burst your bladder just by holding your pee for a long time, so let your mind be eased.If it gets to the point where your body can't hold it anymore, it will simply stop doing so. Hopefully by then you'll have gotten to a rest stop! If you fear the time has come and you're still sitting there wedged between a stranger and a window, read on.

, See if there's a chance the driver can stop the bus at a nearby rest stop so you can use the bathroom (other passengers will probably take advantage, too). Be careful not to distract the bus driver, though. It's important not to raise your voice or do anything that could create a dangerous situation.


It is possible that the bus driver will say no, and you'll just have to keep waiting. If it's a charter bus on a schedule the driver isn't going to be likely to want to pull over. Still, it's worth a try.
If the driver says no, ask when you'll be stopping next, so you can resume your seat at least knowing when you'll get to relieve yourself.

, When it comes, it comes, so have somewhere to put it. Cover your lap with a jacket or something and pee into a container of some kind. Choose one with a lid so you can keep things as sanitary as possible and close it up when you're done.


If your seatmate is a friend, have him or her stay positioned in front of you while you use the window seat to pee discreetly into the container.
Wait for a time when the bus is running over smooth highway and not driving through city streets and running over potholes.

, You wouldn't be reading this article if you saw peeing in your pants as a viable option, but it's worth pointing out that peeing on a bus seat is unsanitary and rude to your fellow passengers. If there's just no way you can avoid it, and you can't find a container fit to use, do your best to hold in as much as possible until the bus finally comes to a stop.

, If you panic, you'll attract attention to your wet pants, adding to your embarrassment. Simply stay where you are until the bus stops and wait for others to leave, then inform the driver you've had an accident. If there are still others on board who notice you peed in your pants, don't sweat it! You may never have to see them again.

You also can print off a registration form from the Donate Life website to fill out by hand and mail in.

, This state department operates a state donor registry with the names and contact information of all Wisconsin residents who want to donate their organs.To add your name to the registry, go to https://health.wisconsin.gov/donorRegistry/public/newSearchDonorRegistry.html and follow the instructions.
Registration isn't required to become an organ donor, but it is an added assurance that your intentions will be fulfilled. The donor registry is accessible by hospitals throughout the state.

, You can return to the donor registry website at any time if you need to add new contact information, or if you have decided for whatever reason that you no longer want to be an organ donor.Changing the registry doesn't change any of the information on your license or state identification card.

Consult an attorney.,
Mention organ donation in your living will and healthcare power of attorney.,
Tell people you want to donate your organs.",How to Become an Organ Donor in Wisconsin3," If you worked with an attorney to draft your estate planning documents, contact them and let them know that you want to update your documents to indicate your desire to be an organ donor.It typically isn't necessary to include organ donation in a will or trust, because your loved ones likely won't find these documents until it's already to late to donate your organs.
When you contact your attorney, they will let you know what documents need to be updated and how you should go about it.

, Your living will tells your loved ones what you want to happen if you are in the hospital on life support. Your healthcare power of attorney gives a specific person the power to make healthcare decisions for you if you are unconscious or unable to make those decisions on your own.If you have either, or both, of these documents, they should include organ donation.
If you don't have a living will and healthcare power of attorney, talk to an attorney about creating one. When you document your intentions in a living will or healthcare power of attorney, Wisconsin law requires any healthcare providers or family members involved in making your end-of-life decisions to honor those intentions.
You also should let the person you've named in these documents know that you are now registered as an organ donor. Give them a copy of the new documents for their records.

, Even after you've registered as an organ donor, your wishes may not be honored unless those around you know that you intend to donate your organs.It's a good idea to let your primary care physician and any other health care providers who treat you regularly that you've registered as an organ donor.
You also want to let close family know, particularly your spouse or parents. If you don't have a healthcare power of attorney, these are the people who will be making your end-of-life decisions. Let them know you want to donate your organs so there won't be any confusion.

Locate a bathroom.,
Find someone you trust.,
Analyze the wet spot.,
Freshen up.,
Wash yourself.,
Clean the mess.",How to Cope if You Wet Yourself in Public2," Casually look around and go to closest bathroom. Here, you will be able to efficiently analyze and deal with the situation.


Make sure not to draw attention to yourself. Walk casually to this location, for others might not even be aware of your troubles.

, Your ally can help you get to a bathroom unnoticed. They can provide you with clothes and or other solutions you may not have access to.


You may even find, after looking around the room, that you are surrounded by friends therefore panic is unwarranted.
If you can't find someone else to rely on, remember that you are your best ally. Trust in your capabilities that you can get through the situation independently and successfully.

, Figure out how noticeable your wet spot is, and what you will need to mend it. You may find it is not visible and no action is necessary. But you may also find the situation to be dire.


Take your time. If you look too fast you may over or underestimate how visible it is.

, Once in the bathroom, scrub out the accident as best you can. Most bathrooms include soap, water, and paper towels or hand dryer. These are the perfect tools to remove stain or smell from your clothes.


Remove the item of clothing that is blemished and scrub, by rubbing the material together, with soap and cold water in the sink. Then soak up the moisture with paper towels or a hand drier until the material is dry.
Scrub gently or aggressively depending on what kind of material is blemished.
If you feel uncomfortable removing any clothing, scrub out the urine as best you can and dry afterward with your clothing still on. A simple excuse of “I spilled something on myself” would also serve as an understandable explanation.

, Clean the skin that made contact with the urine using soap and water. This avoids future smell and the spread of bacteria.

, If your accident pooled on the ground/chair you should soak it up. It could give you away or someone could slip, so give it a quick clean.


Grab a good handful of paper towels from the bathroom. Lightly wet some of them with a little soap and water, but keep the rest dry. (If there are no paper towels, use toilet paper.) Soak up the mess, wipe it down with the wet towels, and dry with the rest of the towels.

To do this subtly you could use a foot to wipe down the mess. If someone notices, use a credible excuse.


Dump the dirty towels back in the bathroom trash and thoroughly wash your hand with soap and water.

Don’t panic.,
Have a sense of humor.,
Remember other embarrassing stories.,
Do not linger on the past.",How to Cope if You Wet Yourself in Public3," No matter how minuscule or grand the situation is, you may find yourself going into a stressful panic mode. This will only hurt you and may even draw attention to your accident which could have gone unnoticed.


To prevent panic from escalating breathe deeply with your diaphragm. Distract yourself with little games like counting how many outlets are in the room, or which objects are the color blue. Stress may have induced the accident in the first place.Stress Urinary Incontinence is a real thing, so take it easy.

, Laugh it off. You might find yourself in a situation where everyone in the room has watched you wet yourself, but if you don't let it bother you it won't bother others.


Emotions are contagious. If you express shame, sadness, or stress, those around you will react accordingly. By having a sense of humor you'll most likely get a positive reaction. Some studies have shown that smiling can make you happy. So even if you don’t feel happy, the act of smiling can provide a little relief. , Friends, family, and coworkers all have one.You make mistakes, you are human. This accident does not define you.

, If you stay in the present, you’ll recognize there is nothing to be embarrassed about. You do not live in that one moment.


Stop apologizing. This keeps your mind in the past, and it was simply an accident. You are in the present, and presently there is nothing to apologize for.

Pay attention to your body.,
Know your environment.,
Regulate your liquor intake.,
Wear absorbent products.,
Seek help from your doctor.",How to Cope if You Wet Yourself in Public4," If you need to go, go!


Even if you're in the middle of a conversation, leave. Others will understand and a difficult situation will be avoided.

, If you are in a situation where bathrooms will be hard to access, regulate your liquid intake.


Events like operas and plays may not let you leave the theatre.
Airplanes, concerts, and sports games are notorious situations for difficult access to bathrooms.

, Avoid drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time. Alcohol is a diuretic. That in combination with impaired judgment and a relaxed body can lead to a messy accident. Before you start drinking, note where the closest bathroom is.
Ask your friends to tell you when they are going to the bathroom and go with them. You may forget or not realize how badly you need to go.
Use a Blood Alcohol Calculator to determine exactly how drunk you are getting. You may not feel the effects of the liquor right away and continue to drink., Invest in adult diapers or sanitary napkins. It may feel uncomfortable or embarrassing, but it will catch leaking urine.


Adults wear diapers and sanitary napkins for a variety of different reasons that can cause bladder control issues:

Urinary infections
Prostate gland enlargement
Specific diseases (Parkinson’s, arthritis, dementia, etc.)
Pregnancy
Post-Menopause



, If this is a regular occurrence, you may have a medical condition such as Overactive Bladder. Your health provider may give you the help you need, and you won't have to continuously cope with wetting yourself.

Drink adequate water.,
Prepare a baking soda solution.,
Steer clear of bladder irritants.,
Sip some ginger tea.,
Use horseradish as a food garnish.,
Mix cream of tartar with warm water and lemon juice.",How to Cope and Deal With Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)2," Drinking plenty of water when you have a UTI can help your body to flush out bacteria;however, you may want to consult your doctor about how much water you should drink each day. Drinking too much water can dilute any antibiotics that your doctor has prescribed.

, Drinking a baking soda solution once per day may help to relieve the burning sensation that comes along with a UTI. Mix 1 tsp of baking soda into an 8 oz glass of water until the baking soda has dissolved. Then drink the whole glass. This solution will alkalinize the urine and decrease the pain as the urine passes.You may want to skip this treatment if you are on a low-sodium diet because baking soda has a high sodium content.

, While you are dealing with a UTI, avoid certain foods and drinks that may cause spasms of the bladder. Pass on coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and soft drinks that have caffeine and/or citrus flavors while you have a UTI. These foods and beverages may make your UTI worse., Ginger tea has anti-inflammatory properties and it may help to reduce some of the pain and discomfort caused by a urinary tract infection. Ginger inhibits prostaglandin release in much the same way as NSAIDs.You can buy ginger tea in the store or just pour a cup of boiling water over a few pieces of crushed ginger in a mug.

, Horseradish may help to kill the bacteria that cause a UTI. Add about a ½ teaspoon of freshly grated horseradish to food as a garnish or create a horseradish solution to drink. To create a solution, mix ½ teaspoon of grated horseradish with water.Eat or drink the horseradish, but be ready with a glass of milk to follow it up. Horseradish is very hot and you may need some milk to counter the sensation of heat.

, A mixture of cream of tartar, warm water, and lemon juice also has bactericidal properties. Mix 1 ½ teaspoon of cream of tartar with about one cup of warm water. Then, add a squeeze of lemon juice to the mixture. Drink the whole solution one to two times per day."

Your doctor will need to get a urine sample and perform a culture to be certain that it is a UTI and not something else. Some common symptoms of a UTI include:


Feeling a burning sensation when you go to the bathroom
Having the urge to urinate often, even if little or nothing comes out
Feeling pain or pressure in your back and/or lower abdomen
Producing cloudy, dark, bloody, and/or strange-smelling urine
Feeling tired and/or shaky
Having a fever and/or chills
Confusion (in older adults)

, If your doctor diagnoses you with a urinary tract infection, then you will need to follow your doctor’s treatment plan to ensure a quick and full recovery. Your doctor may prescribe anti-biotics, recommend a certain fluid intake, or advise against certain activities.

, In some cases, a UTI may not respond to treatment and may require a more aggressive treatment or even hospitalization. Some people are more susceptible to UTIs and may get one after another.Let your doctor know right away if your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse.

Determine if you are an eligible donor.,
Find a local blood bank or blood drive.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat a good meal.,
Bring your ID.,
Dress appropriately.",How to Donate Blood1," The basic requirements for donating blood are that you be at least 17 years of age, in good health, and weigh at least 110 pounds. In some states, you can donate blood when you are 16 as long as you have parental consent. Inquire at your local blood center about your eligibility. Some factors that may prevent you from being allowed to donate are:Pregnancy
Sexually transmitted diseases
Recent tattoos or body piercings
Certain medications
A cold or flu
Travel to certain international destinations
Organ or tissue transplants;
, Your best bet for donating blood is through the American Red Cross, which collects almost half of all blood donations in the US. Visit http://www.redcrossblood.org/give/drive/driveSearch.jsp to search for a Red Cross blood drive happening near you. Some other reputable organizations that collect blood include:


America's Blood Centers, a network of community-based, independent blood programs across North AmericaUnited Blood Services, a non-profit blood centre that serves 18 statesThe Armed Service Blood Program, a blood program for the United States Military with 20 locations worldwide, Staying hydrated is important when you are donating blood as it maintains circulation in your body and improves blood flow. Being well-hydrated can also prevent lightheadedness during your donation. Drink at least 16 oz. of water prior to donating blood, and avoid caffeine (i.e. coffee or caffeinated sodas), which can dehydrate you., Before donating blood, make sure to eat a healthy, well-balanced meal. Avoid overly fatty foods (such as French fries or ice cream), as high fat levels can affect testing of the blood you donate. Try to promote a healthy iron level in your diet during the weeks prior to your donation by eating foods like red meat, spinach, beans, fish, and poultry., People who have donated blood before should bring their blood donor card on the day they donate. Otherwise, bring two valid forms of picture ID. These include:Driver's license
State ID
Passport
Immigration and Naturalization Service card (green card)
Student ID
Military ID
Employee ID

, On the day of your donation, wear clothing that will facilitate the process. Sleeves that fall above the elbow, or that can be rolled above the elbow, are a must. Alternatively, dress in layers that will allow you to free up your arm by removing something during your donation."
"
Divulge your medical information.,
Make sure that you are comfortable.,
Rest up.,
Take care of your arm.,
Replenish fluids.",How to Donate Blood2," Prior to donating, you will be given a quick assessment which will include a confidential interview about your medical history. You will also be given a very brief physical to check blood pressure, pulse, and hemoglobin level. Be sure to bring a list of any prescription medications you are taking, and disclose all relevant details about your health (e.g. past conditions, history of fainting)., The process of giving blood will take about 8-10 minutes, during which one pint of blood (and a few extra test tubes of it) will be collected. Ensure that you are calm and comfortable by telling the trained healthcare professional whether you would prefer to sit or lie down during the donation, and if there is an arm you'd prefer to have the blood taken from.Bring an ipod, reading material, or your smart phone to keep you entertained while you stay still for those 8-10 minutes.

, Following your blood donation, sit and rest for 15 minutes- most blood drives will have a designated rest area with chairs and snacks for donors. Avoid strenuous activity for approximately five hours after donating (e.g. cardiovascular exercise, heavy lifting). If you feel dizzy or lightheaded over the next 24 hours, lie down and put your feet up until the feeling passes.Avoid any activities where you could be injured if you faint for the next 24 hours.For example, you should avoid using power tools because you could injure yourself if you faint while using them.

, Keep the bandage that is applied to your arm post-donation on for at least five hours. However, if a wrap bandage was applied, then remove it within one hour and leave the strip bandage on.If you experience any pain in your arm or swelling around the puncture site, apply ice to it. If you experience bleeding, apply pressure to the spot and raise your arm above your head until it stops.Wash the area around the bandage with soap and water to avoid a rash.

, Take care to replenish your body's fluids for 24-48 hours after your donation. Drink an extra four glasses of water or non-caffeinated fluids during the day to properly rehydrate. Avoid alcohol for at least 8 hours after donating blood."

Find a location.,
Contact the Red Cross.,
Partner with a local business.,
Recruit donors.",How to Donate Blood3," Blood drives are generally organized on behalf of an organization that serves approximately 200 or more people, such as a corporation, school, or religious group. If you are taking the initiative on your own, approach one of these groups, or a community group or local representatives, to propose the idea. If the organization you affiliate with does not have a location to hold the blood drive in, look for one that is safe, clean, easily-accessible, and large enough to provide a comfortable waiting area for donors. Some suitable venues might be:School gymnasiums
Church basements
Community centers
A public square

, To start planning a blood drive in your area, register with the American Red Cross to get free information about the process. Visit http://www.redcrossblood.org/forms/register-host-blood-drive-0 to fill out a questionnaire requiring your basic contact information, the name and nature of the organization you are planning on behalf of, and whether you were referred by someone. You will also be asked to indicate if you have held a blood drive before.


Upon receipt and consideration of your application, a Red Cross representative will contact you to discuss the blood drive.

, Try approaching a local business for support for your blood drive. An affiliated business could donate to the cause (e.g. a local grocery store donating snacks and juice) or offer discounts or deals to the donors who participate in your blood drive. In exchange, the business will receive the kind of exposure that comes with local sponsorship.Visit a business that you have in mind, ask to speak to the owner or manager, and say something like: ""I am organizing a blood drive on behalf of the local community centre to benefit our city. I was wondering if you would be willing to join our cause?""

, Advertise the blood drive to recruit donors. Tell friends, family, and colleagues about the event, and share it on social media (e.g. creating a publicly-shared event on Facebook). Visit the Red Cross website at http://www.redcrossblood.org/hosting-blood-drive/-coordinators-toolkit/flyers-and-tools for templates for flyers and posters that you can print out and hang up around your area."

Stock up on fresh vegetables.,
Bring home herbs, like parsley.,
Eat more garlic.,
Consume more onions.,
Prepare your foods appropriately.,
Stop consuming processed junk food.,
Satisfy your temptations to cheat with healthy alternatives.",How to Cleanse Your Kidneys1," This cleanse is less intensive than juice-only cleanses. You’ll simply be cutting certain things out of your diet and adding others for a certain amount of time. You need to consider the following when planning your dietary cleanse:


Your calorie needs.
You’ll likely be consuming more food per volume than normally, since many fresh vegetables have fewer calories than the foods you’ll be cutting out.
In order for the cleanse to work, you need to stay away from listed foods and consume primarily fruits and vegetables.;
, You’ll be cutting out unhealthy and processed foods that challenge your kidneys and bring in nutrients and chemicals that you want to get rid of. Many of the foods you’ll be cutting out increase levels of uric acid and as a result tax your kidneys. The foods you’ll be cutting out include:Animal protein
Processed food
Foods high in phosphorous or calcium, like dairy and nuts
Foods that are mainly made of carbohydrates

, You’ll be focusing on foods that will introduce nutrients and vitamins to your body that will increase the efficiency of your kidneys and help purge unwanted nutrients and chemicals. Foods you’ll be focusing on include:


Fresh vegetables
Fresh fruits
Organic fruits, vegetables, and other foods that are free from pesticides and other harmful additives

, You need to increase your water intake to the appropriate amount. Most people walk around in a state of limited dehydration. This taxes your kidney and liver, and makes you more sluggish and tired. Drinking the appropriate amount of water will increase kidney function and help flush out unwanted chemicals and nutrients.Increase water intake to eight 8-oz cups of water (2 liters).Water should be filtered or spring water.Drink throughout the day., Some people even choose to eat only fruit. That's because fruits are highly recommended during the whole process of detoxification thanks to their abundance of nutrients. Not only are they great for your system, they'll also fight that sluggish feeling you'll undoubtedly be combating. There are a wide variety of fruits and vegetables you’ll be able to use for your cleanse. Here's where to start:Apples have a lot of fiber and vitamin C which are known to be antioxidants and help in the fight of toxins in the blood.
Lemons are also one of the popular fruits that are used because they have the ability to increase citrate levels which decreases kidney stone formation.
That being said, just about any watery fruit is fair game (though coconut flesh, avocado, and rhubarb should be avoided). And, as always, the fresher, the better.

, Fresh vegetables will be a very important part of your dietary cleanse. Most vegetables contain decent amounts of fiber and have nutrients and vitamins that will aid your kidneys during your cleanse. You can choose most any vegetable, but remember that you’ll be consuming a lot more than you typically do.

, Herbs are also used to help in the cleansing of the kidneys and one very popular herb is parsley. Parsley in particular is good, as it is considered to be a diuretic — something that makes you pee more. The more you pee, the more toxins or waste products are removed from the body. In other words, the more effective your cleanse.


Parsley can be eaten raw or made into a juice or tea.
Infuse it into your water or tea for easy intake that you'll barely notice.
You can also look to cilantro and other herbs that might be available locally.

, Garlic may stimulate urine production and may aid in flushing out toxins from the kidneys. It contains allicin, which oxidizes heavy metals and makes them more soluble in water, meaning that it can help to flush out toxins. There are several ways you can increase your garlic intake:


Eat garlic raw.
Add garlic to your recipes when cooking.
Take garlic supplements.

, The polyphenolic compounds in onion may help to dissolve kidney stones. Its polyphenol content is higher compared to various other vegetables. Like garlic, there are several ways you can increase your onion intake.


Eat raw onions — try adding them to a salad.
Add onions to other food.
Take onion supplements.

, You’ll gain the most nutrients and vitamins from fruits and vegetables when they are eaten either raw or lightly cooked. Avoid cooking your fruits or vegetables long. Consider the following tips:


Eat fresh and raw when you can.
Avoid cooking your fruits or vegetables until they lose their color or change color.
Don’t add oils or salt.
Avoid the temptation to add butter or sauces to your food.

, Eating too much fatty and salty food will make the kidneys work harder. If there's a lot of waste in your blood, the kidneys have more work to do. The more you consume pure, healthy stuff, the easier of a time you'll be giving your kidneys.

, You should stick primarily to fresh fruits and vegetables, but if you need to there are healthy alternatives, rich in fats and carbohydrates that you can consume. Consider the following:


Nuts.
Oat bran.
Whole wheat products.

Use a sterile needle, tweezers or a rotable medical device for ingrown hairs to gently tease the hair out of the skin.",How to Remove an Ingrown Hair1," Use the warm compress first––this should bring the hair to the surface––don't dig for the hair if you can't easily get at it. Don't pluck the hair out completely if you can avoid doing so; just make sure that the ingrown end is out of the skin. It may take a little time to coax the hair out, so persevere and do not cut the skin.


Sometimes you'll see a loop of the hair close to the surface of the skin. This means that the tip of the hair has begun growing down into the skin. If you get a needle in the loop and tug lightly, the end will often come loose.
If you choose to use tweezers, remember that tweezers can be bought either pointy or flat-tipped. A pointy-tipped pair may cause less damage to the skin around the hair if used carefully. Another choice might be to use a rotable medical device for ingrown hairs which does not damage the follicle or the surrounding skin.;

Realize that more than one reason may be at work.",How to Control Bladder Spasms," Performing Kegel exercises, also called pelvic floor exercises, can help to strengthen your pelvic muscles, which provide support for your bladder.Men can do Kegel exercises too!To begin strengthening your pelvic floor muscles, you first need to identify the right muscles.When you urinate, use your muscles to stop the flow of urine midstream. If you can do this, you have identified one of the muscles involved with pelvic and bladder support.Do not continue to stop your urine flow, as this can increase the likelihood of developing other problems including urinary tract infections.Another way to identify the right muscles is to imagine that you are trying to prevent from passing gas in a public place. Squeezing those muscles identifies the right muscles you need to exercise to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.;
, Your doctor or a physical therapist can help you find other ways to properly identify the muscles you need to exercise in order to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.Once you are clear on the right muscles, take care not to contract, or squeeze, other muscles when you are doing your exercises. Contracting other muscles can put more pressure on your bladder.Also avoid holding your breath while you are doing your exercises., If your doctor agrees that this form of exercise might help, perform your pelvic exercises three times each day, and in three different positions.


Perform your exercises while lying down, sitting, and standing.Hold each squeeze for about three seconds, then relax for three seconds. Try to reach 10 to 15 repeats of the same exercise in each position.As you become more comfortable with these exercises, extend the length of the contraction., It may take as long as two months to start seeing a difference in the frequency or severity of your bladder spasms.Remember, strengthening your pelvic muscles through exercise may only be one part of an effective treatment plan to reduce, or get rid of, your bladder spasms.

, Keep track of the time of day when you most often have spasms, or leak urine. Develop a schedule of times throughout the day to urinate. Maintain this schedule for a few weeks to be sure you are emptying your bladder frequently enough to avoid spasms and leakage.Gradually extend the time between voiding. This will gradually train your bladder to hold a little more urine, strengthening the muscles to prevent the spasms.Avoid drinking fluids within two hours of bedtime to help control of your bladder during the night., Some foods can trigger bladder spasms. Pay close attention to the foods you eat, and eliminate items that seem to be triggers for you.Foods that are highly acidic, such as citrus fruits and tomatoes, and foods that are spicy have been associated with triggering bladder spasms.Chocolate and foods or beverages that contain artificial sweeteners may also trigger bladder spasms., Beverages that have high levels of caffeine, such as coffee, tea, and soft drinks can lead to spasms. So can beverages that have high acid content, such as citrus fruit juices.Alcoholic beverages and those with caffeine can cause your bladder to fill quickly, leading to leakage and spasms.Beverages that contain large amounts of citrus fruits can be irritating to your bladder, and lead to bladder spasms.
Try spacing out what you drink over the day, rather than drinking a large quantity in a short period of time., Harsh soaps and the ingredients in bubble baths have been reported to trigger bladder spasms.The ingredients in bubble bath products and soaps that contain fragrances or harsh ingredients can be irritating to your bladder, and lead to spasms.

, Being overweight puts added pressure on your bladder. Talk with your doctor to determine a healthy weight loss program to aid in controlling your bladder spasms., In addition to being bad for your health in general, smoking irritates your bladder muscles. ""Smoker's cough,"" a chronic cough caused by lung irritation due to smoking, can also trigger bladder spasms and can cause leaking.Talk to your doctor about smoking cessation programs. You can also refer to Quit Smoking for more tips.

, Some medications are approved for use in helping to provide control of your bladder. Some agents work to prevent leakage, and other work to control the unwanted muscle contractions or spasms.Anticholinergics are bronchodilators, which means they work to stop certain muscles from tightening. For bladder spasms, they help reduce involuntary bladder contraction.The medications in this class include propantheline, oxybutynin, tolterodine tartrate, darifenacin, trospium, and solifenacin succinate.These medications may cause dry mouth and other side effects, include constipation, blurred vision, heartbeat irregularities, and drowsiness.
Tricyclic antidepressants may be used in some cases, since they have anticholinergic aspects.The most commonly prescribed include imipramine hydrochloride and doxepin. These agents help to control the smooth muscle tissue in the bladder.Alpha blockers can be prescribed to reduce overactive bladder symptoms by decreasing bladder contractions and relaxing muscles. Common agents are prazosin and phenoxybenzamine., All drugs have side effects and many can interact with other drugs. The interactions can be serious in many cases.By working with your doctor, your existing drug regimen will be considered as your doctor considers safely adding new agents that can help to manage your bladder spasms., Use them only with caution. There is little to no evidence that supports the effectiveness of using herbal and alternative remedies to treat bladder spasms. Always consult your doctor before using herbal and alternative therapies as they can cause problems with your prescribed medications and existing medical conditions.Few studies in humans have been done to measure the effectiveness of alternative and herbal remedies to help control bladder problems, including spasms.Some small evidence is available for Japanese and Chinese herbs, but the results are very limited and not adequate to support recommending their use for this problem., Several studies suggest that bladder-specific acupuncture can bring relief to people with overactive bladder and spasms.Ask your doctor for a referral to a licensed acupuncturist with knowledge of bladder conditions.


Most states require acupuncturists to be licensed through the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). Finding a licensed acupuncturist will help ensure that you receive appropriate care.Keep your doctor informed of alternative therapies you're trying. This way, all of your healthcare providers can work in conjunction with each other to provide you with the best possible care.

, Electrical stimulation devices, similar to a TENS unit, can sometimes be used to help stimulate the nerves or the muscles in a routine manner to prevent the sudden spasms.Usually, this form of treatment is not considered a first-line treatment option.Many of the devices require minor surgery to implant the actual device and find proper placement for the electrodes.Interventions of this type are most often used to control bladder problems that may or may not be directly related to spasms. Common use of electrical stimulation devices are for conditions such as overactive bladder syndrome, stress incontinence, and urinary urge incontinence., The surgical procedure options to control your bladder spasms or related bladder problems are based on the underlying cause of the problem. Your doctor can best advise you on the risks and benefits of proceeding with a surgical procedure.Surgical interventions for bladder spasms are only recommended in people that suffer from severe detrusor muscle over-activity, meaning severe and painful episodes of bladder spasms, and in those that have not responded to other treatment options., The bladder is controlled by several muscle groups. Those groups include the sphincter muscles, the abdominal wall muscles, and one additional muscle that is part of the bladder itself.The most common culprit behind bladder spasms is the detrusor smooth muscle, which is the main muscle composing the bladder wall.The detrusor muscle consists of smooth muscle fibers that are part of the wall of the bladder. The detrusor muscle contracts, along with the abdominal wall muscles, to empty the contents of the bladder into the urethra.However, all of the muscle groups are involved in emptying the bladder and may be a part of the problem, so you should see your doctor for a full diagnosis.The sphincter muscle provides a tightening at the opening of the bladder to prevent urine from passing. When the brain signals the muscles that it is time to release urine from the bladder, the sphincter muscle relaxes to allow the urine flow to pass through the urethra.The urethra is the tube that connects your bladder to the outside.The muscles of the abdominal wall are in a relaxed state when the bladder is empty and as it gradually fills with urine. The abdominal wall muscles gently expand as the bladder expands.The abdominal wall muscles and the sphincter muscles work together to provide bladder control. When the brain says it is time to release urine, the abdominal wall muscles contract, or tighten, and press on the bladder to force the urine into the urethra.The muscles and the nervous system work together to effectively communicate with the brain and provide voluntary control over emptying your bladder. A problem with any of the muscles or nerves involved can contribute to bladder spasms., The nerves that are built into the bladder area are part of a complex communication pathway that sends messages to, and receives messages from, the brain.Nerves that are part of the bladder and abdominal wall area tell the brain when the bladder is full and it needs to be emptied.
This is translated as a feeling of pressure that lets you know it is time to release the urine stored in the bladder.Damaged nerves can send signals to the muscles to contract at the wrong time, causing spasms.Some medical conditions that interfere with nerve signals that involve bladder contraction include diabetes, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.Other conditions that cause the nerves to be damaged are back surgery, pelvic conditions or surgery, back problems such as herniated discs, and radiation exposure., Bladder or kidney infections can cause the muscles to suddenly spasm. The irritation from the infection cues the bladder muscles to squeeze or contract, resulting in a spasm. A urinary tract infection is temporary. The bladder control problems resolve once the infection is properly treated.If you feel you may have a bladder or kidney infection, seek medical treatment as soon as possible to obtain a prescription for the appropriate antibiotic to treat the infection.
Symptoms of a urinary tract infection include a strong and frequent urge to urinate, passing small amounts of urine, a burning sensation or pain when urinating, cloudy, discolored, or visible blood in the urine, strong smelling urine, and pelvic pain., Some medications can cause bladder spasms. Talk to your doctor if you are taking medications for other conditions that might be contributing to your bladder spasms.


Not every medication causes problems. Even the drugs that might cause problems do not cause them in every person.
Do not stop or alter any of your medications. Talk with your doctor about your bladder spasms and your current medication regimen.
If you are taking a drug that might be contributing to the bladder spasms, dose adjustments under the direction of your doctor might help while still providing control of your medical condition.
Examples of medications that can cause bladder control problems include drugs prescribed that help you to relax, manage symptoms of anxiety, help you to sleep at night, muscle relaxers, diuretics, or medications used to treat nerve damage including conditions like fibromyalgia., In many cases, the use of catheters either inserted by healthcare professionals or those that can be self-inserted, can cause bladder spasms.Your body recognizes the catheter as a foreign substance and contracts or spasms in an effort to remove it.Talk to your healthcare provider to select a catheter that is as comfortable as possible, is the proper size, and is made of materials that may be less irritating., In some cases, more than one possible cause of your bladder spasms may be contributing to your bladder spasms.


For example, you may have weakened muscles or mildly damaged nerves but no problems with bladder spasms. Becoming overweight or drinking caffeinated beverages, combined with the weakened muscles or damaged nerves, may be enough to cause you to develop bladder spasms.Recognizing that several factors can be causing your bladder spasms can help you to work towards resolution of this problem by implementing a combination of different approaches to treatment.

Add wheatgrass juice.",How to Cleanse Your Kidneys2," Ensure that you do not eat solid food. Eliminating solid food is thought to help your body to focus on flushing the toxins out rather than digesting what comes in. While this might be challenging, the whole point of the juice cleanse is to give your kidneys some time to rest.

, Some people suggest sticking to only one juice during your cleanse, while others say drinking several different juices throughout the day is more healthy. This is a decision you need to make for yourself. Consider:


If you do decide to go with just one type of juice, make sure to review if that juice is appropriate for a prolonged amount of time.
By drinking different fruit and vegetable juices, you will come closer to getting your required amounts of nutrients and vitamins.
By sticking to one juice, you might save money and you might save time by being able to prepare more juice at one time.
Your juices should be fresh and free of additives and preservatives.

, The diuretic properties of watermelon may aid in producing more urine. This helps in the removal of more wastes from your body. Watermelon may help to wash away toxins in your kidneys as it is high in potassium.


Juice two cups of watermelon.
Add a teaspoon of lime juice.
You can drink the juice two or three times a day. Some people prefer watermelon juice as their sole juice., Lemon juice may be very effective in cleansing your kidneys. The citric content in lemons may reduce the level of calcium in your urine, thereby reducing the risk of kidney stones.


Juice a small lemon.
Add it to a cup of warm water.
Drink it in the morning on an empty stomach., Radish juice may prevent the formation of kidney stones and is thought to be able to remove existing kidney stones. The diuretic properties of radish may help kidneys to effectively process waste and improve urine flow.


Take a cup of radish pieces and put them in a juicer.
After extracting the juice, you may add some honey to taste.
Drink this juice once a day., Consider blackcurrant juice as part of your juice mix during your cleanse. Blackcurrant juice may aid in treating uric acid stones. The alkalizing effect of blackcurrant may aid in acidifying urine and treating urinary tract infections. You’ll only want to drink this once a day., Carrot juice is a great all-around juice for your cleanse. The carotene content in carrot may aid in preventing kidney stone formation. It is also rich in other vitamins and nutrients that will help you.


Take three carrots and wash them thoroughly in running water.
Cut them and juice them well.
Add water to liquefy the juice before you drink. Drink this mixture once a day.
If you're going to rely on carrot juice as your sole juice, consider mixing up your recipes and adding celery, kale, or other vegetables for important vitamins and nutrients., The diuretic properties of cucumber may aid in flushing uric acid. As a result, cucumber juice will help dissolve kidney stones and improve overall kidney health.


Keep the skin on if it was grown organically (but make sure you wash it), remove it if it was not.
Take three to four cups of cucumber pieces and juice them.
Drink this juice once or twice a day., Grapes are rich in potassium, which ensures that toxin-free blood is passed through the kidneys. Grape juice is also readily available in many types of varieties, and buying store-bought grape juice might save you time and money.


Don't rely on grape juice as a single juice cleanse, but drink it perhaps once a day or every other day.
Those on a dialysis are not supposed to have foods rich in potassium, so avoid grape juice if this is the case.
If you’re going to be drinking store-bought grape juice, make sure to get juice that is free from refined sugars and other additives.
Feel free to experiment with different varieties of grapes., Parsley contains a number of nutrients and vitamins that will aid in your cleanse. Specifically, parsley is rich in apiol and myristicin and will help increase urine production and may aid in flushing out germs through the urine, thereby cleansing your kidneys.Try drinking parsley juice once a day.


Take a handful of parsley leaves, clean them well and add two glasses of water.
Boil the parsley and water mix for roughly 10 minutes.
Filter the liquid and drink once a day., Wheatgrass is a rich source of alkaline minerals, which means that the juice may help to cleanse your kidneys. It is thought to flush out toxic metals including cadmium and mercury.


Try drinking wheatgrass juice once or twice a day.
Juice a handful of wheatgrass.
Add water to dilute the juice if you like.
To enhance the taste, juice a few pieces of apple along with the wheatgrass."

Consult your doctor.,
Determine your daily calorie needs.,
Choose the duration of your cleanse.,
Avoid caffeine.,
Avoid alcohol.,
Consider taking supplements during your cleanse.",How to Cleanse Your Kidneys3," Before you do start a kidney cleanse, you should consult your physician in order to make sure that a cleanse will be alright for you. Cleanses are not necessarily right for all people at all times, so you need to clear this with a professional.


Juice cleanses can be very difficult to do and the body may go into variety of stages during the process. Headaches and fatigue may be noted initially as the toxins are being flushed out. Towards the end of the cleanse, increased energy is noted.
This time should be used to think about goals. Limit stressful exercise — try going for walks or doing gentle yoga. Avoid anything that exerts a lot of energy, like running.

, Before starting the detox, you need to determine how many calories and what sort of nutrition you will need. Consult your doctor about your minimum needs during your cleanse.


Calorie needs vary based on your lifestyle, age, level of activity, weight loss goals, and other individual factors.Most adult men need between 2,400–2,600 calories per day to maintain their weight.
Most adult women need 2,000–2,200 calories per day to maintain their weight.

, Kidney cleansing can be done safely anywhere from three days to seven days about once or twice a year. Keep in mind that it's unwise to cleanse for any longer. Kidney cleanses depart from the idea of a balanced diet and are meant only to be temporary. If you've never done it before, it's advised to begin with three days.

, Foods and liquids with caffeine increase calcium oxalate or uric acid in the kidneys and could lead to the development of kidney stones in some cases. The caffeine puts your kidneys on overdrive and leads to more work, with less effective waste removal overall. This is why sticking to water is your best bet.


Don't forget that some teas and chocolate have caffeine, too.
Rhubarb is also a source of caffeine.
Before you consume anything, make sure it's caffeine-free; it may contain the stuff and you don't even know it., While an increase in liquid intake is advised, alcohol should be avoided. Alcohol is a toxin that poisons the blood. It messes with your system and, in abundance, can wreak havoc on your body (and mind). Stick to water and tea to give your kidneys the vacation they need.

, Certain supplements will increase the efficiently of your kidneys and help purge unwanted chemicals and nutrients. While supplements can help your cleanse, they are not required, and you should consult your doctor before taking them.Vitamin C
Vitamin B12
Curcumin
Silymarin

Apply a warm, moist compress to the area for a few minutes.",How to Remove an Ingrown Hair3," This will soften the skin.


Just wet a washcloth with hot water, wring it out, and press it against the ingrown hair. When the washcloth cools down, run it under hot water again.
If you can see the ingrown hair embedded in the skin, this treatment will soften the hair and bring it closer to the surface. If you can't initially see the hair, leave the warm compress on until it rises to the skin's surface.
If you apply the compress for ten minutes, and you still can't see any sign of hair, you're not going to be able to remove it yourself, or it might be something else altogether. And while you're fretting over your skin, this might be a good time to Check for Skin Cancer.

Take precautions to prevent UTIs from forming.",How to Choose the Right Cranberry Supplement," Vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements are sold at a variety of stores and locations (you can even buy them online); however, since these (along with all other supplements) are not regulated by the FDA, you need to be careful where you buy them.Avoid purchasing supplements online. You may not be familiar with the company and cannot physically pick up the supplement and review all the information on the packaging. Many websites can provide deceiving information and it's best to choose a store instead.
You can purchase cranberry supplements at pharmacies, grocery stores and health food stores. It might be beneficial to purchase a supplement from a pharmacy or grocery store that has a pharmacy. You can ask the pharmacist whether or not that particular supplement is appropriate for you given your current health conditions and medications.
Look for supplements that have been evaluated by an outside company. Supplements that are verified by U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF International, and ConsumerLab.com have been tested to prove that they contain the amount of the ingredient as advertised on the label and that they are free of harmful substances.;
, With any medication or supplement, it's essential to the read the label. This is where you will find the ingredients, dosage and instructions for consumption.


First look at the ingredients. Is it truly a cranberry supplement? Or are there other ingredients included?
Look for a supplement, ideally, that's made from the cranberry juice, not the skins. This has more of the antioxidants (known as proanthocyanidins) needed to prevent bacteria growth.Depending on what your goal is, there are varying levels of recommended doses. Make sure you purchase a cranberry supplement in the right dose for your needs.
Review the serving size and how to take your cranberry supplement. You might need to take one tablet or a few tablets to meet the recommended dose. Also note whether you should take the supplement with or without food.

, A very common form of cranberry supplement is in a tablet form.These can be found at most pharmacies and health food stores.


Many health professionals recommend this form as they do not have as much sugar or as many calories as regular cranberry juice or the powdered supplements. This is helpful if you need to watch your overall calorie or sugar intake.
Make sure to read the label to see whether or not the supplement uses the extract from the skins or the juice.
A 1 gram tablet of concentrated cranberry extract may help prevent UTIs. 240 mg may help reduce lipid levels and prevent H. Pylori.

, In addition to tablets, another common form of cranberry supplements is in a powdered form. It mixes into beverages easily and gives them a little bit of flavor.Like a cranberry tablet, the powder can provide all the same benefits. This can be even more useful as you need to add it to liquid which can help you drink more fluid during the day.
Again, make sure the the supplement uses extracts from the juice, not the skins.
Some powders may have some added sugar to them. Read the label to make sure they fit within your dietary guidelines.

, Although cranberry juice isn't necessarily a supplement (as a pill or powder form is), it can be used as an alternative to taking a pill or powdered cranberry supplement. Drinking cranberry juice generally results in similar benefits to taking a supplement.To help prevent UTIs, drink about 3 – 6 oz of pure cranberry juice or 10 oz of cranberry juice cocktail daily. For other health issues like preventing H. Pylori or lowering your cholesterol, you may only need about 2 oz of cranberry juice daily, however a higher volume like 6 oz is acceptable.Be careful with cranberry juices. 100% cranberry juice is quite sour, so most food manufacturers add sweeteners (like sugar) which can increase the sugar and calorie content. Look for either 100% juice or diet cranberry which may add a no-calorie sweetener instead of sugar.
Cranberry juice is also a little more cost effective and easy to find compared to cranberry supplements.

, When you purchase a cranberry supplement, you'll most likely notice there are a variety of brands available. In addition to reviewing the dosing amount and ingredients, it's also important to look where the supplement was actually manufactured.


Some studies have shown that supplements manufactured outside of the US may contain some toxic or harmful ingredients. Other countries do not have the same manufacturing laws and regulations as the US and you may end up ingesting something that is banned or prohibited in the US.Look for the ""Country of Origin"" label or ""Manufactured In"" label. This will tell you exactly where the supplement was made. You may want to avoid products made in China or Mexico; however, supplements made in Canada, the US or even the EU may be appropriate.

, Any time you want to start taking a dietary supplement, it's essential to speak to your doctor first. You want them to be informed of what you're taking and make sure he thinks it's safe for you.


Talk to your doctor about the safety of adding a cranberry supplement to your weekly routine. It's best to bring the supplement with you so your doctor can see the dosage, form and other ingredients in the supplement.
Talk to your doctor about why you want to take this supplement. For example, is it for UTI prevention? Your doctor may also give you other tips to prevent UTIs as well.
Make sure to inform you doctor of any other medications or health conditions you have. Cranberry juice and supplements can interact with certain medications.

, There have been many, many studies done on cranberry juice supplements on a wide variety of health conditions. The dosage and type of supplement you take may vary based on the benefit you need.Cranberry supplements and juice are most commonly used to prevent or treat UTIs. There is good evidence to support the prevention of UTIs with cranberry supplements. However, there is little evidence supporting the treatment of UTIs with supplements.
One popular use for cranberry supplements is to lower lipid or cholesterol levels. There is very minimal evidence supporting this.
You may also consider using cranberry supplements to prevent stomach ulcer formation from the H. Pylori bacteria. There is moderate evidence to support this.
There is very little evidence to support the use of cranberry supplements for the following: diabetes management, oral health management, prevention of metabolic syndrome and prostate health.

, Each type of supplement will come with specific dosing instructions. It's important to read the label thoroughly and figure out how much to take of your cranberry supplement.


On the supplement fact panel (found on the bottle or box) you'll find the serving size information. If it's a capsule or tablet, it may say something like ""1 tablet per serving"" or ""2 capsules per serving.""
Make sure you take the amount recommended to help you either prevent a UTI, reduce the likelihood of having an H. Pylori infection or lower your cholesterol levels.
Do not take more than the recommended serving daily. A higher dose won't necessarily provide any additional benefits. It may also cause more side effects or interfere with other medications you're taking.

, All supplements have the potential to cause unwanted side effects. You could experience mild headaches or nausea. However, they may also interfere with other medications to cause side effects. Monitor for any changes while you take cranberry supplements.


Most health professionals find cranberry supplements to be safe for most healthy adults. In addition, many studies have shown little to few side effects associated with supplements.High doses of either cranberry supplements or cranberry juice have been associated with an increased risk of developing kidney stones due to the oxalate content.
Large quantities of cranberry juice, especially 100% cranberry juice, have been occasionally associated with stomach upset and diarrhea.
If you notice any of these symptoms, stop your cranberry supplements and talk to your doctor.

, Although cranberry supplements may help prevent a UTI from forming, it should not be used to treat a current UTI. Do not take it if you feel you have a current infection.


Cranberry supplements have been thought to acidify the urine which was thought to prevent UTIs from forming; however, recent research shows that its the components of cranberry juice that help prevent the bacteria from sticking to cell surfaces and causing an infection.There is no research or evidence supporting that cranberry supplements help treat a current UTI. It should not be taken if you already have been diagnosed with an infection.
If you think you have a UTI, talk to your doctor immediately and set up an appointment to do a urine test. If you test positive for a UTI, the only treatment is antibiotics.

, Taking cranberry supplements may help prevent a UTI from forming, but so can other dietary habits. One in particular is drinking adequate fluids. Make sure to drink consistently throughout the day if you're susceptible to getting UTIs.


Most health professionals recommend drinking at least 64 oz (2 liters) of clear, hydrating fluids each day; however, if you're susceptible to UTIs, you may want to consider aiming for 80 – 100 oz (2.3 — 3 liters) of fluids daily.
The more water you drink, the more diluted your urine will be. In addition, it'll ensure that you urinate more frequently which helps flush the bacteria from your urinary tract.Do not drink sugary or sweetened beverages. Stick to clear, no calorie fluids like: water, sparkling water, flavored water or decaf coffee and tea.

, In addition to taking cranberry supplements or drinking cranberry juice, you can also get some of the same health benefits from cranberries themselves. Try incorporating cranberries into your diet as an additional source of healthful antioxidants.


Cranberries can be purchased in fresh, frozen or dried form. All of these forms will have those health-boosting and UTI preventing antioxidants and vitamins.
If you choose dried cranberries, try to find those that do not have added sugar to them. You can sprinkle them on yogurt, oatmeal, or salad, or mix them into a homemade trail mix.
Fresh and frozen cranberries can be used interchangeably. You can eat them raw, but they are quite tart. Cooked down and added to desserts or made into a sauce works well.

, Another supplement that could help aid in the prevention of UTIs is a probiotic. These ""good bacteria"" have been shown to not only help aid with stomach issues, but may also be beneficial to the urinary tract.Health professionals note that there are bacteria in the urinary tract (like the urethra) and generally they are the ""good"" bacteria; however, these areas can contain unhealthy and infection-causing bacteria which end up causing a UTI.
An increased amount of the healthy or good bacteria can help prevent the overgrowth of the UTI-causing bacteria.
You can take a probiotic supplement or consider purchasing yogurt or kefir that also contain a high quantity of probiotics.

, In addition to diet and supplements, there are some good hygiene habits that can help prevent UTIs from forming. Make sure you practice good hygiene to help UTIs from recurring.


Have good bowel habits. Fecal material can contaminate your urethra easily as these two areas are quite close physically. Women need to take care to wipe front to back. Preventing constipation or diarrhea is another way to prevent contamination from fecal material.Avoid potentially irritating feminine products. Women also need to avoid using harmful or irritating products like deodorant sprays, douches, harsh cleansers or powders. These can irritate the urethra easily and cause a UTI."
"
Prevent it by drinking lots of water daily!,
Dress for the weather to make sure that you're not sweating more than you need to.,
Water load when needed.,
Keep an eye open for symptoms.,
Take breaks when you show signs of dehydration.,
Use wet towels or a water mist on the skin to aid in cooling.,
Avoid any intentional dehydration.,
Realize that leg cramps while exercising, or following exercise, are an exception.,
Combat the situation if you're sick.,
Look out for diabetes-related dehydration.,
Treat heat stroke as an emergency.",How to Avoid Dehydration," By the time you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated. Thirst can signal a water loss of 1% of body weight. Light-headedness can occur with as little as a 2% water loss.


Water contains no calories and is great for your health in other ways. The amount of water you need is dependent on body weight. Hospitals use a formula to compute water intake needs, because even a patient in a coma needs water! For an adult weighing 150#, 8 oz. of water every hour for 8-10 hours is about right, in a temperate climate, with a sedentary lifestyle. That works out to about 1/2 gallon of water per day. On a hot day, that can increase by 16-32 oz. Add in strenuous exercise, and intake needs can rise by another quart or more, per hour.
To figure out how much water you need in a day, follow the ""half rule"" and drink half your body weight (although, in ounces, not pounds.) For example, somebody who weighs 140 lbs needs about 70 ounces of water in a day.
You lose water in many different ways: urine, sweat, feces, and even breathing! Even if you are sleeping, water is being consumed by your body's functions.;
, If it's a hot, humid day, wear lighter clothes. Dress like desert dwellers do: light weight and light colored clothing that covers your skin and breathes reflects and insulates you from the sun.

, If you're going to participate in a sport or a strenuous activity, then drink up before hand (""water loading""). Then drink at regular intervals (around 20 minutes or so) during the activity.

, The most common signs of dehydration are:


Thirst
Cracked lips, or a whitish deposit
Dizziness or lightheadedness, feeling faint
Dry, sticky mouth
Headache
Nausea or vomiting
Producing less urine or darker urine
Stomach or leg cramping
Non-traumatic nosebleeds (minute cracks in the nasal tissue) which can be made more severe by blood-thinner medications
Feeling hot (Body temperature 99-102 degrees Farenheit)

, If you experience any of the symptoms above, then rest for a while in a cool area and drink plenty of water. Remove clothing that constricts blood flow, or air circulation. Remove dark colored clothing that absorbs heat. Remove clothing that doesn't breathe, such as plastics, or tightly woven garments. If you are feeling nauseous, or have already vomited, begin with sips of water, and keep sipping, even if you vomit again. As you begin to tolerate water, change sips to mouthfuls. To replace lost electrolytes, add diluted, non-caffienated sports drinks, or an apple, orange and a banana. Give nothing by mouth to an unconscious, or barely conscious person.

, Water immersion, such as sitting in water, is OK as long as the body's core is not chilled, such as a brief dip in a pool.


Remember: it's not the water you get on you, but the water you get IN you that counts!

, Some exercise equipment, and some weight loss preparations, achieve their ""results"" by dehydration. These include the rubber belly bands that cause sweating, and the ""colon cleansers"" and ""loose 10 pounds a week"" formulas that cause water loss, and not much else. Athletes have been known to use them to make a lower weight class, since water weighs 8.3 lbs per gallon. Once weighed, they then drink to replace the water lost. This is not a good idea for most of us.

, The cramping is caused by a build-up of lactic acid in the muscle, with insufficiently fluid blood to remove it. Staying still only pools this blood in the legs, adding to the problem. A recovery process called ""hot walking"" is best. As you drink water, you walk, even if it's painful, and the steps are tiny, or even if you need the support of another person to start. You'll probably need 16-24 oz. of water, and about 5-10 minutes of walking to see results, and another 5-10 minutes for full recovery. You will be amazed at the results! Massage and stretching offer little benefit.

, Dehydration can often occur with a stomach ailment. One loses lots of fluids through vomiting and diarrhea. So if you're sick, you may not feel like eating or drinking anything. But your best bet is to take tiny sips of room-temperature, clear liquids. Chicken broth (AKA ""Jewish penicillin"") is a great choice, and there is some science to support it. Sixteen ounces of water with a tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon of salt, replaces electrolytes as well (Pedialyte is a commercial version). Ice pops are a good choice, too. As you can tolerate it, a banana adds needed potassium.

, Diabetes is another illness that can dehydrate you. An overabundance of sugar (a ""diabetic coma"") will increase urination as your body attempts to decrease the glucose in your blood. If you urinate frequently, see your doctor, who can tell quickly if diabetes is present. ""Adult diabetes"" (Type 2 diabetes) often caused by obesity and poor eating habits, is one of the most frequent undiagnosed diseases, and with the rise of pediatric obesity is now being seen more frequently in children. Treatment is often achieved by weight loss and diet and exercise changes.

, It is a severe change in mental status or unconsciousness, or body temperature above 102 degrees Farenheit, is a medical emergency! Call 911 (ambulance or fire support). Immediately cool the person off using whatever methods are available: shade, wet towels, a mister, fans, or a cool water bath (below the neck). Protect the airway, and ensure breathing. If you have ice packs, place them under the neck, in the armpits, and in the groin area. Once cooling has been achieved, remove it so that the core temperature stays above 96 degrees Farenheit. Give nothing by mouth until the person is conscious. Even if the person seems to have fully recovered, have them seek medical attention.

Open your foley catheter.,
Open the lube pack.,
Change our your gloves.,
Now you are ready to begin the process of changing your catheter.",How to Change a Super Pubic Catheter While Maintaining Sterile Field," Once you begin this process you do not want to leave the area. Items you will need include: gloves (preferably more than one pair), a trash can, a foley catheter (the size will be determined by your doctor and provided by your pharmacy or medical supplies provider), insertion tray (provided by your pharmacy or medical supplies provider), an empty syringe, and your catheter bag.;
,,, This tray is routinely wrapped in a medical paper or underpad, this will be used as a non sterile field. Open it to expose your tray, leaving it flat. Everything in the kit at this point is sterile, once touched by your gloved hands it is no longer sterile.


You should see 2-3 more underpads and a packet that contains sterile gloves. Open up an underpad very carefully, making sure to only grab the edge or corners, as little as possible. Placing this piece in an accessible location, the part of the paper facing up is your sterile field and cannot be touched by your gloved hands as they are now. Very carefully open up the gloves, they will be folded in half, open this up, you will see to flaps leave these closed until you switch gloves later in the process.
In your tray you will find, a lube pack, a pack of iodine either by itself or with swabs already coated, if the iodine packet is by itself you should see cotton swabs and a pair of tweezers. Place the lube pack next to the tray, and open the iodine packet, if need be pour over the swabs without touching them.

, The top portion of the kit should come out, set this to the side on either the unsterilized underpad or to the side Do not set this on the sterile pad. Pull out the prefilled saline syringe. Set this to the side.

, It will be in two different casing, the first can be thrown away the second should be perforated on both sides or down the middle and will stay on until later. Open the end will the two port entries, one  is a small opening for the syringe, the other is the opening to connect the bag. Pull the stopper off the syringe and insert into the opening push a small amount of saline into the catheter, now watch the other end of the catheter the balloon should slowly fill. Check for any sign of leaking. Make sure to pull all the fluid out of the balloon. You cannot insert the catheter if the balloon is even partially inflated.

, Open the other end of the foley catheter, do not remove the packaging, you only need to expose an inch or so, do not touch the foley itself, this needs to remain sterile, this is the insertion end, place this end in the lube packet and set it aside if any of the foley is exposed set on the sterile pad only.

, Do not use the sterile ones yet.

, Please ensure you follow your doctor's instructions to the letter.

Regulate your fluid levels.,
Do Kegel exercises.Kegel exercises are designed to strengthen your pelvic floor, urinary sphincter, rectum, bladder, and small intestine.By strengthening these parts of your body through Kegels, you reduce the likelihood that you will have a leaky bladder while running.,
Maintain a healthy weight.If you are overweight, you are more likely to suffer bladder leaks while running.,
Try other workout options besides running.,
Do not smoke or drink.If you smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, you might be at higher risk for a leaky bladder.",How to Avoid Bladder Leaks While Running1," While it is important to stay hydrated during a run, if you find your bladder leaks while running, you should look for ways to adjust your fluid intake to reduce your leakage levels.For instance, if drinking water 30 minutes before your run leads to a leaky bladder once you’re running, try drinking water closer to the time you start running. Alternatively, try pushing your last cup of water before your run back to an hour before you lace up.


If you need to pee after a certain amount of time spent jogging — say, every 50 minutes — limit your runs to a period of time during which your bladder will not leak (like 30 minutes). If you want, you could hit the bathroom, then head back out for another run.
Finally, pee before going for a run. This will empty any excess liquid in your bladder and prevent possible leaking.
Avoid drinking caffeinated beverages. These can irritate your bladder. Skip the coffee and soda if you plan on running.;
,


First, find your pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles you use to stop the stream of pee when you urinate. During urination, try stopping and starting again. Do this each time you urinate until you’re familiar with their location and what it feels like when these muscles specifically are engaged.
Tightening your pelvic floor muscles doesn’t require that you tighten your abs, butt, or thighs. Pay attention to your body to discover the difference between these muscle groups and your pelvic floor muscles.
Once you know where the pelvic floor muscles are, lie down on a carpeted area or mat (a yoga mat works well). Squeeze and hold the muscles tight for at least five seconds. Then, relax the muscles for five seconds (though don’t relax so much that you urinate). Repeat four to five times.
Work your way up to tensing your pelvic muscles for 10 seconds, then relax for 10 seconds.
Try to do these exercises three times daily.

, To lose weight, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. You will lose weight when your total caloric intake is less than your total caloric expenditure each day.


A healthy diet is built on a foundation of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, as well as fat-free or low-fat dairy products and proteins such as poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts. Other healthy foods you might enjoy include strawberries, blueberries, watermelon, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, nuts, seeds, and soy beans.
Use the National Institute of Health’s body mass index (BMI) at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm. The calculator will help you figure out what a healthy weight for you is.
Once you’ve reached your target weight, adjust your diet and exercise regimen so that your caloric intake is on par with your caloric expenditure each day. You could do this by reducing your exercise levels or increasing the volume of food you eat.

, Keep in mind that running is just one form of exercise to keep you fit. It is beneficial to mix your exercise schedule up a bit, especially since high-intensity running can exacerbate your leaky bladder. Biking, lifting weights, and swimming can also help you stay healthy and fit, and allow you time to work on strengthening your pelvic muscles.

, To quit smoking or drinking, set an end date no more than two weeks in the future.


One method is to cut down slightly on your alcohol or cigarette consumption every day at a rate proportional to your end date. For instance, if you plan on quitting in two weeks, your cigarette or alcohol consumption should be halved after one week and reduced by 75% after about 10 days.
Using an OTC nicotine replacement therapy, such as nicotine gum and/or a nicotine patch may be an effective method for curbing cigarette cravings.When you decide to quit smoking or drinking, get support from people who love and care about you. Share your decision to adopt a healthy lifestyle with them.
If you’re around people who smoke and drink, you might feel the urge to do so as well. Spend time with friends and family who do not smoke or drink to avoid this urge.

Exfoliate the area.,
Be gentle.",How to Remove an Ingrown Hair7," Twice a day, scrub the ingrown hair gently. This will help to remove any dead skin cells, dirt, and oils that might be trapping the ingrown hair. It may also physically nudge the tip of the hair out of your skin. Try to hit the ingrown hair from a variety of directions. Use an exfoliating glove or ingrown hair brush, and try one of the following exfoliating techniques:


Exfoliate your legs with salt
Exfoliate your skin with olive oil and sugar

, You'll need to exfoliate enough to achieve this effect, but not so much that the area surrounding the ingrown hair starts to bleed.


When in doubt, exfoliate more gently but for a longer period.
Note! It's very difficult to remove an ingrown hair from under a scab. In this case, it might be best to use a different method, or consult your doctor.

"
"
Get a urethral insert.This is a small tampon-like disposable device inserted into the urethra that acts as a barrier to prevent leakage.,
Try a vaginal pessary.A vaginal pessary is a latex or silicone device that fits into your vagina to help support your uterus, vagina, bladder or rectum.",How to Avoid Bladder Leaks While Running2," It's usually used to prevent incontinence during a specific activity. One type of urethral insert is FemSoft, a narrow silicone tube that you can insert into your urethra to create a seal at the neck of your bladder, thereby preventing urine leakage. It is important to closely follow the instructions for use provided by your healthcare provider and included with the product. If you experience any problems or have any concerns, call your doctor.

, A vaginal pessary may help manage your stress urinary incontinence. Your doctor will determine which type of pessary and which size and shape is right for you.


It is important to follow up with your healthcare provider as recommended to ensure proper fit. If you experience any problems or have any concerns, always contact your doctor right away.

"
"
Discuss the options with your physician.,
Have a sling procedure performed.This is the most common type of surgical procedure you can get to avoid a leaky bladder while running.,
Get injectable bulking agents.,
Try a retropubic colposuspension.",How to Avoid Bladder Leaks While Running3," Your doctor may recommend a surgical procedure to manage your stress urinary incontinence. These interventions are designed to improve closure of the sphincter or support the neck of the bladder. Surgery should always be the last course of action. Only use surgery if Kegel exercises, lifestyle changes, and other medical interventions do not work for you. Talk to your doctor to determine if you are a good candidate for any of these procedures and to discuss any associated risks.

, In this procedure, a doctor will use some of your own tissue (or, occasionally, animal or artificial tissue) to create a small “hammock” below your bladder. The extra support will give you more control over your bladder’s function, and reduce leakage during running.

, In this process, gels or other synthetic bulking agents are injected into the urethra to help you regain control over your ability to close your sphincter. This is not a permanent solution, but it is relatively noninvasive, making it a preferred course of treatment for many women.You may need two or three injections in order to produce the desired effect.Each procedure lasts about 30 minutes.
This procedure is best for women who suffer from intrinsic bladder deficiency, a subtype of stress urinary incontinence.Bulking will probably not be effective if your bladder neck is dropping or not well supported, or if you simply have an overactive bladder. Talk to your doctor to determine if you are a good candidate for this procedure.
You will not be able to eat or drink anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.

, This procedure offers extra lift and support to your bladder neck and urethra. This procedure may be done laparoscopically or by abdominal incision. A surgeon will sutures the support tissues of your bladder neck, vagina, and urethra to ligaments or bones in your pelvis.You’ll need anesthesia before getting the surgery.
This procedure is typically used for incontinence caused by a weak or poorly supported bladder neck.
Retropubic colposuspension has been found to be effective in solving urinary incontinence in 70% of cases and is appropriate for many women."
"
Use incontinence pads or special underwear.,
Empty your bladder.,
Bring a change of pants.If you’re in a race, bring someone along.,
Carry sanitary wipes.Sanitary wipes are a hygiene product for cleaning and moisturizing your skin.",How to Avoid Bladder Leaks While Running4," There are several brands of underwear (like Thinx or Fannypants) that are designed to absorb any leaks. They are even available in sporting versions so you can wear them while you run. Visit your local undergarments shop or search online for a specific brand's website to try out this option.If you’re too embarrassed to talk about your incontinence and need for special undies, just order online.

, If you feel your bladder start to leak and cannot contain it, look for an area off the jogging trail to relieve yourself. Look ahead of you and behind you to ensure you’ll have adequate privacy. Head off the trail about 20 feet (6 m) (seven meters) and avoid any thorns, brush, or roots that might trip you up. Don't disregard your safety in your rush.


Try to situate yourself behind some large trees or bushes so that you’ll be hidden from anyone passing by on the trail. Try a women’s urination device like GoGirl or Shewee to make it easier to urinate off the trail. You could pack these small devices in a fanny pack when you go running.
If you are wearing safety vest, remove it when you head into the woods. That way, even if someone runs by you while you’re urinating, you will be harder to spot.If you’re running in an urban environment, your situation is much easier. Just look for a restaurant or public bathroom in which to do your business.

, Not only can they cheer you on and offer moral support, but they can also hold a spare pair of bottoms for you. That way, if you do end up peeing, you can change once your race is run.


You probably won’t be able to change into the clean shorts or pants while running. The best option is to have someone meet you at the end of your race with a clean pair of bottoms.
Don’t forget to pack underwear, too.
If you’re by yourself out on the trail while running, you probably won’t have a change of shorts or pants handy. Your best move is to just head home, freshen up, and change there. Or, you can keep a change of clothes in your car if you are driving to a trail or track.

, They are used to maintain healthy, clean skin and avoid irritation from bodily substances. If you run, stuff a small package of sanitary wipes in a fanny pack.


Typically they are used by women during menstruation, or by parents changing their baby’s diapers.
If you wet yourself during a run, simply remove a sanitary wipe from the package. Use it just as you might use a napkin or disposable tissue to clean up a spill. Wipe away the urine on your legs and discard the sanitary wipe in a trash bin.

Disinfect the wound.,
Keep the scab protected.,
Be proactive.",How to Stop Picking Your Scabs1," Open wounds and sores can develop infections. Always wash a new wound thoroughly with soap and water as soon as you obtain it. Then clean it up with an antiseptic wipe or a bit of Neosporin and apply a bandage to protect it while it heals. You can also try using betadine or peroxide on the wound to clean and remove unwanted bacteria. These basic precautions will help to keep it clean and prevent infection., Scabs form over wounds to keep out germs while the body repairs skin cells and tissue. It is important to help the healing process by protecting this barrier.If you cannot bandage it, try applying moisturizer or lotion as it heals. Scabs kept protected will usually leave less scarring. The slight skin massage that comes with applying moisturizer will also increase circulation and help it to heal properly.
Take a fingernail file and smooth the scab down to the surrounding skin. Then, when your hand rubs across the area, it will be less of a temptation and harder to pick.

, Ensure fewer scabs by using healthy products to properly cleanse your skin. Make sure that skin products aren't causing blemishes that tempt you to pick.

Most often, they occur on the soles of the feet or on the hands or fingers.Calluses are not contagious, but they can become uncomfortable if they get too large.;
, Corns and calluses are terms that are often used interchangeably. They do share some similarities, but there are also some differences. Technically, corns are areas of hardened skin near a bony area. Corns are usually found on or between the toes. Calluses are not associated with bony areas and usually appear on weight-bearing areas.


Both corns and calluses are caused by friction, such as the foot rubbing on shoes or toes rubbing against each other. Another difference between corns and calluses is that the callus is all thickened skin, but a corn has a hard central core, surrounded by reddened and inflamed tissue.
Corns tend to be painful, while calluses are rarely painful.

, If your callus becomes infected, inflamed or painful, you should talk to your doctor. It may require medical treatment.

, The simplest thing one can do is to soak the feet in hot water. Take a medium-sized tub and fill it up with warm water, around 45°C (113°F) and while sitting on a chair or stool, immerse your feet in the tub for 15 to 20 minutes while you relax and read a book.


Add Epsom salts for additional skin softening.Soften the hardened skin by adding a half cup of Epsom salts for every gallon of water. Soak the affected area for 10 to 20 minutes.
At the end of this foot spa of sorts, you will find your calluses getting soft. Over a few days of repeating this procedure they will be soft enough for you to just scrape them off with your hand., Castor oil can be used to soften skin and encourage new skin growth. Apply castor oil by massaging it into the callus. Then cover your feet or hands with old cotton socks or old cotton gloves. Castor oil will stain clothing, so be sure to choose something that can get stained. Cotton clothing is preferred because cotton is a natural fiber that will absorb the castor oil, but it will also leave some castor oil on the callus. Leave on for at least 30 minutes.

, Squeeze out the Vitamin E and massage it into the callus. Use as many caplets as needed to cover the entire callus.


Leave the Vitamin E on the callus for at least 30 minutes.

, Aspirin contains salicylic acid, which helps treat calluses. Make a paste by crushing six uncoated aspirin tablets in a bowl. Add a half-teaspoon of either apple cider vinegar or lemon juice to make a paste. Apply the mixture onto the callus. Wrap the affected area in a warm towel and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes., Pumice is an extremely porous rock that forms during volcanic eruptions. It can be used to gently rub off (exfoliate) the thickened skin of a callus. Once the callused area is softened, you’ll use a pumice stone to rub off the top layers of the callus.


Pumice stones are readily available at drug stores and grocery stores.

, Use one of the softening methods to get your callused area ready. Moisturize by leaving on castor oil or Vitamin E for at least 30 minutes, or you can leave on one of these treatments overnight.

, Use the pumice after the moisturizing step to make it easier to gently remove the thickened skin. When your skin is softened, you won’t need to rub too hard. Use gentle, firm, single direction strokes, such as those similar to how you would file your nails or play a violin. With a steady hand and constant, minimal pressure, rub off the top layer of the calluses to bring about healthy skin from underneath.


Always remember that the callus is your body’s response to increased pressure and friction. Rubbing too hard may result in more callus formation.

, Be patient with the process of removing the callus. Use the pumice every day to remove a fraction of the callus. This may take a while, but will pay off in the long run.

, If after one to two weeks, the callus is still present, call your physician for advice. The callus may require a medical procedure such as:Surgical trimming
The use of urea (a cleaning agent that helps loosen skin) to soften and remove the skin cells
Orthotics to minimize pressure and/or friction
More extensive surgery

, Although the skin on a callus is hardened, you should remove the skin by rubbing it away. Do not try cutting or shaving the area. This can cause infections and laceration injuries. You can easily cut too deeply or at the wrong angle. You may require medical attention if you do this., Monitor your skin for changes that might indicate a callus is forming. If you can’t reach or see your feet, ask someone to help you. You can visit a doctor or podiatrist for a foot examination., If you are developing a callus from playing a guitar, for example, you can stop doing that activity. It may not be feasible to stop the activity, however. For example, if you have a callus on your finger from using a pen for writing, you may not be able to eliminate this activity from your daily routine.

, Many people develop calluses on their feet when their shoes don’t fit. Since calluses are the skin’s response to pressure or friction, you need to remove the source of the pressure or friction.


Get your feet measured. As you age, your feet will change size and shape, so it’s important to keep your shoe size current.Try on shoes before you buy them. Sometimes, the fit will be different depending on the manufacturer, so pay attention to how the shoe feels on your foot, not the size marked on the box.
Make sure there is about ½ inch between your toe and the tip of the shoe.
Don’t buy shoes expecting them to stretch as you wear them. If they are too tight when you buy them, then go up a size.

, Wear gloves, socks and properly fitting shoes to protect your skin from calluses. Don’t walk around barefoot, as this increases the potential for callus formation., Using these lotions on your feet and hands before you wear your shoes or gloves to reduce friction can greatly alleviate your callus pain.


Alternatively, consider slathering them in petroleum jelly. Moisture will never be a problem again!

, These or the donut shaped footpads specifically recommended for calluses are fantastic as they keep the callused area raised and cushioned, hence reducing friction by avoiding contact with footwear. They won't get rid of existing calluses, but they will prevent new ones from forming.You can also make a foot pad out of moleskins by cutting two moon-shaped pieces and arranging them around your callus.

Practice positive affirmation.,
Don’t give up!",How to Stop Picking Your Scabs2," There may be reasons why you are picking at your scabs, ranging from purely physical (they itch) to mental or emotional (perhaps as a way to relieve tension). Understanding the root cause can help you to break the habit.


Not everyone who picks their scabs has a behavioral problem. Some amount is normal. Other times it is a sign of skin problems, drug use of withdrawal, or other conditions. It only becomes a behavioral disorder when it is so frequent that it impacts other aspects of your daily life.People pick their skin for various reasons. For some it is boredom, while for others it can be a way to relieve negative feelings, depression, or stress. Sometimes it is unconscious; at other times the picker experiences feelings of guilt.Keeping a log can make you aware of when, where, and how often you are picking, especially when it happens unconsciously. Whenever you catch yourself, record it in a notebook.

, Once you have an idea of when and why you are picking your scabs, try things that divert your attention or remind you not to pick. It may take one or more different ways to control your behavior. Be strategic and use methods that suit your own situation.

, If you are a self-motivated and competitive person, make breaking your habit into a sort of contest. Set a number of days or hours to go without picking and gradually increase this. Then reward yourself for significant progress.

, One way to stop is to make the habit physically hard. Cut your nails, wear gloves, or cover the scabs. Having shorter fingernails will make it harder for you to pick. Keeping scabs bandaged will prevent you from looking at them and help you resist the urge to pick.


Try soft cotton gloves. Not only do they act as a barrier, but they should make you even more conscious of the behavior and help you to reduce it.If you tend to pick at your arms or legs, wear long sleeves and pants whenever possible. If the scabs are on your ankle, wear high socks. This way, even if you give in, you will pick at the fabric rather than the skin itself.

, This is another way of making your picking harder — and also a fashion-sensible one. It will be more difficult because you will have to scrape with thicker nails, which won't catch the skin as easily. Thin nails are sharp and can slice off the scab.


If you go this route, have the manicurist make the nails as short and thick as possible. This will be added insurance against damaging the skin.

, When you feel the urge, distract yourself or channel your energy into something else. Try reading books, going for a walk, or watching television when you feel the urge to pick.


Finding a habit that occupies your hands is even better and is something that is commonly used to quit smoking. You might try drawing, gardening, knitting, doing a puzzle, playing the piano, or crocheting. You can even just hold a coin or paperclip. If nothing else works, sit on your hands., Remember to respect yourself whenever you catch yourself picking. Press on the scabbed area or wave your hand over the scabs, with a reminder that you love yourself and want to protect your skin. Try this technique before bed and when you wake up.

, It will take a long time to undo the habit at first. But if you are successful just once, you can do it again and will eventually reduce your picking. Be proud of your progress. With care and time, you can gradually free yourself of the habit.

Recognize a problem.,
Seek professional help.,
Follow a medical regimen.,
Seek psychological treatment.,
Consider habit reversal training (HRT).,
Consider stimulus control (SC), as well.",How to Stop Picking Your Scabs3," If out of control, scab picking can be a sign of a bigger behavioral problem called ""Skin Picking Disorder."" People with Skin Picking Disorder compulsively touch, scratch, pick, or rub their skin, which can result in scarring or worse.Try asking yourself the following questions:


Does your skin picking take a lot of your time up?
Do you have noticeable scars from skin picking?
Do you feel guilty when you think about your skin picking?
Does your skin picking cause significant disability socially or professionally?
If you answer yes to more than one of these questions, you may have SPD.

, Scab picking may indicate SPD or another medical problem, like psoriasis or eczema. It is important to consult a medical professional to find out what is causing it, and whether it is independent or a symptom of a different, underlying problem.


There are any number of different therapies available for chronic scab picking. Some might involve medication to relieve physical triggers, while others use behavioral therapy. Once a doctor discovers what is wrong, she can advise you on the best treatment.
SPD is a variant of Obsessive Compulsive disorder because of the compulsive urge to perform repetitive behaviors.
Your SPD may be related to depression, bipolar disorder, attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder, and an eating disorder. Other conditions similar to SPD include body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (pulling out hair), and nail biting.

, Your scab picking may be due to a physical problem and not to SPD. It may be dermatological, like eczema, for example, an inflammation of the skin that can cause itching. In this case the doctor may prescribe medication like corticosteroids or other topical creams.


Remember, the medicine will treat the underlying cause of your scab picking, but it will not address the habit itself. Even if the physical triggers disappear, you may still feel the psychological urge and need help.

, If your picking is not caused by a physical condition and is Skin Picking Disorder, you may need to consult a professional about getting counseling. One common psychological treatment option is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT.


CBT is often used to help people replace bad habits with good ones. There are different forms of available for scab picking.
Treatment may involve dermatological therapy, antidepressants, anxiolytics, or antipsychotics.

, HRT is a form of CBT, for example, based on the idea that scab picking is a conditioned behavior. It helps you recognize situations in which you are likely to pick and discourages the behavior by substituting alternative responses, like balling up your fists, when faced with the urge to pick.

, SC is another method that lessens sensory triggers in your environment that lead to picking – that is, “high risk” situations. It teaches you how to avoid circumstances that might lead you to pick, like changing your bathroom behavior if looking in the mirror is your trigger.

This constant scratching may result in significant scarring after your blisters have healed.Scientists have shown that a mild amount of pain is produced when you scratch. This interferes with the itch sensation for just a moment. It only provides temporary relief because the mild pain signal from the scratching causes your brain to release serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Serotonin, which carries signals between nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord, makes you feel the itch sensation more intensely. This is the start of an unending scratch-itch cycle because you start scratching to relieve this itching.If you or your young child cannot stop scratching, trying putting gloves, mittens, or socks on your hands. This can be especially useful during the night when you are sleeping and less able to resist the impulse to scratch.;
, You can apply a cold compress or a towel-covered ice pack to the itchy areas for 20 to 30 minutes.Wet a washcloth or small towel with cold water to make the cold compress. You can purchase an ice pack from the store or put ice cubes in a disposable, plastic freezer bag. You want to wrap the ice pack with a towel to prevent your skin from getting too cold which could cause you pain.The cold compress and ice pack soothe the itching because the nerves that sense you have something cool/cold on your skin send signals that block the itching sensation., Take a bath every three to four hours for the first several days after the red spots and blisters form on your skin. You can take a plain bath or add baking soda, cornstarch, or oatmeal to the water.During one of the baths, clean your skin with a gentle soap. It is not realistic to think that children, especially younger ones, will tolerate having to take such frequent baths. You can try applying frequent cold compresses instead.Add about four tablespoons of the baking soda, cornstarch, or dry, uncooked oatmeal to your bath water. You can use colloidal oatmeal, which is finely ground and made for the purpose of putting it in bath water. The baking soda, colloidal oatmeal, and cornstarch should dissolve well in the bath water. But, you may want to fill a nylon stocking with the dry oatmeal, tie a knot at the end, and throw it in the tub so that you will not have loose oats floating around the tub or clogging your drain.Studies have shown that oatmeal is a cleanser and moisturizer. It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which makes it great for treating your itchy skin., Use a mild soap when you wash your skin and your clothing. When you dry off after your bath or shower, pat yourself dry and do not rub your itchy skin.Use a soap and laundry detergent that is dye-free and fragrance-free to prevent further skin irritation.Moisturize your skin with a fragrance-free lotion after taking your bath or shower. A lotion like Aveeno has colloidal oatmeal in it and is a good choice. You should aim to moisturize your skin once or twice every day. Do not apply perfumes, cosmetics, or any other skin products to your skin.If you have blisters around your mouth, it may be painful to eat and drink. Pamper this area by eating foods which are cool, soft, and bland, like Popsicles, lukewarm oatmeal, or lukewarm soup. Definitely avoid food that is spicy, salty, or acidic., Make sure you dress comfortably in soft, loose-fitting clothing. Make your bed more comfortable by using only soft bedclothes. You want to avoid any material which creates friction or feels rough when it rubs up against your itchy skin.Silk and 100% cotton are soft and smooth unlike rough materials like wool or gabardine which should be avoided., You want to have short nails and clean hands just in case you cannot resist the urge to scratch. Your scratching can lead to a skin infection in your open blisters because of the bacteria under your nails and on your skin.You do not want to add to your discomfort by causing a skin infection. Dirt and bacteria is less likely to get under your shorter nails. Wash your hands frequently with lukewarm water and a mild soap. You will keep your skin clean with a daily bath or shower., Calamine lotion contains mostly zinc oxide which is good for treating skin irritation and itchiness. It is safe for all ages but avoid applying the lotion around the eyes and mouth.Shake the bottle of calamine lotion and squirt some onto a cotton ball. Use the cotton ball to spread the lotion gently over the itchy areas. Allow the lotion to dry and feel it begin to soothe your skin. Re-apply the lotion as often as you need.Stick to calamine lotion and do not use a hydrocortisone cream on your blisters. The purpose of this medication is to lessen your immune response to the viral infection and it may lessen the itching, but the medication also could interfere with how well your blisters heal.If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should not use calamine lotion or any medication without first checking with your doctor., Histamine is a protein and one of its effects is to cause skin itchiness. Antihistamines help you feel better by blocking this effect in your body.Antihistamines block the receptors or places in the body where histamine attach. This can make your skin feel less itchy.Examples of over-the-counter antihistamines you can get without a doctor’s prescription are diphenhydramine (Benadryl), loratadine (Claritin), and cetirizine (Zyrtec). Do not take any medication or give it to your child without first talking to your healthcare provider., When this antihistamine is in its topical form, it can be absorbed erratically through your open blisters. Drug levels in your blood could become too high.You could experience side effects like dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting., Your itchy skin may be hard to soothe, but you can get relief from a fever or any pain you may be having. Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or any other over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil). Never use aspirin while you are sick with chickenpox.Use the NSAIDs with caution. According to a few studies, there is a very small chance you could develop serious inflammation of the skin if you use NSAIDs while you have chickenpox.Research has shown that you could develop Reye’s Syndrome if you use aspirin (a salicylate compound) to treat your symptoms from a viral infection like chickenpox. This serious and life-threatening disease can affect your liver and brain. The syndrome is most likely to develop as you begin to recover from the chickenpox. You suddenly will become symptomatic and experience drowsiness, loss of energy, personality changes like irritability or combativeness and confusion as a late symptom. No one should take aspirin while she is sick with chickenpox, but young people under the age of 22 are at high risk for developing the syndrome., Antiviral medications will not cure the infection, but they may decrease the intensity of symptoms like itchy skin. If your scratching has led to a bacterial skin infection, your doctor may need to prescribe you an antibiotic.The bacterial skin infection around your open blisters could cause your itchy skin to get worse. Call your doctor immediately if you have a fever associated with areas of skin that are very warm, red, tender or draining pus. Taking an antibiotic can help you to feel better sooner.If you are one of the people at risk for more serious disease, you must go to your doctor’s office and be examined to see if she will prescribe an antiviral like acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir. People at higher risk are healthy people older than 12 years of age, infants three months or younger, people with chronic skin or lung disease, people receiving steroid therapy, people with weakened immune systems, and some groups of pregnant women.If your child is older than three months and younger than 13 years, he does not have to be seen by a doctor unless he is becoming more and more symptomatic.Call to make a doctor’s appointment if you develop symptoms like a fever lasting longer than four days, a fever that rises above 102°F (38.9 °C), extreme illness, difficult waking up or confusion, demeanor changes, difficulty walking, stiff neck, frequent vomiting, difficulty breathing, or a severe cough.Your doctor will decide what type of medication and/or treatment you need.

In people with normal immune systems, the rash usually occurs as a single, distinct stripe on one side of your body or on your face. Some people with weak immune systems may have a rash all over their body.Other symptoms include fever, headache, chills, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to touch, fatigue, and an upset stomach.The rash will form blisters that will scab over in 7 to 10 days. Shingles lasts between 2 and 6 weeks.;
, You should see a doctor as soon as you develop a rash. It is best if you get to the doctor within 3 days (sooner if the rash is on your face). The doctor can diagnose you and make a treatment plan. Early treatment can help your blisters dry up faster and decrease your pain.Shingles can be treated at home. You probably will not have to stay in the hospital.Most people get shingles once, but it is possible to get it 2 or 3 more times., While you are having an outbreak you should wear loose-fitting clothes made of natural fabrics, get lots of rest, and eat healthy. You can also try taking an oatmeal bath or using calamine lotion to calm your skin.Try wearing silk or cotton fabrics instead of wool or acrylic clothing.
You can add a handful of ground or colloidal oatmeal to your bath to soothe your skin. You can also buy oatmeal bath products that can be added to your bath.Apply calamine lotion after you bathe and your skin is still damp., Stress can make your shingles more painful. try to do things that take your mind off of your pain by doing things that you enjoy like reading, listening to music, or talking with friends or family.Stress can also trigger an outbreak, so do what you can to avoid it.



Meditation and deep breathing techniques can help you relieve the stress of enduring a shingles outbreak, and may help reduce your pain.You can meditate by silently repeating a calming thought or word to keep you from being distracted by your thoughts.You could also try guided meditation where you focus on a mental image or place that you find relaxing. As you visualize this place, you should try to incorporate the smells, sights, and sounds. It is helpful if you have someone else guide you through the visualization process.Tai chi and yoga are also other ways to reduce stress. Both of these combine specific postures and deep breathing exercises., Your physician will likely prescribe valacyclovir (Valtrex), acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), or a similar drug to treat your shingles. Take the medication as directed by your doctor and pharmacist, and talk to them about any potential side effects or reactions with other medications you are taking.You should take these medications as soon as possible so that they will be effective. This is why you should get to your doctor as soon as your rash appears., The pain you feel during a shingles outbreak should be brief, but it may be intense. Depending on the level of pain and your medical history, your doctor may prescribe something with codeine, or a medication that will manage long term pain such as an anticonvulsant.Your doctor may also prescribe numbing medication like lidocaine. It may be applied as a cream, gel, spray,or a skin patch.Your doctor may also inject you with corticosteroids or a local anesthetics to manage your pain.Prescription capsaicin cream, which contains the active ingredient in chili peppers, can also help manage pain when you apply it to the rash., Take cool baths during an outbreak of shingles, or hold a cold compress over the blisters and sores.Keep them clean with cold water and mild soap to prevent further irritation or infection.You should bathe with a gentle soap like Dove, Oil of Olay, or Basis.You can mix 2 tsp of salt in 1 liter of cool water and use a washcloth to apply the solution to your blisters or rash. This will help with any itching you are experiencing."

Reside in a humid, damp, or crowded place
Come into close contact with a person or animal infected with ringworm
Share clothing, bedding, or towels with a person who has ringworm
Take part in sports that include skin-to-skin contact such as wrestling
Wear tight clothing
Have a weakened immune system;
, In most cases, ringworm starts as a flat and scaly patch of skin. As the infection progresses, the scaly patch may grow in size.Be aware that ringworm of the scalp often starts as a small sore that looks like a pimple. Keep an eye on the spot to see how it develops.Notice patches by running your fingers over the skin to see if it feels scaly. Your skin patch may also be slightly matte in color from the scales. Watch the patch to see if it develops further or gets itchy, which may indicate ringworm.
Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching any skin you suspect may be infected with ringworm. This can keep it from spreading to other parts of your body.

, Scaly skin may have a raised border that expands outward as the infection spreads on your skin. The patch will form a roughly circular ring, hence the name ringworm.Be aware that the basic contours of the scaly or infected patch will be circular, but may also appear to be wavy like the outline of a snake or worm. You may also have several rings that interconnect with one another.
See if you have any patchy and itchy areas in your groin or on your feet that are not circular in shape. These areas may both be signs of a fungal infection more commonly known as jock itch and athlete’s foot.Check the color of the border and see if it is a darker red than the inside of the patch. This is often a good indication of a ringworm infection.

, The external and internal areas of most ringworm infections have different textures or appearances. Check the internal area of the patch for the following signs, which can indicate ringworm:


Blisters
OozingScattered red bumps
Scales of skin
A clear appearanceBald spots or broken hair on the scalp, One of the most common symptoms of ringworm is severe itching and discomfort on your skin, especially near patches or sores.If you have itching and/ or discomfort with any of the other symptoms, chances are you have ringworm and should get a diagnosis.

, Finger and toenails can also develop fungal infections similar to ringworm.This is called onychomycosis. Some common signs of an infection on your nails are:Thick nails
White or yellow nails
Brittle nails

, Mild cases of ringworm often respond to the application of an antifungal lotion. These preparations can relieve symptoms such as itching and kill the infection.Get a topical antifungal treatment such as clotrimazole or terbinafine at a local pharmacy or medical supply store. Follow the packaging instructions or any by your doctor to treat the infection.
These treatments work by making the cell wall of the fungus unstable and causes membrane leakage. This essentially ""kills"" the infection.

, Rubbing honey on to ringworm may get rid of ringworm or prevent it from recurring on your skin. It also can help relieve any inflammation associated with ringworm. Apply some warmed honey directly to your ringworm or spread a layer on a bandage and put it over the infection.Change the bandage or reapply honey twice a day until the infection goes away.

, Place a few slices of garlic directly on your ringworm and then cover the area with a bandage. Garlic has antifungal properties that may kill the infection.


Peel garlic and slice the clove into thin sections. Put the slices directly on the infection and then cover it with a bandage.Wear the garlic overnight and repeat application every night until the infection disappears.

, Like garlic, apple cider vinegar has medicinal properties. Applying apple cider vinegar directly on ringworm for a few days can kill the infection.Wet a cotton pad with apple cider vinegar and rub it onto the ringworm.Repeat this treatment three to five times per day for one to three days.

, A salt and vinegar paste may kill ringworm.Apply the mixture for a week and see if it eases your infection.


Mix salt and vinegar into a paste and put it directly on the infection. Leave the mixture on your skin for five minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. It may take up to a week for salt and vinegar to kill ringworm.

, Tea tree and lavender essential oils have strong antifungal properties. Use either oil to halt the development of ringworm and kill it.Mix a solution of tea tree oil and water, using equal parts water and oil. Use this mixture for up to a week on the infection.
Put a dab of lavender oil on the infection every day. Lavender oil treatments can take a bit longer — up to a month — to kill ringworm.

, If home treatments do not help or heal your ringworm, or if it gets worse, make an appointment with your doctor. This is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis and your doctor can develop a sensible treatment plan to combat and prevent your ringworm.Undergo a physical exam in which your doctor will look for symptoms of ringworm. They may ask for your health history and factors such as exposure to ringworm.
Ask your doctor any questions you have about ringworm or how you may have contracted it.
Remember skin-to-skin contact, contact with bed linens, or an infected animal or person can spread this infection. Ensure that if anyone else in your home has the infection that they are treated as well to avoid getting reinfected after it clears.

, In most cases, your doctor can diagnose ringworm by examining it; however, you may need some testing to confirm a diagnosis. This can also help your doctor develop the best treatment plan for you.Your doctor may scrape off some skin flakes to examine under a microscope. Your doctor will want to identify the fungus and diagnose your ringworm, especially if it is resistant to infection.
If standard treatments do not work, your doctor will run more tests for immune deficiency issues.

, Your doctor might prescribe an antifungal cream or lotion if your ringworm is severe. Prescription antifungals are more powerful than over-the-counter options and may be more effective at treating your ringworm.Follow dosing instructions if your doctor gives you a prescription antifungal medicine.

, Your doctor may also prescribe an oral treatment for ringworm. These pills are often used for more severe cases of ringworm and may be used in conjunction with creams or lotions.Take oral antifungals for eight to 10 weeks and follow the dosing instructions. The most common medications are terbinafine, itraconazole, griseofulvin, and fluconazole.
Be aware that oral antifungals may have the following side effects: diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, and headache.

, For scalp ringworm, you may take an oral antifungal and shampoo with an antifungal product. This may be easier and more effective at curing scalp ringworm than home treatments.Consider using a shampoo with tea tree oil if you can’t find an antifungal shampoo, as tea tree oil has antifungal properties and may help eradicate the infection.
Consider using Selsun Blue shampoo for your skin. This can help prevent and treat fungal infections. Use it three times a week, using your regular soap the rest of the time. Once the infection clears up, us it twice a week for a while.

Be careful not to get the shampoo in your eyes and avoid using it on your face.



, Proper hygiene is an important part of preventing and treating ringworm. Simple measures — such as washing your hands to using only your own personal items — can keep ringworm from spreading to others and may prevent recurrences., Ringworm is a result of parasites that feed on skin cells. Washing your hands frequently and showering daily may help prevent ringworm or its recurrence.Use a soap and water to wash skin after using the restroom or touching common surfaces.
Wear flip flops or shower shoes if you shower in a gym or locker room.

, Damp environments can promote the growth of ringworm. Be sure to completely dry your skin with a towel or by air after swimming or a shower. This can eliminate a damp environment that promotes fungus growthDust talc or cornstarch rice powder to keep your skin dry of water or sweat.
Use a deodorant and antiperspirant under your arms to keep them dry, which may help prevent ringworm.

, Because ringworm is highly contagious, avoid sharing personal items. This can prevent ringworm or recurrence of the infection.Keep the towels, bedding, and clothing of an infected person separate from your items. Hairbrushes and combs can also spread ringworm.

, Wear clothing appropriate to the weather and choose to layer items in the event of changing temperatures. This can prevent the sweating that promotes the conditions favorable to ringworm.Wear soft and lightweight clothing in the summer. Choose fabrics like cotton that allow your skin to breathe.
Wear layers in winter or at transitional times. Layering allows you to easily remove clothes so you don’t get hot. In turn, it prevents sweating that can promote an environment conducive to ringworm. Consider fabrics such as merino wool to keep you warm and dry.

Washing the chafed skin is especially important if you've been exercising or sweating a lot. You'll need to wash away the perspiration before treating the skin.Avoid rubbing the skin hard with a towel. You don't want to further irritate dry, peeling skin.;
, Sprinkle powder over your skin. This should help to reduce your skin's friction. You can use talc-free baby powder, baking soda, cornstarch, or another body powder. Avoid talcum powder, since some studies show it may be a carcinogen., Use any kind of petroleum jelly, body balm, diaper rash cream, or product designed to prevent chafing over the skin to reduce your skin's friction. Several products are specifically designed to prevent chafing for athletes. Once you've applied an ointment, you may want to cover the area with a bandage or sterile gauze pad.If the area is very painful or bleeding, ask your doctor for a medicated ointment. You'll be able to spread it on the area much like petroleum jelly., Cool the chafed skin by applying an ice pack right after you finish exercising or begin to notice irritation. Make sure not to apply ice or an ice pack directly to your skin, since this can further damage your skin. Instead, wrap the ice pack in a towel or cloth and keep it near your skin for 20 minutes. This cooling sensation will give you immediate relief., Spread natural aloe vera gel directly from the plant onto the chafed area. You can also purchase aloe vera, but make sure it has as few additives as possible. This will calm your skin. You may also want to drop a couple of drops of tea tree oil onto a cotton ball. Then, spread it over your skin. This can fight infection and help your skin heal faster.

, Create a soothing mixture of 2 cups baking soda and 10 drops of lavender essential oil. Then add this to a running bath of lukewarm water. Avoid soaking in very hot water, which can dry out or further irritate your skin. Soak for at least 20 minutes and then get out and pat yourself dry with a clean towel.You can also make a soothing tea to add to the tub. Boil 1/3 cup of green tea, 1/3 cup of dried calendula (marigold), and 1/3 cup of dried chamomile in 2 US quarts (2,000 ml) of water. Let the tea steep until the liquid cools, then strain it and pour into your tub.

, Chafed skin can become infected and need medical attention. If you notice an infection or scaly red rash, go see your medical practitioner. You should also see your doctor if the chafed area is incredibly painful or debilitating and sensitive.

, If you know you'll be exercising and perspiring, make sure to apply talc-free and alum powders to the areas that usually get the sweatiest. Wet skin will make chafing worse, so get out of wet clothes as soon as you're done exercising., Clothes that are too tight fitting can irritate your skin and cause chafing. Wear synthetic clothes that fit snugly. Clothing that sits close to your skin will prevent the friction that causes chafing.If you're exercising, don't wear cotton and try to dress as minimally as possible.Make sure you don't wear clothes that have seams or straps that rub. If you notice rubbing or irritation when you first put it on, the rubbing will only get worse after several hours of wearing it. Better to choose something more comfortable that doesn't chafe your skin.

, This is especially true if you're exercising. Drinking lots of water will let your body sweat easier, which prevents salt crystals from forming. Salt crystals on your skin can be a source of friction, causing chafing., You'll need A & D ointment, which is usually used for diaper rash, and petroleum jelly. Combine 1 cup of each in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup of vitamin E cream and 1/4 cup aloe vera cream. Stir the mixture well. It will be pretty stiff, but you can spread it on chafed skin.Spread the lubricant on areas that usually chafe before you plan on exercising or sweating. It can also help heal chafed skin and prevent blisters., If you're overweight, you may notice more chafing. This is especially true if you notice chafing on your thighs. Losing some of the weight will help prevent excess skin from rubbing together in the future.Start by exercising and incorporating healthy food into your diet. You can do an exercise that doesn't cause significant chafing, like swimming weightlifting, or rowing."

Soak a towel in warm water.,
Wash your face with a gentle cleanser.,
Try physical exfoliation.,
Try chemical exfoliation.,
Wash your face with water after you are done exfoliating.,
Understand that you can also exfoliate other areas of your body.,
Try an all-natural solution using home ingredients.",How to Get Rid of Dead Skin1," Gently place this on your face and let it sit for one to two minutes. This will open your pores and prepare the skin on your face for exfoliation. Exfoliation is one of the most effective means to get rid of dead skin. Be careful that you use a warm and not scalding hot towel.;
, After using the warm towel, the next step is to wash your face using a mild cleanser (such as Cetaphil) — the same as the one you likely already use on a daily basis as part of good skin care. Cleaning your skin can further help to open the pores and better prepare the skin on your face for effective exfoliation.


After washing, gently pat your skin with a dry towel. Be gentle and do not rub too vigorously, to avoid causing any damage to your skin.
You may try standing in front of a fan to dry your body, especially hard to reach areas.

, There are two types of exfoliation: physical, and chemical. Physical exfoliation is when you physically use a product that scrapes away dead skin cells by the pressure exerted upon them. Examples of tools for physical exfoliation include exfoliating pads and microdermabrasion kits.Skin-care professionals do not recommend microdermabrasion without the consultation of a doctor or dermatologist first, as you could damage or irritate your skin.
Skin-care companies such as L'Oreal, Ponds, Clinique, and Neutrogena are now producing at-home microdermabrasion kits.
These generally consist of an abrasive cream or scrub with a special tool for application.Sometimes they come with a microdermabrasion cloth with fibres that are rougher than normal and meant to remove dead skin cells.An example is Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion and Peel System., There is a variety of chemical exfoliating products available. Your best bet is to consult a professional in aesthetics or a dermatologist for advice in choosing the right product for you.If you are unable to afford a professional consultation, carefully read the labels of the products and choose one that is suited to your skin type.


After washing your face and gently drying it, carefully apply the chemical exfoliating product. Spread it all over your face, being sure to cover the full surface area.
Gently massage the chemical exfoliating agent into your skin. Try delicate circular motions with your fingers. Do not rub too hard, as you do not want to damage your skin inadvertently.
Many people exfoliate their neck as well.
Some examples of chemical exfoliating agents include a glycolic acid peel or a lactic acid peel. The acidic nature of these peels is part of what makes them so effective.
Chemical exfoliation tends to work better than physical exfoliation (in particular for long-term results) because it is able to access deeper layers of the skin. Chemical exfoliation works by breaking chemical bonds, which in turn releases dead skin cells and allows them to shed much more easily.

, Then gently pat it dry. Leave it for about five minutes to air dry and then finish by applying a moisturizing lotion.


Moisturizing lotions are recommended as part of general skin care. They help to prevent early signs of aging and give your skin an overall healthy glow.

, Basically, all areas of your body are okay to follow this same process of exfoliation (other than sensitive areas and mucous membranes); however, the most common area people use it for is the face and/or the neck. This is because these areas are most visible to the public, and often the highest cosmetic concern for people.


Look for exfoliating body scrubs that are made to work on the rest of your body and not your face.

, Not all exfoliating solutions are products bought in a store. In fact, it's easy to make your own exfoliating creams, peels, and rubs at home, if you prefer a more natural approach. Below are two easy-to-use recipes:


Sugar and Oil Scrub: Combine equal parts brown sugar and any cooking oil (like olive oil, grapeseed oil, etc.) for a highly economical, highly effective skin scrub. Rub into the skin to exfoliate, then rinse with soap and water. Add a tablespoon of honey and a few drops of lemon for extra nutrients.
Greek Yogurt and Papaya Enzyme Face Conditioning Mask: Mix 1/2 cup of Greek Yogurt and three tablespoons of mashed up papaya. Apply to face or body, and leave for 15 to 30 minutes. Peel off and rinse face when done."

Reassess after six weeks.",How to Cure Scabies," Any case of severe itching that lasts weeks or months could result from scabies.Signs of scabies include:


Intense itching, especially at night.Small red bumps (they may be pimple-like) appear on the skin like a rash. The rash can be on the whole body or limited to certain areas. Common places include the wrist, armpit, elbow between fingers, genital area, waist, and beltline. The rash can also have small blisters.Small burrow lines between the bumps. They are typically light gray and slightly raised.Norwegian scabies, or ""crusted scabies,"" is a particularly severe form. Signs of crusted scabies include thick crusts on the skin that crumble easily and may appear greyish. They contain hundreds of thousands of mites and eggs.Crusted scabies is rare and typically seen in patients with suppressed immune systems
Be particularly vigilant of these symptoms if you have been in contact with anyone infected with scabies.;
, It is important that you visit your doctor. Over-the-counter and home remedies will not treat the infestation completely.The doctor will usually only need to see the rash to diagnose the condition. He might also take a sample by scraping under the bumps and looking for the presence of mites, eggs, and feces under the microscope.
Be sure to tell your doctor if you are pregnant or have any problems such as serious illness, or other severe skin diseases.

, If your itching is severe, you may want to treat it on your own while waiting for your doctor's appointment or prescription. Soaking in cold water or applying calamine lotion may provide relief from itching.You can also use over-the-counter oral antihistamines, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl).

, Once diagnosed, your doctor will usually prescribe a mite-killing cream or lotion containing five percent Permethrin. Always follow your doctor's and pharmacist's instructions exactly when using the cream.


Permethrin is topically applied and has a few side effects such as burning/stinging and itching.Permethrin only kills mites and not ova (eggs), so a second application is necessary for treatment. Two applications at least one week apart (this is how long it takes an egg to hatch) is the minimum treatment required to make sure it is eradicated.
For people with a severe infestation and weakened immune system, doctors may prescribe Ivermectin as an oral treatment. Ivermectin is an oral medication. It is generally used for crusted scabies and taken as a single one-time dose. Some doctors may prescribe a second dose after one week. Side effects of Ivermectin include fever/chills, headache, loss of appetite, joint pain and rash.Your doctor may prescribe other creams instead of the Permethrin. These include Crotamiton 10%, Lindane 1%, or sulfur 6%. These are less common, and are used if a patient has failed treatment with Permethrin or Ivermectin. Treatment failure is frequent with Crotamiton. Side effects of Crotamiton include rash and itching. Lindane is toxic if overused or misused. Side effects of Lindane include seizures, and rash., Several herbs are traditionally used for treating scabies. There is little proof that these remedies are effective — most evidence is anecdotal, or people saying they were helpful, but there is no scientifically backed evidence to support their use. Currently the only proven remedy is prescription medication. Do not rely on these treatments alone. Talk to your doctor before trying any herbal remedies, including the following:


Devil's horsewhip or prickly chaff flower (Achyranthes aspera)Neem (Azadirachta indica)Karanja (Pongamia pinnata)Turmeric (Curcuma longa)
Blue gum or camphor oil (Eucalyptus globulus)Fig bark powder ('Ficus carica, Ficus racemosa, Ficus benghalensis), Wait a while for your body to cool down some from the shower before applying your medication., Unless a medical professional advised you otherwise, start behind the ears and from the jawline and work your way down. Apply using cotton wool swabs, a paintbrush, a sponge, or any item supplied with the treatment for the purpose.


Continue rubbing the cream downward, over your entire body.Avoid the eyes, nose, and mouth area, but apply everywhere else. You must cover your genitals, soles of your feet, between your toes, back, and buttocks. Get help for areas you're not able to reach yourself.
After covering your body, take care of your hands. Apply between the fingers and under your nails. You will need to reapply the cream to your hands every time you wash them.

, Leave the lotion or oil on your body for the amount of time directed. This is usually between eight to 24 hours.The length of time you'll need to leave the medication on your skin will depend on the product and your doctor's instructions.

, Once the allotted time is up, wash off the medication under a warm shower.Be aware that you may remain itchy for a few weeks after the treatment.


This is because your allergic reaction to the mites continues while the dead mites bodies remain in the skin. If it's concerning you, speak with your doctor again.

, All household members need treatment on the same day, even if they aren't showing signs of scabies. This will prevent reinfestation.Don't forget visitors to your house. This includes family members staying for any length of time, babysitters, and other visitors.

, The cream is usually one application with a repeat application after seven days. But, this will depend on your doctor or pharmacist's instructions. Be sure to follow the prescription.


You'll probably have a check-up visit in a few weeks to address your progress.You're not done yet. Cleaning your house the same day you use the treatment is vital for preventing a new infestation.Keep reading for instructions.

, To prevent reinfestation after treatment, it's vital to thoroughly clean your home the same day you applied the treatment. A scabies mite can live for one to three days off the body.Cleaning will ensure that remaining mites are killed.


Disinfect the floor and bathroom surfaces by mopping (you only need to do this after the first treatment).

Vacuum floors, carpets, and rugs. Dispose of the bag or contents in an outside trash can immediately and dispose of as quickly as possible.Bleach the mop after each clean.
If you can steam clean the carpet.

, Wash bedding daily until you’ve not seen new bumps for at least a week.Wear disposable gloves when stripping beds.


If you have a heavy comforter, you can place it in a airtight bag for 72 hours.Dry clothing and bedding in a hot dryer or on the clothesline in hot weather under direct sunlight. Dry cleaning is also appropriate.
Put blankets in the dryer before bed every night until you're certain the infestation has ceased.

, Store clothes that you cannot wash in the airtight bag for 72 hours to one week.The same approach will work for stuffed animals, brushes, combs, shoes, coats, gloves, hats, robes, wetsuits, etc. Vacuum bags are widely available that are airtight and take up little space.
Bag all clothing the moment you remove it.

, If you're still itching after six weeks, this can indicate that the treatment has not worked. See your doctor for more advice and new treatment options.

Recognize PHN.,
Watch out for complications.,
Seek medical treatment.,
Get the shingles vaccine.,
Take care of your overall health.",How to Live With Shingles2," One out of five people with shingles will develop post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). You may have PHN if you are experiencing severe pain in the same area where you had your shingles rash.PHN can last for weeks or months. Some people can experience symptoms for years.The older you are, the more likely you are to develop PHN.If you experience pain when things touch your skin (e.g., clothes, wind, people), you may have PHN.If you wait too long to seek treatment, you may be more likely to develop PHN.

, While PHN is the most common complication, there are other complications such as pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.Scarring, bacterial skin infection, and local muscle weakness are also possible complications., If you think you are suffering from PHN or other shingles complications, you should go see your doctor. Your doctor will be able to develop a treatment plan to manage your complications. Your treatment plan will be focused on managing your chronic pain.Your treatment plan may include topical agents such as lidocaine, analgesics such as oxycodone, anti-convulsants such as gabapentin (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica), or psychosocial interventions.Many people may experience depression or other mental health issues when they deal with chronic pain. Your doctor may prescribe you antidepressants or recommend that you receive cognitive behavioral therapy. Your cognitive behavioral therapy may include relaxation techniques or hypnosis. Both of these techniques are effective for managing chronic pain., If you are 60 and older, you should get the shingles vaccine. Even though you have had shingles before, you should still get the vaccine.You can get the vaccine at your doctor's office or at the pharmacy.


Your shingles vaccine will be covered by Medicare Part D plans or your private health insurance.You should wait until your rash has disappeared before you get vaccinated. Talk with your doctor to decide the best time for you to get the vaccine., Living with shingles means that anything can trigger an outbreak, including stress, a lowered immune system, poor diet and exhaustion.While getting vaccinated is the only way to prevent shingles, having good overall health can help you avoid another outbreak and recover from shingles better.Eat a balanced diet and get plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
Exercise regularly and get plenty of rest.

Begin by soaking your feet.Get a bowl of warm to hot water and place both of your feet in it.,
Try a physical exfoliation brush.,
Use a pumice stone.If there are dead areas of skin of particular toughness, such as calluses, a pumice stone is an efficient way to shave them down and get rid of the dead skin.,
Finish by moisturizing the skin on the bottom of your feet.,
Get a pedicure.",How to Get Rid of Dead Skin2," Let them soak for five to 10 minutes before exfoliating. This will loosen calluses and prepare for the best results.


You can add some extra virgin olive oil to the water to increase the softening of your calluses.
After soaking them, pat your feet dry with a towel.

, Take a brush (you can buy a physical exfoliation brush at a cosmetics store) and rub it in gentle circular motions along the bottom of your foot. Focus particularly on the heel, and on other areas of hard or dead skin; this is an effective way to get rid of loose and/or dead skin.


Alternatives to using a brush include a foot file, or the Ped-Egg product that has been marketed as an effective means of physically exfoliating your feet. You can also try an exfoliation cream designed specifically for your feet.,


Be sure to wash the pumice stone after use and to let it air dry before your next use.

, After exfoliating, using a moisturizing agent can help to ensure optimum protection for the new skin and will keep it healthier for longer. Put socks over the moisturizing agent to not slip while walking.

, If you do not want to do this yourself, you can always get a pedicure. During the pedicure they will soak your feet and trim your nails. Some only use a microdermabrasion to work on the hard spots while other will use a razor blade to shave off dead skin. They can also work on any calluses you have on your feet.

"
"
Use moisturizer liberally.,
Cover up in cold weather.,
Avoid overuse of harsh abrasives.,
Avoid long, hot showers.,
Consider switching your soap.,
Try a gentle steam bath.",How to Get Rid of Dead Skin3," Usually, your skin secretes natural oils to keep it soft, healthy, and moisturized; however, if something removes these oils or interferes with their production, your skin can get dry, flaky, and cracked. To soothe your skin once it dries out, apply a moisturizing lotion, cream, or balm often. These moisturizing solutions work by holding moisture close to the skin with a layer of oil or fat. Consider make lotion application part of your daily routine — for instance, you might try keeping a bottle of hand lotion at each of your kitchen and bathroom sinks so you can apply after each wash.


As a very general rule, the thicker the moisturizer, the more it will help your skin regain its moisture.Thus, thick creams, balms, and ""butters"" are usually more effective than thinner, watery lotions; however, these can sometimes leave you with an unpleasant ""greasy"" feeling. Try a few options to see what works best for you.

, In many parts of the world, winter means cold, dry air outside and hot, dry air (from a heating system) inside. Together, these conditions can be very tough on your skin, causing dryness, cracking, and irritation. One of the best ways to keep your skin safe in the winter is to keep it covered up with long sleeves and other skin- covering accessories. The less of your skin that's exposed to the dry, biting air, the less you'll have to deal with its dehydrating effects.

, Stronger abrasives (like pumice stones and stiff brushes) can sometimes be great for eliminating tough, built-up dead skin deposits; however, if used too often (or if used on sensitive skin), these abrasives can leave the skin red and raw, making it vulnerable to dryness and irritation in the long run. If you're noticing pain or redness after exfoliating, take a few days off from your daily routine, then switch to a milder abrasive.


For instance, if your stiff-bristled shower brush has been irritating your skin, try switching to a gentle washcloth, which should allow you to exfoliate at a much more manageable pace.

, Hot water, though relaxing, strips away essential oils from your skin and leaves it vulnerable to drying out. To avoid this, simply keep your water temperature warm, not hot, and limit your showers to a reasonable length — about 10 minutes or less. The cooler (and shorter) your shower, the less likely you are to dry out your skin.


The same principle applies to baths — shorter and cooler is best. You'll also want to avoid bubble baths and other soap-based soaks (except those known to be ""moisturizing""), as these can also strip your skin's natural oils.
Pat (rather than scrub) yourself dry after bathing. The back-and-forth action of a towel can remove natural oils loosened by the warm water and irritate delicate skin.

, Some soaps and cleaning products contain chemicals that can dry out sensitive skin and remove its natural protective oils. Alcohol-based soaps are especially bad. Although it's great for killing germs, alcohol can seriously dehydrate the skin.While good hand hygiene is crucial for preventing the spread of disease, you don't need to ruin your hands with harsh soaps to stay clean, so try switching to a milder soap (like Dove ""Sensitive Skin"") or one billed as ""moisturizing"" to prevent dry, cracked skin.

, For some, spending a few minutes in a steam room or sauna can help soften dry skin, unclog pores, and, most importantly, just feels great. If you have access to a professional-quality steam room, consider spending a few minutes to a half hour or so in the steam room occasionally as part of your weekly routine.


Stay safe when using a steam room or sauna — never stay in longer than is comfortable, never raise the heat so high that it's hard for you to breathe or stay awake, and, most importantly, never combine sauna time and alcohol use."

Assess your nerves.,
Rehearse beforehand.,
Talk positively to yourself.,
Don’t rush.,
Avoid caffeine.",How to Calm a Nervous Stomach1," In order to know how to best calm your nervous stomach, it is a good idea to evaluate your symptoms. This will help you understand what kind of nervous stomach you have and focus on finding the best ways to calm yourself down. The most common nervous stomach symptoms include:Feeling a knot in the pit of your stomach.
A fluttering, butterfly feeling.
A rolling, churning feeling.
Feeling nauseous, queasy, or bloated.
A tight, warm feeling in your stomach.;
, Sometimes you can relieve some nerves by simply feeling more confident in a given situation. Whether you are giving a presentation, going on a first date, or interviewing for a job, practicing beforehand can you feel less anxious.Try to imagine the situation you are nervous about and see yourself successfully and confidently meeting your goals. Do some research so that you feel knowledgeable about the topic, and be sure to go over any talking points you have. Just don't plan everything super specifically as this will give you even more to worry about.

, Before an activity that gives you a nervous stomach, many people also experience racing thoughts. These thoughts are usually negative and only cause even more anxiety and cramping. Stopping these thoughts completely with techniques like meditation can take a lot of time to master. A quick, effective fix for racing, negative thoughts is to turn them into positive affirmations.For example, try repeating to yourself:


“I am enough and I can handle this.""
“I am the best candidate for this job. I am qualified and professional.”
“I want to succeed, and I am going to succeed.”

, Feeling rushed will only make you feel more panicked and anxious. If you give yourself enough time to gather your materials and get to a place early, this can help you feel on top of things and in control. This extra time will also give you longer to calm down and use the restroom, which will help your nervous stomach. Just keep in mind that if you get to a place more than 15 minutes early, you should plan on waiting outside the venue because arriving too early can be an inconvenience.

, Caffeine is a type of stimulant and will amplify the effects of adrenaline in a stressful situation, as it activates your sympathetic nerve system and can induce a ""fight-or-flight"" response.Certain sources of caffeine, like coffee and energy drinks, are also known to cause stomach irritation. Cutting back on caffeine before any stressful situation will not only put less stress on your nervous stomach, it will also help to eliminate any nervous adrenaline jitters. Try drinking an ice-cold glass of water instead; ice water will help you feel refreshed, wake you up, and keep you hydrated.

Learn some breathing techniques.,
Use aromatherapy to help you relax.,
Eat foods that calm the stomach.,
Try to relax your body one part at a time.,
Treat your symptoms with medicine.",How to Calm a Nervous Stomach2," Focusing on your breathing and taking deep, relaxing breaths is one of the easiest ways to calm a nervous stomach. Most people, when they are nervous, have a tendency to take shallow, rapid breaths that speed up your heart rate even more, pumping more adrenaline to your body and fueling your anxiety.Learning to calm your breathing will help you breathe more efficiently, reduce the effects of adrenaline, and calm your nervous stomach.


Try breathing in through your nose, then exhaling through your mouth.

, Aromatherapy uses essential oils, which are derived from various herbs, fruits, bark, and flowers, to positively affect your mood.Lavender and lemon are two of the most popular oils used for relaxation and stress relief. You can either keep these scented oils in burners throughout your house, or you can also purchase aromatherapy massage oils with lavender or lemon for personal use. You can either take light sniffs of the oil or apply the oil to pulse points on your body, like the wrists.

, To help offset a nervous stomach, there are specific foods that contain enzymes and other properties that can relax the digestive tract. If you are really nauseous and don’t feel like eating at all, seek these ingredients out in the form of a mint or lozenge so you can just let it melt in your mouth:Honey is soothing and helps coat the stomach lining.
Mint and peppermint, which contain properties that relax smooth muscles like the stomach.
Ginger and candied ginger, which contain pyrochemicals that help fight nausea.
1 teaspoon of baking soda dissolved into 1 cup of hot water. The sodium in baking soda draws out digestive juices into the stomach, which then aids food’s passage through the small intestine.
Papaya, which contains protein digestive enzymes that have anti-inflammatory properties.

, This is also known as progressive muscle relaxation. When you are feeling tense and your stomach is in a knot, try standing still with your eyes closed. Assess where you feel the most tension in your body, and focus on letting this tension go. Take deep breaths as you relax your arms, your legs, your back, your neck, your torso, and your stomach. Focusing on your body instead of your thoughts can help calm you down. Doing this technique repeatedly can also trick the body into releasing this tension throughout the body, including the stomach., While you never want to take medicine if you can avoid it, sometimes a nervous stomach can be so extreme or persistent that it becomes necessary. If the non-medicinal techniques aren’t working for you, there are some medications that can help calm the stomach. Common over-the-counter examples include:Tums
Pepto-Bismol
Rolaids
Alka-Seltzer
Emetrol
Mylanta
Similac

Keep the area clean.,
Secure the drains.",How to Care for (Jackson Pratt) JP Drains," Following your surgery, you may have drainage from the wound that needs to be removed to prevent fluid, hematoma, and/or abscesses from forming. Being able to monitor the drainage also lets you watch for developing complications after your surgery. JP drains work by gentle suction which pulls out the drainage from the wound. This is done by a closed bulb system, which creates suction when the air is squeezed out of the bulb and the cap tightened.


While drains promote healing and remove fluids, they should not be left in for long periods of time, as this can cause complications.;
, A JP drain is made up of a three-part connected system made up of a catheter tubing. This tubing has a flattened part with holes in it to collect the drainage. During surgery, the drain is sewn about an inch deep into the cavity that needs drainage usually with silk suture (stitches). The rest of the tubing exits the body and connects to the bulb, which has a suction seal cap attached. This is what you'll open to empty the drainage.When you use the JP drain, you'll squeeze the suction bulb to make pressure that pulls the fluid from the wound. When you empty the JP drain, the bulb will expand since you'll have just released the plastic cap creating the closed system.

, Your surgeon or the medical staff will explain the important role you have in caring for your wound. Following surgery, you'll need to make sure the wound is healing as expected, monitor the drainage amount and type, watch for signs of infection, look for any dislodged JP drains or catheter tip, and care for the drainage site every eight to 12 hours (or as prescribed by your surgeon).


Since the bulb needs appropriate suction to function, you'll generally have to empty it when it's half full., Collect all the items you will need: your log sheet, thermometer, measuring cup, several gauze pads, and scissors. Make sure you're somewhere near a stable work area with access to a water source. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.For example, you might use a counter in your bathroom.

, Cut your gauze pads halfway to the center, so that they can easily wrap around the drains. These will protect the catheter from rubbing against your wound site. Un-pin your drains from your clothing. Consider wearing something with pockets at waist-height, such as a robe, to place your drains in once you've emptied them.


Only cut the gauze pads for the number of drains you have (one to two). Leave the other pads intact for cleaning purposes.

, Uncap the bulb of the JP and pour the contents into your measuring cup. Calculate how many ccs or mls of fluid were drained and record the amount on your data log. Dispose of the fluid in the toilet. Once the bulb is empty, wipe the cap with alcohol, squeeze it while replacing the cap. This should create suction and the bulb should look indented. Do not try to rinse the drain out.Remember to make note of any unusual characteristics of the fluid (cloudy, brown, or smelly discharge, which might also merit a call to your doctor)., Gently remove the tape and gauze so that you don't place tension on your stitches. Look for any signs of infection (pus, warmth, redness, swelling) and note them in your log.Take a full-sized gauze pad and moisten it with alcohol. Clean the area, moving away from the wound so you don't introduce bacteria into it. Or, use a clockwise pattern, circling from inside to the outermost edges. If you need to re-clean an area, use a new gauze and start over. Let the area air dry.


If you noticed any signs of infection (like fever, chills, pus, redness, or swelling at the site) remember to call your surgeon's office.

, Once the area is dry, take your pre-cut gauze pads. Keeping the flattened tip of the JP drain flat and flush next to your body, encircle the catheter with the gauze. Secure the gauze with adhesive tape, making sure there's no friction or rubbing of the tubing at the wound area. Empty the drains and wash the area every eight to 12 hours, or as recommended by your surgeon.


Place your drains at waist level or lower than your wound. Gravity will help push the fluid into your JP drains.

, Usually, the drainage is bloody following surgery, but as time passes it should become straw-colored, then clear. The drainage should never look cloudy or like pus. Notice the amount of drainage for every 24 hours. Your doctor should have given you a marked plastic container so you can track how many cubic centimeters (cc) or milliliters (ml) of fluid were drained. Check this every time you empty the JP drain, usually every eight to 12 hours. The amount of fluid should decrease as time passes.


You'll probably also be given a data sheet, to log the amount at the time of drainage.
Usually drains can be pulled (by your surgical staff) when drainage is less than 30 – 100 cc in 24 hours., It is important that you have good communication with your surgeon and the staff. You'll need to attend follow-up appointments for wound observation and drainage removal. You should also report any issues or concerns you have. If you notice any of the following, get call your doctor:Edges of the wound are red
Pus or thick drainage
Foul odor coming from the incision/insertion site
Fever, greater than 101°F (38.3°C)
Pain at surgical site

, Bathing and showering can be challenging with JP drains, but with some help you should be able to gently clean the site. Be sure to get your doctor's permission before bathing or showering, especially if you still have bandages. If you're allowed to bathe or shower, gently wash the area and make sure it's completely dry when you're done. If you're not allowed to bathe or shower, carefully clean the area around the drain using a washcloth or gauze.If you need additional help, communicate this to the office staff for a visiting nurse referral. Some surgeons will have a visiting nurse come out daily to help you with a sponge bathe and washing your hair.Or consider having a family member help you bathe.

, Use a safety pin and attach the pin through the plastic loop on top of the JP bulb. Wear loose fitting clothing and attach your drains to your clothing, like a loose shirt. Pin the drains to anchor them. This way, they won't get tangled or pulled out. JP drains that are attached to clothing may also feel more comfortable.You might try using a fanny pack to secure the JP drains around your waist.
Avoid pinning them to your pants. If you accidentally forget they're there, you may pull down your pants and remove the drains.

Avoid highly processed foods.,
Give kids filtered water.,
Focus on serving organic, non-GMO foods.,
Serve foods that are rich in probiotics.,
Provide children with a probiotic supplement.,
Feed kids plenty of fiber.,
Let kids play outside and get dirty.,
Watch for the signs of poor gut health.,
Consult your children’s pediatrician about gut bacteria.",How to Balance Gut Bacteria in Children," Overly processed items often contain relatively few nutrients in general, and could reduce levels of healthy gut bacteria if consumed in large amounts. Processed foods also contain few nutrients and probiotics, which are necessary for a healthy gut. Excessive consumption of processed foods has also been linked to increases in intestinal inflammation.It can be difficult to get kids to eat non-processed, naturally colored foods, as children are often drawn towards the attractive coloring and mild tastes of processed foods. Try gradually weaning your kids off of processed food. For example, allow kids to have mac and cheese or chicken nuggets for dinner some days, but insist that they eat an apple or banana beforehand.;
, If you live in an urban area, your tap water will likely be treated with chemicals such as chlorine. Chlorine can kill off potentially harmful bacteria in tap water, but can also kill off healthy gut bacteria when ingested.Instead of giving kids straight tap water, filter tap water through a high-quality, carbon-based filter. This will remove most of the chlorine from tap water and encourage healthy levels of gut bacteria.


Carbon-based water filters can be purchased at your local kitchen-supply store, and may also be available at grocery stores. Brands such as Kenmore, Paragon, and Aquasana make carbon-based water filtration systems. You could also purchase a pitcher-sized water filter, which will be less expensive and does not require installation.
You can also buy bottled water from your local grocery store. Bottled water is relatively inexpensive if bought in gallon-sized jugs.

, In many cases, genetically modified foods have been sprayed with pesticides that, when ingested, can harm gut bacteria and diminish digestive-system health in both children and adults. To avoid this, serve organic foods that have not been treated with pesticides such as Glyphosate.Not all GMO foods are marked as such on the packaging, so you’ll need to focus on buying items marked “organic.”


Common GMO foods include corn, soy, and canola oil. Look for organic versions of these foods at your local grocery store or health-food store. Also shop for organic fruits and vegetables, as non-organic veggies and fruits are commonly treated with pesticides.

, Probiotics provide live bacteria that help develop a healthy balance of gut bacteria in your children’s digestive systems. Dairy products are especially high in probiotics; plan to serve children plenty of yogurt that contains ""live and active cultures"" and aged cheeses, especially gouda and cheddar.Probiotics are also commonly found in fermented products. If you children are not picky eaters, try feeding them dishes which contain apple cider vinegar, sauerkraut, tempeh, or kefir (a yogurt-like dish).

, In addition to serving probiotic-rich foods, you can also give your children a probiotic supplement to boost bacteria levels. If your children are picky eaters and do not want to eat non-processed foods and vegetables, plan to give them a daily probiotic pill. Although probiotic supplements do not require a prescription to purchase, consult your children’s pediatrician before starting the kids on supplements.Probiotic supplements are available at most health-food stores or behind the pharmacy counter. As they contain live bacteria, the supplements need to be refrigerated. Look for a tablet form of probiotic, such as Nature’s Bounty Acidophilus Probiotic. These will not be marked with a specific dosage (as probiotics are not technically medicinal).
Alternately, look for a probiotic in packets which can be mixed into children’s food. Most probiotic packets will be marked “for kids,” including brands Culturelle for Kids and Florastor Kid.

, Fibrous foods encourage healthy digestion by filling children’s stomachs and intestines with prebiotics: the food source which probiotic bacteria feed on. Children who eat prebiotic fibrous food will have a more receptive gut to probiotic bacteria, and will develop more balanced gut health overall. Feed children fibers like artichokes, asparagus, leeks, and onions.If you children shy away from the strong flavors and distinct textures of these fibers, substitute more child-friendly prebiotic fibers, including bananas and tomatoes and grains such as barley and rye.

, While it may seem counterintuitive, allowing your children to play outside and cover themselves in dirt and mud can have health benefits. If children are exposed to naturally-occurring bacteria and germs from a young age, they may develop stronger immune systems and have a healthier variety of digestive-system bacteria. While children should still bathe regularly, you don’t need to be overly concerned with keeping them germ-free at all times.To cultivate healthy bacteria in your children’s guts, also avoid washing their hands with antibacterial soap, which can kill off healthy bacteria as well as unhealthy germs.

, If children have a deficit of healthy gut bacteria, they may exhibit one or more of the following signs: excessive gas, diarrhea, or nausea. In more serious cases of imbalanced gut bacteria, children may develop irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease, and may experience serious weight loss, bloating, abdominal pain, or even blood in the stool.While changing your child’s diet and increasing their probiotic consumption can improve their gut health, these symptoms can occur for reasons unrelated to gut health. If dietary modification doesn’t clear up the symptoms, schedule an appointment with your child’s doctor.

, Whether or not you’ve noticed signs and symptoms of imbalanced gut bacteria levels, it’s a good idea to ask your child’s doctor about ways you can promote balanced levels of gut bacteria. Ask if they recommend specific dietary changes (including ones you may not have considered), and ask their opinion on probiotic supplements for children.If your children are experiencing uncommon problems with their gut health, the pediatrician may provide a referral to a nutritionist or a gastroenterologist.

Wash your hands often.,
Avoid contact with a sick person.,
Use bottled water while traveling.",How to Avoid the Stomach Flu1," Wash your hands carefully with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Always wash your hands after going to the washroom and before and after handling food and eating. This will help to prevent the spread of germs. Germs on your hands can get into your eyes, ears, and nose and make you sick. Wash your hands with warm water and soap, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds.
If you are not able to wash your hands you can use a hand sanitizer as a substitute. However, soap and water is the best method to ward off germs. ;
, If you know of someone who has the flu it is best to keep your distance and avoid any close contact. The stomach flu can easily spread from person-to-person through direct contact. For example, if someone in your family is sick you should create a separate sick room. This is typically a bedroom where the person can rest privately so that they do not contaminate the rest of the house.
If having a separate room is not possible, avoid sharing eating utensils, glasses and plates. Use separate towels in the bathroom.

, It is quite common to develop a stomach flu while traveling. Frequently this is a result of drinking water that is contaminated. Purchasing bottled water, although more expensive, can help to prevent getting a nasty bug while traveling. A few other travel tips include: Avoiding ice cubes because they could be made using a contaminated water source.
Don’t eat raw fruits and vegetables that may have been washed using a contaminated water source.
Use bottled water to brush your teeth when traveling in a developing countries.
Avoid drinking untreated surface water from a lake or stream.

Seek medical attention.",How to Avoid Getting Cholera when Traveling," Cholera is most often passed through drinking or using water that has cholera bacteria in it. Getting your water from sources that you know are safe and clean can help you avoid contracting cholera.Adequate chlorination of local water supplies is essential. Even if water is treated with chlorine, if it is not enough (parts per million dose), then even treated water can pass on the cholera bacteria and infection can result. When in doubt, opt for boiled drinking water.
Ask your host or accommodations if the water has been boiled, bottled or chemically treated. If he or she is unsure, seek a source that you know is safe. Use the same procedure for bottled or canned carbonated beverages.
Check the seal of bottled and canned drinks to make sure that the seal isn’t broken. If it is, opt for a bottle or can that is clearly sealed. Consider wiping off the outside of the container before drinking bottled or canned beverages.Stay away from tap water and fountain drinks as they could contain contaminated water.Avoid ice cubes at all costs, as this can transmit the bacteria easily.;
, You may not be able to find or access clean water sources. If this is the case, you can also safely disinfect your own water through methods such as boiling or filtering it.Disinfect your water by:


Boiling it for one minute
Filtering it and adding two drops of household bleach or ½ iodine tablet per liter.

, You may also find yourself in a remote area, perhaps while you are hiking, with no supplies such as a filter, bleach, or pot and pan. In these cases, you can use water purification tablets or powders. These are small and easy to carry. You may want to purchase them before you leave, as they may not be available once you are abroad.


Read the package labeling to see the strength of your specific purification tablet or powder. Consult the chart on the package to learn how many tabs you’ll need to purify the water you want to use. Remove the tablet from the strip and put it in the water. Stir with a clean utensil and cover your water. Wait 30 minutes before drinking and make sure to consume all of the water within 24 hours of purification.
Consider using a chlorine liquid purifier called Dlo Lavi if you are in Haiti. Use one capful of the product per 5 gallons (20 liters) in clear water or two capfuls per 5 gallons (20 liters) if the water is very dirty or cloudy. As with purification tabs, stir the water with a clean utensil and cover it while waiting 30 minutes for your disinfected water. Again, make sure to use all of the purified water within 24 hours.

, Whenever you disinfect or purify water, it’s important that it remains clean. Covering any purified source with a tight light can protect the water and ensure that it remains safe to use. This is also the case for sources like bottled water or canned beverages.

, Just as drinking water contaminated with the cholera bacteria can make you sick, so can eating food prepared or cleaned in contaminated water. Try and eat only foods cooked freshly and completely through. Make sure any dishes are hot when they arrive to you.Make sure any food you purchase from street vendors is cooked in front of you and is served hot.
Stay away from any raw or undercooked meats and seafood.This includes sushi.You may want to avoid all seafood in endemic areas.
Consider pre-packaged foods if you are unsure of a food source., Most people love fruits and vegetables, which can also be a good alternative for a person who may not like or be unsure of meat. But just as it’s important to eat thoroughly cooked foods, so it is to check your fruits and vegetables to ensure they are not contaminated with cholera.Stay away from unpeeled fruits and vegetables. This includes salads or dishes with fruits like grapes and berries. If any unpeeled fruits or vegetables are in a dish, make sure they’re thoroughly cooked.Consider sticking to fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself such as bananas, oranges, and avocados.

, Dairy foods such as ice cream are often contaminated with cholera. Staying away from dairy products and unpasteurized milk may minimize your risk of cholera. If you want to consume dairy, make sure it comes from a known source and is both sealed and pasteurized before consumption., If you are traveling to a specific region of the world that still experiences cholera outbreaks, it may be useful to check to see if there is a current cholera outbreak. This can remind you to be extra vigilant about taking preventative measures to avoid contracting cholera.


Call the country’s embassy or local consulate or consult its website. Either may be able to provide you with information on cholera outbreaks. The United States Department of State provides a list of all embassies and consulates in the US at http://www.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/dpl/32122.htm.
Consult the websites of international organizations that track health issues and often have information on current cholera outbreaks. These include the World Health Organization or International Committee of the Red Cross.You can also call the CDC at 877-FYI-TRIP (394-8747) or visit their website for travelers at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel.

, If you’re in areas with a known cholera outbreak or with unsanitary water, it’s important to be especially vigilant about washing your hands. This can minimize your risk of contracting the disease or spreading it to someone else. You can use either soap and water or hand cleanerWash with clean water and soap. Rub your soapy, wet hands together for at least 20 seconds. Clean between your fingers, under your nails, and up your wrists. Make sure to rinse thoroughly.Use an alcohol-based hand cleanser if no water is available. Make sure that is at least 60% alcohol. Consider buying sanitizer before you leave so that you have it on hand if you get into a situation where you don’t have water but can’t buy sanitizer.Make sure to clean your hands when you prepare food, before you eat, and any time you use the restroom.

, Dishes washed in water contaminated with cholera can also infect food placed on them, and in turn you. Make sure that you or anyone with whom you are traveling washes dishes in bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water., You’ll need to maintain your own hygiene while traveling and brushing your teeth is a vital part of that. Brushing your teeth with water from unknown or dirty sources can also increase your risk of getting cholera.Remember that exposure to even a small amount of water contaminated with cholera can infect you, even if it’s just to brush your teeth.
Use only bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water to brush your teeth. If these aren’t available, consider carrying some portable brushes that have toothpaste that you can chew or even chewing a piece of gum. Use these until you can find a safe water source to brush your teeth.

, There is a relatively low risk of contracting cholera when you are traveling and most doctors don’t recommend getting vaccinated. If you are especially concerned about the disease or going to be in an area with a cholera outbreak for an extended period, such as doing missionary or humanitarian work, you may want to consider getting a cholera vaccine. Be aware that the traditional injected version is only minimally effective at preventing cholera. In addition, the two oral vaccines are not available in the United States.Talk to your doctor or local health care provider if you are interested in the vaccines. The two oral cholera vaccines that the WHO has prequalified are Dukoral and ShanKoe.
Be aware that no country requires immunization for cholera as a condition of entry.

, If you show any of the signs or symptoms of cholera, get to a doctor immediately. Cholera can quickly turn fatal, even in the healthiest individuals. Seeing a doctor can ensure you get proper and prompt treatment if you do have cholera or another disease.Tell the doctor why you are visiting the office. Let him or her know what your symptoms are and when they started. You may also want to inform the doctor if you’ve had any dirty water and if you’ve been using methods such as purification tabs to clean your water.
The symptoms of cholera include large volume depletion through rice-water-colored diarrhea. It is imperative that supportive measures be taken to replenish hydration and electrolyte loss, as dehydration can be fatal.

Clean any contaminated surfaces.,
Wash laundry frequently.,
Remove any contaminated trash immediately.,
Use separate personal items.,
Make sure childcare facilities are clean.,
Keep your workspace clean.",How to Avoid the Stomach Flu2," If someone in your household has the stomach flu it is a good idea to keep all hard surfaces clean and disinfected in order to prevent the spread of the flu. You can use a number of disinfectant cleaners or a mixture of two cups bleach to one gallon of water. Surfaces to pay attention to include: Counters
Doorknobs
Faucets
Tables
Toys

, You can help prevent the spread of the stomach flu by washing all laundry that comes into contact with the flu. For example, sheets, towels, and linens used by a sick person in your household should be washed immediately. You should also wash all linens and cloth that come in direct contact with vomit or bile.


Handle these materials carefully and quickly place them in the washing machine without shaking them and potentially spreading the germs.
Wear rubber gloves while touching contaminated linens to protect yourself.
Wash your hands immediately after handling.

, A good way to prevent the flu from spreading within your home is by taking out the garbage frequently. For example, tissues, vomit, and bile should be cleaned up quickly and removed from the house. Always wash your hand after handling contaminated waste.

, In order to prevent the spread of the flu you should always use your own personal items. Don't share utensils, plates, toothbrushes, or towels. These items come in close contact with your mouth and should not be shared especially with someone showing flu symptoms. , If your child goes to daycare or another childcare facility, make sure there are separate areas for diaper change and for food preparation to avoid cross contamination. The transmission of the virus is fecal to oral, so it is important these things are kept separate.

, It is quite common to come into contact with the flu while outside of the home, particularly at work. You should do your best to maintain a clean workspace by disinfecting your office supplies regularly and washing your hands frequently while at work.


Take care to wipe down items such as your keyboard and phone.

Wash fruits and vegetables.,
Refrigerate meat and store properly.,
Avoid preparing food for others while you are sick.,
Eat healthy foods and stay hydrated.",How to Avoid the Stomach Flu3," Make sure to always wash your fruits and vegetables before serving them. This is even more important if your food may have been in contact with someone who has the flu. The stomach flu can spread very easily onto food products if they are handled by someone who is sick. Because foods are often handled by multiple people before reaching your home it is always a good idea to wash fresh foods before serving. Some fruits and vegetables can also be contaminated while being harvested. , Make sure that you keep your meats refrigerated before cooking and eating. Refrigeration helps prevent the growth of bacteria that can cause the stomach flu. Meats should also be eaten within a few days of purchase if left uncooked and in the refrigerator.

, If you are sick with the flu you should not prepare food. In fact, you shouldn’t handle food until all of your symptoms have disappeared for at least two days. The flu can easily be transmitted between people and taking extra precautions can help prevent the spread of the virus. , Drinking enough water and eating a well-balanced diet of fruits/vegetables, grains, dairy, and protein keeps you healthy and feeling good. Maintaining a healthy diet full of vitamins can even help to keep your immune system strong and prevent illnesses such as the flu. Some foods to try include: Foods that contain vitamin C. It is found in citrus fruits and some vegetables such as oranges and red bell peppers. It can help to prevent illnesses by strengthening cells to kill viruses.
Carrots, which contain beta-carotene which converted into vitamin A in the body and helps boost immune systems.
Almonds, which are an excellent source of vitamin E which is an antioxidant that fights the flu.
The recommended fluid intake in temperate climates are 13 cups (3 liters) of water a day for men and 9 cups (2.1 liters) for women

Utilize supportive treatment.,
Watch out for signs of the stomach flu.,
Go to the doctor.",How to Avoid the Stomach Flu4," Most acute episodes of nausea and vomiting are caused by viral gastroenteritis and are self-limiting, meaning they will resolve without medication. Rest, eating healthy food as soon as possible, and rehydrating with water or electrolyte-rich sports drinks are usually the only treatment necessary. The cornerstones of treatment of stomach flu are management of hydration, electrolyte and nutrition.


In most cases medication is not necessary. Keep in mind that the flu is viral, so it cannot be treated with antibiotics.

, Some of the main symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, headaches, muscle aches, vomiting, fever, chills, fatigue, and dizziness. If you notice these symptoms in any of your family members or yourself it is important to keep your distance in order to contain the flu and not spread the virus., Typically the stomach flu should only last a few days; however, because the effects of dehydrations can be especially serious for infants, young children and pregnant women, these patients should seek medical attention at the onset of the stomach virus. If you are a healthy adult, utilize supportive therapy. If your symptoms persist after 10 days you should seek medical attention.

Estimate the length of your stool.,
Consider the width of your stool.,
Note the consistency of your stool.",How to Analyze Poop1," The optimal length of a bowel movement should be about 12 inches in length. Stool that is significantly shorter, such as round pellets, indicates constipation. Increase your dietary fiber intake and stay hydrated., If your stool starts to become consistently narrow, talk to your doctor. Thinning bowel movements indicate an obstruction in your large intestine. Your bowel may be blocked by a foreign object or a tumor., Your bowel movement should be smooth, solid, and a little fluffy.


Bowel movements that break apart easily or are mostly liquid indicate diarrhea. This may be caused by a wide range of health problems including infectious disease, inflammation, nutrient malabsorption, or even psychological stress.
Bowel movements that are lumpy, hard, and difficult to pass indicate constipation."
"
Figure out your stool's baseline color.,
Look for signs of blood.,
Try not to be alarmed by other odd colors unless they persist.",How to Analyze Poop2," The ideal flavor is medium brown, but some variation can be found among healthy people.


Green or yellow stool is usually caused by your bowels moving too fast, as with mild diarrhea. Bile, the main pigment in poop, starts out green and turns brown over time.
Pale gray or yellow feces may indicate liver disease., Take note of any stool that is red or pitch black in color.


Bright red indicates bleeding late in the digestive tract, likely the large intestine or anus. This type of bleeding typically indicates non-serious health issues, such as minor inflammation or hemorrhoids. It can also rarely be a sign of cancer. Talk to your doctor if it happens multiple times or if your bowel movements become painful.
Bleeding higher up in the digestive system, such as from the stomach or small intestine, produces feces that are extremely dark red or black in color. It will also have a sticky, tar-like consistency. If you pass this type of stool, talk to your doctor. It could be a sign of a variety of serious problems ranging from peptic ulcers to bowel cancer.Eating beets can also stain your poop red. However, beet red is fairly easy to distinguish from blood red. If the red has a magenta or fuchsia tinge, it is almost certainly from beets or food coloring, not blood., Almost all transient causes of changes to stool color can be traced back to food coloring. Even if you don't remember eating a food with a particular color, dyes may be hidden or masked by other colors more easily broken down. Food coloring may also interact with other pigments in the digestive tract to produce unexpected results."
"
Track your bowel movement frequency.,
Determine stool buoyancy.,
Take note of particularly foul-smelling bowel movements.",How to Analyze Poop3," A healthy digestive system will result in ""regular"" bowel movements. However, ""regular"" is a relative term. Figure out your normal bowel movement frequency so you can be aware of changes that may be early warning signs of health problems.


Generally, a healthy frequency for bowel movements ranges from once every three days up to three times daily. Diarrhea is defined as more than three trips to the toilet in one day. Constipation, conversely, occurs when bowel movements are spaced more than three days apart., Healthy feces should slowly drift to the bottom of the toilet. If your bowel movement readily floats, your diet is likely to just be very high in fiber.


Pancreatitis causes impaired lipid absorption, leading to fatty floating stools. These bowel movements are extremely oily, releasing immiscible droplets into the toilet bowl., No poop is going to smell pleasant. In fact, a pungent smell can be indicative of healthy gut flora. However, certain health problems can cause feces that smell significantly stronger than usual. These include bloody stool, infectious diarrhea, and nutrient malabsorption syndromes."
"
Avoid being alarmed by meconium.,
Check the consistency.,
Notice the color.,
Be aware of frequency.,
Notice the smell.",How to Analyze Poop4," A baby's first bowel movement, called meconium, is usually passed within 24 hours after birth. Meconium is very dark green to black, thick, and sticky. It is made up of shed cells and debris that accumulated in the womb. Your baby should transition to more normal poops within two to four days., While a new baby's digestive system is maturing, they will produce stool that is very different from what is considered healthy in older children and adults. Because of their liquid diet, healthy infant bowel movements are not solid and should be the consistency of peanut butter or pudding. It is normal for formula-fed babies to produce thicker, bulkier poop than breastfed infants.


Diarrhea in infants is extremely watery and may leak past the diaper and onto your baby's back. Call your doctor if your baby has diarrhea and is under 3 months old, has had diarrhea for more than a day, or is exhibiting other symptoms like fever.Solid bowel movements are a sign of constipation. A sporadic pebbly diaper is no cause for alarm, but consult a doctor if it happens frequently. Severe constipation may be paired with diarrhea if the watery stool leaks past the hard blockage., Baby stools are generally lighter and can range from yellow to green to light brown. Do not be alarmed by color changes. As your baby's digestive system matures, changes to enzyme production and transit time will produce variety.


Dark brown is a sign of constipation.
Black stools after meconium is cleared can mean bleeding. Small flecks of black similar to poppy seeds are most likely caused by swallowed blood from an irritated nipple. Do not be alarmed if your baby is taking an iron supplement, as this also produces black stools.
Very pale yellow or chalky gray can be a sign of liver problems or infection., A healthy newborn baby will have anywhere from 1 to 8 bowel movements each day, with an average of 4. Like adults, each baby will have their own ""normal"" rhythm. However, talk to your doctor if your formula-fed baby has less than one bowel movement per day, or your breastfed baby has less than one every 10 days., Your baby's stools should smell less pungent, almost sweet. It is normal for formula-fed babies to have bowel movements that smell stronger than those of breastfed infants. Bowel movements should begin to smell more like an adult's once your baby transitions to solid food."

Talk to your doctor.,
Take synthetic thyroid hormones.,
Try natural thyroid hormones.",How to Boost Metabolism As a Thyroid Patient1," There are two types of thyroid patients. If your metabolism is too slow because your thyroid is not producing enough thyroid hormone, you suffer from hypothyroidism.If your metabolism is too fast, however, your thyroid is overactive and producing a surfeit of thyroid hormone. Only your doctor can help you determine if you have hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and whether boosting your metabolism as a thyroid patient is safe.If you are a thyroid patient with this second type of thyroid disorder (known as hyperthyroidism), you should not attempt to boost your metabolism, since it is already in high gear. Further metabolism boosts could complicate your condition and cause damage.
Only attempt to boost your metabolism if you are a thyroid patient with hypothyroidism.;
, The typical treatment for hypothyroidism – regular ingestion of the thyroid hormone levothyroxine – will boost your metabolism. Talk to your doctor about whether you might be able to receive levothyroxine and thereby boost your metabolism.Levothyroxine may cause heart palpitations, insomnia, shakiness, and an increased appetite.
You will need to take thyroid hormone at least a week or two before you notice your symptoms start to decline.
You will likely need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.

, Synthetic thyroid hormones are preferred by the medical community. But there are also natural sources of thyroid hormone made from pig gland extracts. Like their synthetic counterparts, they are available only with a prescription.The main difference between these hormones and the ones manufactured synthetically is that these contain triiodothyronine as well as thyroxine. The synthetic version contains only thyroxine.
Don’t confuse these natural extracts with glandular concentrates available in health stores. Glandular concentrates are not regulated by the FDA and their efficacy and purity cannot be guaranteed.
Be sure to talk to your doctor about starting a new supplement. They can recommend the best time to take your medication to promote metabolic health.

No matter the goal of the enema, the way in which it is administered is the same. However, if the goal is retention, then enemas are best done after a normal bowel movement. For constipation, the enema is given to help evacuate the bowel.


Empty your bladder before an enema to reduce the discomfort associated with adding fluid to the bowel.
Obtain an enema bag which is purchased from the pharmacy or a Fleets enema bottle. The first uses fluid prepared at home while the second is a self-contained unit purchased at the pharmacy.
Place a plastic cloth under the area where you will lie down in case you inadvertently release the fluid before reaching the bathroom.;
, The bag should have been cleaned from any previous use with hot, soapy water. You should never share an enema bag, even if it has been cleaned; each family member should have his own. Fill an enema bag with the desired solution as recommended by your doctor and warm water (see Part 2). Make sure that the clamp is on to contain the fluid. Once the bag is full, hold the bag, hose end down, and open the clamp momentarily to allow the fluid to purge any air from the hose to avoid introducing air which can cause cramps. Then close the clamp.In general, you use smaller amounts of fluid for retention enemas so the rectum is not overwhelmed with the amount of fluid and the individual can retain it without discomfort. Your doctor will instruct you on how full the bag should be.
Make sure you have a method of hanging the bag so someone doesn’t have to hold it up. The administration of fluid in a bag uses gravity. Your best bet is to hang it on a stand near where you are going to administer it. It should be high enough so that the tube allows the fluid to flow easily, about 2 feet (0.6 m) above your rectum but no more than 3 feet (0.9 m) above.

, Measure and mark four inches on the enema tube so you are assured the tube is not inserted more than four inches into your rectum.Lubricate the end of the tube with a lubricating jelly, like KY jelly, to make insertion more comfortable.

, Lay down on your left side, with your knees pulled up to your chest. This changes the position of the lower colon so it is able to receive more fluid from the rectum. Anatomical positioning of the lower colon and gravity will help the fluid to go higher in the colon. Turn your head to one side, left arm under your head., Separate the buttocks and identify the anus, or the outside of the rectum, where the tube will be inserted. Slowly insert the end of the enema tube, or the lubricated end of a Fleet's enema bottle, into the rectum approximately 3.5 inches.While inserting the tube into the anus, bear down and push the anus out as if for a bowel movement.
Never force the tube in. If you can not get it in, do not continue trying. Call you physician to discuss what to do next.

, If using an enema bag, release the clamp and allow the fluid to fill inside. If using a Fleet's enema bottle, apply gentle pressure to the bottle. Gently roll the bottle from the bottom to the top so there is no backflow into the bottle., Breathe through your mouth if you feel cramps. Close the clamp temporarily, until cramping eases, then resume the flow. Watch the bag until it is empty and remove the nozzle. If using the Fleet's enema bottle, keep the bottle rolled and gently remove the tube., If suffering from constipation, try to keep in the lying down position for at least a few minutes and up to one hour before going to the bathroom and expelling the fluid..


If the enema was administered for retention and absorption, you may want to to stay on your left side for 10 minutes, roll to your back for 10 minutes and then your right side for 10 minutes to help the fluid move through the large colon.

, As with any medical treatment, there is the possibility that you may experience some side effects after administering an enema. During the procedure, you may experience a feeling of fullness and some discomfort. Cramps and gas may also persist for a few hours after the enema. Tell your doctor promptly if these symptoms continue any longer than a few hours after the enema has been administered.Using enemas too frequently can result in dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance. Although your body can absorb liquid from the rectum, it can also lose electrolytes from the blood if the fluid in the rectum is hypotonic (or has less electrolytes than in the blood) or can irritate the colon to expel more waste material than intended.
Dehydration can have serious side effects for both the heart and kidneys. Decreased urination, dry mouth, increased thirst, lack of tears, dizziness, lightheadedness, or pale and wrinkled skin can all be symptoms of dehydration.
An allergic reaction to any of the medications commonly used in enemas is rare. However, if you experience an allergic reaction, which involves symptoms such as a rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, or trouble breathing, call your physician immediately.

Start a food journal.,
Reduce consumption of chocolate.,
Moderate your drinking.,
Stop eating mint.,
Avoid fatty, greasy and spicy meals.Meals that are cooked in a lot of oil, deep fried or especially spicy can be difficult to digest.,
Replace your morning coffee with ginger tea.",How to Avoid Foods That Worsen Indigestion1," A food journal can help you keep track of the foods that cause your indigestion. You can keep your food journal as a handwritten notebook or use an application on your mobile device. Every day, write down everything you eat and drink, any symptoms of indigestion, and feelings or thoughts about your eating habits for the day.You can use a mobile application such as Evernote to record your eating patterns.;
, Chocolate can make indigestion worse.If you regularly eat chocolate as a snack and experience indigestion, try cutting chocolate from your diet.


Replace your afternoon chocolate bar with a chia seed bar. Chia seed granola bars are gluten free and have loads of antioxidants. However, please avoid chia bars if you have an intolerance to chia seeds.
Replace your afternoon chocolate bar with a candied ginger snack. Ginger helps the body deal with indigestion. Replacing chocolate with candied ginger will help you avoid indigestion.

, Alcohol is known to exasperate indigestion.If you cut down on your drinking, you may be able to bring your indigestion under control. It is possible to enjoy one or two drinks but one should avoid drinking excessively and avoid fizzy drinks as well as strong liquor and wine.Try replacing your evening beer or wine with a ginger tea. Ginger tea with honey is a relaxing drink that can help you calm your nerves. Ginger tea also helps your body deal with indigestion., Mint is known to make digestion worse.If you drink mojitos or other cocktails with mint, you may be asking your stomach to handle two indigestion culprits at once. Try avoiding mint or replacing it with alternative herbs. If you have a recipe that asks for a lot of mint, consider cooking a different dish.


You can replace the mint in your recipes with an equivalent amount of basil, rosemary or marjoram.You can also simply omit the mint in some recipes. If you are making a mint chocolate chip pancake recipe, you can simply omit the mint and enjoy chocolate chip pancakes. Alternately, you could replace the mint with basil and enjoy basil chocolate chip pancakes., Try to avoid foods that come out of the deep fryer and foods that are cooked in a lot of oil. French fries, onion rings, deep fried calamari, and stir fries are among the deep fried and oil rich foods that you might want to avoid.


If you are eating out, consider asking your server if there are any low fat and non-greasy options on the menu.

Talk to your doctor.,
Get the right amount of iodine.,
Look for foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Eat selenium-rich foods.,
Get an adequate amount of protein.,
Drink coffee.,
Drink green tea.,
Eat spicy foods.,
Add spices to your diet.,
Eat breakfast.",How to Boost Metabolism As a Thyroid Patient2," Any treatment regimen for hypothyroidism, including adjusting your nutrient intake, should be discussed with your doctor. Only your doctor is experienced and familiar enough with your medical history to determine how tweaks to your nutrient intake might impact your metabolism and thyroid condition., If your diet contains too little iodine, you will develop a slow metabolism and hypothyroidism. To correct this, take foods that naturally contain iodine or have iodine added to them. For instance, you might consume iodized table salt, kelp, dairy products, or seafood.One exception to this is in the case of Hashimoto’s disease. If you have Hashimoto’s disease or another autoimmune disease, iodine intake can cause you to develop hypothyroidism (and, therefore, a slow metabolism). If you have such a condition, avoid consuming kelp, dulse, and other foods with large amounts of iodine.If your urine concentration of iodine is below 100 micrograms per liter, you are iodine-deficient. Consult your doctor to ensure you’re getting the right amount of iodine., Omega-3 fatty acids such as those in fish and fish oil supplements are thought to help reduce inflammation and build immunity, which in turn enhances metabolism. Talk to your doctor about good ways to incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids into your diet.Be sure to consult with your doctor before you start any omega-3 supplements if you are on blood thinners or if you have a bleeding disorder.

, Selenium is a chemical element present in certain foods. Some research suggests low levels of selenium could lead to hypothyroidism. Getting adequate selenium, therefore, could boost your thyroid. Brazil nuts, meat, fish, and mushrooms contain selenium in moderate doses.Avoid taking selenium supplements. They contain selenium in far higher concentrations than the foods that contain selenium naturally, and the side effects are quite risky.

, Inadequate protein intake can depress the metabolism.Around 20 percent of your daily caloric intake should be protein (or up to 35 percent if you have a very active lifestyle). For instance, if you consume 2,000 calories per day, about 400 calories should come from lean proteins like nuts, seeds, and tofu.Avoid red and processed meats, as they cause cancer and heart disease., Caffeine can slightly increase the metabolism. Avoid dousing your java with cream and sugar, though, as this could add unwanted calories and fat to your diet. This is never desirable, but is especially problematic when you’re a thyroid patient with a sluggish metabolism.Two cups of coffee is enough to boost your metabolism as a thyroid patient., Green tea is a popular beverage made from green tea leaves. To make green tea, obtain some tea bags containing green tea. Place the bag in your mug. Boil some water, then pour it over the tea bag. Allow it to sit in the water for two to three minutes, then remove it. Wait five minutes, then drink the tea.Alternately, you could get some loose leaf tea. In this case, you’ll need a tea strainer or tea ball. Fill the strainer or ball up with loose leaf tea and drop it in your mug. Just as you did with the tea bag, pour boiling water over the tea. Remove the strainer or ball after two to three minutes and wait for the tea to cool.
Three to five cups of green tea per day will help you boost your metabolism as a thyroid patient., Eating certain spicy foods can give your metabolism a small boost, even if you’re a thyroid patient.For instance, habanero, jalapeno, and cayenne peppers can improve your metabolism. The spike in your metabolic rate may last for three hours.Spicy foods are also good for the immune system and circulatory system.
Adding paprika, chili flakes or a similar spice to soups is a great way to help you boost your metabolism., Eating foods seasoned with cinnamon, ginger, onion powder, black pepper, and other spices could boost your metabolism. For instance, add a few shakes of cinnamon and/or nutmeg to your apple or pear slices. Put some garlic or onion powder on your mashed potatoes. Or add some black pepper to your green beans., The metabolism slows during sleep and will remain relatively slow until it is jump-started for the day by consuming food. Thyroid patients who make breakfast a priority could boost their metabolism.Avoid sugary snacks like donuts and sweetened cereals for breakfast. Instead, choose whole-grain toast with a smidgen of jam, orange juice, and a banana or other fruit.

Understand the purposes of enemas.,
Consider the different solutions used in enemas.,
Know the contraindications.",How to Administer an Enema2," For the most part, people use enemas in order to treat constipation. When unable to fully evacuate the bowels, an enema can stimulate the colon to contract and force stool out of the body. The enema can also soften the stool that is there, making it easier to expel. But constipation is only one reason why an enema might be administered nor should it be considered a consistent form of relief from constipation. Long-term usage of enemas to relieve constipation can cause serious damage to your bowels and your ability to have a natural bowel movement.Gerson therapy also makes use of enemas. Gerson therapy is a therapeutic approach to cleansing the body of toxins which does not rest on solid scientific research. The basis of the approach involves treating cancer based on diet and nutritional intake, including the use of coffee enemas, which are an essential part of the regimen.Retention enemas are another form of enemas that have long been used to administer medications (including antibiotics and anti-seizure medications) and fluids to the body when oral administration was not possible. The rectum is a cavity in the body which is fully able to absorb nutrients and fluids.Medications have been given through suppositories but fluids are more readily absorbed into the body than medications via oil-based suppositories. In cases where IV administration is not possible, retention enemas can be helpful in the treatment of dehydration triggered by vomiting.Cleansing enemas are used to help the body rid the lower intestines of waste or to administer specific herbs which are expected to be absorbed into the body. Cleansing enemas can be either large- or small-volume enemas which are designed to irritate the colon to produce peristalsis and encourage evacuation of the rectum and large intestines.

, Enemas can be made at home or purchased in the store. The fluid used can be medicated or just water. What is used will depend upon the goal of treatment. Consult with your doctor as to what is the best option for you. Here are some different types of enema solutions:


Tap water enemas should always use small volumes because the fluid is hypotonic, meaning it will pull electrolytes out of your blood and into the enema, which you then expel. This increases the risk of an electrolyte imbalance.A soap-suds enema can be used but only when pure castile soap is used. Other, harsher soaps can be dangerous to instill in an enema.Oil retention enemas are given to help soften the stool in the rectum, making it easier to pass. Adults may use an enema up to 150 ml and children up to 75 ml. The enema should be retained for 30 to 60 minutes, giving the oil time to penetrate and coat the stool.Powdered milk and molasses is a comfortable enema to use and one of the best treatments for severe constipation. This can be repeated up to four times in one day. Add three ounces of powdered milk to six ounces of hot water and shake until thoroughly mixed. Then add 4.5 ounces of molasses and shake until the color is even throughout.Coffee enemas are used to detoxify and cleanse the bowel. Coffee, when administered rectally, stimulates bile production to help eliminate toxins and improve liver activity. Use coffee that has been boiled for 10 minutes and then cooled to room temperature or grounds that have been soaked overnight. In both cases the water should be strained before the fluid is used. Try to use organically grown coffee to reduce your exposure to pesticides. Note that coffee enemas do not deliver the caffeine you receive when drinking the beverage orally., It's important that you be aware of the contraindications of using an enema, which are conditions or factors that would make the treatment unsuitable for or harmful to you. In general, enemas are not harmful. However, there are some individuals who should not use enemas, particularly medicated enemas.Do not use medicated enemas if you have severe kidney disease, congestive heart failure, obstruction in your stomach or intestines, paralytic ileus, megacolon or active inflammatory bowel disease. If you are dehydrated, you should also not use an enema.
Women who are pregnant or nursing must talk with their doctor before taking any medication to determine if the medicine is safe for the baby.

Most fiber supplements come in the form of a powder you mix with water and then drink. They are made with fiber content from plants and animals that's known to be beneficial to humans.Keep in mind that getting too much fiber can result in loose stools and other side effects, so be sure to take only the recommended dose.

Supplements that include psyllium are geared toward dealing with constipation by bulking up the stools.
Supplements that contain inulin and oligofructose can stimulate growth of beneficial bacteria in the intestines, which also reduces constipation.

, Prunes are a natural source of concentrated fiber, and they also contain sorbitol, which is a natural laxative. If you like the taste of prunes, try having some whole prunes or prune juice every morning. Prunes will help your stools move through your digestive system, preventing constipation., Sometimes constipation is caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the gut. Eating yogurt that contains probiotics restores these beneficial bacteria that facilitate proper digestion. Try eating a cup with breakfast every day as a way of preventing constipation.

Eat more fiber.,
Stay hydrated.,
Exercise.,
Limit fat intake.,
Quit smoking.,
Lose weight if you are obese.,
Avoid straining when you try to pass stool.,
Talk to your doctor about medication use.",How to Avoid Diverticulitis1," A high-fiber diet may help reduce your chances of diverticulitis. Try to eat 25 to 35 grams (0.88 to 1.2 oz) of fiber a day. Fiber, naturally found in many foods, can help to make passing stool easier. Fiber adds bulk to your stool; when your stool lacks bulk, your colon is forced to exert more effort to push the stool out.When your colon exerts this pressure, sacs are more likely to form. Foods that are rich in fiber include prunes, apples, pears, black beans, kidney beans, potatoes, squash, spinach, whole-grains, grain cereal, brown rice, and oatmeal.


These foods will help you prevent constipation and increase the frequency of your bowel movements, which will help keep your colon clear and lower the risk of inflammation and backup.Insoluble fiber in the form of cellulose has been associated with a decreased incidence of diverticulitis. Foods high in this insoluble fiber are celery, apples, raisins, prunes, raspberries, and strawberries.However, there have been recent studies that argue that high fiber diets do not necessarily prevent asymptomatic diverticulitis. More studies need to be done to know the exact relationship between high fiber diets and this condition.;
, While the amount of water you drink depends on your size and how much exercise you get, you should strive to hydrate yourself every day. Water can help to flush out the intestines. When you don’t get enough water, you may become constipated, which can lead to the development of diverticulitis.


While this can vary from individual to individual, men should generally try to get roughly three liters (which equals 13 cups) or water each day. Women should generally drink 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal), which equals nine cups., Exercise encourages normal bowel movements, which help prevent diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. Any type of exercise that keeps you moving will help, such as walking, jogging, dancing, aerobics, and cycling. Aim to exercise five times a week for at least 30 minutes at a time.


Exercising can also help you lose weight, which will prevent you from becoming obese, a main risk factor for diverticulitis.If you suffer from chronic constipation, even just an increase of physical exercise for at least 10 minutes daily will be helpful. This can include cardio exercises like running and biking, and resistance training like lifting weights or rock climbing.

, Diets high in fat — and specifically red meat — may predispose people for developing diverticular disease.To help decrease the chances of diverticulitis, you should limit the amount of red meat and other fatty animal proteins you consume in your diet. There is no exact amount you should can still consume every week, but try to avoid red meat more than once a week. Instead, eat alternate proteins such as chicken, fish, tofu, soy products, beans, and almonds.


Red meat is associated with a 1.5 times increase in diverticulitis in people studied., Smokers are at higher risk for diverticulitis and will also cause the disease to progress more rapidly.If you smoke, speak with your doctor about quitting — from going cold turkey to using the patch or gum or following a specific cessation program, there are many ways to quit smoking for good, and your doctor will be happy to support you.

, It was found that a high BMI and waist-to-hip ratio increases risk of diverticulitis. It may be that carrying excess fat in the abdomen in particular puts one at risk for diverticulitis, as having a large waist circumference also puts a person at higher risk.Talk to your doctor or calculate your BMI. If your BMI is between 25 to 29.9 you are considered overweight, and if it is above 30, you are considered obese.Speak with your doctor about making a plan to lose weight. This should include adjusting your diet and adding exercise.

, If you do happen to become constipated, do not try to strain to pass your stool, as this could cause feces to get trapped in any existing pouches you may have, which could result in diverticulitis.Instead, if you are constipated, set up an appointment with your doctor or go to your local pharmacy to get stool softeners or some other form of treatment that will allow you to pass stool without straining.

, Certain drugs can increase your risk of diverticulitis. Regular use of aspirin or Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) can increase your risk of diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding, as can use of corticosteroids, and opiate analgesics.If you use any of these drugs regularly, speak with your doctor about ceasing use of and possibly alternate medications you might try.

The best exercises to boost metabolism are aerobic exercises like running, biking, and swimming. However, your metabolism will drop again once you’ve stopped exercising.If you have been inactive for a while and are not used to exercising, start small. For instance, go on a 10-minute run every other day. Gradually increase the frequency and length of your run.
For instance, after a week or so, extend your run to 15 minutes and run four days per week. After another week, extend your run to 20 minutes and run five days per week.
Continue in this way until you feel you are pushing yourself, but do not push yourself beyond what you can handle. If you find yourself short of breath, panting, or collapsing during your run, slow your pace and reduce the length of your runs. Avoid overextending yourself.

, Since muscle burns more calories than fat, you can boost your metabolism slightly by adding muscle. For instance, do pushups, sit-ups, bench press, and lift free weights.Start small and work your way up. For instance, if you are

Eating foods without fiber is hard on digestive system and can lead to constipation. These foods are common culprits:White bread
Snack foods
Fast foods
Fried foods
Dairy
Candy

, Alcoholic beverages like wine, beer, whisky and others have a dehydrating effect Being dehydrated can make it much more difficult to pass stools. If you tend to get constipated often, you might want to consider cutting back on alcohol. Stick with just a glass per evening, or eliminate it entirely. When you do decide to drink, make sure you have a glass of water for every glass of alcohol.

, Caffeine can sometimes help with mild constipation, since it's a diuretic, but it can make prolonged constipation worse, since it’s dehydrating. If you have a three cup a day habit, you might want to cut back for awhile to see if it helps you avoid constipation. Try drinking just one cup per day, or switch to a low-caffeine tea.

, When you're on the go, you might put off going to the bathroom, but this isn't good for your digestive system. Waiting too long to go to the bathroom is a common reason for constipation, so any time you get the urge, heed it.


It can help to have a schedule. For example, you might want to plan to go to the bathroom and have a bowel movement every morning. Once you start this type of routine, your body will respond by staying more regular.

, Running, yoga, and other physical activities improve digestion.If you’re feeling constipated, try going for a brisk jog or walk to get things moving again. Exercising three or four times a week will help you stay regular and prevent constipation.

, For some people, sitting on a toilet isn't the best possible position to help them easily have a bowel movement. Many have found that a squatting position makes the process go more smoothly. The easiest way to try this position is to prop up your feet on a stool while you're sitting, so that your knees are raised.

You can get a small stool to prop up your feet.

Try castor oil.,
Take a dose of epsom salt.,
Drink dandelion tea.,
Try senna tablets.",How to Avoid Constipation3," This is a classic quick fix that really works. Castor oil acts as an irritant to the intestinal lining, causing a bowel movement to happen.Taking a teaspoon is an effective way to relieve constipation, but be very careful not to take too much, since it can lead to gastrointestinal problems if you overdose.


Take the exact dose suggested on the packaging of the castor oil you buy, and no more.
Avoid taking it before bed, since it may cause you to spend some time in the bathroom.

, The salt mixed with water acts as a laxative by helping hydrate your stool to make it easier to pass. Mix a spoonful of epsom salt into a glass of water and let it dissolve, then drink the solution.In an hour or so, the constipation should pass.

, Dandelion root that has been dried and made into tea has been an herbal remedy for constipation for many years. You may find relief from mild constipation by drinking dandelion tea every day. It's a safe and beneficial herb, though no conclusive studies have been conducted to prove it works.


You can buy dandelion tea that has been prepackaged, or buy loose dried dandelion root to make your own. Let it steep for five minutes, then stir in some honey to enjoy.

, Senna is an herb that stimulates the muscles in the bowel to contract, enabling you to pass stools. It works well to relieve prolonged constipation, with other methods you've tried aren't effective. However, senna tablets can have side effects, so talk to your doctor before using them if you have a preexisting condition related to your digestion.

Reduce your intake of foods that often cause indigestion.,
Reduce your alcohol consumption.,
Eat small meals more often.,
Don’t eat right before bed.",How to Alleviate Indigestion2," Foods that may set off indigestion include:Fatty, heavy foods, such as fast food.
Spicy foods. This is particularly true if you usually eat bland foods.
Chocolate.
Carbonated drinks like sodas.
Caffeine. This includes drinking too much coffee or tea.

, Alcohol causes your body to increase the amount of stomach acid it produces. This increases the likelihood of the acid irritating your digestive tract.Mixing alcohol with painkillers, like aspirin, can increase the damage to your stomach.

, This will prevent you from overburdening your stomach with more food than it can handle. It will also avoid stretching your stomach, which can also be uncomfortable.Try eating five or six meals instead of three. You can do this by adding small meals between breakfast and lunch and then again between lunch and dinner.
Eat slowly and chew your food well. This will make your food easier to digest.

, Eat your last meal at least three hours before you lie down. This will reduce the likelihood that excess stomach acid will go up into your esophagus.When you do sleep, put extra pillows under your head and shoulders. This will make it harder for acid to flow up into your esophagus.

"
"
Quit Smoking.,
Reduce stress.,
Control your weight.,
Evaluate your medications.",How to Alleviate Indigestion3," Smoking can damage the muscle that prevents acid from flowing up from your stomach into your esophagus. The muscle may become looser making your more susceptible to acid reflux.The chemicals in cigarette smoke may also cause indigestion.

, Stress can make you more prone to indigestion. Try using common relaxation techniques to control your stress. Many people use some or all of the following techniques:Meditation
Deep breathing
Yoga

Visualize calming images
Progressively tensing and then relaxing the different muscle groups in your body

, Being overweight increases the pressure on your stomach. You can maintain a healthy weight by exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet.Try to do 75 to 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. This could include running, walking, biking, swimming, or playing sports. The exercise will also help you mange stress.
Eat a healthy diet that includes lean meats, low fat dairy products, whole grain breads, and several servings of fruits and vegetables per day.
Women will usually be able to lose weight safely on a diet which gives them 1,200–1,500 calories per day. Men will generally lose weight with 1,500–1,800 calories per day. This should enable you to lose approximately one pound per week. Do not try more extreme dieting unless you are under a doctor’s supervision.

, Don’t stop or change your medications without consulting your doctor first. Your doctor may be able to recommend an alternative that won’t aggravate your indigestion.Non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen may exacerbate indigestion.
Nitrates, which are given to widen blood vessels, may make you more prone to having acid reflux. This happens because they can weaken the muscle that keeps the opening between your esophagus and stomach.
If changing to other medications is not possible, your doctor may suggest taking them with food.

"
Recognize a heart attack.,
Call your doctor immediately if you have severe symptoms.,
Get an exam.",How to Alleviate Indigestion4," Heart attacks require immediate attention from emergency responders. The following symptoms are indicative of cardiac distress and not indigestion:Shortness of breath.
Sweating.
Chest pain going to the jaw, neck or arm.
Pain in your left arm.
Chest pain when you are physically active or stressed.

, Severe symptoms may indicate a more serious underlying problem. Look out for:Vomiting blood.
Bloody, black, or tarry stool.
Difficulty swallowing.
Exhaustion or anemia.
Loss of appetite.
Weight loss.
A lump in your stomach.

, Your doctor will check you for other digestive disorders such as:Gastritis.
Ulcers.
Celiac disease.
Gallstones.
Constipation.
Pancreatitis.
Cancers of the digestive system.
Intestinal problems such as blockages or reduced blood flow.

Monitor any pain you experience in your abdomen.,
Keep track of any fever or chills you experience.,
Pay attention to gaseous discomfort and bloating you experience.,
Watch out for the development of diarrhea.,
Pay attention to any muscle spasms you experience.,
Check your stools for blood.",How to Avoid Diverticulitis2," When the pouches in your colon become inflamed they can cause pain. You may feel pain on the right or the left side of your colon, depending on where the pouches have formed., When the pouches become infected with bacteria, your body may increase your internal temperature in order to fight off the infection. The immunity of your body is strengthened at high temperatures, so your body will naturally elevate your temperature to combat bacteria.Chills may develop as a reaction to the fever. You may fluctuate between feeling very hot and very cold.
Take note if your appetite is not as intense as it normally is. Loss of appetite can also be associated with the fever that may develop in response to an infection in your colon.

, When pouches form and become infected in your colon, your digestive system becomes disrupted. Digesting food takes longer, which causes gas to accumulate in your abdomen.


This can cause a great deal of bloating and discomfort.

, While constipation is generally a part of diverticulitis, you may also experience diarrhea. When your large intestine has pressure put on it, more water can be passed as a waste product, rather than being absorbed into the body. This can lead to you experiencing diarrhea.Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which in turn can lead to dizziness.

, When you become constipated, the food passing through your system can exert a lot of pressure on the walls of your intestine. This pressure can cause abdominal cramping, muscle spasms, and pain., This may occur when your mucosal lining becomes severely inflamed and the pouches start to bleed. This can cause blood to appear in your stools. Contact your doctor if you see any bloody stools."

Learn the risk factors.,
Diagnose the condition.,
Talk to your doctor about going on a liquid diet.,
Treat the condition.,
Take medications to reduce pain caused by diverticulitis.,
Take care complications.,
Talk to your doctor about more invasive medical treatments.",How to Avoid Diverticulitis3," There are certain situations that put you at risk for diverticulosis. These can be genetic or lifestyle related, but old age also plays a large factor. Risk factors include:Advancing age
Weakness in the colon or bowel wall
Constipation
Low fiber or high animal fat diets
Increased intestinal pressure due to stool build up
Genetics
Use of medications such as steroids, opiates, and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs naproxen and ibuprofen
Obesity
Smoking
Lack of exercise

, If you think you might have diverticulitis, you can go to your doctor and have him or her run a variety of tests. Your doctor may give you a barium enema and then perform an X-ray, which will show the inflamed areas of your colon. Your doctor also may do a visual check of your color with a short or long scope to look for the existence of the inflamed sacs.


If your condition is causing serious pain, your doctor may perform a CT scan or ultrasound to look for the characteristic sacs., If you catch the condition early on, you may be put on a liquid diet that will help to flush out your system and allow your organs to heal. You will be able to return to a solid diet when the symptoms subside.For more intense situations, you may be put on an intravenous liquid diet, which means that you will have to remain in the hospital while your colon heals. These intravenous foods contain carbohydrates, vitamins, proteins, fats and minerals to ensure that you get a balanced diet.

, Since most patients do not have symptoms or the symptoms are minimum, the treatment is also generally light. A strong fiber diet is typically prescribed to prevent constipation and the formation of the inflamed sacs.


If the inflamed tissue becomes infected or pus-filled, treatments range from oral antibiotic treatment at home with Levaquin and Flagyl to inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics with the same medications or Clindamycin to take care of anaerobic bacteria. If the condition is severe, surgical drainage with sterile washout and colonic resection may be used. 200 to 400 mgs of these medications are generally given twice a day, though the dosage depends on the severity of the infection.
The drug Mesalamine is often used with the probiotic Lactobacillus casei to help prevent re-occurrence as well., You can talk to your doctor about taking acetaminophen to fight the pain caused by your condition. Mesalazine can also be taken to combat abdominal pains.There are also medications you can take to control muscle spasms. These medications include buscopan. Take these medications as prescribed by your doctor.

, Although this condition is typically not problematic, there are serious complications that can arise. Diverticulitis may cause an abscess, an infectious mass called a phlegmon, or peritonitis, which is an infection of the lining of the abdominal wall caused by a ruptured sac. Some of these conditions can be deadly if not treated properly.


If you have diverticulitis that has led to peritonitis, you will be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics and potential surgical intervention., If you have extreme pain in your left lower quadrant that gets worse over time, you may have an abscess. You may also experience unbearable pain to the entire abdomen with just a slight tapping. These abscesses may be drained via percutaneous drainage with a needle guided by a CT scan, where the needle is inserted as the patient receives anesthesia. The pus is drained with the guidance of the CT scan to avoid surgery. However, some cases require surgery.


In other severe cases, you may have to have a colon resection, where two sections of your colon are sutured back together after the doctor cuts the infected and diseased portion away.
About 15 to 30% of patients with diverticulitis will have to have surgical intervention. Uncomplicated diverticulitis surgical treatment rates have declined from 17.9% in 1991 to 13.7% in 2005."

Understand the potential problems of malocclusion.,
Discuss a treatment plan with your orthodontist.,
Practice good dental hygiene.,
Draw attention to other parts of your appearance.,
Smile with confidence.,
Accept your appearance.,
Understand the facts behind malocclusion.,
Seek support if you are bullied.,
Remember that you are not alone.,
Be confident.",How to Deal With Buck Teeth," The sooner teeth alignment problems such as malocclusion are detected and treated, the better. Since the bones of children and adolescents are still relatively soft, their teeth can be moved more easily, making youth the best time to correct problems and irregularities such as malocclusion., Your orthodontist will examine the position of your teeth, as well as the general health of your mouth, teeth, and jaw. Based on this examination, he or she will recommend a course of action.

, Malocclusion is caused by skeletal issues, dental issues, or a combination of both. An orthodontist can fix only dental issues and mild skeletal issues; for skeletal issues, you will need to see an orthognathic surgeon. When your orthodontist examines your teeth, make sure that he or she explains the condition, and answers any questions you may have. While some degree of malocclusion is fairly common, this does not mean that the condition cannot cause problems. These can include:


The risk of breaking teeth that stick outDifficulty chewing and/or breathing normallyPremature tooth wear or decayHeadacheBullying because of appearanceStress because of appearance., Your orthodontist can recommend the best treatment for you, based on your specific case and the position of your teeth. Possible treatments for malocclusion may include:Braces or aligners. These are applied by an orthodontist, and help to shift your teeth back into their proper positions. Generally, they are worn for a period ranging from a few months to a few years.
Removal of teeth (if overcrowding is causing the malocclusion)
Repairing irregular teeth by caps and other restorations
In rare cases, surgery may be required to change the shape of the jaw.

, If you are unable to correct your malocclusion or have to wait for treatment, you should still make sure to take good care of your teeth. Keeping your mouth clean will make treatment easier when you are able to seek it, and is good for your overall health.


Brush, floss, and rinse your teeth regularly (twice a day), and follow any special instructions your dentist gives you.If you wish, you can also whiten your teeth with whitening toothpaste or at-home kits, or professional services provided by a dentist.
Remember to see your dentist regularly for cleanings and examinations

, If you are worried about the appearance of your teeth, you can draw attention away from them in various ways. For instance:


Colorful or eye-catching makeup
Distinctive earrings, hair style, etc.
Using muted shades of lipstick (rather than bright colors, which draw more attention to the mouth)

, If you have malocclusion, you might want to keep your lips closed or cover your mouth when you smile, this might actually draw more attention to your mouth. Try smiling confidently and normally.

, Everyone has flaws, and accepting them in yourself and others is part of living a fulfilled life. Flaws, including physical imperfections, are also part of our “humanness,” and what makes each person unique.Be proud of what makes you unique, and don’t constantly worry about being the same as others.


Remember that standards of attractiveness vary from person to person (“beauty is in the eye of the beholder”).No one thing defines you are, either for yourself or others. Be proud of who you are, inside and out.
Practice self-compassion. This means being as forgiving to yourself as you would be to others.If you are able to accept others for who they are, extend the same compassion to yourself.
Be mindful of your emotions. If you feel yourself judging yourself because of your malocclusion, stop and mentally remind yourself that you’re proud of who you are as a whole person., Malocclusion is not something you can prevent.Ordinarily, it is a hereditary condition, passed down through families.This means that no one does anything “wrong” to get buck teeth, although prolonged thumb sucking, pacifier use, or bottle feeding (past age three) can sometimes make it worse., If you are being bullied or stressed because of your teeth (or any other reason), let your school counselor, parents, or another trusted authority know about it so that you can get help.There are many resources about how to deal with and prevent bullying; schools should have anti-bullying policies., Studies show that the most prevalent cause of bullying is a person’s smile.If you are bullied because of your teeth, it is important to remember that there are others like you. You can find support among others, and work together to change attitudes.


Remember that most people actually have some degree of malocclusion—it’s just more noticeable in some people than in others., Malocclusion can be a source of embarrassment and stress, but remember that everyone has flaws. With or without malocclusion, you can be successful and fulfilled.


If you ever feel stressed because of your malocclusion, or don't know how to go about seeking treatment, talk to a counselor, parent, or someone else you trust for support and help.

Manage the pain.,
Eat properly.,
Take care of your teeth.,
Watch for bleeding.,

Consider getting replacement teeth.,
Watch for long-term risks.,
Take regular care of your teeth.",How to Deal With a Tooth Pulling," If you start to feel pain in your mouth, it could be the sign of a serious condition, which may lead to your teeth being pulled. Possible reasons for pulling a tooth include:Your mouth is crowded. Sometimes you will need a tooth removed to help keep your teeth properly aligned. They may be too big for your mouth, or their current position prevents a new one from breaking in. This is a common case with wisdom teeth, located in the rear of your mouth. It is also sometimes necessary for orthodontic purposes.
There is tooth decay or other damage that has spread to the middle of your tooth. If other treatments like a root canal or antibiotics cannot cure it, your tooth may need to come out.
You are under serious risk for infection. This is the case in instances where your immune system has been compromised, perhaps while receiving chemotherapy, having an organ transplant, or before heart surgery. Your dentist may decide to have your teeth pulled because of the increased risk, and the damage it would cause.
You have serious gum disease. Gum disease infects your gums, and can cause your teeth to loosen. Your dentist may need to pull teeth in order to properly treat your gums.;
, If you are feeling pain in your teeth, your dentist will be able to determine what needs to happen next. Make sure you are honest about the pain and how long you have had it. When you discuss surgery, you should ask a few questions. The answers will probably be similar for many people, but there may always been different concerns depending on your unique medical history.Ask about your teeth, including how many will need to come out, and what other damage there is in your mouth.
Ask about the surgery, including how long it will last, and what kind of anesthesia you will get. You will also want to ask about your preparation, including when you should arrive, whether there are certain restrictions regarding food, drink, or medication (prescription and non-prescription), and if you will need assistance afterwards.
Ask about the recovery period, including healing time, ways to care for yourself afterwards, and other treatments you may need.

, Not every insurance plan will cover tooth extraction, so if you are having the surgery, make sure you know what your plan covers. Teeth pulling does not need to be expensive, depending on the clinic you attend, but you don't want to be surprised when the bill comes.


If you have concerns about the cost, talk to your insurance company and dentist about different payment options. It is better to figure out a payment plan than to not have a tooth pulled. If it stays in, you may develop more problems, which will be even more expensive to deal with.

, After the surgery, you will want to drink lots of water and eat soft foods like applesauce and yogurt. Make sure you have plenty of soft food around so that you don't go hungry and have to leave your house after surgery to go get supplies., Come early to make sure you are there for the operation. The sooner you are ready to go, the quicker the operation can get started and you will get home.You should not come alone for the surgery. You will be taking an anesthetic drug, and will probably be on several prescribed painkillers after the operation. Someone else, like a family member or close friend, should drive you home. Having them there can also help if you experience anxiety or concern about the surgery.

, It is natural to be a little nervous about your procedure beforehand, but you shouldn't be scared. Before the surgery, make sure the dentist has answered every question you have, so that you can feel confident in what he is going to do and how it will work.


If the possibility of surgery scares you, or you feel nervous when it is beginning, try some basic relaxation techniques like controlled breathing, where you take a deep breath then release the air very slowly. You can also try visualization techniques, where you think about something positive or pleasant, such as a relaxing day on the beach, to get your mind off the surgery., Surgery takes a lot out of you, even a relatively simple one like tooth pulling. Take the day off from work or school. Avoid exercising and make sure to keep your head elevated., After the painkillers you got at the dentist wear off, your mouth will probably ache, and there will be some swelling. Over the counter drugs like acetaminophen (Tylenol), or stronger prescription painkillers from your dentist, taken as directed, will help reduce the pain. Additionally, an ice pack or cold compress against your jaw will help reduce the pain and keep swelling down., You'll have to restrict yourself in the first 24 hours after the surgery. Drink lots of water to replenish fluids. Eat soft foods like applesauce, but avoid dairy (like ice cream or yogurt) for the first two days, as these may contain lactic bacteria such as lactobacillus which can generate infection if there is no antibiotic prescription. After the first 24 hours, you will be able to introduce harder foods like mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, and pasta as you can tolerate the pain.Avoid alcoholic, carbonated, caffeinated, or hot beverages during that period, and don't eat hard, chewy, hot, or spicy foods.
Don't drink with a straw for at least a week, as the suction may dislodge blood clots.

, Don't brush your teeth, use mouthwash, rinse your mouth, or spit for the first 24 hours. When you start again, be gentle around the wound. For the first few weeks after surgery, rinse your mouth with warm salt water every two hours and after meals.Wait at least 72 hours before you start smoking again (longer if possible), and avoid chewing tobacco for at least a week.

, Some bleeding of the pulling site is common, especially within a couple of hours after surgery, so don't be too concerned at first. If you notice bleeding, or taste blood in your saliva, put a piece of gauze or other absorbent fabric over the wound. Hold it there for about 15 minutes. Do not rinse you mouth.A moist tea bag works well also. The bag helps to absorb the moisture from the blood and your saliva, and has natural constrictors that will help stop the blood.Bleeding should not last too long after surgery. If you are still bleeding after a few hours, contact your dentist.

, The hole your tooth came out of needed to be sewn up afterwards, and you'll want those stitches removed. Some tooth pulling operations use dissolving stitches, which should disappear on their own in a few weeks. Your dentist will let you know what you have and what you should be prepared for., Don't worry about being embarrassed or concerned about missing teeth, especially if they are from a visible part of your mouth. This is a common concern, and one your dentist can help with. Talk to him about cosmetic surgery or implants to replace the tooth.Remember that having a spot from a missing tooth is much better than if you had left the tooth in there to rot. This might have caused even worse damage to your mouth and bones, and potentially more teeth coming out., While most tooth-removal surgeries are completely safe, and patients make a full recovery, there are some things to keep an eye on. The symptoms will mostly include pain in the tooth socket, perhaps from exposed bone, or bacteria developing from food and other particles getting into the hole.Make sure your dentist remembers you had the teeth removed, especially if you get a new dentist. They will be able to help you keep track of your mouth and watch for such health risks.

, This means daily brushing and regular flossing to keep them clean, as well as regular checkups and cleanings with your dentist. You'll want to wait a few days after the surgery to let the wound heal, and be gentle around the hole.

Use toothpaste or gel with a high percentage of fluoride.,
Elevate your head when you're asleep.,
Rinse with warm salt water.",How to Deal with the Pain from a Chipped Tooth1," If your nerve is exposed, it will be sensitive to variances in temperature. Both hot and cold temperatures will cause extreme pain. Prevent this pain by staying away from hot coffee, tea, soup or other foods. Don't drink iced drinks or eat ice cream.The best temperature for foods or beverages will be about the same temperature as the air.
Wait until coffee or tea is room temperature before drinking.;
, These will cause a nerve to hurt. In addition, they will eat away at the already-damaged enamel of your tooth.Examples of foods to avoid include tomatoes, oranges, lemons, and coffee.
In addition to high sugar content, most soft drinks contain phosphoric and citric acids that wear away tooth enamel.

, Both acetaminophen or ibuprofen can effectively handle the pain that comes with a chipped or broken tooth. Most toothaches are caused by inflammation of the gum or nerve tissue, so an anti-inflammatory pain reliever will work best.Never put a pain reliever directly on the injured tooth itself.
Check for possible interactions with any other medication you may be taking. A pharmacist will be able to answer any questions you may have.
Topical numbing gels, such as Anbesol, may help briefly, but are unlikely to provide any sustained pain relief from cracked tooth pain.

, Take a piece of dental floss between your two index fingers, and gently slide between each tooth. If any food is pressing against your broken tooth, the floss should remove it.Make sure that you go all the way to the gum line.
Waxed floss is recommended as it makes it easier to slide between your teeth.

, Oil-of-cloves, or eugenol, is an effective natural pain reliever. Apply a small amount of the oil to a cotton ball, and press the cotton ball against the painful tooth for about 10 seconds.Be careful not to swallow the oil-of-cloves.
Oil-of-cloves can be found at many natural foods stores.

, You can get a temporary dental cement from most drug stores or pharmacies. These temporary fixes will help cover the crack in your tooth, which will help with the pain.Stick with soft foods while wearing your temporary tooth repair, and avoid unnecessary chewing.
Using the temporary repair should allow you to handle hot or cold foods more easily.

, A fluoride toothpaste or a fluor gel can help speed up the remineralization of your tooth. This can help ease any sensitivity or discomfort., Raising your head just slightly above the level of your heart will help relieve some of the pressure against your chipped or broken tooth. When the head is placed at the same level as the heart or lower, blood will rush to that area, bringing with it more pressure which results in pain.Sleeping with an extra pillow or two will raise your head sufficiently to help ease the pain.
Avoid tilting your head at an extreme angle that may cause pain in your neck.

, Salt water works as an antibacterial as well as a pain reliever. Dissolve several teaspoons of table salt into a cup (8 oz or 237 ml) of warm water several times per day. Fill your mouth with the salt water, rinse, and gently spit out. Repeat three to four times per application.Generic table salt is fine for this. It doesn't need to be iodized.
Don't use hot water while your tooth is chipped, as it will be painful against your exposed nerve.

Determine the cause if you can.,
Remove debris if that is the cause.,
Eat sensibly to prevent more pain.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Try (with caution) an oral anesthetic gel containing benzocaine.,
Try clove oil.,
Apply a cold compress to your cheek.,
Take care of teething children.",How to Deal With a Sore Tooth1," Tooth pain can sometimes be caused by something as simple as a bit of food wedged between two teeth or tooth and gum. If you can determine the source of your tooth pain, you may be able to alleviate it yourself at home.


In addition to food or debris caught in the teeth or gums, common causes of a sore tooth include: an infection of the tooth, root, or gums; mouth trauma that causes tooth damage; an emerging crack or split in the tooth; teething (in children); or a sinus infection that causes mouth pain.;
, If you determine that food or other debris is the cause of your sore tooth, and you can remove it with care and without causing substantial additional pain, you might save yourself a trip to the dentist (and the subsequent bill).Rinse your mouth vigorously with warm water in an attempt to dislodge the debris.
Use floss to try to dislodge the debris. Dentists prefer this to using a toothpick or similar item, as they are more likely to damage the teeth or gums.
Contact your dentist if the debris cannot be removed and is causing significant pain.

, Particularly if your tooth pain is caused by a crack or chip, you should avoid eating foods that are too hot or cold, foods that can easily stick on or around teeth, and foods that can further damage a tooth.Save the jawbreakers and salt-water taffy for another time, and let your coffee cool down at bit. Sensitivity to cold items, such as a shaved-ice treat, can be particularly painful, especially if you follow a warm food item with a frosty one.
Take note of food types or temperatures that are causing pain, however, so that you can tell your dentist should you need to visit.

, If your tooth pain is caused by tooth decay, injury, or infection, pain medication may alleviate your symptoms.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a pain reliever that is commonly used for toothaches.
Ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) also are pain relievers as well as anti-inflammatory drugs. You may benefit from an anti-inflammatory medicine if you have inflamed and sore gums.
Take the medication as directed. Never exceed the maximum dosage listed on the box during a 24 hour period.
Don’t apply an oral pain reliever like aspirin directly to the sore tooth or gums.

, Sold under brand names including Orajel and Anbesol, these medications can be applied directly to your sore tooth and the surrounding gums.Be careful of an allergy to a local anesthetic. Many people, historically, are allergic to ester-based local anesthesia, like benzocaine. If you think you might be allergic, consult your doctor as soon as possible.
This will provide temporary pain relief, but will not treat the root cause of your toothache.
Apply the gel to the affected area with your finger or a cotton swab.
Use medications with benzocaine sparingly, and never more often than directed on the packaging or by your dentist. Benzocaine can cause a condition called methemoglobinemia, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood and can cause serious harm.Signs of methemoglobinemia can include bluish lips, shortness of breath, fatigue, confusion, light-headedness, and rapid pulse. Seek medical attention immediately if such symptoms are observed.

, Some dental professionals believe that the natural anesthetic eugenol present in oil of cloves can be effective at relieving discomfort associated with a toothache.Squeeze or drop a small amount of clove oil onto a cotton ball.
Rub this on your tooth and the surrounding gums.
This will provide only temporary pain relief at best.

, This can be especially helpful if you have a toothache associated with a cracked tooth.Wet a washcloth with ice cold water and press it to your cheek.
Alternatively, you can use a gel ice pack. Wrap it in a cloth.
Apply the compresses for 15 minutes at a time.

, Tooth pain in small children is most often caused by teething, the emergence of teeth that normally begins at four to seven months of age.It is not uncommon for teething to be accompanied by fever, rash, diarrhea, and fussiness. If symptoms are consistent, recurrent, or severe, contact the child’s physician.
Soreness due to teething can often be alleviated by gently rubbing the gums with a clean finger, the back of a chilled spoon, or a moist gauze pad. Chilled teething rings or pacifiers may also be helpful.
Do not use oral antiseptic gels containing benzocaine in children under two without the the consent of the child’s physician. Methemoglobinemia, a shortage of oxygen in the blood that can be caused by benzocaine, can be fatal to small children.

Know your teeth are not that bad.,
Smile anyway.,
Don't draw attention to your mouth.,
Attract attention to your eyes.,
Draw attention to other features.,
Smile without showing your teeth.",How to Deal With Having Bad Teeth1," Despite what you think about your teeth, there are always people with worse teeth than you. There may be something about your teeth, such as the crooked tooth in the front, the gap in between the top and bottom teeth, or their color, that you think is so apparent and awful that no one will ever want to look at you. This is usually not the case. You stare at your teeth every day and see each and every imperfection. Most people pay very little attention to your teeth and will never notice the imperfections you see.


Even if they do notice, most people won't care. Very few people have perfect teeth.;
, Even if you feel self conscious, you should own your teeth. Present yourself with confidence and a sincere smile and no one will pay attention to things such as bad teeth. The confidence and smile can give a great impression no matter the condition of your teeth.


Practice smiling confidently in the mirror.

, If you are really worried about your teeth, try not to draw too much attention to your mouth. Don't wear bright, bold lipstick or lip liner. This will cause people's eye to go directly to your mouth. Instead, wear clear gloss or balm. This will make your lips look normal and not draw attention to them.


You also shouldn't place your hands near your mouth or chew on your fingernails. If you do, people will look at your mouth and teeth, which is not what you want.

, If you are worried about people paying too much attention to your teeth, trying pulling people's attention away from it. Try wearing mascara or bright eyeshadow if you wear makeup. If you don't, try an interesting pair of glasses to draw attention to your eyes instead of your teeth.


Be expressive with your eyes, especially when smiling. Using your eyes to show your emotion not only makes your smile feel warmer and more engaging, it also draws attention away from your teeth., If your best feature is not your teeth, try calling attention to the parts of you appearance that you do like. This will direct attention to parts of your appearance you feel confident about instead of your teeth. If you wear jewelry, wear attractive earrings, such as a pair with sparkles or ones that dangle. They will do a great job of drawing attention.


Try wearing more accessories. Pick out a new hat, grab a new bracelet or wrist cuff, wear a great pair of shoes, or throw on a flashy necklace. This will make people notice you for how stylish you look, not for your teeth.
Get an alluring haircut. Try styles with a dramatic cut or bold color to focus attention on your hair. You can try fun hairstyles as well., If you still fill self conscious about your teeth, you can try seeming confident without showing your teeth. Many people smile like this anyway, so it won't seem out of the ordinary if you try it. This way, you will seem nice and friendly without having to show your teeth.


Practice smiling different ways in the mirror. Also try opening your mouth more or less to see what looks good but still looks natural.
Look at old photographs of yourself smiling and find the smiles you like best.

Stay hydrated.,
Chew or suck sugarless candy.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Try artificial saliva.,
Ask for prescription medication.",How to Cure Dry Mouth1," Carry a bottle of water with you and sip it throughout the day to keep your mouth moistened. Sports drinks or even milk can work as well, but avoid anything that contains sugar or caffeine.Try eating yogurt and cream because they create a protective layer over the mucosa that can fight dryness.
If your mouth is driest after waking up, run a humidifier while you sleep. This keeps the air moist. You could also drink a glass of water or tea before going to bed;
, Chewing and sucking both stimulate saliva production. Use sugarless gum or candy, since people with dry mouth are at high risk of developing cavities.


One clinical trial showed that green tea lozenges may be more effective than other hard lozenges.It's not certain which component of green tea causes this effect, so you may wish to try several brands.
If you don't have either of these at home, try sucking on a piece of hard, uncooked pasta.

, There are several types of foods that can cause pain or mouth infections if you have dry mouth. Reduce these to a minimum, and only eat them with plenty of water:Acidic foods such as tomatoes or citrus juice. These are especially bad, as they promote tooth decay as well as causing pain. Some people also have an increased saliva flow when they taste or see lemons.
Salty and spicy foods, which can cause pain.
Toast, crackers, and other dry foods should only be eaten when moistened with sauce or soup.
Sugar has a high risk of causing tooth decay. Minimize your intake, and don't brush teeth right away after eating sugary foods. The sugar carries on attacking your teeth for 40 mins-1 hour. If you brush your teeth immediately after eating any meal you are brushing away thin layers of the enamel, leading to highly sensitive teeth. This means when you drink freezing cold water or eat freezing cold food or if you eat sugary sweets, your teeth will hurt. Only brush teeth 40 mins to 1 hour after your meals.

, There are many types of artificial saliva, including over-the-counter and prescription products. The extra moisture can make you more comfortable, but it will not treat the underlying problem, which has a vast origin.


Ask a doctor first if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.Some people are allergic to the ingredients in some artificial saliva. Call an emergency medical number if you feel shortness of breath, swelling of your tongue, lips, or neck area, or itching., There are a variety of prescription-strength drugs that increase saliva production. If over the counter remedies don't work, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor will know which medicine is best for you based on your medical condition and other drugs you are taking.

Take a painkiller.,
Apply a cold compress.,
Numb the area.,
Clean your mouth thoroughly.,
Use a sea salt rinse.",How to Cure a Toothache1," Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen, which provide quick, effective relief for most minor toothaches.Having a throbbing tooth can impede your ability to eat, speak, and get to sleep. It's also more difficult to treat the toothache when you're in pain, so getting some relief from an over-the-counter pain medicine can help.

If the pain is intense and/or you can feel it radiating to other neighboring areas such as your ear, head, or throat, then an emergency appointment to your dentist is necessary.
Use only the recommended dosage printed on the package, or the dosage recommended by your doctor.
Tylenol is another effective over-the-counter painkiller.;
, Fill a food storage bag with ice, cover it with a thin cloth or paper towel, and apply it directly to the tooth or the cheek area just outside the tooth. The cold temperature will help ease the pain. Using a ice pack instead of a bag will have the same effect, but be sure to cover it with a towel.









There are cases of pulpitis when the pain calms down with a warm temperature. If the pain increases with the cold pack, switch to a warm compress.
Do not apply the ice directly to the tooth. This will increase the pain, especially since teeth inflamed by toothaches are often quite sensitive to hot or cold temperatures.

, Buy an over-the-counter tooth and gum numbing gel to help ease the throbbing for a few hours. These gels are applied directly to the affected area and usually work for several hours, but saliva dilutes the effects of the gel and spreads it down your throat or over your tongue so do not swallow any.








, Sometimes toothaches are caused by small pieces of food that have gotten lodged in the tooth and are exacerbating the pain of cavities or gingivitis. When this is the case, thoroughly cleaning your mouth can go a long way toward eliminating the pain and making the problem go away.









Floss around the tooth. Make sure the floss goes up to your gums. Sweep it back and forth across the tooth so that it picks up any particles that have lodged there.
Brush the area. If your ache is caused by gingivitis, this is one of the best ways to ease the pain. Brush your teeth for several minutes, concentrating on the painful area. Keep brushing until the area no longer feels as sensitive.
Use a rinse. Finish the cleaning by using mouthwash to rinse away dislodged particles. Or, or pour a few drops of bee propolis into a half of a glass of water and use this to rinse your mouth.
Keep it up. Use this routine twice a day, every day, and keep using it after the pain subsides.

, A toothache caused by a blow to the tooth or a mild infection might go away on its own. To help it along, make a rinse with warm water and a spoonful of sea salt. When the salt dissolves, gargle the water in your mouth, making sure it splashes around the affected area. Repeat several times daily until the pain subsides.

Learn more about cracked or broken teeth.,
See a dental care professional.,
Tell your dentist how your tooth was cracked.,
Avoid habits that may result in cracked teeth.,
Wear a mouthguard at night.,
Protect your teeth when playing sports.",How to Deal with the Pain from a Chipped Tooth2," The severity of the pain depends upon how deep the crack or break in your tooth is. The surface level of the tooth is the enamel, which is the hardest tissue in the human body. The dentin layer is beneath the enamel, followed by the dental pulp chamber containing the tooth nerves.A crack that goes all the way into the dental pulp layer will be the most painful.
""Craze lines"" are cracks that affect only the enamel. Their damage is usually purely cosmetic, though if a craze line is on your front tooth, it may produce sensitivity.
Craze lines can occur when you consume a very hot or very cold beverage, or a combination of the two. They can also be caused by tooth grinding.

, Your dentist should be able to repair most simple chips in teeth. They may also recommend that you seek help from an endodontist for more complex repair.If the tooth requires a root canal, you'll need to see an endodontist. An endodontist is a dentist who has received specialized training in diagnosing and treating oral and facial pain.
Endodontists also are trained in problems associated with the inside of the tooth.

, Treatment for a cracked tooth depends in part on how the tooth was damaged. Common reasons for a cracked tooth include: chewing or biting on something hard (such as an ice cube, an unpopped kernel of popcorn, or fruit stone); a hard blow to the chin or lower jaw; tooth grinding; or gum disease, which has weakened the tooth.Sometimes large fillings serve to weaken the tooth so that it cracks in response to ordinary use.
If you have a habit of chewing pens, pencils or other hard objects, this may also result in chipping your teeth.

, If you tend to grind your teeth, either during the day or at night when you're asleep, you may be more likely to crack a tooth. Biting your lips or inner cheeks may cause enamel to erode.Smoking results in gum problems, which lead to damaged teeth.
Nail-biting is a habit that can result in a chipped tooth, particularly if you bite too hard.

, Grinding is when a person moves their jaw back and forth, pressing the teeth together. You may not even be aware that you grind your teeth at night. Sometimes a chipped tooth is how someone learns they have this bad habit! If you notice any pain in your jaw or tension in your neck, you may be grinding your teeth at night.Every time you grind your teeth, you're injuring your tooth enamel. Over time this will result in weakened teeth.
Over-the-counter mouth guards are less expensive, but may result in difficulty breathing at night.
A good night guard should be comfortable and well-fitted to your teeth. If the guard is working it should relieve any jaw pain in the morning.

, Accidental injuries are a common cause of chipped teeth. Wearing a mouthguard when playing high-impact sports will help prevent this.


Mouthguards come in a variety of price ranges. Recommended mouthguards are comfortable, resistant to tearing, and resilient. Ask your dental care provider for more information.A mouthguard should be long-lasting and easy to clean. It should be fitted to suit the individual's mouth, and should not restrict speech or breathing.
Sports for which mouthguards are recommended include both high-contact sports (such as football, hockey, roller-derby, rugby, etc.) and low-contact sports (such as gymnastics, weightlifting, surfing, etc.).

Know when to call a dentist.,
Do not delay if you may have an abscess.,
Go to your appointment and follow the dentist’s advice.,
Return to the dentist for follow-up treatment as needed.",How to Deal With a Sore Tooth2," While tooth pain can often be at least temporarily alleviated at home, permanently fixing a sore tooth frequently requires the intervention of a dentist.


Call a dentist if any of the following are true: your symptoms have lasted for two days; you have tooth pain accompanied by fever; you have signs of infection (swelling, redness, odor or discharge from the site); or you have trouble breathing or swallowing. If any of these symptoms are severe, even if they have lasted for less than two days, seek medical help immediately.If your tooth hurts when you're chewing, you might have a crack on your tooth. If it's above your gum, it can be treated with a root canal. If it's below the gum, your tooth may need to be extracted.
If you don’t have a regular dentist, call one in your area. If you have a toothache, you should be able to be seen within a couple of days.

, An abscess is an infection that has spread from a crack in the tooth into the pulp inside. From there, it can spread into the jaw and elsewhere, with possibly serious medical complications.In addition to pain, swelling, fever, redness in the gums, and a foul taste in the mouth can be signs of an abscess. Call a dentist if any of these symptoms accompany your sore tooth.
Seek medical attention immediately if you also experience any of the following symptoms: high fever, chills, vomiting, or dizziness. These can be signs of a severe dental abscess.In addition, seek immediate medical treatment if you experience an inability to open your mouth (if you can't fit one finger into it), difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, or gasping for air when you lay flat. These symptoms indicate that you might have a significant infection compromising your airway.

, Be ready to tell the dentist when your pain started, where the pain is most severe, and if you have any other symptoms.In addition to a visual inspection, the dentist may take x-rays, which can spot an abscess.
Take any and all medication prescribed by the dentist, according to his/her instructions. If you have an abscess, your dentist will probably prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection before the tooth can be fixed. Your dentist may also give you a prescription for a painkiller such as prescription strength acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or even hydrocodone.

, In the case of an abscess, the dentist will likely perform a root canal and crown. A root canal involves the removal of the infected pulp and the re-closure of the area in order to save the tooth.Root canals can be pricey, depending upon whether you have dental insurance, but they are not usually as painful as is often portrayed on television comedies, for instance.
Root canals can often take one to three office visits to complete. You will likely be fitted with a temporary crown after your root canal and need to return to the dentist for a permanent cap.
Your dentist might also give you the option of extraction, which is significantly less expensive.

Brush your teeth regularly.,
Floss your teeth regularly.,
Rinse your mouth out.,
Get regular dental check-ups.,
Protect your teeth.",How to Deal With a Sore Tooth3," Keeping your teeth clean is the easiest way to reduce your chances of having tooth pain. If it’s already too late for that, you also don't want to worsen a cavity or abscess by allowing plaque and tartar to build up on your sore tooth.You should brush your teeth at least twice a day — once in the morning and again before bed.
Many dentists recommend using a soft bristled electric toothbrush to brush your teeth, but any standard toothbrush is preferable to none at all.
To brush your teeth effectively, put a pea sized amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush. If you have a toothache, you can try using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.
Position your brush at a 45 degree angle towards your gums and teeth. Use small side to side strokes and brush the front, back, sides and tops of each tooth.
Make sure you hit all areas of your mouth as well, including your gums and tongue.

, It is nearly impossible to keep the tight spaces between teeth clean otherwise. Also, an existing toothache can be caused or aggravated by food and other debris getting stuck between your teeth.You should floss at least once a day — the time of day does not matter, nor does your choice to floss before or after brushing.
Using a piece of string floss or a floss pick, slide the floss through the space between each tooth.
Slide the floss down to the base of each tooth, getting under the gum line. Then slide the floss back and forth to loosen and remove food and debris.
Do this for all of your teeth.
If you dislodge a piece of debris and your toothache suddenly subsides, that may have been the cause of your pain.

, Both commercial mouthwashes and home-made rinses can help keep teeth clean.


A salt water rinse can help temporarily reduce mouth bacteria, including those that can be associated with abscesses. Mix one-half teaspoon of table salt to one cup of lukewarm water, swish around the mouth, and spit out. Repeat several times per day as desired.Salt water rinses are commonly prescribed starting 24 hours after dental surgery.
In the mouthwash section of the drugstore, you’ll find both cosmetic and therapeutic mouthwashes. The former merely mask bad breath, while the latter (which are generally preferable) also treat problems like tartar and plaque buildup. Read the package labels for more information on each type/brand, and follow the instructions for use., If you visit your dentist for regular cleanings, you may avoid ever having to visit him/her with emergency tooth pain.


Two cleanings per year is a common recommendation, and is often the frequency covered by dental insurance. Some people may need more frequent cleanings, however.Even if going to the dentist twice per year is a minor annoyance, it is far preferable to having major dental procedures done because of abscesses, for instance.

, Even the cleanest of teeth will become painful if cracked, chipped, broken, or otherwise traumatized, so protection of the mouth and teeth is essential.Always wear an approved protective mouthguard when playing sports or engaging in other activities where injuries to the mouth or teeth are not uncommon.
Take special care — or avoid entirely — chewing on ice, popcorn kernels, hard candy, and other similar foods that can crack or chip teeth.
Never use your teeth to cut, tear, or separate anything that doesn’t belong in your mouth. Use scissors.

Try a teeth whitening product.,
Brush your teeth.,
Floss your teeth.,
Eat less sugar.,
Avoid other harmful activities.",How to Deal With Having Bad Teeth2," If your issue with your teeth is that they aren't white enough, you can use whitening products to make them whiter.

The cheapest and best to start with is whitening toothpastes. These are easy to use because you use them just like any other toothpaste.


Also try whitening gels. These come with trays to hold the gel against your teeth. These can be more expensive, especially if you get custom trays from a dentist shaped to your teeth.
You may also want to try whitening strips. These stick onto your teeth to whiten them. These are quite expensive and you will likely have to use these repeatedly, so the cost can add up.
If you want extreme whitening, you can also get professional whitening treatments done by your dentist., Something as simple as brushing your teeth twice a day can help your overall teeth health and make you more confident about your teeth. Brushing can improve the way your teeth look even if they are not straight. Brushing will keep teeth healthy and make it easier to get dental work to fix more complex problems.


Choose a fluoride toothpaste. It will do a better job of preventing cavities and tooth decay than a non-fluoride toothpaste., Brushing is not the only maintenance that you should perform on your teeth everyday. Floss daily using either normal floss or floss toothpicks. This will help remove bacteria, plaque, and food from your teeth that is missed by your toothbrush. It will also keep your teeth healthier and looking better.Mouthwash will also help maintain your teeth and make you feel more confident about your smile. Plus, it has the added bonus of killing bacteria and giving you fresh breath.

, Excessive sugar in the diet is a leading cause of tooth decay. Each time you eat sugar, an acid is created that starts to deteriorate your teeth. Instead of eating multiple sweets really close together, try limiting the amount you intake to one sweet every 4-5 hours. This will give your teeth time to stabilize before you add any more sugar to your mouth.


Be aware of hidden sugars in sodas, juices, and products labeled ""no sugar added"". These all have sugar in them that can harm your teeth. Try diet sodas, sugar free products, or natural sweeteners. These have no effect on your teeth and will help you preserve your teeth.
You don't have to cut sweets out all together, just reduce the amount of sugar you eat each day.
Try eating sugar-free sweets if you are having a hard time reducing the amount of sugar in your diet., There are other activities and habits that can make your teeth worse. You should stop smoking because cigarettes stain your teeth. Coffee, dark colored soda, tea, and red wine can stain your teeth, so try to drink less of them on a daily basis.If you really like dark liquids, try drinking them through a straw to reduce staining.
Dry mouth can also lead to tooth decay, so try to keep your mouth moist by drinking more water or chewing sugar free gum."

, If you try different ways to make yourself feel better about your teeth but nothing works, you may have an underlying issue related to your self esteem that goes deeper than your teeth. A psychologist or counselor can help you with social anxiety related to your teeth. She can also help you with anxiety about seeing a dentist or having dental work done.

Get a root canal.,
Get a tooth extraction.",How to Cure a Toothache2," If the toothache is caused by a major infection or tooth decay, it won't go away on its own. You should see a doctor or dentist if you experience the following symptoms along with the toothache:









A fever and chills. This could be a sign that the infection is serious and the symptoms will get worse.Discharge. Again, you don't want to risk letting a bad infection get worse.Pain that grows worse and won't go away, even after taking medication. You could have a cavity that gets worse after every meal.
The pain is in a wisdom tooth. Many people have to get their wisdom teeth removed if the teeth grow in at an angle that crowds the mouth.
You have trouble swallowing or breathing, which may be caused by an abscess.

, If you have a cavity that is exposing the nerves of your teeth, leading to pain, the dentist may decide to put in a filling to protect the nerves in the pulp from getting overstimulated.







, If you have a dental abscess, which happens when the pulp of the tooth gets infected, a root canal will be performed. The dentist cleans the inside of the tooth to get rid of the infection. Since this procedure may be painful, the mouth is numbed with local anesthesia beforehand, especially if the dentist performs a surgical drainage of the abscess through the gum.








, In some cases the tooth is beyond repair, and the best course is to get it taken out. In the case of baby teeth, an extraction is almost always performed, since the teeth are going to fall out eventually anyway.








Adults who get an extraction often get bridges or dental implants to make up for the lost tooth.
In the case of wisdom teeth, tooth extraction is almost always performed because the functional advantage is not always one of the best and the position of the tooth does not allow for a proper root canal treatment. In some cases, when patients are scared or the wisdom tooth is severely impacted, patients can be put under general anesthesia. Recovery takes a week or so.

, This time-worn home remedy eases the pain of a toothache, but it probably won't cure it. Still, it's a useful trick when the ache is caused by a blow or a mild infection that will go away after a few days. Pour some whisky or vodka on a cotton ball and apply it to the affected tooth. If the gums become red or irritated, then stop using this method.

, With your thumb, press the point on the back of your other hand where the base of your thumb and your index finger meet. Apply pressure for about two minutes. This helps trigger the release of endorphin, the brain’s feel-good hormones.








, Swish 1 tbsp of coconut oil in your mouth for 15-20 minutes. There are claims that this reduces the amount to harmful bacteria in the mouth. When you swish the oil, the bacteria get 'stuck' in the oil. This is how the bacteria, as well as plaque caused by bacteria is removed. After 15-20 minutes spit out the oil into a garbage can. Do not swallow it...you will be swallowing the bacteria in the oil if you swallow it. You also should not put oil in the drain, as it can harden and cause it to clog.

Since baking soda has been used a teeth cleaner for over 150 years and is fairly inexpensive, it is present in may major toothpaste brands in different quantities. Opt for a toothpaste with a high concentration of baking soda (e.g. Arm and Hammer toothpaste)."

, Dishwashing soap is a good choice, but you can also use hand soap. Anti-bacterial soap also works., Gently brush the mouth guard or retainer. Pay special attention to the pockets of dirt and plaque.

, Make sure all of the soap comes off. Feel the mouth guard to make sure none of the soap remains. Rinse it really well to avoid any unpleasant irritation of the oral mucosa from leftover soap.

, If your mouth guard or retainer is not in use, it should be in a case. This protects it from getting damaged and away from pets (who often like to chew on it.)"

Mouth rinses may contain antimicrobial agents to prevent disease, fluoride that reduces tooth decay, and odor neutralizers to combat bad breath.Some mouth rinses are merely cosmetic, meaning they seek to eliminate bad breath temporarily but do not have the bacteria fighting powers of stronger brands. Make sure you purchase a mouth rinse that is therapeutic and designed to clean your mouth and throat in addition to eliminating bad breath.Mouth rinses will come with instructions on how to use them. Most of them require you to swish or gargle the liquid for a number of seconds before spitting it into the sink and rinsing out your mouth with water.;
, Tonsils are small collections of lymph tissue in the back of the throat that are often the cause of infections and bad breath. Some people have their tonsils removed via operation to keep these from occurring, but if you still have your tonsils they may require upkeep to prevent the buildup of bacteria. Sometimes, tonsil stones, which are concretions of food particles and mucus, build up in the folds of the tonsils and cause bad breath. They may also make you feel like you're gagging, or like you need to clear your throat constantly.


If you're having trouble with tonsil stones, you may need to regularly irrigate your tonsils, using an irrigation system you can purchase at a drug store. Tonsil irrigation systems work somewhat like nasal or ear irrigation systems do, in that a rubber syringe is used to spray water and some kind of medication in the back of the throat to remove unwanted debris. Make sure you don't use too much pressure or force, or you could irritate your tonsils or cause bleeding.You can also buy tonsil sprays at most drug stores. These are medicated sprays you use on the back of your throat to clean out your tonsils and prevent decay.If your tonsils are growing uncomfortably large, taking oral probiotics might hinder their growth. Talk to your doctor before trying any new medication, however.If you aren't able to remove tonsil stones on your own, or they pose a serious problem for you, see your doctor.

, When brushing your teeth each day, make sure you take a few minutes to brush the back of your tongue with your toothbrush. This helps clean your throat and mouth in addition to your teeth, and prevents the build up of disease and bad breath causing bacteria.

, The quickest way to remove phlegm and other unwanted substances from the throat is simple over-the-counter medication that can be purchased at most drug stores and supermarkets.


OTC medications labeled as ""expectorants"" are designed to clear mucus and phlegm from the throat and chest. These include brand names like Mucinex or generic medications like guaifenesin.Always check the side effects of any new medications you're taking. Many expectorants cause drowsiness and sometimes medication labels might even advise you not operate a motor vehicle while taking the medication.You should always consult your physician when taking any new medications, even over the counter meds, to make sure they're safe for you given your medical history and any current medication you're taking.If over the counter medications do not help, see your physician. If she thinks it's necessary, she may refer you to an Ears, Nose, and Throat Specialist to help find you a prescription medication to clear out your throat.

, Salt water, or saline solution, can effectively clean out the throat for a short period of time by preventing nasal drip, reducing stuffiness, and removing mucus from the nose.You can buy sterile saline solution from the drug store or make your own at home.


Mix half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt in a cup of distilled water at room temperature. If you have to use tap water, boil it first to sterilize it and then let it cool down.Dissolve the baking soda and salt into the water.You will need some kind of rubber syringe. You can use an ear syringe or a medical syringe with no needle. Squirt the solution into your nose and let it run into the back of your throat. Spit it out into the sink.Do not be concerned if you accidentally swallow some of the solution. It will not hurt you.This should help clear your nasal pathways, which will reduce the buildup of phlegm in your throat. Repeat as symptoms persist.Make sure to keep the syringe sterile by washing it with soap and water after using it. Replace your saline solution every few days.

, Honey and lemon both have antibacterial properties that can help soothe the throat and remove phlegm, mucus, and other bacteria.


Combine honey and lemon juice in equal properties and mix thoroughly.You can take a spoonful of the mixture pure, but many people find the taste too sweet. If that's the case, adding it to your tea, coffee, or even just to a cup of hot water can help it go down easier.Don't give honey to children under 1 year old. It can contain botulism spores that can cause a serious infection in infants., Eucalyptus oil can be applied externally to relieve congestion, which may help clear up the throat.


You can buy eucalyptus oil from most drug stores, supermarkets, and health food shops. Remember, it's only for applying to the skin and should never be taken orally. Always dilute eucalyptus oil in a carrier oil first, such as coconut oil, olive oil, or canola oil.You can gently massage eucalyptus oil into your chest to and neck and leave on for a few hours to relieve congestion. This may result in your throat clearing up., Raw ginger and garlic can be extremely helping in clearing up congestion and cleaning out the throat.


Ginger and garlic both have antibacterial properties that can help clear out infections that lead the phlegm and mucus in the throat. Phlegm itself contains a variety of bacteria that garlic can destroy.You should consume ginger and garlic uncooked for the best results. If the idea of chewing whole bits of garlic or ginger puts you off, you can always mince both and take with water like a pill.

, Herbal teas have been known to eliminate irritation in the throat caused by phlegm-causing infections. Green tea, ginger tea, chamomile, or lemon tea are good choices. Try a non-caffeinated variety for best results.Herbal tea can melt away mucus in the throat, decongesting you and cleaning out your throat., Spicy foods could potentially irritate an already sore throat, so use this method with caution. The idea is that spicy foods loosen phlegm and make it runnier, easier to remove via coughing and blowing your nose. Chili, peppers, wasabi, and horseradish are all good choices. However, if you've had issues such as acid reflux in response to spicy foods in the past, it might be best to try a different method., If your throat is clogged or congested, there are certain foods you should avoid as they can make the problem worse.


Dairy products, like cheese, yogurt, and milk, can increase mucus production in the body. Meals rich in salt and oil should also be avoided.Refined sugars and other artificial sweeteners can irritate the throat and make problems worse. They should be avoided while you're trying to clean your throat.Soy products, like tofu and soy milk, can also increase the production of phlegm. Therefore, you should not substitute milk and cheese with soy alternatives while trying to clean out your throat., Proper hydration can help mucus stay loose and not get caught in your throat as easily.


Aim for about 8 glasses of water a day, although if you're sick with a cold you may need to drink slightly more than this as you'll be producing more mucus.Water keeps your throat lubricated, which reduces phlegm production. Drink water with meals instead of other beverages and have a bottle of water nearby while you're at work or relaxing at home and sip on it periodically., Smoking not only results in a litany of other health problems, it's very bad for your throat. Not only does smoke irritate the vocal folds, tobacco use makes you more susceptible to infections resulting in more colds and flus and therefore more mucus. Ditch the cigarettes while trying to clear out your throat and look into plans for quitting longterm., If you have phlegm stuck in your throat, alcohol and carbonation should be avoided.


Carbonated beverages, even carbonated waters, can irritate the throat and create unnecessary phlegm.Alcohol not only irritates existing phlegm, it lowers the immune system which can prolong your cold or flu, meaning your throat will take longer to clear out."

Scrape your teeth clean with a crunchy fruit or veggie.,
Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink.,
Go to a dentist if you notice a problem developing.,
Let the dentist polish your teeth.,
Get protective treatments.",How to Care for Your Teeth," When you brush you should do so for at least two minutes. This will give you the time you need to get to all surfaces of your teeth. Make sure you remember the backs of your teeth.Teach your children good oral hygiene habits by having them start brushing as soon as they get their first baby teeth. Cavities in baby teeth will be just as uncomfortable as cavities in permanent teeth.For best results, use a soft bristled brush or an electric toothbrush. Whichever type of toothbrush you use, be sure to replace it every three months. If you are concerned that your toothbrush might be worn out earlier, you can inspect it to see if the bristles are bent and damaged. If so, you may want to replace it.
Brushing regularly will not only give you healthy, pain-free teeth, but it will also keep your breath fresh. But don’t brush too soon after eating. After you eat your mouth is more acidic and this makes the enamel temporarily softer. Wait at least 30 minutes before brushing.;
, Fluoride protects the enamel and makes you less likely to get cavities. But it is important that the toothpaste have enough fluoride to be effective. Check to make sure it has at least 1,350 – 1,500 ppm.Toothpastes with less than 1,000 ppm of fluoride will be ineffective at protecting your teeth.
Children can use full strength toothpaste if an adult makes sure they spit it out after brushing.

, Flossing cleans the surfaces between your teeth. This is important because you can’t clean there effectively with your toothbrush. As a result, if you don’t floss, food, plaque, and bacteria build up there.Use 30 cm of floss or an interdental cleaner. Insert it between your teeth and curve it around one of the teeth. Move it up and down along the side of the tooth, then curve around the other tooth and repeat.Use a floss pick if you have trouble using the classic method.
Be gentle when you go below the gum line. If you are new to flossing, your gums may bleed, but after a few days, this will stop.

, Look for a mouthwash that has fluoride in it. If you use a fluoride mouthwash after brushing and flossing, this will help the fluoride reach the enamel of all surfaces of your teeth. Swish the mouthwash around in your mouth for two minutes to allow it to thoroughly coat all areas of your teeth.


Chlorhexidine is also a protective substance found in some mouthwashes, which fights against bacteria and has a slight remineralizing effect.
You can also make a natural remedy using a salt solution. Put half teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water and stir.
Don’t swallow the mouthwash because it may upset your stomach. If you want to try to kill bacteria further back in your throat, you can gargle briefly before spitting it out.

, The surface of your tongue is uneven. This means that food particles and bacteria often get trapped there. This then becomes a source of bacteria which gets transferred to your teeth.You can brush gently or use a special tongue scraper. Some toothbrushes even have a rough, rubbery patch on the back which you can use for this purpose.
Scrape gently so that you don’t injure your tongue. It shouldn’t hurt. When you finish, rinse your mouth out to get rid of the debris and bacteria.

, Smoking will stain your teeth yellow, give you bad breath, and make you more likely to get gum disease or mouth cancers. If you need help quitting smoking, there are many resources available. You can:Get support from friends, family, or a support group
Avoid situations where you habitually smoke
Call a hotline when you are having cravings
Talk to your doctor or see an addictions counselor
Try nicotine replacement therapy
Get residential treatment in a treatment center

, Sugar erodes the enamel on your teeth because as it breaks down, it produces acid which wears away your enamel. This makes you more likely to get cavities and tooth decay.Foods to avoid include:Sugary sodas. Limit the amount of juice you drink to one glass per day.
Desserts such as pastries, cakes, ice cream and candies.
Highly sweetened tea or coffee.

, These foods leave a thin layer of sugar on your teeth which is difficult to remove and increases your risk of tooth decay. Try to avoid eating:Gummy candies
Granola bars
Taffy
Dried fruit like raisins
Sugary gum. Sugar-free gum is excellent for stimulating saliva production and helping to remove the last little bits of food stuck between your teeth, This particularly effective at the end of a meal or as a healthy snack between meals. Consider eating more:


Apples
Broccoli
Peppers
Carrots
Lettuce
Cucumbers
Celery
Peanuts
Goji berries
Seeds

, Alcohol damages the enamel on your teeth and increases your risk of tooth decay. If you need help quitting drinking there are numerous resources you can draw upon. You can:Get support from friends, family, or a support group like Alcoholic Anonymous
Talk to your doctor about taking medications
Get counseling
Try residential treatment

, Don’t wait until it’s extremely painful. If you don’t have dental insurance, you may be able to find affordable care by contacting dental schools, searching for free clinics online at the websites of organizations like the American Dental Association or the American Dental Hygienists Association, or contacting your community health center or local health department. Signs that you need to have your teeth checked include:Pain
Permanent teeth that are loose
Red, swollen, or painful gums
Swelling in your jaw
Bad breath or a strange taste in your mouth that doesn’t go away
Sensitivity to the temperature of your food

, For best long-term results, you should have your teeth examined and cleaned twice a year. This will involve:Inspecting your teeth for signs of decay
Teaching you how to brush and floss most effectively
Cleaning each surface of each tooth
Scraping away hard plaques that have built up

, These treatments make your teeth less vulnerable to decay. Many people, both children and adults, get fissure sealants and fluoride varnishes.Fissures are the little crevices on the chewing surfaces of your teeth. This treatment involves putting a thin plastic coating on the teeth to prevent cavities from starting in them. This procedure is done on permanent teeth and is good for a decade, but it needs annual check from your dentist.
Fluoride varnish is a strong fluoride solution which strengthens the enamel. It can be applied twice a year on both baby teeth and permanent teeth.

Figure out the best deductible for you.,

Pick a plan that has the coverage you need.,
Check out the premium.,
Look at the waiting periods.,
Check reviews of the company.,
Choose a dentist.,
Look at group coverage.,
Comparison shop.",How to Choose a Dental Insurance Plan," ""Deductible"" is probably a word you've heard thrown around a lot when it comes to insurance. A deductible is just an amount you must pay yourself before your insurance kicks in. If your deductible is $500, that means you must pay the dentist $500 in dental work before your insurance starts to pay anything. Deductibles reset each year, and some plans won't have a deductible.If your teeth are relatively healthy, you may not even meet a $500 deductible in a year if you only get a single cleaning and x-rays done.
Some plans have exceptions for maintenance work, meaning they will pay for basic dental work (like cleanings), but you must meet the deductible if you have anything extensive done.
For deductibles, you have to guess how much work you'll get done. If you need a lot of work done, a plan with a low deductible is better, as you won't be paying as much out-of-pocket. Keep in mind that lower deductibles mean you'll pay more per month for insurance.;
, That may just sound like a bunch of letters. DHMO stands for dental health maintenance organization, while PPO stands for preferred provider organization. You're probably still confused, so take a moment to look more closely at how their names relate to their coverage.A DHMO focuses on keeping costs low. Plus, things like cleanings and x-rays are covered without having to meet a deductible (though you may need to pay a co-pay). On the other hand, you won't have as many choices when it comes to dentists.
A PPO gives you more freedom for deciding where to go, but you usually have to meet the deductible before any services are covered, even maintenance. Also, PPOs tend to be more expensive overall. Choose this plan if you want to be able to have a larger pool of dentists to choose from.
You might run across one other type of plan, called an indemnity plan. These plans let you choose whomever you want for your dentist, and the insurance just pays a percentage., The yearly cap, also called the limit or annual maximum, is how much an insurance company will pay for your coverage in a single year. Most dental coverage caps at $1,000 or $1,500, though you may be able to swing a higher cap with a higher premium.Usually the cap doesn't include the maintenance work. So, if you've had two cleanings, plus $2,400 worth of dental work, only the $2,400 will count towards your cap.
Obviously, if you need more work done, you'll want a higher cap. However, you're not likely to get much higher than $1,500 without paying more in premiums. Therefore, you must consider whether it's better to pay higher premiums or to eat the cost of the extra work.
The $1,500 cap is only what insurance is paying. So if your plan covers 50% of the work, that means you can get $3,000 worth of work that year, with both you and the insurance company each paying $1,500.

, When it comes to dental insurance, what's covered can vary a great deal. Most plans won't cover more than 50 to 60 percent of extensive dental work. Some plans will cover more maintenance, while others will cover more of the extensive work. When you're looking at plans, check to see what percentage of dental work it covers.You may find that one plan covers all maintenance work and 50 percent of all other work up to a capped number, such as $1,000. Other plans may not cover maintenance work, but they may offer coverage of up to 60 percent of all other work up to $1,500.
If you're younger (under 40), you'll likely do better with a plan that covers maintenance, while if you're older, you may do better with a plan that covers more of the extensive work.

, Of course, cost is going to be a factor, and the premium is the only thing you'll pay consistently, which means you can stick it in your budget. A premium is the amount you pay each month to have insurance. Dental plans tend to be much cheaper than health insurance, usually under $50 a month. In theory, the higher the premium, the more coverage you get. However, that's not always the case, as premiums can vary widely by company.When comparing, make sure to compare benefits while also considering the cost of the premium. You're trying to get the highest coverage for the lowest premium. Think of it like a blanket. If two blankets cost $25 and $26 each and one covers your feet while the other doesn't, you're going to pick the one that also covers your feet, all else being equal. Dental insurance is the same way.

, If you need dental work yesterday, smaller waiting periods are going to be your friend. On many plans, you must wait a certain amount of time before you can get extensive work done. Other plans may even make you wait for maintenance work. That's because they know that people think about getting coverage for a month and then dropping it when they don't need it anymore., This step is where things can get a bit tricky. If you're just staring at numbers, you can just pick the lowest premium for the best coverage. However, service can vary from company to company, just like any industry. So once you've narrowed it down to a couple of plans, you may want to look at how customers have rated those companies., If you have a favorite dentist already in mind, you'll need to think about that when buying insurance. Not every insurance plan is going to cover every dentist. In other words, if you have a dentist you love, you need to make sure they're covered when you buy your plan, so you can keep going to the dentist who knows if you cringe at every dental procedure., If you have a good job, you may be able to get dental insurance that way. Bonus, it will be cheaper because you're in a group. An insurance group just means you buy insurance with other people to make it cheaper.You may be in other groups or organizations that you can use to purchase insurance. For instance, your college may give you a group rate, as well as groups like AARP. Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace may also offer discounted rates.

, You know to comparison shop when you're buying other items. You comparison shop on everything from spaghetti sauce to a new car. A health insurance plan is no different. You can do the legwork yourself, but you'll save some legwork if you use an online plan comparison tool.

These tools let you select several plans in your price range. Then you can compare what kind of coverage and deductible each plan has.

Stay hydrated.,
Rest after the surgery is over.",How to Cope after Mouth Surgery1," Before going in for the procedure, stock up on water, yogurt, applesauce, and other soft foods. Grab some magazines, books, movies, or other favorite sources of entertainment. Get your blankets and pillows out, and make your sofa and bed cozy and ready for you to crash for a few days.Find out how long your expected recovery time is and plan for that duration accordingly.;
, Ask a friend or family member for ride home after surgery. If you've had a general anesthetic (gas sedation or sleeping pills), you are typically not legally permitted to drive. With the exception of taxis, it’s also recommended to avoid public transportation if you’ve been sedated or given an anesthetic.You may also need a ride to the pharmacy and assistance in filling any prescriptions your oral surgeon might offer immediately after surgery, such as painkillers.

, If you’ve had a tooth or teeth extracted, make sure to drink lots of water following surgery. It’s important to keep the surgical site from drying out. Do not consume any hot, carbonated, or acidic beverages, including soda, coffee, and juices.You should also avoid alcohol and milk, which can introduce bacteria (such as lactobacillus) to the surgical site.


Drinking lukewarm water can be easier and less painful.
Don’t drink through a straw for a least a week: this can dislodge clotted blood and cause bleeding or dry sockets.

, Don’t plan on doing any activities immediately following your surgery. For the rest of that day, just curl up and get some rest. While you should avoid anything strenuous for at least a week, you can typically resume normal activities within a day or two, depending on your dentist or oral surgeon’s orders.If you are experiencing persistent bleeding, sit upright and keep yourself elevated in order to avoid choking.

Use antiseptic mouthwash.,
Brush your teeth properly.,
Floss regularly.,
Avoid eating sticky, sugary foods.",How to Clean Your Gums1," You can get antiseptic mouthwash over the counter at the pharmacy. This type of mouthwash contains chlorhexidine, which can help to prevent a buildup of plaque on your teeth and gums. Only use the mouthwash as directed by your doctor or a pharmacist. Using mouthwash with chlorhexidine can stain your teeth brown so only use it occasionally.Make sure you rinse your mouth well with water between brushing your teeth and using the mouthwash. This will ensure the mouthwash works properly and does not interact with any ingredients in your toothpaste.;
, Another way you can keep your gums clean is by brushing and flossing your teeth correctly and regularly. Brush your teeth twice a day and/or after every meal. Use a soft bristle brush or an electric toothbrush. Brush each tooth 15 to 20 times using gentle, short strokes. Go for toothpaste that contains fluoride to maintain your teeth and gums., You should also floss once a day to keep plaque and tartar from building up in your teeth and gums. Use about 18 inches of dental floss, holding it tight between your thumbs and forefingers. Slide the floss up and down between your teeth. Make sure you curve around the tooth when the floss reaches your gum line. Rub the side of your tooth with the floss to remove any food or plaque at the gum line. Floss all of your teeth, including your back teeth.Try to floss after each meal so food does not get stuck in your teeth for a long period of time.

, Foods that contain sugar can end up getting onto your teeth and gums. They can then be difficult to remove, even with brushing and flossing. Avoid soft candies, toffees, taffies, and pastries. If you do eat sweets, rinse your mouth with water afterward or brush your teeth. Do not let these foods sit on your teeth or gums for a long period of time.Make sure you have a lot of foods high in calcium in your diet, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. Calcium is good for your teeth and your overall dental health.

Look for one that freshens breath.",How to Choose a Toothpaste," It's important that your toothpaste contains fluoride, as it helps strengthen the enamel of your teeth. Your enamel is under constant attack from acids, and fluoride remineralizes the entire structure. Make sure fluoride is an ingredient in any toothpaste you buy. It should be 1,000 parts per million in your toothpaste.Fluoride is particularly important for diabetics, as it helps remove plaque. Because having infection in the mouth can be dangerous to a diabetic, it's important to keep your mouth, gums, and teeth as healthy as possible.Consider adding a 30-second rinse with an antibacterial mouthwash to ensure oral health.;
, It's best to pick a toothpaste approved by the American Dental Association (ADA), as they make sure each product with their seal meets certain standards. The toothpaste packaging will have the ADA logo on it if it is approved by this organization., When you are looking for a toothpaste for your child, it's important to pick one designed specifically for them. Children are more likely to swallow toothpaste, and children's toothpastes often don't contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which shouldn't be swallowed.Plus, adult toothpastes are harsher on enamel, so they shouldn't be used on children's teeth., If you have sensitive teeth, it can help to purchase a toothpaste designed to help combat that problem. It should say on the label that it is meant for sensitive teeth. You may not notice results right away, so make sure you use it for a little while before you decide it doesn't work.Ask your doctor about prescription-strength. If you try an over-the-counter toothpaste for sensitive teeth, you may find after a while that it doesn't work for you. If that's the case, your dentist can prescribe you a stronger version. Keep in mind, though, that the prescription variety may be more expensive.A good toothpaste for sensitive teeth should feel sticky an harder the remove than your usual toothpaste. It helps minerals to stay on your tooth surface for a longer time, delivering an increased remineralizing effect.

, Some toothpastes do help to whiten teeth. If your teeth have been stained by what you eat and drink, you may want to try a whitening toothpaste. These toothpastes generally use abrasives to remove stains from the surface of your teeth. Look for one that says ""whitens teeth"" or ""whitening.""However, whitening toothpastes can be damaging when used over long periods of time. In fact, they can contribute to sensitivity and the breaking down of your enamel, especially if you use a lot of pressure when brushing with a hard bristle toothbrush. Ask your dentist about how long it's safe for you to use a whitening toothpaste., Another option when it comes to toothpastes is to buy one that reduces tartar buildup. If that's your goal, pick one that has pyrophosphates as an ingredient. This ingredient is known to help reduce the build up of tartar over time., On the upside, organic toothpastes stick to more natural ingredients, which can be healthier for your mouth (though not necessarily); however, they also usually don't contain fluoride, which most dentists agree is important for dental health.Some natural toothpastes contain salt, which is also abrasive, so you need to be gentle when brushing.

, Once you satisfy the other requirements, it's really up to you what you flavor you choose. In fact, it's important to pick one with a flavor you like, as that will encourage you to brush your teeth more often, so go with what tickles your taste buds.Taste is especially important in kids' toothpastes, as they will be more enthusiastic about brushing if the toothpaste is in a fun flavor they like, such as bubble gum or strawberry. Just make sure they understand they must not eat or swallow the toothpaste.

, Texture really doesn't matter all that much in terms of how it cleans your teeth, so it's up to you whether you pick a paste, gel, or liquid. Paste and gels do make it somewhat easier to brush, as they cling better to your toothbrush and teeth., If bad breath is a problem for you, pick one that can help freshen your breath. It should be labeled as such on the package. Usually, these toothpastes have ingredients that can make your breath less smelly by covering up bad odors, or they fight the bacteria that cause bad breath."

Manage bleeding.,
Take pain medication as recommended.,
Use ice packs.,
Rinse your mouth after the first day.,
Keep distractions handy.",How to Cope after Mouth Surgery2," Keep gauze in to protect the surgical site and change it out regularly until the bleeding stops. Firmly biting the gauze, without causing pain, will help control bleeding. If you’re finding your bleeding persists, try biting down on a moistened, cool tea bag: tannic acid in the tea will help clot blood.Normally the bleeding should stop after one hour.


Avoid excessive or forceful spitting, as this will dislodge blood clots.
Give your dentist or oral surgeon a call if bleeding persists for more than a day.

, Use whatever medication your oral surgeon prescribed or recommended. If you were not prescribed medication, you can use ibuprofen or another over-the-counter pain medication without exceeding the normal daily dosage (check the label). Consult your doctor if you experience severe pain: they might prescribe medication if they haven't already or increase your dosage if necessary.If there was an infection you may need to take antibiotics as well. Follow your dentist's instructions and make sure you take the full course of antibiotics.
Make sure you inform your dentist of any allergies to medications.

, Swelling will reach its peak within two to three days of surgery, but regularly using ice packs as soon as you get home from surgery can help keep it at a minimum. Apply a zip-lock bag of ice or ice pack to your face on the side or sides where surgery occurred. Keep the ice on for 20 minutes, then take it off for 20 minutes., It’s important to keep your mouth clean, but do not rinse your mouth within the first 24 hours if you’ve had a tooth or teeth extracted. Gently rinse your mouth with salt water every two hours and after meals after the first day passes. Don't brush your teeth for the first two days, unless your surgeon says otherwise, and continue to take care brushing around the surgical site as it heals in the future.You can also rinse with diluted mouthwash. Dilute mouthwash in a 1:1 ratio with water and rinse after meals and before going to bed.

, Keep your mind off swelling and discomfort by keeping plenty of entertainment within arm’s reach. Stay distracted by watching TV, playing video games, texting, and reading. Focusing on something other than how sore your mouth feels helps to pass the time.


If you’re bedridden for multiple days but are feeling up to it, try getting some light work done, especially if you’re able to work from home on a home computer.
Remember to avoid strenuous physical activity for at least a week. Don't try to exercise or play any sports.

Eat soft foods.,
Avoid foods that are either too hot or too cold.,
Make sure you’re getting enough protein.",How to Cope after Mouth Surgery3," Creamy soups are good sources of nutrients and calories following surgery, provided they’re not too hot. Smooth yogurts, custard, and milkshakes are also easy to drink. After you heal a bit, you can indulge in mashed potatoes, soft cheese, baked beans, rice pudding, puréed fruit, and smoothies.


Avoid smoothies or purées containing strawberries or other fruits with small seeds. These can get stuck in surgical wounds.

, Keep it lukewarm until your teeth and gums stop being so sensitive. Light cooling has a numbing effect, so small pieces of ice or ice cream when carefully used can have a soothing effect on swelling. Additionally, remember that salty foods, as well as very acidic foods or drinks will cause stinging to surgical wounds., It can be particularly difficult to get enough protein during your recovery time. Consider acquiring or making your own smoothies with milk fortified with additional protein, peanut butter, or powdered protein. Pasteurized eggs or egg whites are also good sources of protein, and butter, vegetable oils, or avocado can be added for additional calories.Consider eating baby food as well to ensure you’re getting proper nutrition during recovery.

Do oil pulling.,
Apply a garlic and turmeric paste.,
Use neem toothpaste or mouthwash.,
Try sage tea.",How to Clean Your Gums2," Oil pulling can be done with sesame oil, olive oil, or coconut oil as long as the oil is 100% organic. This natural remedy can help to remove plaque and tartar on your gums by pulling them out. To do oil pulling, swish a tablespoon of oil in your mouth for five to ten minutes.After five to ten minutes, spit the oil out in the garbage. Do not spit it out in the sink as the oil can clog your pipes.
Rinse your mouth with warm water to remove any remaining oil in your mouth.

, Garlic and turmeric have antibacterial properties and anti-inflammatory properties. They are great for maintaining your gum health. Press one to two cloves of garlic and add a teaspoon of turmeric. Mix the two ingredients together until they form a paste. Then, apply the paste to your gums and let it sit for one to two minutes.

Ask your dentist about scaling and polishing.,
Speak to your dentist about root planing.,
Discuss surgical options with a periodontist if you have serious gum issues.",How to Clean Your Gums3," Get a deep clean of your teeth and gums by getting scaling and polishing done through your dentist. Scaling and polishing is usually recommended if you have a buildup of plaque and tartar on your teeth and gums or if you are at risk of developing gum disease.During the cleaning, the dental hygienist will scrape away the plaque and tartar using special instruments, followed by a polish to remove marks or stains.

, Root planing is a deep cleaning that gets under your gums to remove bacteria from the roots of your teeth. It is often recommended if you have gum disease or other gum related issues.You will be put under local anaesthetic to numb your mouth during the cleaning. After the cleaning, you may feel pain and discomfort for 48 hours.

, Your dentist may recommend that you speak to a periodontist about periodontal surgery if you have severe gum disease and loose or infected teeth. Talk to a periodontist about this option if you have a tooth that is infected or your gums are swollen, irritated, or receding.During periodontal surgery, any affected teeth will be removed. The periodontist may put you on antibiotics after the surgery to prevent further infection.

Determine if you are eligible.,
Make an appointment.,
Eat iron-rich foods.,
Hydrate yourself.,
Get a good night's rest.,
Eat three hours before your donation.,
Collect proper ID cards.,
Avoid certain activities.,
Fill out the forms.,
Take the physical.,
Prepare yourself mentally.,
Have your blood taken.,
Relax.,
Rest and replenish.",How to Prepare to Donate Blood," Each country's blood service has different requirements in place to be eligible to donate blood. These can range from blood disease concerns, to past travel locations, to age and weight. In general, you will be able to give blood if you meet certain criteria.


You have to be healthy, fit, and not suffering from a current illness. Avoid donating blood if you have a cold, a cold sore, a cough, a virus, or an upset stomach. Certain prescribed medications, such as antibiotics, can make you ineligible to donate blood.
You must weigh at least 110 pounds or 50 kg.
You have to be old enough. In many jurisdictions, parental permission is required for the ages 16–17 to give blood. Check the blood organization in your area if you are around this age.
You can only donate blood every 56 days. If you have donated blood more recently than that, then you are not eligible again.Do not give blood if you have had simple dental work done within 24 hours or major dental work in the past month.Dental work in general can place one at risk for dislodging bacteria. This bacteria can get into blood stream and cause systemic infection.;
, There are many blood donation centers across many countries. Since these centers need time to prepare for you to give blood, you should make an appointment. This also allows you time to make sure that all the eligibility requirements are met for that particular date.You can also look for a blood drive if you don't want to make an appointment. Check local advertisements for blood drives in your area.

, Since blood production requires iron, you should eat iron-rich foods for two weeks before your appointment. This will help you have strong blood for donation and help you better recuperate after your donation. Iron-rich foods include spinach, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, organ meat, eggs, and beef.Having good levels of vitamin C will also help to increase iron absorption. Try to consume citrus fruit, juices, or vitamin C supplements.

, To prepare your body for the loss of blood, you need to drink plenty of water or fruit juice the night and morning before you donate. The leading cause of faintness and dizziness when you give blood is a drop in blood pressure or blood sugar. The risk of this is greatly reduced if you are well-hydrated when you visit the donation center.It is recommended you drink a lot in the 24 hours leading to the donation time, especially when it's warm. This includes drinking four good sized glasses of water or juice during the three hours leading up to your donation.If you are donating plasma or platelets, drink four to six 8-ounce glasses of fluids two to three hours before your appointment., Before you donate blood, you should have proper sleep. This will help you feel better and more alert when you give blood, which will help reduce the risk of any adverse reactions to the process.This means you should get full night's sleep (seven to nine hours for adults)before you donate blood.

, Never give blood if you have not eaten that day. Eating will keep your blood sugar levels stable, which will help you feel better after you have donated blood. Having food in your system helps to ward off lightheadedness and fainting. You should eat something healthy that fills you up but doesn't make you feel stuffed.


You shouldn't eat heavy before your come. If you are donating early, eat something light such as cereal or toast. If you are giving blood near the middle of the day, have a light lunch, such as a sandwich and piece of fruit.
Don't eat immediately before your appointment so you don't run the risk of being nauseated during your donation.
Avoid fatty foods for 24 hours before you donate. Increased fat in your blood stream might make it impossible to get accurate readings on mandatory screening tests conducted on your blood after you donate. If the center can't run all the tests, they have to discard your donation., The requirements for each blood donation center may differ, but you will always need at least one form of ID for your visit. This generally includes your driver's license, your blood donor card, or two alternate forms of ID, such as your passport and social security card. Make sure you take these on the day of your appointment.A blood donor card is a card you get from the blood donation center that registers you within their system. You can order one of these online, go by the center to order one, or ask about them when you donate the first time so you have them on subsequent donation visits., In the hours leading up to your appointment, you need to avoid certain activities that may hurt your chances of donating or contaminate your blood. You should not smoke within the hour leading up to your appointment. You should also avoid alcoholic beverages in the 24 hours before you donate. You should also not chew gum, mints, or candy in the hours before your donation.


Chewing gum, mints, or candy makes the temperature in your mouth go up, which could make it seem like you have a fever and make you ineligible to give blood.
If you are giving platelets, you should avoid taking aspirin or other NSAIDs for two days before you donate., When you arrive at your appointment, you will first have to answer a lot of questions about your general health and likely fill out a confidential medical history form. The types of questions you will be asked will vary depending on your particular location, but you should be ready to at least give them the name of any medications that you currently take and any locations you have traveled to over the past 3 years.The United Blood Services is regulated by US Food and Drug Administration. They must comply with regulations set forth by the FDA. Their guidelines have the safety of public in mind and if any behavior, disease, or medication is deemed risky for potential contamination or transmission of disease, one is asked not to donate. It is not meant to discriminate.
As such, certain activities increase the chances of blood borne illnesses and will be inquired about. These includes intravenous drug use, certain sexual activities, taking certain medications, and living in certain countries. If you answer yes to any of these questions, you will not be able to give blood.
There are also certain diseases, such as hepatitis, HIV, AIDS, and Chagas' disease, that will make it impossible for you to ever donate blood.
Answer all interview questions honestly. They can start delving into sensitive areas, but you should be honest so the center will have an idea if they can use your blood., Once you pass all the portions of the questionnaire, you will be given a small physical. This typically includes a nurse taking your blood pressure, checking your pulse, and measuring your body temperature. The nurse will then give you a small prick on your finger in order to check your hemoglobin and iron levels.


Your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, hemoglobin levels, and iron levels will need to be within the healthy range before you can give blood. This ensures the health of your blood and that you won't leave you feeling nauseated or anemic., Many people who give blood are afraid of needles or don't like to be stuck with one. You can distract or prepare yourself before it happens to make it easier on you. Take a deep breath before the needle goes in. You can also pinch yourself with the arm not giving blood to create a distraction.


Don't hold your breath. If you do, you might pass out.
Be reassured that most people report little or no pain, mostly just a feeling like a pinch. The real issue is discomfort, so the less you tense up, the better., When you finish your physical, the nurse will ask you to lie back in a reclining chair or lie down all the way. A cuff will be placed around your arm to make your veins easier to see and your blood pump faster. The nurse will clean the inside of your elbow, which is where the needle will be placed. The nurse will then place the needle in your arm, which is attached to a long tube. The nurse will ask you to pump your hand a few times and your blood will start coming out.


The nurse will take a few vials of blood first for testing, then your blood will fill the bag. You usually give a pint of blood at a time.
This process typically takes between 10–15 minutes., Nervousness can also cause your blood pressure to drop and can lead to dizziness. Talk to the person taking your blood if it helps you to feel better. Ask him to explain everything that is being done.


Find ways to distract yourself, such as singing a song, reciting something, contemplating the outcome of a book you're reading or a TV series you follow, listening to your electronic device, or thinking about the worthy end result of your donation.

, Once you are finished giving blood and the nurse bandages your arm up, you will be asked to sit and wait for about 15 minutes to ensure that you don't faint or feel dizzy. You will also get a snack and some juice to help replenish your fluids and up your blood sugar. The nurse will also suggest that you avoid certain things for the rest of the day and replenish your fluids for the next 48 hours.


You should not do any heavy lifting or strenuous activity such intense exercise for the rest of the day.
If you feel lightheaded later in the day, lie down with your feet elevated.
Leave the bandage on for four to five hours after your donation. If it bruises badly, apply a cold compress. If it hurts, take over the counter pain medication to relieve it.If you feel ill for long periods of time after your visit, call you doctor to make sure everything is okay.

Understand what happens when you donate your body to science.,
Choose between donating your organs or donating your body to science.,
Understand when body donation is not accepted.,
Research programs and facilities.,
Inform your doctor and family members.,
Discuss funeral or memorial options.,
Make alternative arrangements.,
Get the correct forms.,
Comply with details of the form.,
Update your paperwork.,
Understand and inform your family about the procedure after your death.",How to Donate Your Body to Science," Before you die, you will have chosen a facility or program and filled out the necessary paperwork. After your die, someone will contact the facility or program which will usually collect your body. Once they have your body, several things could be done with it.


Donated bodies are used for testing new medical tools and equipment, testing car safety products, studying stages of advanced decay, studied for anatomy purposes, and testing new surgeries, among other things.;
, Understand the pros and cons of each. With donating your organs, your family can still have hold a service for you and you can specify in advance which organs you'd like to donate. With body donation, your family may not get the chance to say goodbye before the body is collected. You also won't be able to specify how it is used. Decide how much control you'd like to have over what happens to your body after your death.Consider the great need for donated organs. Every day about 79 people receive an organ transplant while 18 die waiting for a donor. One organ donor can save 8 lives.
Most programs want a complete body donation. Other programs request that you pre-register any planned organ donations before donating your body., Some programs will not accept very obese bodies and most will not take bodies with certain medical conditions, like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, hepatitis, HIV, or tuberculosis.Bodies that suffered extensive trauma or advanced decomposition won't be accepted either., Look at programs for willed body donation within your state. When you do this, you should keep in mind what's important to you. Here are a few of the things to consider when comparing available programs/facilities:Costs: Some programs will pay for body transport to the medical school, while others will charge. Find out what your family will be responsible for paying.
Funeral or memorial options: Most programs will require almost immediate transportation of the body to the facility. You may want to find out when your cremated remains will be available to your family, if planning a service. They may be available several years after your death.
Assistance from the program: Some programs perform a memorial service after the body has been used and before it's cremated. The program will complete the death certificate and might give information for an obituary.
Type of program: Some programs and facilities only use donated bodies for anatomical study. Others might use them as forensic tools to solve crimes, such as studying advanced decay. Make sure you're comfortable with what the program will do with your body.

, It's important that you tell your family about your decision before your death. If you do your research and make necessary preparations, your family won't be left trying to understand your wishes. If you don't inform your family, this surprise could delay them in getting your body to the right facility in time.


Check with the program you're using about transportation costs. Most programs will pay to transport your body to the facility, but if you die far enough away from the facility, your family may be responsible for paying to get you there., Your family will not be able to hold a funeral with your body present and they should be prepared for this. It may affect their ability to find closure. Inform them that they can still hold a memorial service or attend a commemoration service at the facility where your body was donated.Generally, the school will cover the cost of cremation once the body is no longer being used for study, and some schools have a cemetery plot where they will bury the bodies if that is requested. But, if your next-of-kin want the remains to be given back to them, they may end up having to cover the costs of cremation or burial.

, While you may be a good candidate for body donation and you've correctly filled out the paperwork, your body may end up being rejected. If your body decomposed, suffered trauma, or experienced a major operation, you may not actually be accepted. Decide what you'd like done if body donation does not work out.Again, make these wishes clear to your family, since they'll be fulfilling them after your death. It's always a good idea to put it into writing and notify your attorney.
Remember that you may be able to donate your organs even if you couldn't donate your body. While the decision to harvest suitable organs will be made at the time of your death, you should fill out paperwork and inform your family in advance.This way, if your body isn't accepted, your organs may be.

, Once you've decided to donate your body to science and have selected a specific program or facility, make sure to get a registration packet. This will usually contain details and the consent form. This form must be completed, returned, and acknowledged.


You may be given a wallet card to notify people of your intention to donate at the time of death. Carry it with you at all times.

, Some programs require you to fill out and sign the form in front of witnesses or a notary public. Be sure to read these details before filling out any paperwork.


For example, you may need multiple witnesses over the age of 21. Some programs specify that one witness must be a family member while the other should have legal ties to the family (like an attorney)., Just because you've successfully filled out and filed your body donation paperwork doesn't mean you're all set. You need to update your will to stipulate the program details of the body donation. This is especially important if you fear your family may not honor your wishes after your death.


If you change your mind about donating your body, you can always opt out of the program. To do this, notify the program in writing and file a copy with your attorney., While you may understand what will happen to your body after death, your family might be clueless about what it is they're supposed to do. In most cases, your next of kin, spouse, executor of your will, or hospital facility will need to immediately get in touch with the medical program after your death.The facility will usually come pick up the body.


Have all the necessary program information and contact details available for your family so they aren't burdened with details while dealing with your death.

Know what organs and tissues you consent to donate.,
Recognize that the process of organ donation does not impact your own medical treatment.,
Talk to your family about your decision, especially if you are under 18.,
Recognize that organ donation does not negatively impact funeral traditions.",How to Become an Organ Donor in California1," Before you decide to become an organ donor, it is important that you recognize how your donation might help its recipients. If you register to become a donor, you give consent for the following organs and tissues to be transplanted into medical patients in need:Heart
Lungs
Liver
Pancreas
Kidney
Small bowel
Eyes
Bones
Skin grafts
Heart valves;
, Some people worry that signing up to be an organ donor means that they are less likely to receive life-saving treatments in the event of an accident. However, organ donors in California must be declared brain-dead by two separate doctors, neither of whom is involved in the organ donation process.There is no danger to you if you decide to become a donor.


Brain death means that the brain is totally and irreversibly nonfunctional, even if your body and other organs might be kept viable for a short period of time.Organ donation can only occur when a patient is brain-dead but whose other organs are still viable, often with the help of mechanical means such as a ventilator.Tissue donation can occur after brain-death or after full-body death.

, Anyone 13 years old and older can register to become an organ donor. However, the guardians of potential donors under the age of 18 have the final say in whether or not organs are donated. If becoming a donor is important to you, communicate this to your family so that they will be on board with your decision.If you have registered as an organ donor and you are an adult, you have given consent for organ donation. If you have not registered as an organ donor, your family might be able to provide consent to donate your organs, which is another good reason to speak with them about your wishes.Even if your family's consent is not required, your family will be notified and supported throughout the donation process., Open-casket funerals are still possible with organ donation, if that is your or your family's wish. Your body will be treated respectfully according to your directives and the directives of your family. Organ donation also does not delay funerals.While the costs of organ donations will be covered by the organ procurement organization (or OPO), the funeral costs will still be the responsibility of your family."

Donate plasma.,
Receive your compensation.,
Keep your bandage on for several hours.,
Care for yourself after the donation.",How to Donate Plasma," In order to donate plasma, you must meet certain requirements. Make sure you know what these requirements are ahead of time.


All plasma donors must be at least 18 years old.A plasma donor must weigh at least 110 pounds.You also must pass a medical examination and undergo testing for transmittable infections like hepatitis and HIV.;
, Before being allowed to donate plasma, you must undergo a confidential pre-donation physical. This is usually conducted at the donation center and is designed to assure you're healthy and able to donate plasma.


The physical is a basic exam, where your vitals are taken and you answer a series of questions regarding your medical history. You will also disclose to the doctor any medications you are currently taking and their dosage.Your protein and hemoglobin levels will also be taken via blood test during the exam. This is to assure your levels are adequate enough that you can safely donate plasma., You will have to complete a donor history questionnaire to determine your eligibility to donate plasma. The questionnaire will ask about current medications, recent surgeries, and any recent tattoos and piercings., Assuming you're approved to donate based on your exam and questionnaire, you'll have to follow certain nutritional guidelines in the days leading up to your donation.


Aim for a high protein diet that includes 50 to 80 grams of protein daily. Go for lean, healthy proteins like those found in fish, nuts, legumes, and poultry.Make sure to drink extra fluids, such as water or fruit juice, in the days leading up to the donation., At the donation center, certain forms of identification are required. You will present the following to the receptionist:


Current photo I.D (e.g., passport, driver's license)
Social Security Card or Border Crossing I.D.
Proof of local address, A technician at the donation center will take a small blood sample from your finger via needle. This will be used to quickly check our protein and iron levels to make sure they're adequate and that you're healthy enough to donate., Once your protein and iron levels prove adequate, your arm will be prepared for the donation, which will be taken via a needle injection. Your arm will be doused with antiseptic and a technician will insert the needle into the vein. The process may be somewhat painful but should not be unbearable. Many describe it as similar to a light bee sting., Once the needle is in, the donation process begins. Blood is drawn and plasma is then separated from your red blood cells. The process takes about 2 hours total, so it's a good idea to bring reading material or an electronic device on which you can listen to music or books on tape or watch movies. Some plasma donation centers might let you bring a friend for support and entertainment during the process., Once the donation process is complete, you'll receive compensation for your time. You can usually do this with the reception. Compensation varies from center to center but is usually in the $40 to $60 range., Your arm will be bandaged after the donation is complete. Talk to a doctor at the donation center to ask approximately what time you can remove the bandage. Wash around the injection site with soap and warm water after removing the bandage., After the donation, there is certain protocol you need to follow to make sure your body has time to recover.


Eat a light healthy meal a few hours after donating. Stick to lean protein, fruits and veggies, and whole wheats or grains.Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water and juice after donating, just as you did before the donation. Try to drink room temperature liquids.Do not smoke cigarettes until at least 30 minutes after the donation.Alcohol should be avoided on the day of your donation."

Donate your organ to a family member, friend, or stranger.",How to Become an Organ Donor in California4," Not all donations have to happen after brain-death. In some cases, a living donor can assist a patient with a living donation. Living donors can donate a kidney, portions of a lung, portions of a liver, and portions of an intestine to a transplant patient.

, Organ donations after brain-death can take place when a donor is any age and in any state of health before death. However, living donors often have to be in very good health in order to qualify for the procedure. Living donors also have to be older than 18.Medical conditions that can prevent you from becoming a living donor include:


High blood pressure
Diabetes
Cancer
HIV/AIDS
Infection
Psychiatric or mental conditions
Substance abuse problems

, Donate Life California provides resources for living donors as well as persons on the organ registry. One of these resources is the Living Donation Self-Assessment which can help you determine whether you are healthy and prepared enough to pursue living donation.Visit the following website to begin to determine your eligibility: http://livingdonationcalifornia.org/make-an-informed-decision/assess-your-eligibility/.

, If you have passed initial eligibility checks, a local transplant center will likely get in touch with you about next steps.They will likely ask you a number of questions about your mental health, your reasons for donating, your understanding of the risks involved, your finances, your home situation, and your medical history. They might also provide you with a number of medical tests, such as blood tests, tissue tests, urine tests, psychological screenings, and cancer screenings., Living donation can be expensive, time-consuming, and physically risky. Before committing to living donation, you will have to consider the financial, physical, and psychological impact it might have on you and your family. You also want to be sure that you are donating out of your own free will: not because of outside pressure., Living donation often requires being under anesthesia, which brings a number of serious risks with it such as allergic reaction, infection, or death. Other risks might include blood clots, scarring, injury to surrounding organs, infection, and depression. While these risks are low, they are serious if they occur and can have lifelong effects., Choosing to become a living donor can be expensive. You might have lasting physical symptoms or psychological symptoms that require treatment, and you might have to take a lot of time off of work.Donation might also cause your insurance premiums to increase.Be sure your pocketbook is prepared for donation and that you have a plan in place to fund your care and recovery.


While the costs of the transplant itself will usually be covered by the recipient's health insurance, your aftercare, lodging, meals, and additional therapy might not be covered.Talk to the National Living Donation Assistance group to see if you might qualify for financial assistance to become a living donor.Most donors have to take about 6 weeks off of work in order to recover fully., No matter which transplant center you use, you should be assigned an Independent Donor Advocate (or IDA), who is not associated with the transplant team. Their only job is to advocate for your needs and interests and to answer your questions.Talk to your IDA about any concerns or questions you have. You should be allowed to delay the procedure at any point, and your IDA can help you if you decide to delay or stop the donation process., There are several different kinds of organ donation depending on who the recipient might be. Most living donations occur because of a close personal relationship with the recipient, though some donors choose to help strangers as well.


Directed donation. In a directed donation, a donor names a specific organ recipient. Usually this is a family member or friend.Directed donations among biologically related persons can help the organ recipient have a more successful outcome and reduces the risk of organ rejection.The recipient's transplant center will help determine whether a directed donation is medically possible from a particular donor.

Non-directed donation. In a non-directed donation, a donor decides to donate an organ altruistically, to a total stranger. The donor and recipient might never even meet. In this case, a transplant center will determine who will receive the organ based on medical and tissue compatibility.Paired donation. A paired donation can take place when multiple living donors wish to help their respective family members or friends but cannot due to incompatible blood types. In this case, a transplant center might facilitate a paired donation, in which the transplant recipients ""trade"" their donors. For example, Living Donor A and Recipient A do not share the same blood type. Living Donor B and Recipient B also do not have the same blood type. However, Living Donor A shares Recipient B's blood type, and Living Donor B shares Recipient A's blood type. In this case, a paired donation will allow each living donor to help a loved one by donating to a stranger who happens to share their blood type."

Excessive glucose in saliva serves as a medium for bacteria and increase of plaque formation.
Loss of collagen in the gum tissue, which hastens periodontal diseases. Collagen is a protein that supports the gums, skin, tendons, cartilage and bone.
Thickening of blood vessel walls is a common effect aspect of diabetes. This can delay blood from bringing oxygen and nutrients to body tissues and removing waste products of the cells.
Longer time to heal from the dental surgeries as the blood flow to the various sites is impaired.

Tell other people.",How to Become an Organ Donor in the UK1," A living donor is someone who is willing to transplant their organs, or parts of their organs, while still alive. This can help people on donation lists because they do not need to wait for a potential donor to die. Agreeing to this means you will need to undergo major surgery to remove your organs if they are needed.Living donors can only offer certain organs and tissues for donation, as they are the only ones you can live while still taking them out. Kidneys, the liver, and bone and amniotic membranes are the only organs you can offer as a living donor. Kidneys in particular are needed in the UK, and kidneys from live donors are more likely to survive as transplants than those from a deceased donor.Most living donors are family members, donating to siblings, parents, or children. It is also possible to become what is called a Non-Direct, or Altruistic, donor. This is someone who agrees to donate to someone they may not know if their organs are a good match.As a live donor, you have the right to change your mind about donating, right up to the point where you go into surgery.;
, Many religions in the UK have varied viewpoints on the morality and ethics of organ donation. The NHS provides background from several of the nation's major faiths: https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/about-donation/what-does-my-religion-say/. You should also check with your religious leaders if you have any concerns or doubts.

, There are restrictions on the people who can be donors, to ensure that their organs are healthy and will grow if placed in a new body. Your doctor can do the tests you need to pass in order to become a donor. If you are interested, just ask him about it.The only blanket age restrictions on organ donation are in Scotland, where you must be age 16 years or older. Most donors, though, are over 18, and those under 18 are usually only considered under extreme circumstances, and need court approval. Children cannot register as non-direct donors.
You cannot be an organ donor if you have had cancer that spread in the last 12 months, a severe or untreated infection, or a nervous system condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), The NHS maintains a confidential database of everyone in the UK who has agreed to be an organ donor. There are several ways you can sign up for the Register.The NHS offers an online form, which only takes a few minutes to fill out: https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/

You can contact the NHS Donor Line, either over the phone at 0300 123 23 23 (lines open 24 hours a day, year round), or by texting SAVE to 62323.
There is a paper form that you can mail in, available at GP surgeries and hospitals.
Additionally, you can agree to be an organ donor when you apply for a driving licence or vehicle tax, register with your GP, or register for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

, Once you declare your desire to become an organ donor, you will be assigned a Living Donor Coordinator, who will help walk you through the process. You will then take a series of physical tests for your general health and the specific organs you wish to donate to make sure they are healthy and could help someone in need.You will also undergo a psychological assessment as part of the process. The exam will include discussing your reasons for donating and mental health history. Organ donation can be an emotional process, and the NHS wants to make sure that there is minimal risk to your mental health.

, You should let others, such as friends or close family, know that you have signed up for organ donation. They can provide moral support if it is time for you to donate, or confirm your wishes if you are unable to when the organs are needed. In addition, you may convince other people to sign up as well."

Weigh the financial commitment.,
Make sure that your health care provider will collect your baby’s cord blood.,
Choose a reputable bank.,
Get the most for your money.,
Sign up on the phone or online.,
Bring your kit to the hospital.,
Send off the kit.",How to Bank Your Baby's Cord Blood1," When thinking about banking your baby’s cord blood privately, look at the costs involved and work out your budget for at least the upcoming year to see if it is feasible. Private banks charge between $1,300 and $3,000 for the first-year processing fee, then another $90 to $175 per year for storage of the cord blood.You may choose to invest in this procedure if family members have suffered from blood disorders like leukemia, there is a higher probability that your baby’s cord blood will be beneficial to have in the future, either for them or another close relative.
To make the process simple, use a budget planning app or program. For example, download Mint, a budget app for iPhone or Android that connects directly to your bank to determine the ideal financial plan for you.;
, To bank your baby’s cord blood, you must be sure that your health care provider is willing and able to collect it following your child’s birth. Before signing up with a private bank, talk to your physician about the process and make sure that they agree to collect the sample for you. If your health care provider is not willing to do so, consider making other arrangements for your child’s delivery., When looking for a private bank to store your baby’s cord blood, opt for a reputable, profitable company. A smaller, less recognized bank will be more likely to go out of business, at which point your baby’s cord blood will be lost. Research long-running companies, or look into one of the following large banks:Cord Blood Registry (CBR), the largest newborn stem cell bank in the worldViaCord, which has preserved the cord blood from over 350,000 babies to dateCryo-Cell, the world’s first cord blood preservation bank, When deciding where to store your cord blood, compare pricing and add-ons to get a clear picture of what each private bank will cost you. Inquire about financing plans or possible discounts for pre-paid plans (which usually include twenty years of storage). Look into other discounts that the company may offer (e.g. a reduced fee if more than one child’s cord blood is stored by a family). Ask whether the courier fees for shipping the donation kit to the bank will be covered in the overall collection, processing, and administrative fees.

, Many private cord blood banks will make the registration process simple by letting you enroll with them online or via telephone. Payment (all at once, or in installments) can be made online by credit card, and shipping options may be chosen for delivery of the collection kit. Some banks may offer a free information kit to be mailed to you for further consideration., When you are ready to give birth, bring your cord blood collection kit to the hospital and give it to your physician. In most cases, the mother’s blood will be tested for infectious diseases (in accordance with U.S. federal regulations) and a sample will be submitted to the bank along with the baby’s cord blood. After birth, the doctor will extract cord blood from the cut umbilical cord and seal it in the kit., Take note of the specific mailing arrangements outlined in your agreement with the private cord blood bank. In most cases, you will be instructed to call a medical courier to collect your kit and bring it back to the bank. Be sure to inform the bank of your baby’s birth as soon as possible to ensure the timely delivery and processing of the cord blood.The bank will inform you when it receives the sample, usually within 36 hours after it is picked up.

Decide between deceased and living donation.,
Consider an anonymous or personal donation.,
Get an evaluation from a doctor.,
Consider the physical risks.,
Think about the emotional effects.",How to Be a Kidney Donor1," There are two different ways to become a kidney donor. The first is known as deceased donation, which means that the kidney is harvested from your body after your death. If this is the type of donation you are considering, it is very simple to register. You can visit the website Donate Life America to register, or you can declare your intentions to donate organs on your driver's license.A living donation is when you are still alive and healthy and choose to donate a kidney. Most of us have two kidneys, and it is possible to live an entirely healthy life with only one healthy kidney.
Before committing to living donation, consider the physical, emotional, and financial implications. The following information is intended for those considering living donation.;
, If you are contemplating making a living donation, you will need to think about who you want to receive your kidney. Many people choose to donate a kidney to a loved one who is suffering from a kidney ailment and needs a transplant. The most common kidney donations are made to a child, spouse, or sibling.You can also choose to donate your kidney to a distant relative, friend, or even a co-worker in need.
Anonymous donations are becoming more and more common. This is known as a non-directed donation, which means that your kidney may be given to anyone on the transplant list.

, Not everyone is eligible to become a kidney donor. If you are not healthy enough to survive a major operation, or if your kidneys are not strong enough, you may not be able to donate. In order to determine your eligibility for living donation, you will need to have a doctor perform a thorough physical evaluation.As a potential donor, you will undergo blood, urine, and radiology tests. Your doctor will analyze all of the results to determine your eligibility.
If you are making a personal donation, the blood test will determine whether your kidney is compatible with the intended recipient's physical makeup.
Before surgery, the doctor will order thorough x-rays of your kidneys to ensure that they are sufficiently healthy.

, During the initial consultation, your doctor should talk to you about the many possible risks that go along with kidney donation. You will want to carefully think about all of this information and how it could impact your life. You should discuss possible outcomes with your close family members.Some potential long-term side effects are nerve damage, chronic pain, and intestinal obstruction.
Donors are also at higher risks for health concerns such as high blood pressure, and reduced kidney function.

, Donating a major organ can be a very emotional experience. When you are considering making a living donation, there are several questions you should ask yourself. For example, spend some time thinking about why you want to make the donation.You should ask yourself how you will feel if the recipient does not act grateful, or if your relationship becomes strained. Will you be able to handle that?
You also need to recognize that your kidney may not function properly in the recipient's body. Consider how you will feel emotionally if the kidney fails.

Remind your health care provider about the donation.",How to Bank Your Baby's Cord Blood2," Make sure that you are eligible to donate your baby’s cord blood to a bank before deciding to donate. The standards for donation are consistent across public banks in the U.S. and may disqualify you as a donor. To donate, the expectant mother:must be at least 18 years old
must carry to at least 34 weeks
must not have had cancer or an organ transplant
must not test positive for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or hepatitis C
must not be on prescription medication to treat diabetes
must be pregnant with only one fetus

, Before deciding to donate, see if the hospital where you intend to give birth is affiliated with any public cord banks. Many U.S. hospitals are not able to participate because of the cost of funding limitations. If you are unsure about your hospital’s policies about in-hospital cord blood donation, inquire about further information from your doctor or with hospital administration.For a list of U.S. hospitals that collect cord blood for donation to public cord blood banks (in association with Be The Match Registry®, the largest marrow registry in the world), visit https://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-cord-blood/how-to-donate-cord-blood/participating-hospitals/.

, If you are not giving birth in a hospital that facilitates in-hospital donations, ask your health care provider about mail-in donation as an alternative option. Public cord banks will provide mail-in donation kits for free so that your cord blood can be collected following birth and submitted back to them. Health care providers must agree to the procedure and complete training in how to use the kit, if they have not done so before.Because of overcrowding and numerous patients, many doctors will avoid introducing cord blood donation as an option to expectant parents.

, Ask your healthcare provider if there are any public banks in your area that accept cord blood donations. Visit the Parent’s Guide to Cord Blood foundation’s website at https://parentsguidecordblood.org/en/public-banking to find a local bank. If there are no public banks in your area, consider donating to one that accepts mail-in donations (such as Lifeforce Cryobanks, located in the state of Florida)., If you intend to donate your baby’s cord blood to a public bank, contact the bank of your choice and sign up between the 28th and 34th weeks of pregnancy. Public banks require several weeks to process your information, as well as to verify your medical history and eligibility to donate. Most banks will provide you with a consent form and health questionnaire to fill out, either online, by mail, or in person., When you arrive at the hospital to deliver your baby, remind your health care provider that you have decided to donate your baby’s cord blood. If you were sent a collection kit for the cord blood, give it to your doctor so that they can collect the sample directly after the birth, when they cut the umbilical cord. Make sure that the mail-in kit, pre-paid by most public banks, is shipped to the correct address to complete your donation."

Talk to your insurance company.,
Speak to the doctors.,
Find a support system.,
Have the operation.",How to Be a Kidney Donor2," After your doctor has deemed you eligible to make a living donation, you will need to consider the financial costs. Generally, the recipient's insurance plans will cover the cost of the donor's surgery and hospital stay, but won't cover travel, lost wages, and other external expenses. Call your insurance company and ask a representative what exactly will be covered. Make sure to ask exactly what medical expenses will be covered by the recipients insurance policy. You should also find out if your follow-up care is covered.
You should also make sure that you are financially prepared to miss work for four to six weeks. Your policy will almost certainly not cover lost wages., When you are preparing for surgery, it is a good idea to have in-depth conversations with your doctors. You may find it helpful to speak to your primary care physician, your surgeon, and other members of the transplant team. Ask questions about both the surgical procedure and the recovery process.Talk to your doctor about the success rate of the transplant center, and what the rate of complications for donors are.
Discuss the plan for follow-up care. Ask if you will be assigned an individual donor advocate to guide you through recovery.

, Leading up to surgery, you will likely experience some anxiety. Make sure to talk about your fears with your doctor. You should also tell a close friend or family member that you are very emotional, and could use some extra support. Let your friends and family know that you will need some help after the surgery, as you will need time to physically recover.Line up people to help you before your surgery. You will have one less thing to worry about while you are recovering.
The hospital should provide a social worker to talk to you about the emotional aspects of donation. Make sure you schedule an appointment with him/her the week of your surgery.

, In the days right before the operation, the doctor will run some final lab tests to make sure you are physically ready for the operation. When you are ready, you will report to the hospital or surgical center for surgery. You will be prepped for surgery and placed under general anesthesia.Typically, the surgery is laparoscopic. Small incisions will be made in your abdomen while laparoscopic instruments are inserted to remove the kidney.
You will wake up in a recovery room, where pain medication and oxygen will be administered.
You will have a catheter to expel urine from your body, which will typically be removed the next morning.

"
"
Recover in the hospital.,
Manage your pain.,
Prepare for multiple follow-ups.",How to Be a Kidney Donor3," You will need to spend 1-2 days in the hospital post-laparoscopic surgery. Your vital signs will be monitored and you will be given pain medication. Your nurses will encourage you to get up and walk around, as pain allows.Make sure that you have requested time off from work. Your total recovery time will be about four to six weeks.
You will likely experience gas and bloating in the first two days after the surgery.

, Once you are released from the hospital, you will continue to recover at home. Your body will need about four to six weeks to heal before you can return to your normal routine. Make sure that you are taking any pain medications prescribed by your doctor.Avoid lifting objects heavier than ten pounds (4.5 kg), driving, or operating machinery while taking pain medications. If you have small children, you should arrange to have help caring for them during this period.
Your abdomen may be slightly swollen, so wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing.
You may feel very tired during recovery. This is normal. Make sure to rest as much as possible.

, You will need to see your doctor multiple times after donating a kidney. Your doctor will recommend that your first check-up occur 1-2 weeks after the surgery. You will also need to be seen after 6 months, and 1 year.Depending on your health, your doctor will probably want you to have an annual check-up for the rest of your life.

Ask your parents for their blood type.,
Call a doctor who has drawn your blood.,
Buy a blood typing kit.",How to Determine Your Blood Type1," If your biological parents both know their blood type, that narrows down the possibilities. In most cases this is only enough to guess, using an online blood type calculator or the following list:O parent x O parent = O child
O parent x A parent = A or O child
O parent x B parent = B or O child
O parent x AB parent = A or B child
A parent x A parent = A or O child
A parent x B parent = A, B, AB or O child
A parent x AB parent = A, B or AB child
B parent x B parent = B or O child
B parent x AB parent = A, B or AB child
AB parent x AB parent = A, B or AB child
Blood types also include an ""Rh factor"" (+ or -). If both of your parents have an Rh- blood type (such as O- or AB-), you are also Rh-. If one or both of your parents are Rh+, you cannot tell whether you are + or - without a test.;
, If your physician already has your blood type on file, then you just need to ask. However, they will only have your record on file if you've already had your blood drawn and/or tested. Common reasons why you may have already had your blood type tested include:Pregnancy
Surgery
Organ donation
Blood transfusion

, If you don't want to visit a doctor or donate blood, you can find a home test kit online or at a pharmacy for as little as US $10. These typically instruct you to dampen various labeled patches on a special card, then prick your finger and add a little blood to each patch. Make sure to follow the kit instructions when adding the blood. Note which patches (or vials of fluid, in some kits) cause the blood to clump (agglutinate) instead of spreading out. The clumping is a reaction to substances incompatible with your blood type. Once you've completed the test with all cards or fluids, look up your blood type using the kit instructions or the following list:First check the ""Anti-A"" and ""Anti-B"" patches for clumps:

Clumps in Anti-A (only) mean you have type A blood.
Clumps in Anti-B mean you have type B blood.
Clumps in Anti-A and Anti-B: you are type AB.


Then check the ""Anti-D"" patch:

Clumps: you are Rh positive. Add a + to your blood type.
No clumps: you are Rh negative. Add a - to your blood type.


If the control patch (normal paper) causes clumping, or if you are not sure whether the blood is clumping on any patch, try another card.Any test conducted at home is less reliable than a test performed by a professional.

The stem cells contained in the bone marrow are the building blocks of the blood: The red blood cells - which carry oxygen; the white cells - which fight infection; and the platelets - which stop bleeding, are all produced by the stem cells and are released into the blood stream via the veins and the thin tissue surrounding the bone.


However, in people with serious blood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma and sickle cell anemia, these vital stem cells are either diseased or are not produced at all. In this situation, a bone marrow transplant is the best and sometimes only way to treat and potentially cure the disease.
Around 10,000 people in the U.S are diagnosed each year with diseases which require bone marrow transplants.Seven out of ten people who require a bone marrow transplant do not have a matching donor in their family, and therefore rely on the registry of bone marrow donors to find a match.The process for matching a patient with a donor involves comparing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types in order to find a match. People with shared ancestry are more likely to possess matching HLA types, which is why it's extra important for people with certain racial or ethnic backgrounds to become donors.
The racial and ethnic backgrounds with the greatest need for donations include African American or Black, South Asian or Pacific Islanders, American Indian and Alaska natives, Hispanic or Latinos and people of mixed race.;
, There are two main types of bone marrow donation. The first is an actual bone marrow donation, which involves the removal of bone marrow from the back of the pelvic bone. This procedure is usually done under general anesthetic. PBSC (which stands for peripheral blood stem cell) donation is the more common method used nowadays, and involves filtering stem cells directly from the blood. It is these blood stem cells, rather than the bone marrow itself, which are necessary in the treatment of blood cancers and other diseases.In bone marrow donations, bone marrow containing the blood stem cells necessary for the patient to start producing their own healthy blood cells is taken from the pelvic bone and given to the patient. With PBSC, the stem cells are filtered directly from circulating (peripheral) blood. Even though this procedure does not actually involve the use of bone marrow, it is still commonly referred to as a bone marrow donation.
When you join a bone marrow donation registry, you are agreeing to donate using whichever method the patient's doctor deems appropriate. You do not get to choose which method of donation you would prefer.

, In terms of costs, the expense of making a blood marrow donation is completely covered by either the National Marrow Donor Program, or the patient's medical insurance. This includes travel costs and certain non-medical expenses. The only cost that is not covered is any time taken off work to attend health exams and information sessions or during the recovery period. On the other hand, a donor will never be paid to donate a bone marrow either.


In terms of risk, the dangers involved in the bone marrow donation process are minimal. In fact, over 99% of donors make a full recovery after the procedure.With blood marrow donation, the only major risk involves the use of anesthesia during the procedure itself. In very rare cases, anesthesia can lead to stroke, heart attack and death. After the procedure you will experience some pain in the location from which the blood marrow was taken, which may make walking difficult. You may also feel tired and weak. These symptoms should pass after 1 to 7 days.
With PBSC donation, the risks are minimal. The procedure itself, which involves filtering your blood through a machine, is not dangerous at all. However, the medication you receive before and during the procedure may cause symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, chills or cramping, but these should go away as soon as the donation is complete., Before you begin the donation process or sign up to the bone marrow registry, it is important that you research the entire process thoroughly and understand the implications of your actions. Receiving a bone marrow transplant may be a patient's only chance of survival -- it is literally a matter of life or death. Therefore, it is not something you should undertake lightly. Make sure that you are willing to to carry through with the donation when the time comes, regardless of whether the procedure is surgical (bone marrow) or non-surgical (PBSC).


The chances of you being called upon to make a donation are hard to predict, as it will depend on your individual DNA and whether it is a match for a patient in need. If you possess a common tissue type, there may be less need for your donation, as there will be multiple matches available. #*If you have a less common tissue type one of two things might happen: you may never be called upon, or you may be the only available match for a given patient.
According to Be The Match registry, about 1 in every 540 registered donors will be called upon to make a donation -- of either bone marrow or blood stem cells -- to a patient.Although it is possible to back out of a donation once you have signed up for the registry, you must consider the fact that you may be the only person on the registry who provides an exact match for a patient in need, and refusing to go through with the procedure may seriously affect or delay their chances of recovery. In going through with the donation, you could literally be saving someone's life.
If you do need to back out of the donation, be sure to notify the registry right away, so they can continue their search for another donor as quickly as possible.

, If you are not in a position to donate bone marrow yourself, due to ineligibility or other factors, remember that there are other things you can do to help patients in need. Monetary donations are always welcome. These donations can help to cover uninsured patients' medical bills and other expenses, help the registry to find and vet new donors, or help to fund medical research.It is possible to make a direct donation to the registry (100% of which goes to helping patients in one of the ways outlined above), to make a legacy gift by including the registry in your estate planning, to organize charitable payroll deductions at your workplace, or to raise money by hosting a fundraising or awareness event.

One other option is to donate your baby's umbilical cord, if you are expecting a child. Along with bone marrow and blood stem cells, the blood in a newborn baby's umbilical cord is a rich source of the stem cells necessary to save the lives of patients (usually small children) suffering from diseases such as leukemia. Cord donation is completely safe for both the mother and baby, as the blood is taken from the cord immediately after birth, tested, then frozen and stored in a cord blood bank. This type of donation is completely free and anonymous., Before you register, consider whether you fit the criteria for bone marrow donation. The main criterion is age. People between the ages of 18 and 44 are encouraged to join, as younger people are much less likely to develop complications during or following the donations procedure, while patients who receive donations from younger people have a better chance for long-term survival.


Despite this, people between the ages of 44 and 65 are welcome to join the registry, but they will be required to pay a $100 fee and and are much less likely to be called upon to donate. People over the age of 60 are unable to join the registry, as the risks involved for both the donor and the patient are too high.There are also a variety of diseases and conditions which could prevent you from becoming a donor. You will be asked to fill out a health history form and be informed if you meet the organization's health criteria. This is done to protect the health of the donor as well as the patient.
Note that in every country the criteria to be a bone marrow donor are slightly different. If you live outside of the U.S. talk to your doctor to find out about bone marrow donation criteria and registration procedures in your country.

, If you believe that you meet the above criteria and are committed to donating bone marrow if called upon, you can register with the National Marrow Donor Program. Once you register, you will be asked to undertake a test known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, which is used to match up patients with potential donors. They will then add your HLA type to a database of potential donors, which doctors can search through to find a match for their patients.


If you register with the Donor Program online, you will need to make an appointment with your doctor to give a blood sample, which will then be tested for HLA type. If you register as a marrow donor while donating blood, they will be able to take an extra blood sample for HLA typing. Just be sure to indicate that you wish to join the registry before you donate blood, so that the staff can prepare to take an extra sample.
The cost of HLA testing is approximately $100, but if you get chosen as a donor this amount will be reimbursed, as it will be covered by the patient's health insurance. If you register at a blood drive, there may be a sponsor who covers the tissue-typing costs on the day. Whatever you end up paying is tax-deductible.

, Once your HLA results come back and you are entered onto the registry of bone marrow donors, you will need to wait and see if you are contacted by a patient or their doctor as a potential match. As mentioned above, the chances of this happening vary greatly from person to person and are almost impossible to predict.


A doctor will match their patient with a potential donor by comparing the proteins in each of your blood cells to see if they are similar. The more similar they are, the better the chance of the patient's body accepting the transplant.
If your tissue type matches that of a patient in need of a bone marrow transplant, you will be contacted, so it's important that you keep your contact information up-to-date and respond promptly, whether you intend on going through with the donation or not.

, Once you have been identified as a potential match for a given patient, you will be required to go through a series of additional tests and interviews to ascertain whether you are a suitable donor. You may need to provide a cheek swab or an additional blood sample, if they do not have a previous sample available.


For instance, you will need to be tested for any infectious or genetic diseases which could be passed onto the patient through the donated stem cells. You will also need to provide a detailed family history and undergo a physical examination to ensure that you are fit to go through with the donation procedure.You will also be required to attend an information session, where you will be filled in on the exact nature of the donation procedure and given detailed descriptions of the recovery process and the possible risks and side effects. Any questions or concerns you might have can be addressed during this information session. If you are still willing to go through with the donation, you will be asked to sign a consent form.
Be aware that it may take up to 60 days for the doctor to review all of the health information necessary to make a decision regarding the donation. Once he/she has done this, they will be able to inform you which type of donation you will be required to make -- bone marrow or PBSC., Before you can donate peripheral blood stem cells, you will need to undergo daily injections of a medication called Filgrastim, in the five days running up to the procedure. This medication draws stem cells from the bone marrow, so you will have more of them circulating in your blood.


These injections will be administered at a donor center or medical clinic, where the medical staff will closely monitor your stem cell count, along with your body's reaction to the medication. The last filgrastim injection will be given at the outpatient clinic or donor center on the day of your donation.
Donating PBSC involves a procedure know as apheresis. This is when blood is taken from the body using a catheter inserted in one arm and passed through a machine which filters out the stem cells, along with platelets and white blood cells. The remaining blood (consisting mainly o plasma and red blood cells) then flows back into your body through a vein in the other arm.
The procedure is completely painless and is similar to donating plasma. However, you may feel tingling around the mouth, a slight cramping of the hands, or experience lightheadedness or numbness, all of which should stop once the procedure is done.
PBSC donation will usually require between 2 to 4 sessions, each between 2 to 6 hours each.

, If you are donating actual bone marrow instead of PBSC, the procedure will be entirely different. There will be no need for the filgrastim injections, as the stem cells can be drawn directly from the bone marrow. Bone marrow donation is a surgical procedure, carried out in the operating room, which requires anesthesia and is therefore completely painless. The entire procedure will only take between 1 and 2 hours.


In 96% of cases a general anesthetic will be used, which means you'll be unconscious for the entire procedure. In a small number of cases a local anesthetic will be used, which simply numbs the area the bone marrow is taken from. In this situation, you will be awake throughout the procedure. Your doctor will decide which type of anesthetic is best for you.You will undergo the procedure lying on your stomach. The doctors will insert special, hollow needles into both sides of your pelvic bone, from which they will draw the liquid marrow. The incisions made by the needles will only be about a quarter of an inch in length and will not require stitches.
After the procedure you will be taken to a recovery room where you will stay until you regain consciousness. Once you are able to eat, drink and walk (though perhaps with some difficulty) you will be able to leave again. In most situations a bone marrow donor will enter the hospital as an outpatient in the early morning and will be able to leave by late afternoon. However, sometimes donors are required to stay overnight for observation., Once you have completed your donation, it may take a couple of days for you to feel back to your old self again, especially if you underwent surgery. People who donate bone marrow often experience symptoms including headaches, fatigue, muscle pain, back or hip pain, bruising around the incision site and difficulty walking. These symptoms may last as little as a couple of days, or as long as several weeks.


Luckily, if you donate PBSC there is very little chance of any side effects following the donation, other than bruising at the needle site, and the recovery time is almost immediate. All of the side effects associated with PBSC donation occur as a result of the filgrastim injections or the blood thinners used during the procedure and will stop immediately after the procedure.
If any complications should arise during the donation process, the cost of any medical treatment will be covered by the National Marrow Donor Program. All U.S donors are covered by life, disability and medical insurance policies., After the procedure you may be interested in finding out about the person who received your bone marrow donation. Although patient information is confidential, you will be able to find out the age and gender of the recipient, along with some details about the nature of their condition.


Depending on the transplant center, you may be provided with up to three updates on how the patient is doing in the year following the transplant, and in some cases you will be able to communicate anonymously.
After one year, it may be possible to meet with the recipient in person, if both you and the recipient consent and the transplant center is willing to facilitate the meeting. However, some transplant centers will not provide you with any updates or allow any communication between you and the recipient.
If you wish to find out about the condition of the person who received your bone marrow, it is important to prepare yourself for the possibility that they may not have survived the procedure. In some cases, the process of chemo and radiation therapy patients must undergo before receiving their transplant proves to be too much. In other cases, complications may arise from the transplant itself.Despite the possibility of this outcome, a large number of patients will successfully survive the transplant and may be cured as a result. If this is the case, you will have given another person an amazing gift -- a second chance at life.

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Stay away from the four Cs.,
Drink cranberry or blueberry juice.,
Drink ginger tea.",How to Alleviate UTI Pain1," Drinking more fluids will help you to flush out the bacteria from your bladder and urethra and prevent your UTI from getting worse. This can help lessen discomfort or pain caused during urination.


Drink enough fluid for your urine to be light yellow. The urine may not be clear no matter how much you drink, and may instead be cloudy from the infection or light bleeding. Strive for urine that is light straw yellow.Drinking plenty of fluids will also flush bacteria out of your bladder and help speed the healing process.;
, Certain foods will irritate your bladder and make you want to urinate more often. Try to avoid the four Cs: caffeine, carbonated beverages, chocolate, and citrus.While you have a UTI, eliminate these foods from your diet. Reintroduce them into your diet slowly after the pain and the urge for frequent urination has gone away.

, Cranberry and blueberry are helpful when you have a UTI because they contain elements that will help the bacteria not stick to the walls of the bladder or urethra. This helps reduce inflammation, infection, and recurring infections.


Try to get cranberry and blueberry juice with as much percentage of juice as possible. There is pure, 100% cranberry juice available, so try to find it. Also look for juices without added sugars or high fructose corn syrup. Cranberry juice cocktail can have as little as 5% juice, but up to 33%, as well as artificial or added sweeteners and won’t help as much as 100% pure cranberry or blueberry juices. Try to get the purest form you can.
You can also take cranberry extract as a pill supplement. This is a good alternative if you want to reduce the amount of sugar you ingest.Make sure to follow the supplement directions.
Don’t use the supplement if you are allergic to cranberry juice. Speak with your doctor before taking a supplement if you are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy.
Don’t take a cranberry supplement or drink cranberry juice if you are taking a blood thinner, such as Warfarin.Cranberry juice and extract can be used during an infection and as a preventative measure.

, Ginger tea can help alleviate the inflammation. It can also help reduce any nausea you feel. You can also take a supplement. Cooking with ginger spice doesn’t have the same effectiveness as a tea or supplement because it doesn’t provide the same concentrated amount.


Check with a pharmacist or physician if you have medical conditions or are taking medications before incorporating ginger into your diet. It can interact with certain medications and supplements.
Ginger can cause mild heartburn and diarrhea if taken in high doses. A high dose is considered more than two cups of tea per day or more than the recommended amount of supplements.
Don’t take ginger root, ginger tea, or supplements if you have gallstones, will have surgery soon, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or intend to become pregnant without discussing with your doctor. Don’t take ginger root, tea, or supplements if you have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood thinners."

Go when you need to go.",How to Treat a Urinary Tract Infection," A urinary tract infection (UTI) is most common in women, and it's caused by bacteria in the urethra and the urinary bladder.Left untreated, this bacteria has the potential to make its ways to your kidneys, where it can damage them. The signs that you may have a UTI include:


The feeling that you need to go frequently but little or nothing actually comes out
Pain/burning during urination (dysuria)
Fever and/or chills
Abdominal aching and pain in the pelvic region
Cloudy or unusually colored (dark yellow or greenish) urine
Blood in your urine
Foul-smelling urine;
, You need to get an accurate diagnosis, particularly if this is your first infection.


UTIs can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and even parasites. Knowing the cause will ensure that you get the right treatment. A doctor may need to prescribe antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals or even anti-parasite drugs.
You need to know what type of UTI you have. For example, urethritis is the infection of the urethra (the channel that carries urine from your bladder outside your body) while cystitis is an infection of the bladder.Only a doctor can prescribe drugs for such conditions as bladder spasms (e.g., atropine) and intense pain. Moreover, only a doctor will be able to determine whether surgery is needed., Unfortunately, UTIs easily become resistant if you don't finish antibiotics,so follow the instructions carefully and take all of your pills for the specified period.


Do not drink alcohol if you are on antibiotics. It weakens their effectiveness.
Stay out of the sun if you're prescribed Bactrim or any sulfa medications.

, Even if you feel better, take all of your medication to completely wipe out the infection.

, If you have questions about what works best, talk to your doctor. Use painkillers sparingly.

, Note that this medicine will turn your urine a bright yellowish orange color.


Ask your doctor if you can take this medication before your appointment because it may affect the doctor's ability to read your test results. Also check with them before starting Azo, because some patients experience side effects.
Azo also makes an over-the-counter UTI test strip. Urinate over the strip and read the results. Of course, these at-home tests aren't perfect. See the doctor as a smart precaution even if you test negative.

, Both during a UTI and after, you need lots of fluids to flush out the infection and to keep you hydrated. Drinking plenty of fluids can help to prevent cystitis.Choose water, non-caffeinated tea, hot lemon water and other healthy drinks.
Avoid caffeine, which could dehydrate you. Also, avoid sugary drinks and alcohol.

, Pick juice that contains reduced sugar or an alternative sweetener; too much sugar isn't helpful, and no sweetener makes the juice too acidic. Use it in moderation and be sure to have a healthy, nutritious diet overall.


Cranberry juice won't cure a UTI, but it may prevent recurrence, particularly in women.If you have recurrent UTIs, drink 50 to 150 milliliters (1.70 to 5 fl. oz.) per day of 100 percent pure cranberry juice.If it's diluted in juices, you may need to up the quantity.
Drinking cranberry juice can cause side effects. For instance, it can react with regular medications and can cause kidney stones. Also, drinking more than 3 liters (101 fl. oz.) a day can result in diarrhea.Cranberry juice won't work for men, and it won't treat an active UTI.Take cranberry concentrate pills, the sugar from cranberry juice will just feed the infection further.



, The baking soda neutralizes acid in your urine, which makes peeing less painful. Don't overdo it because the baking soda may disturb the flora balance in your intestine.

, Gentle heat may provide some pain relief.

, Doing this will flush out germs that may have found their way into the urinary tract during sex. A UTI is sometimes jokingly referred to as the ""honeymooner's disease"" because it can be associated with intercourse.

, Drink a lot of water and drink tea, diluted juice (in moderation and preferably not daily with the exception of the cranberry juice as outlined above) and other healthy drinks. Avoid sugary drinks or highly caffeinated drinks or energy drinks.

, The more antioxidant-rich and nutrient-rich your diet, the greater chance you give your body of defending itself against infections.

, Do something physically daily to keep your immune system in good shape.

, Soaking in a tub can provide a breeding ground for infection. For the same reason, avoid sitting around in wet bathing suits or a hot tub.


When you wash your genitals, use a plain, mild soap, or simply water. Skip anything heavily scented or anything containing an exfoliant.
Avoid douching, using feminine deodorant sprays or wearing scented pads or tampons. These products remove your body's natural protective barrier.

, Do not then wipe forward; instead, discard the wiping paper immediately and use a fresh piece for the next wipe. Wiping this way will keep you from dragging germs from your anus toward your urethral opening.


If your hands get dirtied with fecal matter, wash them before wiping again (it is fecal bacteria, E. coli that is the culprit in 80 to 95 percent of UTIs).
Fragrance-free baby wipes without alcohol might help with wiping if you're experiencing pain or a burning sensation.

, You'll prevent not only UTIs but also other illnesses.

, Make sure to wear clean underwear every day. Also, skip tight clothing that chafes against your genital area.

Donate blood.,
Go to a blood service center in your country of residence.",How to Determine Your Blood Type2," If your doctor doesn't have your type on file, then you can also ask to get a blood test done. Call or visit your doctor's office and ask for a blood test to determine your blood type.


Try saying something like, ""I want to find out what my blood type is. Would it be possible for the doctor to order a blood test to check my blood type?""

, If you don't have a primary care physician, then you can have a blood test done at a health clinic. Just visit a local health clinic and ask them to test your blood type.


You may want to call ahead first to see if this is something that the health clinic offers.

, This is an easy way to determine your blood type and help other people, all at once! Find a local donation center or wait until your school, church or community center hosts a blood drive. When you go in, ask the staff if they can tell you your blood type. Your blood is typically not tested right away, so it can take up to a few weeks for them to mail or call you with the result.You might want to call ahead to make sure they'll give you your blood type before you choose a place to donate.
Keep in mind that there are some special eligibility requirements that you will have to meet before you can donate blood. There are also some things that may prevent you from donating, such as high risk behavior, travel to a foreign country, illness, or previous treatment of chronic illness., Blood service centers usually provide people with free resources for getting their blood tested and finding out their type.


In Canada, go to onto Canada's official blood website. Find out where the next ""What's Your Type?"" event is taking place. These are regular promotional events hosted in the community by Canadian Blood Services. Your results are instant and you will find out how common or rare your blood type is, who you can receive from, and who you can donate to. You will learn both your ABO blood group, as well as your positive or negative Rhesus factor.

Urinate when you feel the need.,
Use a heating pad.,
Take a baking soda bath.,
Take over-the-counter medication for bladder spasm.",How to Alleviate UTI Pain2," Although urination can be painful with a UTI, make sure to urinate when you feel the urge. If you are drinking plenty of fluids, you will probably need to urinate every hour or two. Don’t hold it in.


Holding your urine keeps the bacteria in the bladder, which encourages them to reproduce., To help relieve the pain or discomfort on your abdomen and lower back, place a heating pad on it. Make sure the heating pad is warm and not hot. Do not apply it directly to your skin because it can burn the skin. Place a towel or other type of cloth between the pack and your skin.To make a heating pad at home, wet a washcloth and then warm it in the microwave. After taking it out of the microwave, put the cloth in a plastic bag. Don’t place it directly on the skin.
Do not use for more than 15 minutes. You can burn your skin. Use for less time if you use a higher setting., Baking soda can help reduce the pain of a UTI. Place baking soda in the tub and fill it with just a little bit of water. It should be enough so that your bottom and urethra are covered.


You can also buy a product, called a sitz bath, which is specifically made to place inside your toilet. This is useful if you don’t want to or have the time to take the bath in a normal tub. , Medication containing phenazopyridine can help to alleviate pain associated with bladder spasms, as they can numb your urethra and bladder to prevent burning during urination. One such medication is Pyridium, which can be taken at 200 mg three times a day as needed for up to two days. Another OTC medicine is Uristat. These medications will turn urine red or orange.


Be aware that if you start taking medications containing phenazopyridine, your medical provider won’t be able to check your urine for UTI using a dipstick, as the test strip will turn orange.
You can also take ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) for the pain; however, the pain suffered during urination will persist, as these do not have the same numbing effect as phenazopyridine.
If you have extreme pain, your doctor may prescribe you a prescription analgesic. These are used for a short period of time and are paired with antibiotics, which will eliminate the pain and the need for pain medications quickly after you start taking them."
"
Wear cotton underwear.,
Stay away from perfumed bubble bath.,
Wipe to reduce bacteria in the urethra.,
Urinate after sex.",How to Alleviate UTI Pain3," To help prevent a UTI from developing, wear cotton underwear. Nylon underwear traps moisture, which provides a perfect environment for bacterial growth.Although this growth happens outside the urethra and bladder, the bacteria can travel up the urethra.

, Women and girls should not take baths with perfumed bubble bath soap. Perfumed bubble bath soap can cause inflammation of the urethra, which can provide a good environment for bacterial growth., Women and girls should wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from your stool and anus being introduced into the urethra.Your stool is rich in bacteria necessary for the digestion of your food, but shouldn’t get into your bladder.

, Another way that bacteria can get introduced to your urinary tract is through sex. To prevent bacteria buildup, urinate right after you have sex. This will flush the urethra of any bacteria that may have gotten inside it during intercourse."
"
Recognize the symptoms.,
Call a doctor.,
Determine if you have recurrent infections.",How to Alleviate UTI Pain4," There are some symptoms that are common for UTIs. These include:


A strong desire or urge to urinate frequently
A burning sensation or burning pain during urination
Passing small amounts of urine frequently
Red, pink, or coca-cola colored urine, which indicate the presence of blood in the urine
Pelvic pain in the center of the abdomen around the pubic bone in women
Strong smelling urine, To reduce the possibilities of permanent damage, you need to know when to contact the physician. Unless your symptoms disappear within 24 hours with home treatments, it is very important to see your physician for antibiotic treatment. Reducing the pain of a UTI does not mean you have cured it. If you do not see a doctor, you can develop a kidney infection. Most UTIs do not go away on their own.


Your physician can prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing the infection. Take the entire bottle of antibiotics, even though the pain and burning lessens, because the bacterial growth has not been eliminated.
Follow up with your primary care provider if symptoms do not improve in three days. You may need gynecological exam if you are sexually active.

, Some women can experience recurrent infections. Three urinary tract infections or more are categorized as recurrent infections.


This can be caused by a lack of not emptying your bladder completely each time you urinate. Urine that remains in the bladder after urinating can significantly increase the risk of experiencing recurring UTIs.This may be from a structural abnormality in the lower urinary tract. You can schedule an ultrasound or CT scan to check for abnormalities.

Recognize the symptoms.,
Know the different symptoms for an upper or lower urinary tract infection.,
Know when to seek medical treatment.,
Take a course of antibiotics.,
Complete the course of antibiotics.,
Be aware of potential complications.",How to Get Rid of a UTI Fast1," A urinary tract infection (UTI) is very common but can be unpleasant and very uncomfortable. UTIs are an infection of your upper urinary tract (kidney and ureters), lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra), or both.If you develop a UTI you will likely feel a burning sensation when you urinate as well as a need to urinate often.
You may also feel pain in your lower abdomen.;
, There are different symptoms for the various infections. It can be useful to think about your symptoms so you can explain them clearly if you need to go to the doctor. Symptoms of lower UTIs include: needing to urinate more often, cloudy or bloody urine, back pain, very unpleasant smelling urine, and generally feeling unwell.If you have an upper UTI you may experience a high temperature (over 38 degrees C, or 100 Fahrenheit).
You may also be nauseous, and shiver uncontrollably.
Other symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea., 25-40%of mild UTIs will spontaneously resolve, but that still leaves more than half which could be putting themselves at risk for a complication by not seeking medical care. Make an appointment with your doctor straight away if you are experiencing a UTI, and you develop a high temperature, or your symptoms suddenly get worse.If you are pregnant or diabetic you should contact your doctor immediately.
Going to see a doctor will enable you to get a precise diagnosis. What you think is a UTI could be a yeast infection or something else.Your doctor will likely have you take a urine test to determine if you have a UTI and what bacteria might be causing it.These cultures usually take 48 hours to complete.

, UTIs are bacterial infections, and as such, doctor prescribed antibiotics are the most thorough, most recommended treatment to consider. Antibiotics are particularly recommended for women who suffer frequent UTIs. Longer-term courses of antibiotics can help prevent the infection recurring.Antibiotics typically prescribed to treat a UTI are nitrofurantoin (branded as Furadantin, Macrobid, or Macrodantin), and sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim (branded as Bactrim, or Septra).However, ciprofloxacin (known as Cipro), fosfomycin (known as Monurol) and levofloxacin (known as Levaquin) are also prescribed.
In addition to antibiotics, AZO is an over the counter bladder analgesic that can help.

, Take a one- to seven-day course of antibiotics, with your doctor's prescription and advice. Most women are put on a 3-5 day antibiotic. Men might be put on an antibiotic for 7 to 14 days. While symptoms usually clear up around three days after antibiotic treatment, it can take up to five days for all the bacteria in your urinary tract to die off.It may take even longer for men.


It is vital that you finish all of the antibiotics that your doctor prescribes unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
If you stop taking your antibiotics before the course is over, you’re not allowing the antibiotics to completely kill the bacteria.If your symptoms continue after you have taken all your antibiotics, or you don’t feel any better after a few days, contact your doctor again., There are potentially serious complications from a severe UTI, which could lead to kidney failure or blood poisoning. These are not common, and they usually only affect people with a pre-existing health problem, such as diabetes. If you have a weakened immune system, you are more susceptible to complications and infections.Pregnant women with UTIs are at risk for life-threatening complications and should always be examined by a physician.
Men who have recurrent UTIs are at risk of developing inflammation of the prostate, known as prostatitis.You may require hospital treatment for a severe upper UTI, or if there are complications.
This will still involve antibiotics, but you will be closely monitored and perhaps put on a drip to keep you hydrated."

Tell your doctor about your symptoms if you are male.",How to Treat Cystitis," Common symptoms include the following:


A persistent urge to urinate, even when you just emptied your bladder.
A painful, burning sensation when you urinate
Passing small amounts of urine.
Cloudy and strong-smelling urine.
Feeling pressure in the lower part of your abdomen and discomfort in your pelvic area
A low-grade fever.
Small amounts of blood in your urine.Children may have symptoms that include irritability, poor appetite, and trouble controlling the bladder.;
, Other names for cystitis are bladder infections, and urinary tract infections. Starting treatment promptly can help you to feel better quickly and prevent any complications, such as a kidney infection., Sometimes, cystitis can cause discomfort in the abdomen or pelvic area or low-grade fever.You can treat these symptoms with an over-the-counter NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). You can also take acetaminophen (Tylenol), which isn't an anti-inflammatory but can help relieve pain and fever.Take the lowest possible dose that's effective. Overdosing or prolonged use of OTC painkillers can cause serious complications.
If you experience back or side pain, fever and chills, or nausea and vomiting, seek medical help immediately. You may have an infection that requires immediate treatment., Your doctor may want to collect a urine sample to verify the presence of bacteria. The most common type of bacteria that causes cystitis is called Escherichia coli, or E. coli.Your doctor will know which antibiotic you need to effectively manage the infection. Take the antibiotic exactly as prescribed, and for the full duration of the prescription. By doing this you can be sure you have completely treated the condition, and will not have a sudden relapse of your symptoms.Talk to your doctor before you proceed with any herbal remedies. Antibiotics are the drugs of choice when an active infection is involved. Your doctor is your best resource if you are considering herbs or herbal remedies to treat your symptoms.

, Depending on the severity of the cystitis, your doctor may recommend or prescribe drugs called urinary tract analgesics. These medications help minimize the discomfort felt when urinating. The most common agent used is called phenazopyridine. You still need to take antibiotics even if your doctor recommends taking phenazopyridine., Drink as much water as you can each day. This helps to flush out the bacteria that are growing in your urinary tract, including your bladder.The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink about 13 cups (3 liters) of fluids per day. Women should drink about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids per day. If you have an infection, you may want to drink more., Cranberry juice is mildly acidic and helps to lower the amount of bacteria in your bladder.Taking higher doses of ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, may be helpful during this time as this also helps to make your urine slightly acidic. Acidic urine makes it harder for the bacteria to live., Beverages that contain caffeine, such as tea and coffee, can be irritating to the lining of your bladder. The bacteria that is causing your bladder infection attaches itself to the lining area of your bladder and causes irritation, which contributes to the pain you experience. Avoiding beverages that can further irritate the lining of your bladder can help to prevent additional pain, and promote healing.Consuming soft drinks, sugary sodas, and fruit juices, add sugar to the fluids that pass through your bladder. Sugar is a nutrient for bacteria to grow. Avoiding these types of beverages during this time can help to promote healing and prevent further bacterial growth.Drinking just water and cranberry juice is the best option while you have symptoms.

, Some evidence suggests that sex can make cystitis worse.If you do have sex, use plenty of lubrication to help reduce friction and irritation., Taking showers instead of baths is recommended if you have repeated episodes of cystitis, or bladder and urinary tract infections.After a bowel movement, women should wipe from the front to the back. This helps to prevent bacteria from entering your urethra, and moving into your bladder. Teach children to wipe this way, too., Try not to hold your urine for long periods of time. By urinating often, you help to continually flush out your bladder., By doing so, you can help to prevent the unwanted bacteria that may be transferred during sexual activity from spreading into your urethra and bladder. If possible, use warm water to wash your genital area before having sex., Drinking at least 6 to 8 glasses of water each day keeps the fluids moving through your urinary tract. This helps to prevent bacteria from growing and causing an infection., Wear cotton panties and avoid tight fitting clothing and pantyhose. Allowing your genital area to be exposed to air helps to cut down on sweating and moisture build up that can contribute to the growth of unwanted bacteria., Many feminine products affect the pH balance of the urinary tract. Some women may also be more sensitive to chemicals, fragrances, etc. used in these products and develop an allergy-like reaction to them. Particularly if you get cystitis frequently, eliminate the use of these products.Don’t douche. Douching disrupts the natural balance of ""good"" bacteria and acidity in the area.Avoid feminine hygiene deodorants or sprays in your genital area.
Avoid bubble bath or scented granules.
Change tampons or pads frequently during your periods.
Use a water-based lubricant for sexual activity if you experience vaginal dryness.
Avoid lubricants that are silicone or petroleum based.

, In some cases, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to have on hand if you know sexual activity is a trigger for your infections. A single dose following sexual intercourse has been shown to help prevent this type of infection.Your doctor may also prescribe a single dose to be taken every day in a routine manner. Another option your doctor may consider is to provide a 3 day course of a prescription antibiotic for you to begin as soon as you notice the first symptoms. Follow the directions provided by your doctor. This will include directions on how to take the medication, and when to contact him or her if you develop symptoms., Taking probiotics can help to restore a normal and healthy bacterial balance to your body. Some recent evidence suggests probiotics may be beneficial to people that suffer from chronic urinary tract problems., Constipation can contribute to bladder infections, especially in children. This is because retaining stool in the colon, which happens with constipation, can put pressure on the bladder and interfere with its normal functioning.Increasing your fiber intake, especially of whole grains and vegetables, will help speed the passage of waste through your system.Drinking plenty of water will help you keep hydrated and will also make it easier to pass stools.
Regular exercise can also improve colon function.

, Some symptoms may be warning signs of a kidney infection, and include back pain, side pain, fever, chills, and nausea and vomiting.Call a doctor immediately if you experience severe vomiting, diarrhea, a rash, or any signs of an allergic reaction to the antibiotic or other medications taken.
Call 911 if you see swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, or have any trouble breathing.

, If you think your child has a UTI, contact her pediatrician right away. These infections can be much more serious in young children than in adults., Once you have finished the course of antibiotics, and your symptoms come back, let your doctor know as soon as possible. This can mean that the infection was not completely cleared, that the infection has started to spread, or that you may need a course of a different antibiotic.You should also call your doctor if you have any problems taking your antibiotic.

, If you start having frequent and painful urination that lasts for several hours, additional pain or discomfort, or a sudden worsening of any of your bladder symptoms, contact your doctor as soon as you can.If you have a vaginal discharge or sores in the genital area, contact your doctor. Sometimes, yeast infections and STIs can be confused with cystitis, and you may need further treatment.

, Blood in your urine can mean that the infection has spread to your kidneys, or that you may have a kidney stone. Your doctor needs to know about blood in your urine as soon as possible., If this is not your first case of cystitis, bladder infection, or urinary tract infection, your doctor will take that into consideration as treatment is started. In some cases, antibiotics can be prescribed for you to have available if you are more susceptible to this type of infection.In addition, your doctor may want to determine possible triggers for you that are causing repeated infections. Your doctor can help by providing information on ways to avoid your triggers, and stop infections as soon as they begin, including the use of prescription antibiotics., While it is possible for a male to get a bladder infection, or cystitis, sometimes the infection can be a warning sign of something more serious. Be sure your doctor knows about your cystitis."

Consider if you may have been exposed to Giardia parasites.,
Look for physical symptoms of giardiasis.,
Check for secondary symptoms related to the primary symptoms.,
Be aware that symptoms can change or even be absent.,
See a physician.,
Get treatment.,
Understand how giardiasis occurs.,
Know how giardiasis is transmitted.,
Learn about the long-term effects of a Giardia infection.,
Take preventive measures.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of Giardiasis," The way to determine if you have giardiasis is to combine your knowledge of your past behavior with your current symptoms and testing from your physician. Your risk of developing giardiasis increases if you or a family member member have been exposed to any of the following possible means for passing on the infection:


You've been traveling overseas or have come into contact with international travelers, particularly in close quarters.
You've had contaminated water, such as drinking water or ice made from contaminated sources like roof rainwater, rivers, streams, shallow wells, etc. contaminated by infected animals or people. Alternatively, you've had untreated (non-boiled) or unfiltered water.
You've had contaminated food – this can be caused by someone handling food who hasn't washed their hands after changing a diaper or going to the toilet.
You've been in contact with infected people, such as caregivers or family members of infected people.
You've been exposed to feces through sexual contact.
You haven't washed your hands after touching animals or infected people.
You have or have contact with children who use diapers and/or with children spending time in a daycare setting.
You have gone hiking and been exposed to untreated sources of water.;
, The symptoms of a Giardia infection can be non-specific. In other words, they can also mimic the symptoms of other intestinal disorders or infections. Symptoms of the infection will usually appear between one and two weeks after exposure. This is called the incubation period, or the time it takes for the parasite to cause symptoms to occur. The most obvious signs of infection are a number of gastrointestinal symptoms, including:Acute or chronic diarrhea with foul-smelling stool. With a Giardia infection, the stool can have a greasy appearance and blood is very rarely seen. You may find that the diarrhea alternates between watery stool and greasy, foul-smelling stool that floats in the toilet water.
Abdominal cramps or pain
Bloating
Flatulence or passing much more gas than you normally do (the abdomen may be swollen from the gas in the intestines). Often the bloating, pain, and flatulence will all occur together.
Nausea and vomiting
Loss of appetite
Belching gas with a very bad taste

, The result of the diarrhea and other abdominal symptoms can trigger the following additional symptoms of a Giardia infection:Weight loss
Dehydration
Fatigue
Low-grade fever or a fever less than 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit
Individuals over the age of 60 often display symptoms that include anemia, weight loss and loss of appetite
The very elderly and the very young can both be at particular risk for complications stemming from these secondary symptoms

, You may experience symptoms and then get better or you may experience a course of the illness in which you have symptoms, get better, and then feel badly again over several weeks or months.Some people who are infected with Giardia never develop symptoms but are still carrying the parasite and are able to spread it to others through their stool.
People who are asymptomatic, or don’t have symptoms, often clear the infection spontaneously.

, In order to prevent the spread of giardiasis, get a diagnosis from your doctor as soon as you can. Although the infection can be self-limiting and typically clears up, you can reduce your potential for experiencing a chronic infection through early diagnosis and treatment.


Diagnosis is usually made via a fecal specimen, so be prepared to give a stool sample. Once you have a clear diagnosis of giardiasis, you can discuss treatment options with your physician.

, There are several prescription drugs that can be used to treat giardiasis, including metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide. Different factors may affect how effective a drug regimen will be, including medical history, nutritional status, and the condition of your immune system.Infants and pregnant women may be more likely to experience dehydration from the diarrhea caused by giardiasis. To prevent dehydration, these at-risk populations should drink a lot of fluids while ill. Children should utilize an age appropriate electrolyte replacement fluid, such as Pedialyte.
If you work with children or handle food, do not return to work until you're symptom-free for two days. The same goes for children in early childhood centers. Otherwise, you can go back to work as soon as you're symptom-free.

, Giardia is a microscopic parasite found on food, soil or in water that has been contaminated with feces from an infected human or animal. They are protected by an outer shell (called a cyst) that allows them to survive outside a host body for long periods and makes them tolerant of chlorine disinfectant. People are infected when they ingest the Giardia cyst. These cysts are infectious and swallowing as few as 10 can cause someone to become ill. An infected host may shed as many as one to 10 billion cysts daily in their stool for up to several months, particularly when untreated., The parasites may be passed through contact with an infected object, food, or water. It can also be passed from animal to person and through oral-anal contact during sex.Giardia infection is most often waterborne. In other words, the parasite travels and is transported in water. These water supplies can be swimming pools, whirlpool spas, wells, streams and lakes, or municipal water supplies. Water infected by the parasite which is used to wash food, make ice or cook is also suspect.
People at greatest risk of developing giardiasis include travelers to countries where it is common (namely, developing countries), people in childcare settings, people in close contact with someone who has the disease, backpackers or campers who drink water from lakes or rivers, and people who have contact with animals with the disease.

, In industrialized countries like the United States, giardiasis is almost never fatal. It can, however, cause lingering symptoms and some serious complications. Complications can include dehydration, failure to thrive, and lactose intolerance, among others.Dehydration can be a result of severe diarrhea. When the body doesn’t have enough water to carry out normal functions you can experience some significant problems. Complications of dehydration can include cerebral edema, or swelling of the brain, loss of consciousness, and kidney failure. If not treated immediately, severe dehydration can be fatal.Failure to thrive is a condition which occurs in children and the elderly or immunocompromised people. Malnutrition, as a result of poor absorption of nutrients and minerals due to the Giardia infection, can harm the development of a child’s physical and mental development.In the adults, it manifests as a state of decline, such as impaired physical or cognitive function.
After giardiasis, some people suffer from lactose intolerance, the inability to appropriately digest milk sugar. Digestion of this milk sugar uses enzymes normally found in the intestinal tract. After this infection these enzymes may not be present and cause an intolerance to milk sugar after the infection has cleared.Other problems may include malabsorption, including vitamin deficiencies, severe weight loss, and debilitation.

, Take the following measures to avoid becoming ill with giardiasis and also to avoid spreading the infection.Prevent infection:

Do not drink untreated water or use ice made from untreated drinking water, especially in countries where the water supply might be contaminated.
All raw vegetables and fruits should be washed with uncontaminated water and peeled before eating.
Avoid eating uncooked foods when traveling in areas that may have unsafe water conditions.
If your water comes from a well, have it tested. Testing of well water should be done frequently if the well is located in an area where animals graze.


Avoid spreading infection:

Avoid exposure to fecal matter.
Use a condom or dental dam during oral or anal sex.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the toilet, changing a diaper, or coming into contact with fecal matter.
Do not swim in recreational waters, such as hot tubs, swimming pools, lakes, rivers, streams, or oceans if you have diarrhea. It is best to stay out of the water until at least two weeks after the diarrhea has ended.

Drink plenty of water.,
Try some cranberry juice.,
Take vitamin C supplements.,
Avoid consuming irritants.",How to Get Rid of a UTI Fast2," Antibiotics are the only way to really treat a UTI, but given that they often pass in a few days, there are things you can do to help ease the symptoms and make it less likely for the infection to recur. The most straightforward of these is just to drink plenty of water throughout the day, approximately a glass every hour.When you urinate your bladder is cleansed, and this can help flush out bacteria.Do not hold in your urine. Holding in your urine can cause the UTI to get worse, by encouraging the bacteria to breed.

, Drinking cranberry juice is often cited as a home remedy for a UTI. While there is little evidence that cranberry juice can actually fight an infection, it may help prevent one.If you have recurring UTIs try taking higher-strength cranberry capsules.As with water, drinking plenty of fluids helps you to flush out and cleanse your system.


Do not take cranberry juice if you or your family has a history of kidney infection.
You should not take cranberry juice capsules if you are taking blood-thinning medication.There is no medically specified dose of cranberry juice to take, as its effectiveness is not proven.One study found positive results for women who took either one tablet of concentrated cranberry juice a day, or drank 8oz of unsweetened cranberry juice three times a day for a year., Taking vitamin C supplements when you first start to feel the symptoms of a UTI can help to limit a developing infection. The vitamin C helps to acidify the urine, which discourages the bacteria from colonizing your bladder while strengthening your body’s immune defences.Try a 500mg dose every hour, but stop if your bowel movements become loose.You can combine vitamin C supplements with mild anti-inflammatory teas, such as goldenseal, echinacea, and nettle.
If the symptoms persist after a few days, go to the doctor regardless.

, There are certain things you consume which can be irritants, the effects of which are heightened when you have a UTI. The two biggest culprits to avoid are coffee and alcohol. Not only are they irritants, but they also dehydrate you which can make it more difficult to flush the bacteria from your urinary tract.You should also avoid soft drinks that contain citrus juices until after your UTI has cleared.Restricting caffeine and alcohol in your diet can also be used as a preventative measure against future UTIs if you are susceptible to these infections.

"
"
Maintain excellent urinary hygiene.,
Clean before and after sex.,
Wear the right clothing.",How to Get Rid of a UTI Fast3," While proper hygiene is generally considered a preventative measure against urinary tract infections, it is also an essential part of getting rid of the infection sooner. The more you can incorporate healthy and hygienic practices, the better off you will beWipe from the front to the back after using the bathroom. This is especially important for women, who should always wipe from front to back., Sexual intercourse is one of how bacteria can be introduced into a woman’s urethra, eventually ending up in the bladder.To help prevent this, the genital and anal areas should be cleaned before and after sexual activity. Women should also urinate before and after sexual activity. Avoid body lotions and Massage oils as a lubricant unless it says it's safe. These have chemicals that can lead to an infection.


Urinating after intercourse empties the bladder and flushes out bacteria.UTIs are not infectious, and you cannot catch one from somebody else., Certain clothes can make it more difficult to get rid of your UTI. Tight-fitting underwear which is made of non-breathable materials can enable a moist and bacteria-friendly environment to develop adjacent to the bladder. For these reasons, go for cotton underwear, rather than non-absorbent fabrics like nylon.Avoid tight-fitting pants or shorts. Tight garments can cause sweat and moisture to build up, creating an ideal breeding ground for bacteria.
Wearing the right underwear can help prevent infections developing or worsening, but it won’t cure them.

Be patient.,
Take anti-inflammatory painkillers.There are many products available over-the-counter that can help reduce swelling.,
Apply ice.If you're feeling pain from your ganglion cyst, try applying cold to it.,
Don’t use the affected joint as much.,
Stabilize the joint with a splint if necessary.You might find it hard to remember that you’re resting your joint, especially if the cyst is on the wrist.,
Massage the cyst.,
Do not smash the ganglion with a book.",How to Cope With Having a Ganglion1," About 35% of ganglion cysts don’t cause any pain — the only problem with them is that you might find them ugly.Luckily, about 38-58% of ganglion cysts actually go away on their own.If your ganglion isn’t causing you any real trouble, you might just leave it as is and see if the situation resolves on its own.;
, The reduced swelling will ease pain temporarily, until the medication wears off and the swelling returns. However, because many ganglion cysts resolve on their own, managing pain in the short term is often a good way to wait it out. The three most common types of anti-inflammatory drugs available in pharmacies are:Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
Naproxen sodium (Aleve)
Aspirin (Ascriptin, Bayer, Ecotrin)

, You can buy a gel pack from a pharmacy, or simply wrap some ice or a pack of frozen vegetables in a towel. Apply it directly to the area where you're feeling pain for 20 minutes at a time. Do this at least every day, up to once every three hours.

, Although the exact cause of ganglion cysts is still unknown, a leading theory suggests that they result from trauma to the joint (like a hard knock or crushing force).Another theory argues that they form when a joint is overused.In either case, limiting joint movement is known to relieve pain and speed up the healing process. Let the affected limb rest as much as possible.

, While it’s easy to remember to stay off your feet, remembering to stop talking with your hands can be harder! In that case, you might consider applying a splint to the joint. It will both serve as a physical reminder to rest the joint and limit the joint’s movement when you use the limb.


Place a rigid object (like a piece of wood) along the joint you want to stabilize. You can also wrap the joint in something like a magazine or thick padding of towel or clothing.
The splint should extend beyond the joint in both directions, so movement is as limited as possible. For example, a wrist splint should extend from the forearm, past the wrist, and down to the hand.Tie the splint into place with whatever you have on hand — a necktie, tape, a belt, etc.
Don’t tie the splint too tightly — you shouldn’t be cutting off blood flow. If your hands or feet start to tingle, loosen your splint.

, A ganglion is essentially a balloon of liquid, and when it presses up against a nerve, it can cause pain.To encourage the cyst to drain its liquid naturally, doctors often suggest massaging the area. You don’t need to use any particular technique or seek professional massage therapy, though. Simply rub the ganglion gently, but frequently throughout the day.Over time, you should see an improvement in symptoms.

, Ganglion cysts are sometimes called “Bible bumps” because people try to get rid of them by smashing them with a heavy book — like the Bible. While smashing the ganglion can temporarily get rid of it, there’s a 22-64% chance that the cyst will return if you use this method.Furthermore, you can cause even more damage to the already damaged tissue around the ganglion, or even break a bone if you smash the book with too much force.

"
"
Have a doctor drain the cyst.,
Be prepared for aspiration.Though it’s not a complex procedure, you should know what’s going to happen to you when you arrive for your aspiration.,
Ask if the doctor recommends a steroid injection.Aspiration alone is usually not a permanent treatment; in one study, 59% of cysts treated with aspiration alone came back within three months.,
Discuss surgical options with your doctor.,
Know the risks of surgical removal.,
Take care of yourself after the surgery.",How to Cope With Having a Ganglion2," If your ganglion is very painful or is interfering with the natural movement of your wrist, you may need to seek expert treatment to resolve the issue. A medical professional will be able to aspirate, or drain, the cyst, getting rid of the bump under your skin and stopping the cyst from rubbing painfully against nerve tissue.


Your doctor may check the cyst by shining a light through the growth – if the light shines through, then your doctor knows it is fluid-filled and is a ganglion cyst.

, This will help you stay calm and relaxed during the appointment.


The doctor will apply a topical anesthetic to numb the area around the ganglion.
He or she might inject the cyst with an enzyme that makes the jelly-like liquid easier to remove.
The doctor will poke a needle into the cyst, then draw the liquid out from it. The liquid is biological waste that the staff will dispose of lawfully and safely.

, However, administering steroids to the site of the drained cyst has proven far more successful, with 95% of cysts still cleared 6 months after treatment.

, Ganglions have a very high rate of recurrence, so you may find that home treatment and even aspiration is not a lasting solution to your problem. If you have a persistent ganglion that keeps coming back, ask your doctor about the possibility of having the cyst removed surgically.


This is typically an outpatient procedure, in which the doctor administers anesthesia through an IV.
Rather than simply draining the liquid from the cyst, they will remove the entire cyst, as well as the stalk that attaches it to the tendon or joint. Through complete removal, you reduce the chances of another cyst growing back., As with any surgery, there is a chance of something going wrong during the procedure. In rare cases, surgery might damage the nerve tissue, blood vessels, or tendons in the area around the cyst.You may also suffer from an infection or excessive bleeding.

, The area surrounding the cyst site will be sore and possibly painful during the healing process. Ask the doctor to prescribe a painkiller, like Vicodin, to help you manage the pain until it fades. Rest the affected limb as much as possible for at least a few days. For example, if the cyst was on your wrist, avoid activities like typing and cooking for a while. Ask your doctor for a recovery plan that includes:An estimate of how long it will take to recover.
What specific activities to avoid during the recovery process.
What symptoms to look for that might indicate problems with the procedure.

Recognize the characteristics of melanoma.,
Notice squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).,
Keep track of lesions.,
Get clinical diagnosis.,

Take care of other skin cancers.,
Prevent future skin cancer.",How to Check for Skin Cancer," The best way to check yourself for skin cancer is to do a self-examination, or survey. When performing your skin survey, choose a particular day during the month and note it on the calendar. Evaluate each area of your skin, leaving no part unseen. After you look at all the easily seen areas, use a mirror to evaluate the genitals, the anal area, between the toes, your back, and any other hard to see area. It may be helpful to have an image of a body chart and check off areas as you check them on yourself, as well as make note of any moles or markings you find. You can find one of these online, including this map from SkinCancer.org: http://www.skincancer.org/Media/Default/File/File/webbodymap_1142011.pdf


For examining your scalp, enlist the help of a friend, partner, or spouse. Part your hair in small sections looking and feeling for erosions, scales, or discolored lesions.
With the advent of tanning booths and full-body tans, you can end up with skin cancer on the vulva and penis. Take your skin survey seriously and leave no surface unexamined. The best way to adequately perform this survey is to know what each different kind of skin cancer looks like.;
, Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer. It is most often found on the sun-exposed areas of the head, including the ears and neck. It is erosive in nature, which means the local skin invasion of the cancer eats into the tissue it affects. It metastasizes, or spreads, to other sites on the body. Risk factors for this include sun exposure, tanning bed use, tendency to freckle, fair skin, number of blistering sunburns in your lifetime, and history of smoking.


The lesions are flat or slightly raised, pink or flesh-colored, bleed easily, and have a type of hole in them. They have appearance of eroded flesh and can look like a sore or lesion which oozes, crusts, and doesn't heal. The lesions typically range in size from 1 to 2 cm., Early detection is especially important with melanoma. It is the most deadly of all skin cancers. Melanoma can be cured if it is caught early during stage one. As the cancer advances to late stage cancer, the survival rate for more than a few years is less than 15%. The skin lesions associated with melanoma have certain characteristics that can be looked for when checking yourself for skin cancer, which are based on an ABCDE scheme.



A stands for the typical asymmetry within the skin region, where one half does not match the other half.
You should also look for a Border, which will be irregular, ragged or notched, jagged, and not sharp or crisp.
The Color will also change across the skin area with a kind of tie-dye effect with blacks, browns, and blues.
You must also look for the Diameter of the lesion. It will likely be larger than six mm, or just a bit over a 1/4 an inch in size.
You will also notice the mole or lesion Evolve, or change, its appearance over time. People with darker skin color must be aware that they are at risk for cancer as well — in particular a dangerous form of melanoma that is not caused by sun exposure, called acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM). It is typically found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or even under the nails., Squamous cell carcinoma starts out with a precancerous lesion called actinic keratosis (AK), which is a lesion that is not a cancer. An AK lesion appears as scaly flesh or a pink colored lesion and are most commonly found on the head, neck, and trunk of the body. They are often rough or scaly to the touch. These develop into SCC lesions, which are small plagues that are raised, plateaued, and painless with smooth edges. There may appear alone or in clusters. They are typically less than 2 cm in size. They may itch, bleed easily, and appear as non-healing wounds that won’t go away but also don’t grow.


Lesions greater than 2 cm have a 10 to 25% chance to be aggressive and spread. The lesions most prone to spread are those that start on the nose, lips, tongue, ear, penis, temple, scalp, eyelid, scrotum, anus, forehead, and hands.
In those with multiple AK lesions, the chances that at least on will go on to convert to SCC are between 6% to 10%.
There are several categories of people that are at risk for SCC, including those individuals with chronically injured or diseased skin. You are also at risk is you have overexposure to UVA or UVB rays, ionizing radiation, chemical carcinogens, and arsenic. You are also at risk if you have an infection with HPV viruses 6, 11, 16, and 18, leukemia or lymphoma, acne, or take immunosuppressant drugs., As you perform your body searches and notice any of the three different kinds of lesions, keep track of them. Any suspicious lesion should be photographed and marked in red on your body map. When you do your exam the next month, look for changes. Take another picture and compare the two.


If there are any changes, even subtle ones, follow up with your dermatologist. Bring your body map and photos to the appointment so you can show them exactly what has been going on., After you notice the lesions on your body, you need to have it clinically checked by a dermatologist. This is so you can figure out they indicate skin cancer and, if so, which stage it has reached. Once the specific kind is determined based on your lesion's physical characteristics, your doctor will discuss your options with you, depending on your particular situation. The doctor may decide on surgical excision right away if it is certain that your cancer needs that. If the doctor is less certain, they may choose to perform a dermatoscopy, which is a procedure where the lesion is reviewed under high-powered microscope.


Keep in mind that there are many skin changes — including new and changing moles and lesions — that are not cancer. Only an experienced physician can evaluate and help you decide if further evaluation or treatment is needed, so always err on the side of caution and get checked out.
Your doctor may also use a confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM), which is a non-invasive imaging study that provides pictures of the epidermis and the papillary dermis in real time. This will help distinguish benign from malignant lesions.
Your doctor may also opt for a biopsy. Although it is a good test that is still used, a biopsy is not always 100% certain.These techniques further allow your provider to recognize a melanoma and distinguish clinically between other difficult to diagnose lesions.

, If you find that you have an actinic keratosis (AK) lesion, you need to treat it so you do not develop squamous cell carcinoma. If a single AK lesion exists, it is easy to treat; however, if you have multiple AK lesions, it may become less efficient and cost effective to treat them. Instead, you can just keep an eye on them. Observe the cluster of AK lesions for awhile before you choose a method to remove them.


You can remove a singular AK lesion with cryotherapy, which is when the doctor freezes off the lesion with liquid nitrogen. You can also choose electrodissection with curettage, which is the cauterization and removal of the lesion with a scalpel. You can also try laser resurfacing or the application of fluorouracil to remove a single lesion as well. , The primary treatment for other skin cancers is surgical treatment. The doctor may perform a surgery where the tumor or lesion is cut out all of the diseased skin with clear surgical margins. Another popular surgical treatment option is Mohs surgery. This is a micrographic surgery that is used for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.


These cancers grow in the localized area of the primary tumor, only occasionally metastasize; however, they can be locally aggressive and erode the local tissue and frequently recur. These are the carcinomas most often treated with Mohs micrographic surgery that ensure that a malignant focus is not left at the site of excision, which could be responsible for recurrence., In order to prevent future skin cancer, you can take some precautions to help protect yourself. Since sun exposure is the main cause of skin cancer, use a broad spectrum sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection plus barrier protection on our most vulnerable areas when you go outside. These vulnerable areas are the head and neck. You can also wear a hat.


It is a common misconception that people with dark skin don't need to wear sunscreen. Use sunscreen and practice other sun-safe habits, regardless of skin color.You should also avoid tanning beds.
Remember that mucous membranes such as lips and tongue can be affected by SCC and become aggressive and spread."

Pace your recovery.",How to Recognize the Symptoms of Appendicitis," The most common symptom is a dull abdominal pain near the belly button that radiates or changes near the right lower belly. There are other symptoms that aren't so common. If you find yourself checking off several of them, it might be time to contact your doctor or go to the hospital. You should contact your doctor or go to the hospital as soon as you've identified these symptoms in yourself. Delaying the process will only make your appendix more likely to rupture and will endanger your life.You'll usually notice symptoms within 12 to 18 hours, but they may last up to a week becoming more severe as time goes on.Symptoms include:


decreased appetite
stomach problems - like nausea, diarrhea, and constipation, especially if paired with frequent vomitingfever - If your temperature is at or over 103°F (40°C), go to a hospital immediately. If it's at 102°F (38°C) but you're experiencing several other symptoms, go to the hospital as soon as possible. A low grade fever of around 99°F is another symptom.
chills and shaking
back pain
inability to pass gas
tenesmus - the feeling that a bowel movement will relieve discomfort


Many of these symptoms are similar to viral gastroenteritis. The difference is that the pain is general and not specific in gastroenteritis.;
, In addition to the symptoms above, you may also experience symptoms that are less commonly associated with appendicitis. Here are some less common symptoms you can look out for:Painful urination
Vomiting before abdominal pain begins
Sharp or dull pain in the rectum, back, or upper or lower abdomen

, In most adults, your appendix can be located on the lower right side of your abdomen usually one third of the way between your belly button and hip bone. Note that this location may be different for pregnant woman. Watch for a ""path"" of pain. The sharp pain might move from your navel (belly button) to the area directly over your appendix 12 to 24 hours after you start experiencing symptoms. If you've noticed a distinct progression like this, go straight to the emergency room.


In adults, symptoms of appendicitis may get worse within 4-48 hours. If you're diagnosed with appendicitis, it is considered a medical emergency., If it's too painful for you to even touch, especially in the lower right portion, consider going to the emergency room. You may also feel a tenderness in your lower abdomen when you press on it.

Look for rebound tenderness. If you press on your lower right abdomen and feel a sharp pain when you quickly release it, then you may have appendicitis and need medical attention.

, When you press on your abdomen, is your finger able to sink in a bit? Or does your abdomen feel unusually firm and hard? If you notice the latter, you might be bloated, which is another symptom of appendicitis.


If you have abdominal pain, but don't have nausea or decreased appetite, it may not be appendicitis. There are many reasons for abdominal pain that don't need a visit to the emergency room. When in doubt call or see your regular doctor for any abdominal pain that lasts more than 3 days.

, If you can't do this without severe pain, you might have appendicitis. While you should seek emergency care immediately, you might be able to ease the pain by lying on your side and curling into the fetal position.


See if your pain gets worse if you make jarring movements or cough.

, In pregnant women, the pain might be located differently because the appendix is higher when the woman is pregnant. In children 2 and younger, the pain in the abdomen is usually lower accompanied by vomiting and swelling of the belly. Toddlers with appendicitis sometimes have trouble eating and may seem unusually sleepy. They may refuse to eat even their favorite snacks.


In the older child, pain mimics adults in that it starts at the belly button and moves to the lower right quadrant of the belly. Pain does not get better if the child lies down, but it may get worse if the child moves.
If the appendix does burst in the child, a high fever is noted.

, If you feel that you have the symptoms of appendicitis, then it's important not to make your situation worse as you wait for treatment in the emergency room. Here's what you should avoid as you wait to be treated:


Don't take laxatives or pain medication. Laxatives might irritate your intestines further and pain meds can make it harder for you to monitor any spikes in abdominal pain.Don't take antacids. They can worsen pain associated with appendicitis.Don't use heating pads, which can cause an inflamed appendix to rupture.Don't eat or drink anything until you've been examined, because this can make you a higher risk for aspiration during surgery., If you feel reasonably certain you have appendicitis, don't just pick up the phone and make a doctor's appointment for later in the week. Go to a hospital as soon as possible. Appendicitis is potentially life-threatening if the appendix bursts without treatment.


Pack some overnight items, such as fresh pajamas and your toothbrush. If you have appendicitis, you'll be getting surgery and staying overnight.

, Be prepared for triage and tell the triage nurse that you suspect appendicitis. You'll then be ranked on a list of patients who need care according to the immediacy of their injuries. That means if someone comes into the ER with a head injury, you might have to wait a little bit.


Don't panic if you have to wait. Once you're in the hospital, you're a lot safer than you are at home. Even if your appendix bursts in the waiting room, they'll be able to get you into surgery quickly. Try to be patient and take your mind off the pain.

, When you do see a doctor, you'll need to describe your symptoms again. Note any digestive abnormalities (such as constipation or vomiting), and try to tell the doctor when you first noticed the pain. The doctor will examine you for signs of appendicitis.


Expect to be prodded. The doctor will press on your lower abdomen, hard. The doctor is checking for peritonitis, or the infection that results from a burst appendix. If you do have peritonitis, your abdominal muscles will spasm when pressed. The doctor might also perform a quick rectal exam.

, Lab testing and imaging are important for the official diagnosis of appendicitis. Possible tests include:Blood test - This will identify a high white blood cell count, which shows a sign of infection even before a low grade temperature is seen. The blood test will also show if there is an imbalance of electrolytes and dehydration, which can cause pain as well. The doctor may also do a pregnancy test to rule out the possibility in a woman.

Urinalysis - The urine will show a possible urinary tract infection or kidney stone which may also present with abdominal pain at times.

Ultrasound - An ultrasound of the abdomen will show if there is a blockage in the appendix, a rupture of the appendix, swelling of the appendix, or another reason for the abdominal pain. The ultrasound is the safest form of radiation and usually the first resort for imaging.

MRI - MRIs are used to do a more detailed picture of the internal organs without using an x-ray. Expect to be a little claustrophobic in the MRI machine. It's a tight space. Many physicians may order a light sedation to help ease the anxiety. It will also show the same signs as the ultrasound, but a little closer of a look.

CT Scan - CT scan will use an x-ray with computer technology to show images. You will be given a solution to drink. If you do not vomit the solution you can lie on the table to do the test. It is a pretty quick procedure, and not claustrophobic like the MRI machine. This test will also show the same signs of inflammation, bursting, or blockage of the appendix and is used most commonly.

, Your doctor may determine that you do have appendicitis. The only cure for appendicitis is to remove the appendix in a surgery called an appendectomy. Most surgeons prefer the laparoscopy type of surgery, which leaves less of a scar, rather than an open appendectomy.


If your doctor does not think you need surgery, he may send you home to be ""on watch"" for 12 to 24 hours. During that time, you shouldn't take antibiotics, pain medicine, or laxatives. In this situation, you should contact your provider if you get worse. Don't wait for your symptoms to resolve. You may need to return with a urine sample. When you return for another examination, you need to make sure not to eat or drink anything in advance because this could cause complications in surgery.

, Modern appendectomies are minimally invasive, and you should be able to return to normal life with few to no complications. But, it's still surgery — so take care of yourself accordingly. Here's what you should do to get back in shape after surgery:Ease back into eating solid foods. Because you just had surgery on your digestive tract, wait 24 hours before eating or drinking anything. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when you're allowed to have small amounts of liquids, then solid foods, all introduced separately. Eventually, you'll be able to establish a regular diet.
Don't exert yourself for the first day. Take this excuse to rest and recover. Try to engage in light activity and movement over the next few days, since your body will begin healing through movement.
Call your doctor if you notice any problems. Pain, vomiting, dizziness, feelings of faintness, fever, diarrhea, bloody urine or stools, constipation, and drainage or swelling around the incision site all warrant calling your doctor's office. Any symptoms of appendicitis after you've removed your appendix should be a cause for calling your doctor.

Bathe your rooms with light.",How to Recognize and Prevent a Pinworm Infection," Pinworms can affect young and old alike. The means of transmission is fecal-oral. They are spread person-to-person by the ingestion of pinworm eggs in that have contaminated fingers, bedding, clothing, and other items.For instance, a child with a pinworm infection may itch his rectum and get eggs on his fingers or under his fingernails, then transmit them to an object or another person, or even re-infect himself.;
, As you can imagine, the more you’re around people that have poor or undeveloped hygiene skills, the greater your risk.High risk: Children in school/pre-school, people who are institutionalized, and family, household members, and caregivers of the first two groups. Children’s hands go everywhere and usually without a consistent washing. They are also often putting their hands/fingers in their mouth, touching toys, tables, each other, wiping hands on clothes, etc. The same goes for those in institutions. For both of these groups, their environments are a pinworm Petri dish.

Moderate-risk: As you might guess based on those that are high-risk, those that come into contact with any or all of the high-risk individuals are in the moderate risk category. There’s not much you can do other than make sure you follow standard hygiene guidelines. Since you can’t avoid people just because they may have pinworm, all you can do is take care of yourself as best you can.

Low-risk: This is basically everyone else. Adults who have little to no contact with either the high-risk group or fairly limited contact with the moderate-risk group are at a low risk for pinworm infections.

, After a pinworm egg is digested, there is an incubation period of one to two months or longer for the adult gravid female to mature in the small intestine.Once mature, the adult female worm migrates to the colon and lays eggs around the anus at night, when many of their hosts are asleep. When they lay their eggs, they use ""glue"" that adheres the eggs to the anus and it is this substance that triggers the skin's itching sensation.
This is why the itching is usually worse at night: the worms are migrating to the area around the rectum to lay their eggs.

, Scratching an itch can transfer microscopic pinworm eggs to your fingers. From there, the eggs can be transferred to the mouth or other mucous membranes.This hand-to-mouth transaction can also be accomplished indirectly as well. The eggs can be passed to various surfaces such as a shirt or desk, where they can live for two to three weeks and picked up on the hands of others who, eventually, put unwashed hands to their mouth.

, In addition to a noticeable irritation in the rectal area, someone can have a pinworm infection without having any symptoms. When symptoms are present, they are likely to be:Restlessness, poor sleep, especially when this has not been an issue before
Bedwetting
Irritability (such as teeth-grinding)
Vaginal discharge in females
Bacterial skin infections

, If any of these symptoms are occurring, checking for the worms can be done using the naked eye, as follows:You may be able to see worms in the anal (rectal) area, especially if you look about two or three hours after the infected person has fallen asleep. Use a flashlight (torch) to help you see clearly.
You might also see the worms in the toilet after he or she goes to the bathroom. Look to see if the worms are wriggling in bowel movements. The worms are very small, about this long: ___. They may look like little bits of white thread.
They may also be found on children's underwear in the morning.

, If you suspect a pinworm infestation, your doctor may ask you to place a piece of clear, sticky tape against the rectum. Pinworm eggs will stick to the tape. Your doctor will be able to see these eggs under the microscope.The doctor might also take some samples from under the infected person’s fingernails and examine them for eggs.
You may also use a pinworm paddle. This spatula-like device literally “scoops” the area and holds the spatula end in a plastic test tube.

, The best way to prevent an infestation begins here. Your hands are the part of your body most likely to transfer the pinworm eggs so keeping them clean means those eggs go down the drain. Make sure you and your family wash hands before eating or handling food, after using the bathroom, and after changing a diaper.


Use warm water with a mild soap and vigorous hand-washing for about 30 seconds. Think two cycles of ""Happy Birthday"" or the ""ABC song.""
Wash your hands before, during, and after any and all activities with institutionalized friends/relatives, co-workers, etc.
Keep your hands away from your mouth whenever you are in a school or institutional environment.
Be sure to wash your hands after attending to children who are being treated for pinworms., Avoid biting your fingernails. Remember, this is a pinworm egg’s favorite hiding place. If you’ve come into contact with them or scratched an itch where the pinworms are hiding (e.g. clothes, exposed skin), they’ll be hiding under your nails.


Be careful not to trim them too short as that can cause other health issues for you or your loved one’s fingers.
Always make sure to clean under the fingernails both when washing your hands and taking baths/showers. It should be a general practice to keep that area clean.

, Have children wear close-fitting sleepwear and underpants and mittens. This will make it harder for them to scratch at night and pick up the worms.


Every family member should shower or bathe every morning and change undergarments daily (showering may be preferred to avoid contaminated bathwater). During treatment, shower at night and in the morning to remove eggs that have been laid during the night.

, Doing so increases the risk of contact with the pinworm eggs.

, In fact, to be better safe than sorry, wash EVERYTHING in hot water. Just be careful not to put that red sock in with the whites.


When you handle the bedding, clothing, and towels of an infected person (or one you may suspect is infected), do so carefully. Avoid shaking the articles and wash infected articles (underwear, bed linen, sleepwear, and towels) separately from other washing.

, Keeps drapes/curtains/blinds open all day because pinworm eggs are sensitive to sunlight."

Seek care as soon as possible.,
Take care not to spread the disease to others.,
Have your doctor determine the form of leprosy you have.,
Take a multiple drug treatment (MDT) provided by your doctor.,
Take your antibiotics.,
Monitor your progress for any side effects or complications.,
Take care to prevent injuries.,
Continue to see your physician.",How to Cure Leprosy," Leprosy is treatable with medication, and most patients can continue their lives normally if they are treated. The disease is only mildly contagious when it is untreated, and once you are taking the medication, you are no longer contagious to others. However, if leprosy is left untreated it can cause severe problems with the limbs (hands and feet), eyes, skin, and nerves.;
, Hansen’s disease is moderately contagious when untreated. It can spread to others by air, such as when you sneeze or cough.Remember to cover your face when you cough or sneeze to prevent airborne droplets from spreading the disease to others until you can see a doctor and begin treatment.

, Sometimes leprosy manifests only as a skin lesions, and sometimes it takes more severe forms. The particular treatment plan you follow will depend on the form of leprosy you have. Your doctor can diagnose this.


Leprosy can be diagnosed as paucibacillary or multibacillary (which is more severe).A case of leprosy is also classified as either tuberculoid or lepromatous (more severe, causing large lumps and nodules on the skin)., A number of antibiotics (usually a combination of dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine) are prescribed to treat leprosy. These drugs kill the bacteria that causes the disease (Mycobacterium leprae) and cure people infected by it.Your doctor will prescribe medications to take based on your particular case of leprosy.The World Health Organization (WHO) provides the MDT free to patients around the world through the Ministry of Health. In the United States medication for leprosy is provided by the National Hansen’s Disease Program.
Once you start taking the medications, you can no longer spread the disease to others.You do not have to be quarantined.
Daily and/or monthly doses of dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine may be prescribed for 24 months in many cases of leprosy.If leprosy only shows as a skin lesion, patients may be recommended to take the medication treatment for six months.In the United States, multibacillary cases may be treated for one year and paucibacillary cases for two years.If leprosy only manifests as a single skin lesion, the patient may be able to treat it with just a single dose of dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine.Multibacillary cases may require multiple treatments to cure.
Drug resistance to these medications is rare.
Side effects of these drugs are generally mild. Talk to your physician if you have questions., Continue to take the antibiotics your doctor prescribes you, according to the directions you have been given. If you do not take the antibiotics as directed, you could become sick again. , If you notice changes in your condition, experience pain, etc., then talk to your doctor. In particular, leprosy patients are susceptible to certain complications: Neuritis, silent neuropathies (nerve damage without pain), pain, burning, tingling, and sudden numbness may occur. This can be treated with corticosteroids. If left untreated, it can cause permanent injury and loss of function.
Iridocyclitis, or inflammation of the iris of the eye can also occur. If does, you will need to see an eye specialist right away. It can be treated with special drops, but permanent damage can result if it is left untreated.
Orchitis, or inflammation of a testis can also occur. It can be treated with corticosteroids, but let your doctor know immediately if you notice this symptom, as sterility can result.
Ulcers on the foot can result from leprosy. You doctor can develop a treatment plan to reduce this problem using splints, special footwear, and dressing of the wounds.The nerve damage and skin problems associated with leprosy can cause disfiguration and loss of function in the hands and feet. Plans to prevent and/or manage these symptoms, specific to your case, can be provided by your physician., Leprosy can cause numbness.If this happens, you might not notice when the numb area is in pain, and you might harm the area without realizing it. Be extra cautious to avoid injuries like burns and cuts on these affected areas.


Wearing gloves or special footwear can protect you if you have numbness in your extremities., Keep track of your progress as you recover, and note any symptoms you have. Continue to see your doctor for monitoring, and be sure to ask any questions you may have.

Think about how much alcohol you drink.,
Get tested for hepatitis B and C.The chronic liver inflammation and injury from either virus can, over several decades, develop into cirrhosis.,
Be aware of a correlation between cirrhosis and diabetes.,
Take your current weight into account.,
Know the risks from autoimmune and heart diseases.,
Examine your family history.",How to Recognize Cirrhosis1," Alcohol damages the liver by blocking its ability to process carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. When these things build up in damaging levels in the liver, the body may react with reactive inflammation that leads to hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.However, excessive alcohol use is not sufficient to promote alcoholic liver disease. Only 1 in 5 heavy drinkers develops alcoholic hepatitis, and 1 in 4 develops cirrhosis.Men are considered ""heavy drinkers"" if they have 15 or more drinks in a given week. Women are considered ""heavy"" drinkers with 8 or more drinks per week.You can still develop cirrhosis after you've stopped drinking. However, alcohol abstinence is still recommended for all people with cirrhosis. It will help treatment and healing, no matter what stage of the disease you're in.While cirrhosis is more common in men, cirrhosis in women is more likely to result from alcoholism.;
,


Risk factors for hepatitis B include unprotected sex, blood transfusions, and injection drug use with contaminated needles. This is a lot less prevalent in the US and other developed countries due to vaccinations.
Risk factors for hepatitis C include infections from injection drug use, blood transfusions, and body piercing and tattoos.
Cirrhosis from hepatitis C is the most common reason for liver transplants.

, In 15-30% of people with cirrhosis, diabetes is a risk factor for developing ""non-alcoholic steatohepatitis"" (NASH).Diabetes is also common in chronic hepatitis C infections — a common cause of cirrhosis — likely because of decreased pancreas function.


Another cirrhosis cause that's often correlated with diabetes is hemochromatosis.
This condition is characterized by iron deposits in the skin, heart, joints, and pancreas. The pancreatic buildup leads to diabetes.

, Obesity presents a wide variety of health concerns, from type 2 diabetes and heart disease to arthritis and stroke.But, the excess fat in the liver causes inflammation and damage that could develop into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.To determine whether you are within a healthy weight range, take advantage of an online BMI (body mass index) calculator.A BMI calculation takes into consideration your age, height, gender, and weight.

, If you have an autoimmune disease like inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or thyroid disease, be cautious. While they don't directly contribute to cirrhosis, they increase the risk of complications in other disorders that do lead to it.Heart disease is a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis leading to cirrhosis. Furthermore, heart disease related to right-sided heart failure can cause liver congestion (nutmeg liver) and cardiac cirrhosis., Certain types of liver disease that cause cirrhosis have a pattern of genetic inheritance. Look at your family's medical history for diseases that put you at an increased risk for cirrhosis:Hereditary hemosiderosisWilson's diseaseAlpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency"
"
Recognize the symptoms of cirrhosis.,
Look for spider veins.The more technical terms for this condition are spider angiomata, spider nevi, or spider telangiectasias.,
Observe the palms for reddening.,
Note any changes in the nails.,
Inspect long bone joints for swelling.,
Look for curled fingers.,
Check for a firm mass in men's breasts.,
Observe symptoms of hypogonadism in men.Men with chronic liver problems like cirrhosis see a decrease in testosterone production.Symptoms of hypogonadism include impotence, infertility, loss of sexual drive, and shrunken testicles.,
Take note of abdominal pain and bloating.,
Inspect the abdomen for prominent veins.,
Smell the breath for a musty odor.This indicates ""fetor hepaticus,"" and is caused by severe cases of the same hypertension that causes a caput medusa and the for Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur.,
Notice yellow eyes and skin.,
Test the hands for asterixis.",How to Recognize Cirrhosis2," If you observe these symptoms, you should bring it to a doctor's attention as soon as possible. He or she will be able to give you a professional diagnosis and immediately begin the treatment process. If you’re trying to find out if someone other than yourself has cirrhosis, make sure to include that person in your evaluation, as there may be symptoms that can't be observed from the outside. The symptoms of cirrhosis include:Fatigue, or feeling tired
Easy bruising or bleeding
Lower extremity edema (swelling)
Yellow-tinted skin and eyes (jaundice)
Fever
Lack of appetite or weight loss
Nausea
Diarrhea
Intense itching (pruritus)
Increased abdominal girth
Confusion
Sleep disturbance

, Spider veins are an abnormal cluster of veins that sprout from a central blood vessel with a lesion. They usually appear on the trunk of the body, the face, and the upper limbs.To verify spider veins, press a piece of glass over the suspected cluster of veins.
The red dot in the center of the cluster will seem to pulsate — getting red as blood enters, then blanching as blood exits to the smaller veins.
Large and multiple spider angiomas are a sign of more severe cirrhosis.However, they are also common with pregnancy and severe malnutrition. Occasionally, they are seen in otherwise healthy individuals.

, Palmar erythema looks like speckled patches of reddening spots on the palm, and is caused by changed sex hormone metabolism.Palmar erythema mainly affects mainly the outer edges of your palms along your thumb and pinky, and spares the central palm.


Other causes of palmar erythema include pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, hyperthyroidism, and blood problems., Liver disease in general often affects the skin, but observing the nails can provide useful additional information. Muehrcke's nails are pale horizontal bands or stripes that run across the nail bed. This is a result of inadequate production of albumin, which is solely made by the liver.Pressing on these nails will make the bands blanche and disappear before quickly returning.


With Terry's nails, the two-thirds of the nail plate closest to the knuckle appears white. The one-third closer to the tip of the finger appears red. This is also due to inadequate albumin.
Clubbing is a rounding and/or enlargement of the nailbed and the tip of the finger. When severe, the fingers may appear like drumstick, thus the term ""drumstick fingers."" This is more commonly seen with biliary cirrhosis.

, If you see recurring swelling at the knee or ankle, for example, it may be a sign of ""hypertrophic osteoarthropathy"" (HOA). Joints in the fingers and shoulders may also feel arthritic. This is the result of chronic inflammation in connective tissue surrounding the bone, which can be very painful.Note that the most common cause of HOA is lung cancer, which must be ruled out.

, ""Dupuytren's contracture"" is a thickening and shortening of palmar fascia — the tissue that connects the different parts of the palm. This leads to problems with finger flexibility, causing them to curl permanently. It's most common in the ring and pinky finger, and is often accompanied by pain, aching, or itching. The person will have trouble holding objects, as the condition affects grip strength.


Dupuytren's contracture is common in alcoholic cirrhosis, occurring in about one-third of cases.However, it is also seen in smokers, alcohol users without cirrhosis, workers with repetitive hand motions, and people with diabetes mellitus and Peyronie's disease.

, Gynecomastia is a growth of gland tissue in men's breasts that extends out from the nipples.This results from an increase in the hormone estradiol, and is seen in up to two-third of cirrhosis cases. Gynecomastia might appear like pseudogynecomastia, which breast enlargement from fat rather than glandular proliferation.


To tell them apart, lie on your back and place your thumb and forefinger on each side of the breast.
Slowly bring them together. You're feeling for a concentric, rubbery-to-firm disk of tissue directly under the nipple area.
If you feel the mass, there is gynecomastia present.If you don't feel the mass, you have pseudogynecomastia.
Other mass disorders, such as cancer, tend to be eccentrically located (not centered around the nipple)., It may be caused by an injury to the testicle or through a problem with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland.

, These can be signs of ascites, a buildup of fluid in the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity.If enough fluid accumulates, you may also experience shortness of breath.

, Caput medusa is a condition in which the umbilical vein opens, letting blood back up in the portal venous system. That blood is then shunted into the umbilical vein, then the abdominal wall veins. This makes veins highly visible on the stomach. This increased prominence are called caput medusa, because it resembles the head (caput) of Medusa, from Greek mythology.

, The odor comes from an increased amount of dimethyl sulfide as a result from the hypertension.


The murmur grows more quiet when the doctor flattens the blood vessels by applying pressure on the skin above the bell button.

, Jaundice is a condition that causes this yellowish discoloration due to increased bilirubin when the liver can't process it effectively. Mucus membranes may also become yellow, and urine may appear darkened.


Now that yellow skin can also be caused by eating a lot of carotene through carrots. However, carrots will not turn the white of the eyes yellow, as jaundice will.

, Ask the person you suspect of having cirrhosis to fully extend their hands in front of them with palms flat and facedown. The individual’s hands will begin moving and “flapping” at the wrist like a bird’s wings.


Asterixis is also seen in uremia and severe heart failure.

"
"
Ask a doctor to check for a change in liver or spleen size.,
Have the doctor check for Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur.Most primary care doctors will not check for this This is a hum in the veins that can be heard through a stethoscope in the epigastric (upper central) region of the abdomen.,
Allow the doctor to perform blood tests for cirrhosis.,
Have the doctor perform imaging studies.,
Get a biopsy for a definitive diagnosis.",How to Recognize Cirrhosis3," When probed, the cirrhotic liver tends to feel firm and nodular. Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) is caused by hypertension that causes congestion in the spleen. Both of these conditions are signs of cirrhosis.

, Like caput medusa, it's also caused by a problem with the way different vein systems in the body connect to one another when there's high pressure in the veins.


The doctor will perform the Valsalva maneuver — a probing technique that increases abdominal pressure. This will allow him or her to hear the murmur more clearly if it is present.

, He or she will draw blood and have a laboratory perform tests useful for a diagnosis of cirrhosis. These tests may include:


A complete blood count that tests for the anemia, leukopenia and neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia commonly seen in cirrhosis, among other things.
A test for elevated serum aminotransferases enzyme levels that might point to alcoholic cirrhosis. Alcoholic cirrhosis typically has AST/ALT ratio greater than 2.A measurement of total bilirubin to compare your levels to acceptable baseline levels. Results may be normal in early cirrhosis, but levels tend to rise as cirrhosis worsens. Note that rising bilirubin is a poor prognostic sign in primary biliary cirrhosis.A measurement of albumin levels. A failing, cirrhotic liver's inability to synthesize albumin will lead to low albumin levels. However, this is also seen in patients with congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, and some intestinal disease.
Other tests include alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT),prothrombin time,, globulins,serum sodium,and hyponatremia.

, Imaging the body can help recognize cirrhosis, but are more useful to detect complications of cirrhosis like ascites.


Ultrasounds are noninvasive and widely available. A cirrhotic liver appears small and nodular on an ultrasound. The classic finding in cirrhosis is shrinking of the right lobe and enlargement of the left one. Nodules seen on ultrasound may be benign or malignant and need to be biopsied. Ultrasounds can also detect increased portal vein diameter or the presence of collateral veins that suggest portal hypertension.Computed tomography isn't routinely done for cirrhosis, as it provides the same information as ultrasound. Furthermore, it involves radiation and contrast exposure. Ask for a second opinion and the doctor's rationale if he or she suggests this process.
Magnetic resonance imaging's use is limited by cost and patient intolerance, as the process can be time consuming and uncomfortable. Low signal intensity on T1-weighted images suggests iron overload from hereditary hemochromatosis., Checking for signs and symptoms and running blood tests are all good methods for confirming a suspicion of cirrhosis. However, the only way to know for certain that a liver is cirrhotic is to allow a doctor to perform a biopsy on it. After processing and examining the liver sample under a microscope, the doctor will be able to say for sure whether the patient has cirrhosis.

Quit smoking.,
Reduce your alcohol intake.,
Lose weight.,
Increase your activity level.",How to Improve Kidney Function Naturally1," Smoking increases your risk of kidney problems and several other serious health problems as well. If you are a smoker, then quit as soon as possible to reduce your risk of developing kidney disease.Ask your doctor about medications and smoking cessation programs that might help you to quit smoking.;
, Having one or two alcoholic drinks a couple times each week is a reasonable amount, but any more than this amount may damage your kidneys. Heavy drinking will put you at an even higher risk of kidney damage. Heavy drinking is defined as more than 3 drinks a day for women (or more than 7 a week) and more than 4 drinks a day for men (or more than 14 a week).If you are having trouble controlling your alcohol intake, talk to your doctor for help.

, Being overweight can contribute to poor kidney function because your kidneys will have to work much harder.If you are overweight, make losing weight a priority and work to maintain your weight loss. Talk to your doctor for help if you are struggling to lose weight. Some good ways to improve your chances of weight loss include:


keeping a food diary
drinking more water
getting more exercise
eating more fruits and vegetables

, Getting more exercise with benefit your overall health and it may also help to improve your kidney function, so try to make sure that you get some exercise every day.Even 30 minutes of walking can help to improve your overall health.


If you have a hard time fitting in 30 minutes at a time, then try breaking your exercise sessions up over the course of the day. For example, you could do two 15 minute exercise sessions or even three ten minute sessions throughout the day.

Reduce your sodium intake.,
Cut back on sugars.,
Prepare your own food.,
Avoid protein from saturated fats.,
Eat unsaturated fats.,
Exercise.,
Avoid tobacco.,
Limit alcohol.,
Get regular checkups.,
Use medications for pain correctly.,
Watch for symptoms of chronic kidney disease.,
Think about your risk factors.,
Get medical attention.,
Follow the treatment plan.",How to Prevent Kidney Disease," Watch how much sodium you eat and limit it to 2,300 mg of sodium a day. This is equal to about one teaspoon of salt. If you eat too much sodium, fluid can build up in your body causing swelling and shortness of breath. Try seasoning with herbs or spices instead of salt. Cut back on foods that are high in sodium. These include:Sauces
Salted snacks
Cured foods and lunch meats
Canned and convenience foods;
, Studies have shown that sugar plays a large role in contributing to obesity and diabetes, both of which can lead to chronic kidney disease. To reduce your sugar intake, read food labels since many foods contain sugar even if they aren't considered to be sweet treats. For example, condiments, breakfast cereals, and white breads are all high in sugar.Remember to cut back on sodas since these contain high amounts of sugar. They also have kidney-damaging phosphorus additives and offer no nutritional value.Note that added sugar comes in many forms — in fact, there are at least 61 different names for sugar you might find on an ingredients list. These include sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, barley malt, dextrose, maltose, rice syrup, glucose, cane juice, and more., When you make your own meals, you can choose whole grains, fruits, and vegetables that are minimally processed. Packaged foods that are processed are high in sodium and phosphorus additives which are bad for your kidneys. Try to eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day.In general, visualize a serving size of fruits or vegetables by looking at the size of your palm. One portion is about the amount of food you could hold in the palm of your hand.

, Researchers are still studying the relationship between high-protein diets and chronic kidney disease. While you shouldn't avoid proteins, or even fats, you should reduce the amount of red meat, full-fat dairy and saturated fats that you eat to only a few times a week. If you develop kidney disease, your kidneys will work harder to break down the waste from eating and digesting meat.Foods high in saturated fats include:Processed meats: deli meat, sausages, cured meats
Butter, ghee, lard
Cream
Hard cheeses
Coconut or palm oils

, You shouldn't completely avoid fats. Unsaturated fats, such as monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (which includes healthy Omeg-3 fatty acids), can reduce your cholesterol. Lowering your cholesterol can reduce your risk for heart disease which can cause kidney disease. To include unsaturated fats in your diet, eat:Oily fish: salmon, mackerel, sardines
Avocados
Nuts and seeds
Oils: sunflower, rapeseed, olive

, Being overweight or obese can increase your risk for chronic kidney disease. You should exercise to help you lose weight and lower your blood pressure, both of which will reduce your chances of developing kidney disease. Try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise every week.Studies have shown that obese people are twice as likely to develop chronic kidney disease. If your Body Mass Index is over 30, you're considered to be obese.Moderate exercises include walking, cycling, and swimming.

, You might think that smoking damages the lungs the most, but it can cause heart disease. Heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks will make your kidneys work harder and can cause kidney disease. Fortunately, stopping smoking can slow the development of kidney disease.If you're addicted to smoking, talk with your doctor about smoking cessation therapies. Your doctor might recommend nicotine patches or therapy., When you drink alcohol, your blood pressure and cholesterol levels rise. These can contribute to high blood pressure which can cause chronic kidney disease. Although you don't have to stop drinking alcohol completely, you should limit yourself to 1 drink a day (if you're a woman) or 2 drinks a day (if you're a man under 65).1 drink is equal to: 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits (liquor).

, Since kidney disease is difficult to detect until the disease has advanced, you should see your doctor for regular checkups. If you're healthy, aren't predisposed for a disease, aren't overweight and are under 30, you should see your doctor every 2 or 3 years. If you're healthy and between 30 and 40, see your doctor every other year. You can start getting annual checkups when you're 50, as long as you remain healthy.If you've already been diagnosed with another chronic disease like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease, it's important to work with your doctor to manage the disease since these can cause chronic kidney disease.

, Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can damage your kidneys if you take a high dose for an extended period of time. Taking a high dose for a short period of time can temporarily reduce kidney function. Follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions if you take aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen or naproxen sodium.Ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen are in a similar class of drugs, so taking a combination of these drugs at the same time can cause kidney problems.
Acetaminophen products (such as Tylenol) are filtered through the liver, not the kidney, so it’s preferred for people with kidney problems (so long as they have a healthy liver).
Always tell your doctor what medications you're taking since some pain relievers — even over-the-counter drugs — can interfere with other medications.

, You might not notice symptoms right away since chronic kidney disease takes time to develop. Pay attention for:Increased or decreased frequency of urination
Fatigue
Nausea
Itching and dry skin anywhere on the body
Obvious blood in the urine or dark, foamy urine
Muscle cramps and muscle twitches
Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, feet and/or ankles
Confusion
Difficulty breathing, concentrating, or sleeping

, While preventing kidney disease should be important for everyone, it's especially important if you're predisposed to developing the disease. Your risk factor is higher if you have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans also have higher risk of kidney disease. People over the age of 60 are also at an increased risk for kidney disease.If you have a family history of kidney disease, you may be at risk for some kidney diseases that have a genetic component.

, Because many symptoms of chronic kidney disease are similar to symptoms caused by other diseases, it's important to get checked out by your doctor if you notice any symptoms. Your doctor can test your urine and blood for kidney function. With that information she then diagnose kidney disease or determine if another condition is causing your symptoms.


Talk with your doctor about your family history, any medications you're taking, and any concerns you have about your kidney health.

, If your doctor diagnoses you with chronic kidney disease, you'll be treated for the condition that's causing it. For example, if a bacterial infection is causing your symptoms, you'll get antibiotics. But, since kidney disease is chronic, your doctor may only be able to treat complications.


If your kidney disease is severe, you may be put on kidney dialysis or get a kidney transplant.Your doctor might prescribe medications to deal with complications. Specifically, you might need medications to treat high-blood pressure, treat anemia, lower your cholesterol, relieve swelling, and protect your bones.

Allow medical staff to direct your treatment.,
Take medications as directed.,
Be prepared for surgical options.,
Understand your prognosis.",How to Recognize Cirrhosis4," For cases of cirrhosis, most mild to moderate cases are handled on an outpatient basis, with some exceptions. If the patient has major gastrointestinal bleeding, severe infection or sepsis, kidney failure, or altered mental status, treatment in the hospital is required.The doctor will likely ask you to abstain from alcohol, drugs, and medications if you have liver toxicity. The doctor will evaluate this on an individual basis. Additionally, certain herbs like kava and mistletoe can cause further damage to your liver.Discuss all herbal/alternative treatments you are currently taking with you doctor.
Your doctor will immunize you against pneumococcal disease, influenza, and hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
Your doctor will also establish the NASH protocol for you, in which you will be put on a plan for weight reduction, exercise, and optimal control of lipids and glucose (fats and sugars/carbohydrates)., As discussed in previous sections, there are many underlying causes that lead to cirrhosis. The medication your doctor prescribes will be very customized and specific to your precise case. These drugs will treat underlying causes (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, biliary cirrhosis, etc.) as well as the symptoms that result from cirrhosis and subsequent liver failure.

, Doctors don't always suggest surgery, but may recommend it if certain conditions arise from the cirrhosis. These conditions include:


Varices, or dilated blood vessels and can be treated with ligation (surgically tying off the vessel).
Ascites, an abdominal fluid buildup that's treated with paracentesis, a draining procedure.
Fulminant hepatic failure, a rapid onset of encephalopathy (alteration of brain structure/function within 8 weeks of diagnosed liver cirrhosis). This condition calls for a liver transplant.Hepatocellular carcinoma is the development of liver cancer. Attempts at treatment include radiofrequency ablation, resection (surgical removal of the carcinoma), and liver transplant., After a diagnosis of cirrhosis, people can usually expect 5-20 years of life with the disease with little or no symptoms.Once severe symptoms and complications arise from cirrhosis, death within 5 years without transplant is common.Hepatorenal syndrome is one severe complication that may occur due to cirrhosis. This refers to the development of renal failure in patients with liver disease, requiring treatment for kidney failure. Hepatopulmonary syndrome, another serious complication, is caused by the broadening of the arteries in the lungs of patients with liver disease. It leads to shortness of breath and hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). The treatment for this is a liver transplant."

Drink more water.,
Eat a moderate amount of protein.,
Reduce your sodium intake.,
Choose foods that are low in fat.,
Limit phosphorus if you have been told to do so.,
Watch your potassium intake if you have been advised to do so.",How to Improve Kidney Function Naturally2," Water is essential for preventing kidney stones, but it can also help to promote good kidney function. If you are concerned about kidney disease, then you should try to drink more water. Make it your goal to drink between six to eight 8 ounce glasses (about 1.5 to 2 liters) of water every day. If you are at risk of kidney stones, then you should drink even more water per day.Keep in mind that if your doctor has recommended a specific fluid intake for you, then you should stick to this recommendation.

, High protein diets can “overload” the kidneys, so it is important to eat only a moderate amount of protein to keep your kidneys healthy. About 20 to 30% of your calories should come from protein.For example, if you ate 2,000 calories in a day, then your calories from protein should be between 400 and 600 calories.


You can determine whether or not you are meeting this goal by keeping track of what you eat and paying special attention to your calories from high-protein foods. High-protein foods include things like meat, eggs, fish, and dairy products.

, Sodium can also cause problems for your kidneys, so it is best to avoid high-sodium foods and reduce your sodium intake as much as possible. You can reduce the sodium in your diet by cooking your own food and by limiting the amount of prepared and processed foods that you eat.


If you do use any prepared foods, make sure that you read the labels and avoid foods with added salt.
Keep track of how much sodium you eat each day. You should try to stay below 2,300 mg per day if you are under 51 years old and under 1500 mg per day if you are over 51 years old., Low-fat foods will help to protect your kidneys as well as your heart and arteries. Try to steer clear of high-fat foods like fried foods, baked goods, and other fat-laden dishes. Instead, choose low-fat foods such as:lean cuts of meat
low-fat cheese
low-fat milk
poultry with the skin removed
fruits
vegetables
beans

, If you you have kidney disease that is more advanced, then you may need to limit your phosphorus intake. Make sure to limit your phosphorus intake if you have been instructed to do so. Foods that you should limit include:deli meats
meats with added phosphorus
dairy products
cola
processed foods

, It is important to maintain the proper balance of potassium, so you may need to avoid or limit certain foods if you have been told to follow a lower potassium diet. Foods that tend to be high in potassium include:salt substitutes
oranges
bananas
potatoes
tomatoes
brown rice and wild rice
bran cereals
dairy products
whole wheat breads and pastas
beans
nuts

Ask your doctor before you start taking any herbs.,
Consider drinking kidney support teas.,
Stop using herbs if you experience any negative side effects.",How to Improve Kidney Function Naturally3," Herbs can improve the health of many different systems, but you should not use herbs if you have kidney disease. If you want to use herbs to improve your kidney function, make sure that you check with your physician first. Many herbs contain significant levels of electrolytes such as potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and sodium, which can cause problems for you if you have poor kidney function. Some herbs can also interact with other medications that you are taking., If you have visited your physician and have received a “clean bill of health” regarding your kidneys, then you may be able to use some kidney support teas. To make a cup of herbal tea, use a tea bag or use one teaspoon of dried herbs for every cup of boiled water. Pour the boiled water over the herbs and allow it to steep for about five to 10 minutes. Drink two to three cups of tea per day. Some of the herbs that may be used to support kidney function include:


Dandelion leafParsley leaf
Corn silk
MarshmallowUva Ursi (Bearberry), Herbal teas may cause some negative side effects for some people, even though these effects are often mild. If you notice that your body is reacting to one of the herbs you are using, then stop using that herb and contact your doctor.

Learn about gallstones.,
Watch for signs of jaundice.,
Identify symptoms of Cholecystitis.,
Know that diet affects your gallbladder.",How to Identify Gallbladder Disease1," When gallbladder digestive fluid hardens into deposits, it can create gallstones. These deposits can range in size from the size of a grain of sand to a large golf ball.;
, You will notice a yellowish tint to the skin or the whites of your eyes and white or chalky stools. Jaundice usually occurs when gallstones block the bile duct,causing a backup of bile into the liver. The bile may begin leaking into your bloodstream.

, Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder. It can be caused by gallstones, tumors, or other gallbladder problems.These attacks often result in severe pain that can generally occur along the right side of the body or between the shoulder blades. This pain is often accompanied by nausea and other stomach discomfort.A buildup of too much bile in the gallbladder can cause gallbladder attacks.
Different people experience gallbladder attacks differently. Although pain typically is on the right side, or between the shoulder blades, it may also feel like low back pain, cramps, or the like.

, Large or fatty meals can trigger a gallbladder attack.The attacks often occur in the evening, within hours of eating.


Gallbladder attacks are usually a symptom indicating that something else is wrong with the gallbladder. If gallbladder function is compromised and the gallbladder doesn't empty as quickly as it should, a gallbladder attack may occur.

"
"
Watch for early symptoms.,
Be aware of symptoms that mimic the stomach flu or a mild case of food poisoning.,
Assess your pain.,
Notice offensive body odor or excessive bad breath.If you have always had body odor or halitosis (chronic bad breath), it is unlikely to mean anything.,
Check your stools.,
Watch for signs of fever, chills and shivering.",How to Identify Gallbladder Disease2," A few of the earlier symptoms of gallbladder disease include gas, burping, belching, heartburn, feeling bloated, constipation or indigestion. These signs can be easy to miss or diagnosed or dismissed as a less serious problem, but early intervention can be key.


These symptoms indicate that food is not digesting properly, a common occurrence with gallbladder disease.
There can also be ""twinges"" or pain that feels like gas or cramps in the mid-section.

, These symptoms may include persistent nausea, queasiness, constant fatigue and vomiting., Gallbladder problems can often manifest as pain in the upper abdomen that often (but not always) radiates to your right shoulder. This pain can either be constant or it can come and go, depending on the cause of the specific gallbladder problem.This pain may be worse after a meal that is high in fat., However, if these develop suddenly and don’t go away in a few days, they could be signs of an underlying problem, such as gallbladder malfunction.

, One of the clearest signs of a gallbladder problem is stools that are light or chalky in color stools.Lighter, loose stools may be the result of insufficient bile. You may also have darker than usual urine with no change in water consumption.


Some people experience diarrhea that may last up to three months or more and may have up to ten bowel movements per day.

, These generally occur with more advanced stages of gallbladder disease.Again, these are symptoms that are common with other diseases, but if you’ve had stomach problems and other indicators of gallbladder disease, a fever could be a bad sign that the disease is progressing.

"
"
See your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms associated with gallbladder disease.,
Schedule an ultrasound of your abdomen.To determine how effectively your gallbladder is functioning or whether there are large obstructions to the organ, an ultrasound will be needed.,
Schedule gallbladder surgery if necessary.",How to Identify Gallbladder Disease3," If your symptoms match many of the ones above, you should definitely seek medical attention. If you are experiencing symptoms, if your symptoms are worsening, or if you develop new symptoms, see your doctor as soon as possible.


Some gallbladder problems, such as smaller gallstones, will not require invasive medical treatment.These can sometimes resolve on their own. However, a doctor’s visit is needed to determine this.

, The ultrasound technician will check for gallstones, bile flow, and signs of tumors (which are rare).Most polyps found in the gallbladder during the ultrasound are very small and do not need removal. Your doctor may want to monitor smaller polyps through additional ultrasound examinations to ensure they do not grow. Larger polyps generally indicate a greater risk of gallbladder cancer.
Removal of gallbladder polyps is at the discretion of your doctor.

, Many gallbladder problems are resolved with the removal of large gallstones or the gallbladder itself (cholecystectomy).The body can function normally without the gallbladder, so do not be alarmed if your doctor recommends its removal.


Gallstones are almost never treated with medicine. It takes years to dissolve the stone with medicine, and the stones that can be treated effectively are so small that it almost never worth the bother.
Removal of the gallbladder sometimes have side effects, (such as loose stools) but often none at all.

Note your symptoms.,
Compare the severity of the current heartburn episode to the severity of previous ones.,
Consider whether one of your medications is the cause of your heartburn.,
Monitor the duration and frequency of heartburn symptoms.",How to Know when to Seek Medical Attention for Heartburn1," The classic symptom of heartburn is a burning sensation in your throat and/or chest, but you may have other symptoms along with this one such as increased burping, nausea, or even vomiting. Identify them and write them down. Keep a record of your symptoms over the course of a few weeks to identify patterns in your heartburn episodes.;
, The severity of the pain can be an indicator that it is something more concerning than heartburn. For example, a heart attack (myocardial infarction) may feel like a very severe heartburn. If you are still unsure about whether or not your symptoms warrant a visit to the doctor, consider some of the following questions:


Is the pain dull or sharp? If the pain is dull, then it is more likely that it is just heartburn. If the pain is sharp, then you should seek medical attention right away.
Is the pain constant or is it intermittent? If the pain is intermittent, then it is more likely to be heartburn. If the pain is constant, then you should seek medical attention right away.Does the pain stay on one place or does it radiate to another part of the body, like the shoulders or the lower jaw?

If you are short of breath, dizzy, and sweaty; or if the pain radiates to your shoulders, arms, back, neck, or jaw, call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. You may be having a heart attack.



, Some medications can cause acid reflux or heartburn. If you are experiencing frequent, ongoing heartburn and you suspect that the medications are the cause, talk with your physician about the possibility of replacing them. Do not stop taking your prescription medications without talking to your doctor first. Some of the medication types that can cause heartburn include:Antidepressants
Antianxiety medications
Antibiotics
High blood pressure medications
Nitroglycerin
Osteoporosis medications
Pain relievers

, Occasional heartburn that resolves on its own after a short period of time does not warrant a visit to the doctor. However, if you experience heartburn several times a week for more than two weeks, it is a good idea to get a medical check-up, in order to rule out any underlying causes and to get effective treatment. Some of the conditions that can contribute to severe or prolonged heartburn symptoms include:


Inflammation of the esophagus: Also known as ""esophagitis,"" this can cause bleeding in both what is coughed or vomited up, and in your stools.
Esophageal ulcers: These are open sores on the lining of the esophagus. Repeated reflux can cause these and they cause a pain similar to heartburn.
Narrowing of the esophagus: This makes swallowing food difficult, and you can experience shortness of breath and wheezing. In this case, you may also experience chest pain, sore throat, hoarseness, excessive salivation, a sensation of having a lump in your throat (globus sensation), and sinusitis.
Barrett's esophagus: Constant heartburn puts you at risk of developing Barrett's esophagus. This is the development of abnormal pre-cancerous cells which may in turn develop into esophageal cancer. If the doctor discovers this, you will need to have an endoscopic examination every 2 to 3 years to ensure that it hasn't turned cancerous.Peptic ulcer disease: These are painful open sores or ulcers in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum, the upper part of the small intestine.Gastritis: This is an inflammation of the stomach lining.H. Pylori infection: This is a stomach infection caused by the H. Pylori bacteria. It can be treated with antibiotics."

Observe whether or not you have problems swallowing food or drink.,
Think about whether or not you have been vomiting.,
Consider whether or not you have had a significant, unexplained weight loss.",How to Know when to Seek Medical Attention for Heartburn2," For most people, heartburn is an annoying condition, but it does not interfere with daily life. If you experience heartburn that interferes with daily activities or that recurs on a daily basis, you should see a doctor about it., A persistent cough may indicate that you have heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux. If you have a cough that lasts 2 weeks or more, you should see a doctor. You may even want to get checked earlier, especially if you experience things like breathlessness and wheezing., If you have been taking over the counter medications for your heartburn on a daily basis for more than a few weeks, then you should talk to your doctor as soon as possible. You may need a stronger prescription medication and it is a good idea to find out why your situation has not improved., A combination of hormones and pressure on the stomach may cause some women to experience heartburn. Heartburn during pregnancy is most common in the third trimester. If you are pregnant and suffering from severe heartburn, you should talk to your doctor. If you are suffering from occasional mild heartburn, then there are a few simple things that you can do to help prevent heartburn:


Eat 5-6 smaller meals throughout the day instead of 3 large meals.
Wait at least an hour after eating to lie down.
Avoid spicy, fatty, and greasy foods., If you suddenly have trouble swallowing or if it is painful to swallow, it may be a sign that your esophagus has been damaged (most likely by the gastric acid that goes up into the esophagus). If you are having trouble swallowing, see a doctor as soon as possible. Difficulty swallowing puts you at risk of choking., Vomiting may also indicate that you need to see a doctor. If you are vomiting as well as experiencing heartburn symptoms, this may indicate that you have acid reflux. Even if you are only vomiting a small amount or burping up some of what you ate, you should talk to your doctor about it.See a doctor right away or go to an emergency room if the vomiting is severe, if you are vomiting blood, or if you have chest pain after vomiting., Losing weight is fine if you are dieting and exercising, but if you have lost weight unintentionally, there may be a problem. Unexplained weight loss or loss of appetite along with heartburn symptoms may indicate that you have GERD (gastrointestinal esophageal reflux disease). This condition require medical attention. If you have recently lost a drastic amount of weight as well as experiencing heartburn symptoms, you should see a doctor."

Keep a food diary.,
Avoid dairy products.,
Be wary of fiber.,
Avoid fatty foods.,
Avoid non-absorbable sugars.,
Avoid FODMAPs.,
Avoid carbonated beverages.,
Be sure to hydrate.,
Incorporate protein.,
Incorporate probiotics into your diet.,
Eat smaller meals more frequently.,
Incorporate vitamins and other nutrients.,
Exercise.,
Beware of other complications.",How to Eat an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Diet," Although IBD is not caused by your diet, certain foods may trigger painful inflammation in your intestines if you have this disease. It is important to know which foods cause symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea.In your diary, note the date and what you have eaten anytime you have a flare up of symptoms. Over time, you should get a sense of what causes your symptoms and which foods do not.
You may also experience symptoms such as fatigue, pain in your joints, weight loss, or anemia (the loss of red blood cells).
Keep in mind that diet and IBD is very personal; your doctor may have some general guidelines, but what works for one patient — or even an entire sample study of patients — may not work for you.;
, Many patients with IBD report experiencing diarrhea when they consume dairy products such as full fat milk, cheese (especially high fat soft cheeses), yogurt, and ice cream.Being lactose intolerant (or incapable of consuming dairy) is often a complication of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
If you are lactose intolerant, consider using a supplement such as Lactaid which can help minimize irritation if you consume dairy products. You may also want to switch to a non-dairy alternative, such as soy or almond milk.

, Although it is commonly believed that fiber can help relieve digestive problems, many patients with IBD report that foods high in fiber can exacerbate their symptoms. Many fruits and vegetables are high in fiber, but there are ways you can incorporate them into an IBD diet.Cook vegetables thoroughly. When fruits and vegetables are thoroughly cooked, they are easier to digest than in their raw form.
Remove the skin from fruits and vegetables. The skin has insoluble fiber in it, so you might need to peel the skin from your fruits and vegetables before consuming them.Avoid vegetables that can cause gas. These include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and brussel sprouts. Gas will only further irritate your intestines if they are already inflamed.
If consuming vegetables in their natural form is too irritating, consider using vegetable stock instead. You can add this to rice or pasta to add flavor and nutrients. It often has the same nutritional value as whole vegetables, but is generally easier to digest.Avoid nuts. Nuts are very high in fiber and can be especially difficult to digest.
Pick better grains. If you are having a flare up of symptoms, avoid whole grains and breads like rye and whole wheat. Processed grains will be easier to digest. Look for breads like sourdough and French bread instead. , If you are suffering from a flare of symptoms, fatty foods can make your diarrhea and abdominal pain even worse. Avoid consuming butter and margarine when you are having an attack.Watch out for pastas that have cream sauces, or foods that have been baked with cream cheese or sour cream. These also add extra fat into your system.
Fried foods — like french fries, doughnuts, hush puppies, fried chicken, fish or shrimp — should be avoided. They add extra grease into your gastrointestinal tract.
Fatty foods should especially be avoided if you have inflammation in the small intestine area of the gastrointestinal tract., These are frequently found in pieces of candy and gum that have had chemical sweeteners added to them. These ingredients usually end with the letters -ol.Common culprits include:


Sorbitol
Mannitol
Xylitol
Maltitol

, Short for Fermentable-Oligo-Di-Monosaccharides and Polys, these are sugars that can be found in some carbohydrates.They include things such as:


Fructose (commonly found in honey and corn syrup)
Certain fruits such as apples, apricots, pears, plums and blackberries
Sugars commonly found in cereals and pre-packaged granolas
Lactose from dairy products

, These can also cause extra air to get into the digestive tract, causing more gas and irritation.


Similarly, avoid drinking beverages with a straw as this can also put additional air into the liquid when your drink., Because diarrhea frequently causes dehydration, it is crucial that patients with IBD remain hydrated.Drink at least 8 glasses of water every day (or 64 oz). Foods that have a high water content (like watermelon) can also count toward this minimum.
If you have a severe attack of diarrhea, you are likely to lose electrolytes. In these cases, you might need to consume beverages such as Pedialyte or Gatorade to help replenish them. If you are consuming sports drinks or fruit juices that are high in sugar, you may need to dilute them with water or look for a low-sugar version. Fill half of the glass with juice and the other half with water.
Moderate your intake of caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea as well as alcoholic drinks as these dehydrate the body.

, Protein is an excellent source of vitamins, zinc, iron and other nutrients. If you are recovering from a flare, then consuming protein will be a good method for restocking lost nutrients.


Choose lean proteins like poultry, lean cuts of pork, and fish as opposed to fatty forms of red meat, like hamburger or brisket.Smooth nut butters like peanut and almond butter are also a great way to get the protein of nuts without the irritation of eating them whole., Probiotics are active microorganisms that can help encourage digestive health. They are commonly found in foods like yogurt. Talk to your doctor about incorporating probiotics into your diet as many IBD patients have had mixed results from their use.Your doctor may suggest taking a probiotic in a supplement form if you want to avoid lactose products such as yogurt.

, Because your digestive tract is in a sensitive state with IBD, it is best to eat four to five small meals a day as opposed to three large meals.


Make pre-portioned snacks and meals to take with you throughout your day, especially if you are traveling., Diseases like Crohn's or ulcerative colitis can deplete the body of vital nutrients we normally take in from food. Talk to your doctor about which kinds of vitamins you should focus on reintroducing, either through food or through supplements.You might want to avoid taking vitamin supplements in pill form as these can be difficult to digest. Instead, try to take vitamins in a powder or liquid form.Check the ingredients on the vitamin before you consume it. Some vitamins contain non-absorbable sugars or other ingredients that could actually irritate your symptoms.
Do not consume vitamins on an empty stomach. It's always best to take them with food.Many patients with IBD have deficiencies in zinc, iron, calcium, and folic acid. Talk to your doctor if you need extra supplements in these areas.
Avoid taking excessive single vitamins or minerals like vitamin A, D or E. they are fat-soluble and can be stored in the body, possibly causing toxicity.

, Low to moderate forms of exercise have been shown to be beneficial for IBD patients. In addition to releasing positive endorphins which enhance your mood, exercise can help strengthen your muscles and joints which are often weakened by IBD. A exercise session of 30 minutes, 3-4 times a week, will benefit your cardiovascular system and your overall health.Moderate forms of exercise include walking, jogging, biking, swimming, yoga, or gardening. If you are going for a walk, you might want to plan a route that includes a bathroom stop.
Know your limits. If you are experiencing a flare up of symptoms and cannot eat, then you should cease exercising until you have recovered and can eat again. IBD often results in fatigue and joint pain; if you are experiencing these, do not exercise, as this could exacerbate your symptoms., IBD can be a frustrating and difficult condition to live with. Some patients experience depression as a result of the physical pain and the difficulties of managing a diet with IBD. Be sure to talk to your doctor if you feel yourself becoming moody, irritable, or experience constant crying, a feeling of helplessness, and a disconnection from activities that you normally love.Your doctor may refer to a psychiatrist for treatment. You might undergo a course of cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, or a combination of both.
Search online for support groups. Speaking with others who can relate to what you're going through may help.

Most people experience no symptoms when they have gallstones; in fact only 5 to 10% of people develop some symptoms of gallstones. This can make it difficult to know what to look for if you suspect you may have gallstones, and further indicates the importance of consulting a doctor for official diagnosis.Fewer than half the number of people who actually have gallstones even experience symptoms.;
, Individuals with gallstones may experience a recurring pain in the upper right area of their abdomen (right upper quadrant pain) or in front of the lower part of their sternum (epigastric pain). There may be a gnawing pain, nausea and vomiting. The pain, known as biliary colic, usually lasts for more than 15 minutes and can sometimes radiate towards the back.Patients will usually experience recurring episodes of biliary colic after their first time experiencing the pain. In addition, biliary colic often occurs and then goes away. You may only feel this pain several times per year.
This symptom can be easy to confuse with other digestive or abdominal pains.
If you think you suffer from biliary colic, make an appointment to see your doctor.

, Observe whether you have abdominal pains and/or biliary colic after eating large or fatty meals, for example like a greasy breakfast with bacon and sausage or a big holiday meal like on Thanksgiving. These are the moments when you are most likely to experience pain and/or biliary colic.


In some patients, minor biliary colic, without signs of infection, can be tolerated without medical intervention.

, This is the main symptom of gallbladder inflammation, which is often caused by gallstones. The pain usually worsens when drawing a breath.You may experience pain between your shoulder blades and in your right shoulder specifically., Gallbladder inflammation is much more serious than biliary colic, and fever is the best way to distinguish between the two symptoms, based on their severity. You should seek medical attention right away if you fear that you have gallbladder inflammation.


Infection develops in about 20 percent of patients, with a higher rate for diabetes patients.
Infection can lead to gangrene and perforation of the gallbladder.Jaundice can also accompany fever. Jaundice can present with yellowing of the whites of the eyes (sclera) and skin.

, The risk of developing gallstones increases with age. In fact, gallstone incidence peaks when a person is in his sixties and seventies., Women are more likely to be diagnosed with gallstones than men; there is a 2-3: 1 ratio in this regard. Twenty-five percent of women will have a gallstone by the time they turn 60. This gender imbalance is due to the effect of the hormone estrogen, which women have more of. Estrogen stimulates the liver to remove cholesterol, and many gallstones are made from cholesterol.Women who take hormone replacement therapy pills experience an increase in risk of gallstones due to the estrogen. Hormone therapy can double or triple your risk of developing gallstones. Similarly, the birth control pill can also contribute to gallstone formation because of its effect on women's hormones., Expect increased likelihood of gallstones if you are pregnant. Pregnant women are also more likely to develop symptoms, like those listed above, than women who are not pregnant.Seek a doctor’s opinion immediately if you suspect biliary colic or gallbladder inflammation.
Gallstones may disappear after the pregnancy without surgery or medicine.

, Northern Europeans and Hispanics are high-risk groups for gallstones. Some Native Americans, especially tribes in Peru and Chile, have very high instances of gallstones.Family history may also matter. Having a family member with gallstones may indicate you have a higher risk. However, studies are not yet conclusive regarding this risk factor., Consult your doctor if you suffer from Crohn’s disease, cirrhosis or blood disorders as these are all risk factors for gallstones. Organ transplantation and prolonged IV feeding may also lead to gallstones.Individuals with diabetes are also at a high risk of developing both gallstones and gallbladder disease, without stones. This is likely due to weight and obesity., Obesity and frequent crash dieting have been found to increase the risk of gallstones by 12 to 30 percent. In obese people, the liver produces more cholesterol, and approximately 20 percent of gallstones are formed from cholesterol. In general, gaining and losing weight frequently can cause gallstones. The risk is highest for people who have lost more than 24 percent of their body weight and those who lose more than 3.3 pounds per week.In addition, diets that contain high levels of fat as well as cholesterol can be the basis for the formation of cholesterol gallstones (the most common type of gallstone that appears yellow).If you are inactive and lead a sedentary lifestyle, you are at higher risk for gallstones.

, The use of birth control pills at an early age, high doses of estrogen replacement therapy, chronic use of corticosteroid or cytostatic therapies, and drugs used to lower cholesterol can increase the likelihood that you will develop gallstones., Ultrasound is the best test to diagnose and differentiate gallstones. It is a painless imaging technique in which sonic waves produce an image of the soft tissues in your abdomen. A trained technician can find gallstones in the gallbladder or common bile duct.This test can detect gallstones in approximately 97% to 98% of individuals.The ultrasound procedure consists of a harmless machine that recreates an image of your gallbladder by reflecting inaudible sound waves against your body. Your ultrasound technician will apply a gel to your abdomen that will help the sound waves to travel through your body and be detected more accurately. This painless procedure is usually completed within 15-30 minutes.
You should not eat for 6 or more hours before the test.

, If your doctor wants still images of the area or the ultrasound did not produce a clear picture, a CT scan may be necessary. The CT scan will generate a cross-sectional image of your gallbladder by using special x-rays that will be interpreted by a computer.You will be asked to lie down in a cylindrical, donut-shaped machine that will scan your body for approximately 30 minutes. The procedure is relatively quick and will not be painful.
In some cases, the doctor may prefer to use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, rather than a CT scanner. This type of imaging involves a similar setup and will use changes in magnetic fluctuations to create an accurate image of your internal organs. This procedure may last up to an hour, and will involve you lying down inside a cylindrical scanning device.
There is no advantage of a CT over an ultrasound, except that a CT may distinguish a stone in the common bile duct, the small tube that carries bile from the gallbladder to the intestine., If you suspect you may have an abdominal infection, you can get a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC). The blood test can establish whether a larger infection in the gallbladder may require surgery. Blood tests can also reveal other complications caused by gallstones in addition to infection, including jaundice and pancreatitis.This blood test is a standard blood test. Your healthcare provider or a technician will utilize a small needle to draw blood from your veins into small vials that will be analyzed by a lab for the doctor’s requested information.
Leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein are indicators that are associated with acute cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder that could be caused by gallstones. Your doctor may check these levels as well as the standard panel of electrolytes and complete blood count analysis., Your doctor may recommend an ERCP, which is an invasive procedure in which a flexible tube about the thickness of a finger is placed into your mouth and down your digestive tract to examine parts of your stomach and intestine. If the physician finds gallstones during this somewhat invasive procedure, they can be removed.Let your doctor know all your medications, especially if you are taking insulin, aspirin, blood pressure pills, coumadin, heparin. These medications can affect bleeding during certain procedures, and you may be asked to adjust your medication routine.
Due to the invasive nature of the procedure, you'll receive medication that may make you drowsy, and it is advised that you have someone who can accompany you or take you home after the procedure.

, If your doctor is already prescribing tests for possible liver disease or cirrhosis, he can check for gallbladder problems at the same time by determining if any imbalances are present.This test can be requested at the time of a blood test to provide further evidence of suspected gallstones.
Your doctor will check your bilirubin levels,gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels, and alkaline phosphatase levels.If these levels are elevated, you may have gallstones or another issue with your gallbladder.

, If you're trying to lose weight, don't do any crash dieting. Aim to eat healthy, well-balanced meals that include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, complex carbohydrates (like whole wheat bread, pasta, and rice), and protein. Your weight loss goal should be to lose one to two pounds per week and not any more than that.Losing weight slowly but steadily can lower the risk of gallstones.

, Butter, meat and cheese may contribute to a diet that increases cholesterol and causes gallstones. Elevated fat and cholesterol contribute to cholesterol gallstones, yellow gallstones that are the most common type seen clinically.Instead, choose monosaturated fats. These fats increase your level of “good cholesterol,” which can reduce your risk of developing gallstones. Choose olive and canola oils over saturated animal fats like butter and lard. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in canola, flaxseed, and fish oil, may also help lower the risk of gallstones.Nuts are also healthy fats, and some research suggests that you may be able to reduce your risk of developing gallstones by eating peanuts and tree nuts, like walnuts and almonds., Fiber intake can lower risk of gallstones. High fiber foods include legumes, nuts and seeds, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. You should not have a difficult time getting enough fiber through diet alone. However, you can also consider taking fiber supplements, like flaxmeal. For a quick fix, combine one heaping teaspoon of flaxmeal in a glass of apple juice (eight ounces).

, Sugar, pasta and bread may contribute to gallstones.Eat whole grains, fruits and vegetables to lower your risk of gallstones and gallbladder removal.


Some research has suggested an association between high carbohydrate intake and increased incidence of gallstones. This is because carbohydrates are converted to sugar in the body., Some research suggests that drinking coffee daily and drinking alcohol in moderation (one to two drinks a day) can result in a reduced risk for gallstones.The caffeine found in coffee stimulates gallbladder contractions and lowers cholesterol in bile. However, other caffeinated beverages, like tea and soda, do not appear to have the same effect, according to the research.Studies have found that drinking even one ounce of alcohol a day can reduce the risk of gallstones in some people by 20%."

Learn what causes diarrhea.,
Recognize the symptoms of diarrhea.,
Check for blood and/or pus in the stool.,
Check for a fever.,
Look for black, tarry stool.,
Recognize dehydration in children.",How to Make Home Remedies for Diarrhea1," Most cases of diarrhea are caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Diarrhea may also be triggered by reactions to medication, including herbal treatments. Food sensitivities, such as sensitivity to sorbitol and mannitol, may cause diarrhea. Lactose-intolerant individuals may get diarrhea when they consume dairy products.Certain intestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease, can cause diarrhea. These disorders require medical care and often prescription drugs to treat.Diarrhea is also a common side-effect of chemotherapy and radiation treatments.;
, Most diarrhea is “uncomplicated,” and will usually resolve on its own in a few days. The symptoms of uncomplicated diarrhea include:Bloating or cramping
Thin or loose stool
Watery stool
Frequent or urgent-feeling bowel movements
Nausea
Vomiting
Mild fever

, Inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and certain infections can cause blood and/or pus to be present in your waste.You should seek medical attention immediately if you see blood or pus in your stool.


You may also experience blood or pus in your stool if you have recently taken antibiotics. Antibiotics may kill off “good” bacteria in your colon, allowing harmful bacteria to cause an infection., Fever accompanying diarrhea may be the sign of a more serious health issue.

Take a walk when you are bloated.,
Apply heat.,
Apply pressure to your stomach.,
Relax your body.",How to Get Rid of Bloating1," Roughly 20 to 30 minutes of rapid walking can aid in the digestive process. Walking quickly will help relieve bloating better than a slow walk.Walking is gentle enough to prevent further stomach upset, but it also provides enough physical activity to keep food and trapped air moving through the digestive tract. The increased heart rate and breathing causes the digestive muscles to push air and food through the intestines.;
, Bloating can come with a host of other uncomfortable feelings. Heat can reduce the pain from bloating, and it can help relax you, which can relieve the gas or constipation causing the bloating.There are many ways you can apply heat:


Place a heating pad on your stomach for direct heat.
Take a hot bath or shower.
Relax in a sauna.

, For five minutes, gently apply pressure in a small circular motion to a spot roughly four finger-widths above your belly button. This technique is known as acupressure. Putting gentle pressure on your abdomen can ease physical stress on the stomach, reducing any present tension and bloating. If your bloating is caused by constipation, it can also help encourage going to the bathroom., Lay down on your back in a dark room. Read a book. Meditate. Relaxation can help relieve the symptoms of chronic bloating. If you are frequently stressed and you suffer from bloating, try taking some time out of your day to peacefully rest.Your body will be relaxed enough to either pass the gas or constipation that is causing your bloating.

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Stay away from caffeinated and carbonated beverages.,
Try herbal teas.,
Try ginger preparations.,
Take small sips.,
Continue breastfeeding your child.",How to Make Home Remedies for Diarrhea2," Diarrhea dehydrates your body. To prevent dehydration, you need to drink plenty of clear liquids. Water is important, but you should also look for beverages that contain electrolytes like sodium, chloride, and potassium. Water alone does not contain enough electrolytes to replenish your body when you’re severely dehydrated.Healthy adult males should consume at least 13 cups/3 liters of water per day. Healthy adult females should consume at least 9 cups/2.2 liters of water per day. You may need to drink more than this to combat dehydration while you have diarrhea.Water, vegetable juices (particularly celery and carrot), sports drinks, electrolyte replenishment preparations, herbal (non caffeinated) teas, flat ginger ale, and salty broth such as miso are good options for adults.Barley water can also be a good way to rehydrate. Use 1 cup of raw barley to 1 quart of boiling water. Allow to steep for 20 minutes. Drain and drink throughout the day.Children should drink oral rehydration solutions such as Pedialyte and Infalyte. These are balanced for childrens’ nutrient needs and are sold in most grocery and drug stores.White grape juice may also be good for children who are dehydrated due to diarrhea., Drinks such as coffee and soda irritate the bowels and could make diarrhea worse.If you want to drink a beverage such as ginger ale, stir it or let it sit open overnight to allow the carbonation to dissipate.


Avoid alcohol when you have diarrhea. It dehydrates the body and can worsen diarrhea symptoms., Peppermint, chamomile, and green tea are very effective at curbing the nausea that can often accompany diarrhea. You can use tea bags or prepare your own.Chamomile tea is safe for children and adults, unless they are allergic to ragweed.You should not give children any other herbs without first consulting your pediatrician.You can make fenugreek tea by adding a level teaspoon of fenugreek seeds per cup of hot water. Although there is not enough scientific evidence to confirm fenugreek’s effectiveness, it may help settle upset stomachs and fight nausea.Contact your doctor before trying other types of herbal teas. Teas made of blackberry or raspberry leaves, bilberry, or carob may help calm stomach and bowel inflammation. However, they may also interfere with medications and can cause complications with existing medical conditions. Ask your doctor before trying these herbs., Ginger can help fight nausea and inflammation.You can drink flat (uncarbonated) ginger ale or ginger tea to help settle an upset stomach and ease bowel inflammation. If you drink ginger ale, make sure to find a brand that uses real ginger; some ginger ales do not use enough real ginger to be effective.


You can make your own ginger tea by boiling 12 slices of fresh ginger with 3 cups of water. Simmer and allow the tea to reduce for 20 minutes.Stir in a little honey before you drink the tea; honey may also help diarrhea symptoms.Ginger tea is safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women.However, pregnant women should not take more than 1 gram of ginger per day.Do not give ginger to children under 2 years of age. Children over 2 years old may benefit from small doses of ginger ale or ginger tea to treat nausea, upset stomach, and diarrhea.Ginger can interfere with blood-thinning medications such as aspirin or warfarin (Coumadin), so don’t use ginger if you are taking blood thinners.

, If your diarrhea is caused by a “stomach bug” or accompanied by vomiting, drinking a lot of fluid all at once could make it worse.Try to take small sips regularly throughout the day to keep your stomach settled.


You can also use ice chips or frozen popsicles to stay hydrated.These are especially good options for children, who may want to gulp fluids if they’re dehydrated.

, If your breastfeeding child has diarrhea, continue breastfeeding her or him. This will help comfort the child and keep him/her hydrated.Do not give an infant with diarrhea cow’s milk. This can cause gas and bloating.

Get plenty of fiber.,
Eat salted crackers.,
Try the BRAT diet.,
Avoid milk and dairy products.,
Avoid greasy, fried, or spicy foods.",How to Make Home Remedies for Diarrhea3," Fiber can help absorb water and firm up stools. This can slow down diarrhea. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends at least 25 grams of fiber daily for women, and 38 grams for men.Try adding sources of insoluble fiber, or “roughage” to your diet while you have diarrhea.


Brown rice, barley, and other whole grains are good sources of insoluble fiber.Cook the grains in a light chicken or miso broth to help replace lost salts.
Foods that contain potassium and fiber include mashed or boiled potatoes and bananas.Cooked carrots are a good source of fiber. You can mash them if you would prefer., Salty crackers are mild and can help settle an upset stomach.Some types of crackers also include fiber, which will help firm up your stool.


If you are gluten-intolerant, try rice crackers instead of wheat crackers.

, The components of the BRAT diet -- bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast -- help bulk up your stool and provide gentle nutrition that won’t upset your stomach..


Choose brown rice and whole grain toast. These contain more fiber and nutrients like vitamins and minerals.
Applesauce contains pectin, which helps to firm up stool. Apple juice may actually have a laxative effect that makes your diarrhea worse.Avoid any solid food if you are continuing to vomit. Stick with broths and other fluids, and call your doctor.

, These can cause diarrhea in individuals with lactose intolerance.Even individuals without lactose intolerance may find it harder to digest dairy products while they have diarrhea., These can upset your stomach and worsen diarrhea.Go for bland,mild foods until you feel better.

Stop eating wheat and dairy for a week.,
Introduce more fiber slowly.,
Avoid eating certain foods while you are bloated.,
Avoid drinking carbonated drinks.,
Eliminate gum and hard candies from your diet.",How to Get Rid of Bloating3," Quickly eating your food can cause you to swallow air. This may be the cause of your bloating. Carefully chew your food for a few seconds before swallowing to prevent extra air from going into your stomach., The most common allergens that cause bloating are gluten and lactose.Gluten is found in wheat products while lactose is in dairy products. For a week, try avoiding all wheat products. If that stops the bloating, you may have a gluten intolerance. If you still have bloating, try avoiding all dairy the next week instead.


Gluten products include bread, pasta, cake, cookies, and anything that contains flour. Some soups and sauces also use gluten as thickeners. If you think you have a gluten intolerance, get a test for Celiac Disease from your doctor. Celiac disease is an inability to digest gluten, causing stomach pains and bloating.
Lactose is found in milk, ice cream, yogurt, and cream. If you think you have a lactose allergy, get an allergy test from your doctor.

, Bloating can be caused by having too little fiber in your diet, but if you start eating a high fiber diet immediately, you can cause more problems. Wait until the bloating has passed before you try increasing your fiber intake. Slowly add whole grains, raw vegetables, nuts, and fruits to your diet over the span of a few weeks. If this causes more bloating, cut back for a few days before trying again.Adult women and men should consume between 25 – 38 grams of fiber a day. Fiber can be found in grains such as oats, wheat, and unmilled rice.

, While your bloating is an issue, you should not eat certain foods, as these may worsen the issue. These foods, which are rich in short-chain carbohydrates called FODMAPs, may not be properly digested if you have other digestive or gastrointestinal problems. FODMAPs include carbohydrates such as fructose (sugar from fruit), lactose (sugar from dairy), and artificial sweeteners such as sorbitol and mannitol. While do you do not need to cut out these entirely, you should reduce your intake until your bloating is gone. These foods include:Apples
Pears
Dairy products
Asparagus
Brussel sprouts
Garlic
Legumes like lentils, beans, and chickpeas

, Fizzy drinks like soda and beer can release carbon dioxide gas in your belly, causing it to bloat.

Find the best dentist.,
Consider finding an all in one dental office.,
Research your procedure.,
Consider asking for light sedation for the procedure.,
Bring something to read.,
Bring a friend or a family member.",How to Calm Your Nerves at the Dentist," If you don’t already have a dentist, don’t be afraid to search around.


Ask friends and family members about different dental offices and who they prefer.
Ask about offered services. When calling around, ask the dental office questions about services offered, prices, and insurance requirements.;
, There are many general practice dentist offices. However, all in one dental specialist offices are on the rise. This makes it much easier to have procedures completed, because they are all done under one roof.


When you decide to go with an all inclusive dental office, you don’t have the anxiety of visiting different clinics around town with different staff. You can get to know the staff at one location, thus making the overall experience much less stressful.

, Doing so will help you know what to expect. This should be done in moderation. Knowing what to expect at your dental visit can be reassuring. This way, you aren’t bombarded with a needle to the face, wondering what is going on.


Too much research can be an overload of information, including the 1 in 1 million chance of something dreadful happening.
Ask your dentist for information on your dental procedure. Oftentimes, your dentist will have medically accurate materials on their website. In essence, be prepared so that you can enter the dental office calm, cool, and collected.
Your dentist can provide you with informational websites with accurate graphs and educational materials.
Don't watch YouTube videos on a procedure. Watching YouTube videos of procedures is not a good idea. Most videos will not accurately depict the procedure, and each procedure is different because every patient is different.

, If you are getting a root canal, cavity filled, or tooth pulled, you don’t have to just stick with a topical anesthetic. Even though you can’t feel (most of the time) what the dentist and assistants are doing, the noises, pressure, and anxiety of sitting in the dental chair can take a toll. Mere minutes feel like hours. To help cope with this stress and anxiety, ask your dentist about light sedation options.


Ask about nitrous oxide. Many dental offices offer nitrous oxide (laughing gas) to help ease patients’ nerves. Even though you are still awake, you are relaxed and stress free. Before you know it, the procedure is over!

, Sitting in a waiting room until it’s time for you to back to the dental chair for your appointment can be stressful in itself. Sitting there, your mind can begin to mull over possible outcomes, your impending procedure, and other aspects.


Instead of letting your mind continuously run about how nervous you are with your dental visit, read over a book or magazine instead. Most doctors offices have a great selection of magazines from which to choose.
Bring a book, magazine, or crossword with you to the dentist. It is always good to be prepared in case there is not a good magazine that you can find.

, Having a friend or family member in the room with you can help ease tension and nerves. Just knowing that someone else is there with you to lend support can decrease anxiety levels tremendously.


Call before your appointment to ask the dental staff if it is okay for someone to be in the room with you.

Check for bleeding gums.",How to Care for Teeth and Gums During Pregnancy1," This is especially important during pregnancy. You’re more susceptible to plaque during pregnancy because your body doesn’t fight it off as well; your immunity drops, and your hormonal changes can affect your entire barrier of tooth protection. If you had good dental hygiene before pregnancy, simply maintain it. If you weren’t brushing as often as you should, try getting to brushing twice daily during pregnancy.If you find that your toothbrush is irritating your gums, try using a soft bristle toothbrush.If you're experiencing the gag reflex due to morning sickness, get a smaller toothbrush (a kid's toothbrush is great for this).;
, As you’re more susceptible to gum disease and inflammation during pregnancy don’t skimp on the flossing. Flossing is important to protect against periodontal disease and to remove plaque. If you are sensitive to strong tastes, use a flavorless floss., Not only will this promote the health of your baby, but it will also kelp you maintain healthy teeth during pregnancy. Sugary foods lead to the build up of plaque which can cause cavities and hurt your gum health. With the sensitivity of gums during pregnancy, this is particularly important., Calcium is necessary for healthy teeth and a healthy pregnancy.The daily amount of calcium you need while pregnant and breastfeeding is 1200mg. You can get this through food sources, including dairy, broccoli, spinach, and beans., This is the reason why it’s important to take good care of your teeth and gums when you are pregnant. These hormonal changes increase the risk of developing gum disease because it makes gums more sensitive, which makes it easier for gingivitis to develop, and this can affect the health of the unborn baby., You may have ""pregnancy gingivitis,"" because you are more susceptible to gum disease during pregnancy. If you do have bleeding gums, you may need to see a dentist for treatment.You may experience a slight pain or burning in your gums, and your teeth may feel loose as a secondary effect of the increased inflammation.

Use bland toothpastes.,
Don’t brush immediately after morning sickness.,
Rinse with baking soda and water after morning sickness.,
Use a tongue cleaner to remove acid after morning sickness.",How to Care for Teeth and Gums During Pregnancy2," Sometimes morning sickness can cause taste sensitivity during pregnancy. If you find yourself being sensitive to your normal toothpaste, try a blander one.Ask your dentist for recommendations for the best bland toothpastes during pregnancy., Because of the acidity in stomach acid, it is really important to delay brushing teeth immediately after vomiting. The stomach acid is really damaging to your enamel. Rather wait and brush your teeth at your normal times. , If you vomit and you want to wash out your mouth, use baking soda and water, as this won’t damage the enamel. It will also help get rid of the taste of vomit.Also, drinking a combination of baking soda and water can help ease the nausea.If you don't like the taste of baking soda, you can also use mouthwash.

, This will help your mouth feel cleaner and will help remove acid from your mouth.If you have a particularly sensitive gag reflex, you may want to wait until the nausea subsides before scraping the back of your tongue."

Tell your dentist you’re pregnant.,
Let your dentist know what medications and prenatal supplements you are taking.,
Get normal preventative dental care during your pregnancy.,
Get any urgent dental procedures done.,
Put off any elective procedures until after the pregnancy.,
Get treatment for periodontal disease if you have it.",How to Care for Teeth and Gums During Pregnancy3," Because the dentist will want to add extra protection during x-rays, it is important to tell your dentist about being pregnant. They may also want to change your treatment plan, especially if you have any procedures scheduled that aren’t necessary before the baby’s due., As with any doctor, it’s especially important to let them know what you are taking during pregnancy so as avoid any negative interactions that may harm the baby’s development. Make sure you do this before any procedures are undertaken or medications are prescribed., Getting your regular check up at the dentist is very important when you’re pregnant as you are at risk of worsened gingivitis and periodontal disease. When you’re at your checkup, make sure you let your hygienist or dentist know about any changes in your gums since becoming pregnant., It is safe to get most urgent dental procedures such as root canals during pregnancy. They will likely use less anesthesia, but will still want to make you comfortable, so don’t hesitate to tell them if you are uncomfortable during a procedure.Any tooth pain or infection should be handled as soon as possible, because of the risk of bacteria spreading and endangering your pregnancy.

, Because you don’t want to take any unnecessary risks, avoid cosmetic dental procedures until after the pregnancy.Because risks of elective dental procedures during pregnancy are unknown, they are best avoided., During pregnancy, your mouth is more susceptible to gum disease and inflammation. Root planing and scaling can help treat periodontal disease. This is a procedure done by the dentist and is safe for pregnant women."

Handle dentures with care.,
Rinse your dentures after eating.,
Remove dentures correctly.,
Insert dentures properly.,
Soak dentures overnight.",How to Care for Your Dentures1," Dentures can warp and break easily, so treat them gently and take care not to drop them: they can get damaged if dropped from even a few inches. Don’t ever bend or squeeze them because it will be hard to repair them and there is the risk of not fitting properly afterwards.


Take care not to leave your dentures in the reach of children or pets. It won’t matter how carefully you’ve handled your dentures if your toddler or puppy manages to grab them.;
, It is important to remove your dentures after eating and rinse them thoroughly.Whenever you rinse your dentures, do so over a bowl filled with water or a thick towel or cloth. This will help to protect your dentures if you accidentally drop them., There is a proper technique for removing dentures, which many people overlook. Remove them by using both thumbs or index fingers to feel the borders of the dentures, then pulling gently on the acrylic areas (the parts that are colored pink). For upper dentures, pull gently downward; for lower dentures, pull gently upward. Do not bend or squeeze the dentures when removing them, especially if they are flexible.


If your dentures are large (or if you have a small mouth), try stretching your cheeks and rotating the dentures, removing one side first and then the other.
Never pull or exert too much force on the metal parts of your dentures. Doing so will cause distortion or breakage.
You can search for video tutorials on Youtube, or ask your dentist to show you how to remove them correctly.

, As with removing your dentures, there is a specific technique for inserting them correctly. Using the edge of the dentures, stretch one side of your cheek outward, allowing enough room on the other side to insert the denture. Insert the opposite end, then insert the side stretching the cheek. Check placement, then press toward the tissue surface from both sides simultaneously.


Always use both hands when inserting your dentures. This technique is a precautionary one: if you accidentally let go with one hand, your other hand will be available to catch the dentures.
Always press on the left and right side at the same time while looking in the mirror to check the position. Never use too much force or you may hurt your teeth or gums. Using this technique may help to prevent fractures, the denture being dislodged, and pain.

, When you first get dentures, you may need to wear them during the day and night for a while. Ask your dentist whether or not to remove your dentures at night. If you do need to remove your dentures when you go to bed, soak them in a container filled with lukewarm (or room temperature) water. You can also dissolve a denture cleaning tablet in the water to make a denture cleansing solution.Never use hot water, as it can warp the dentures. Avoid wrapping your dentures in tissue or other paper, as they may get thrown away by mistake.

Choose the right tools.,
Rinse with water first.,
Wet your brush or cloth.,
Clean your dentures gently.,
Remove any remaining denture adhesives.,
Rinse well.,
Brush your tongue, gums, and natural teeth.",How to Care for Your Dentures2," Dentures need to be cleaned regularly, just like natural teeth. It’s important, however, to brush them without causing damage. Always use a soft-bristled toothbrush (harder bristles will damage the dentures) or a soft cloth, and either buy pastes made specifically for dentures or use mild soap or dishwashing liquid.Never use medium- or hard-bristled toothbrushes, regular toothpaste, strong detergents, household cleansers, acids, bleaches, or anything abrasive on your dentures. This can lead to oral irritation and mucosal sores

, Before brushing or cleaning, rinse your dentures thoroughly with plain water. This step will wash away any remaining debris or food particles.


If you do not have the tools or time to brush your dentures thoroughly after eating, at least take the time to rinse your dentures. A quick rinse is much better than nothing at all.

, Dry brushing will damage your dentures, so get your toothbrush or soft cloth wet before you start.

, Using smooth, even, gentle pressure, brush all of your denture’s surfaces with the mild soap or denture paste. Do not scrub.


Make sure that you clean your dentures daily. Dentures accumulate bacteria, tartar, plaque, and stains, just like natural teeth do. Failing to brush regularly will cause irritation, burning, infection, and gum disease

, When you clean your dentures, be sure to remove adhesives. Otherwise, they will accumulate in a thick layer on your denture and cause problems with shape and fit. If you leave adhesives on your dentures for a long time, they become very difficult to remove, and the adhesion of the denture will diminish considerably causing food to get underneath them while you are eating.

, After cleaning, rinse the dentures thoroughly to remove any excess soap or paste. It is also important to rinse your dentures well after they have been soaking in a denture cleansing solution. These solutions may contain chemicals that can make you sick if you ingest them., Using a soft toothbrush and regular toothpaste, brush your mouth and gums, as well as any natural teeth you may have.It’s important to remove any debris and plaque from the inside of your mouth before you insert your clean dentures.


If you wear partial dentures, you should also floss and use mouthwash. Don’t neglect your natural teeth just because you also have dentures.

Try ultrasonic cleaners.Ultrasonic cleaners are available at drugstores and online.,
Use denture cleansing agents.,
Make a homemade stain remover.,
Do not use materials that can damage your dentures.",How to Care for Your Dentures3," They are small bathtub-shaped devices filled with a special cleaning solution; using tiny vibrations, they dislodge debris, tartar, and stains from the microscopic pits on your dentures. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, place your dentures in the tub to clean them thoroughly.


Note that ultrasonic cleaning is not a replacement for daily brushing. It is, however, very effective at preventing stains when used in combination with daily brushing.

, There are a variety of products on the market that will clean your dentures chemically to disinfect and prevent stains. They come in powders, tablets, solutions, gels, and pastes, and they make a good addition to your regular brushing routine because they can help to prevent tartar deposits. You can also reduce tartar deposits by brushing your molars well, especially on the back sides. Follow manufacturer’s instructions, and always rinse well – residual cleansing agents can cause burning and gum irritation.


Overnight soaks in products designed for the purpose will effectively sterilize your dentures.
If your dentures have metal clasps, they should not be placed to soak in any kind of cleansing solution, as the metal will tarnish.
Never use hot water with denture cleaning products, as hot water will warp your dentures and cause an improper fit.

, You can also mix equal parts of vinegar and water and leave your dentures to soak in the solution. Soak your dentures overnight in this solution once per week and rinse them thoroughly after your remove them., If you notice stains and deposits on your dentures, you may feel tempted to use toothpicks, knives, stiff brushes, bleaching agents, abrasive scrubbers, and/or strong chemicals. Do not use these items. They can scratch, fracture, stain, or warp your dentures, and you will end up paying for a new one.


Avoid whitening toothpastes, rinses, and bleach solutions as well. These can weaken your dentures and change the color."
"
Avoid adjusting dentures on your own.,
Use dental wax for temporary relief.,
Buy adhesives to deal with looseness.,
See your dentist regularly.",How to Care for Your Dentures4," If you feel that your dentures aren’t fitting properly, or if you develop pain, sores, or irritation, see a dentist as soon as possible., If you feel painful sharp edges on your dentures, you can purchase dental wax to cover sharp areas and protect your mouth, gums, and tongue. Simply run your finger along the edge of the denture, mark any areas of sharpness, and apply dental wax to those areas.


Reapply dental wax as often as necessary, but remember that this solution is a temporary one. Ultimately, you will need to see your dentist.
If this doesn't work then you should try using a denture adhesive, which is similar to a gel.

, If your dentures feel too loose, you can buy denture adhesives, which come with simple instructions. Dab three or four pea-sized amounts of adhesive to the tissue surface of the denture, then insert.


Adhesives are also a temporary solution. You’ll need to see your dentist for a more permanent fix.

, Whether you have full or partial dentures, you should see your dentist every six months. He or she will check for damage to the dentures and for changes in your mouth or gums; if there are any problems, they can be addressed during these appointments.


If your dentist notices any changes in your face, jaws, gums, or bones, he or she may need to reline / rebase your dentures. Relining / rebasing is a process in which your dentist or dental technician adds material to your denture base to make a new denture base with the existing teeth. Additionally, if your dentist notices a lot of wear and tear, he or she may recommend new dentures.
If you have any trouble with the fit or feel of your dentures, schedule additional appointments between your regular check-ups.

Check the color.,
Check the shape.,
Choose a strong cement.,
Do not use full porcelain crowns.,
Avoid certain foods.,
Be careful when eating very hot or very cold foods.,
Chew gently.,
Maintain proper oral hygiene.,
Invest in a bite guard.,
Do not contract unnecessary dental surgeries.,
Adjust your bite.,
Brush gently.,
Stay cognizant of your crown’s condition.",How to Avoid Dental Crown Problems," Before getting the permanent crown inserted, your dentist will carefully match the color of the crown to the color of your teeth to ensure it looks natural. He or she should consult you, giving you a chance to approve or disapprove of the selection.Using a mirror, look in your mouth at the surrounding teeth to see if they are the same hue as the crown. Don’t be afraid to reject your dentist’s initial selection. It’s your mouth, after all, and you should be happy with your crown.


You should also check the color in natural sunlight. Sometimes the lighting in a dentist's office can be bright and confusing. Check the color outside, too, to see what it will look like in everyday lighting.;
, Ensure the shape of your permanent crown is correct. A properly shaped crown will make contact with the teeth on either side of it so food doesn’t become lodged in the gaps. A poorly-made crown may cause food to get stuck on either side of the tooth.Furthermore, crowns that are too big can cause trauma to the jaw as it is bitten by the tooth opposite it. This trauma may, in turn, lead to painful pulpitis, the inflammation of the tooth pulp (nerve)., Your crown may come out due to the use of a weak cement. With newer crowns, the cement tends to be very strong, but older crowns have a greater tendency to fail due to weak cement.If the cement has failed, you may look in your mouth and see that there is still some tooth and filling in your mouth. The crown itself will appear to be hollowed-out, and only crown material will be present within it.

, Porcelain is very brittle, and full porcelain crowns are more likely to fail than metal crowns. Choose a more robust crown of gold or another metal that can stand up to higher grinding pressures and possesses greater durability.Many problems with porcelain crowns cannot be avoided. The porcelain may have been fired incorrectly in the lab, or might not have been made thick enough.
Besides crown breakage or failure, porcelain crowns can rapidly wear down opposing teeth if the porcelain surface becomes rough.

, Hard and sticky foods should not be eaten while wearing a temporary crown. Examples of hard foods include raw vegetables, hard candies, and mints which might break your crown. Examples of sticky foods include caramel, taffy, or chewing gum., With a metal crown, especially, you will experience a slight to moderate pain or sensitivity in the crowned tooth. This is due to the greater thermal conductivity of the metal crown. Sensitivity will typically be felt at the gum-line.


Cold sensitivity should only last for about 6 weeks. Sensitivity to heat should last only about a week. If sensitivity to either persists beyond the expected time, you may require a follow-up visit with your dentist., Your crown may be sensitive to pressure. If you have to chew on it, be slow and gentle in your application of pressure. If you feel pain, however slight, stop chewing and try to eat a smaller portion.


Chew with the side of your mouth opposite the side where your crown is whenever possible.
Do not use toothpicks to scrape or force food bits from between your teeth; you may inadvertently loosen or remove the crown.

, One possible problem with a dental crown is that the tooth underneath your crown could start to decay. You can avoid this by adhering to a regular oral hygiene regimen which includes brushing and flossing regularly.Brush your teeth at least twice a day. You are still at risk for plaque, tooth decay, and gum disease on and around the crowned tooth.
The major difference when practicing oral hygiene with a crowned tooth is the way you floss. Floss side to side, rather than up and down. In other words, thread the floss between your teeth as your normally would, but instead of lifting the floss back out the same way you inserted it between your teeth, pull it out laterally, through the gap in your teeth. This avoids the possibility of you lifting the crown out along with the floss.
You can also use an oral irrigator when you floss, which can be great for massaging your gums.
Regular dental visits ensure that your dental problems are detected at an early stage and treated instantly.
The accumulation of plaque and tartar around a dental crown can cause irritation to the surrounding soft gums and cause gum inflammation. Prolonged gum inflammation can cause gingivitis or periodontitis, which is characterized by the loosening of teeth due to loss of attachment.

, A bite (or occlusal) guard is a special covering for the teeth which offers protection. Popular in sports where threat of dental damage is high, they are also often prescribed for people who clench their jaws or grind their teeth at night.A good mouth guard will be comfortable, durable, and easily cleaned. There are various kinds:


Stock mouth protectors can be bought off-the-shelf at local department stores. They offer limited adjustability and are not recommended for use by dentists.
Boil and bite mouth protectors are available at sporting goods stores and can be adjusted to a greater degree than stock mouth protectors. They are placed in hot water to soften, then placed in the mouth to form a semi-mold around the teeth.
Custom mouth protectors are made individually by professional labs contracted by your dentist. By making an impression of your teeth, your dentist can create a mold that perfectly protects your mouth.

A fourth kind of bite guard is also custom ordered from your dentist and meant for night use, in cases of teeth grinding during sleep. Called a nocturnal bite plate or bite splint, these will prevent potentially damaging jaw movements during sleep.



, If a new type of filling or crown is developed, do not feel obligated to trade up for the new one. Teeth adjacent to the crowned tooth should be left alone unless absolutely necessary. For instance, do not insist that your dentist remove your fillings on the teeth next to the crowned tooth simply because you do not like the way they look. Every time you adjust your teeth and jaw, you run the risk of damaging the already vulnerable crowned tooth. You may end up needing a root canal or, at the very least, experience painful inflammation.

, An uneven bite occurs when the crowned tooth comes in contact with its upper or lower counterpart before the rest of your teeth do. This can cause many dental problems over time, such as TMJ, jaw pain, headache, and even stomach problems. You can adjust your bite with surgery, orthodontics, or with selective modifications.


Selective modifications involve making changes to one part of the jaw which is causing pain or interference with your crown. A dentist may employ a dental drill to smooth areas where teeth are not coming together properly, just as you might use sandpaper to smooth away a piece of rough wood.This is the easiest and safest option to correct bit problems.
Orthodontists can correct your bite with braces. Braces are affixed to your teeth to move them into proper alignment. Your dentist will be able to recommend an orthodontist to you if he or she believes you would benefit from braces.
You can also get jaw surgery. This can be expensive and is recommended only in extreme cases of jaw damage such as dislocated or torn cartilage.If you know your bite is uneven before getting the crown, let your dentist know.

, Gum recession due either to toothbrush abrasion or natural aging may expose the metal substructure of porcelain crowns. If you see a gray line just above your gums but below the crowned tooth, you are seeing the metal substructure.While you cannot prevent natural recession due to age, you can take to preventative measures against toothbrush abrasion.


Spend no more than two to three minutes brushing. Do not use long horizontal scrubbing along the gums. Instead, use the roll method, in which you move the head of the brush in circles around your mouth from the top of the tooth to the base, where it meets the gum line.Use mouthwash to avoid gum inflammation, which usually takes place where the gum and crown intersect, or between teeth.

, Pay attention to the feeling of the crown in your mouth. Loose crowns can be swallowed or become lodged in the throat. If you feel it coming loose after probing it gently with your tongue, contact your dentist immediately.Do not discard a crown that comes out. Remove loose debris from around the tooth and inside of the crown. You can brush, scoop, or rinse the debris out of the inside of the crown. Figure out what the proper position of the crown is by placing it back in your mouth until it “clicks” into place over the tooth it was covering. Without applying pressure, close your mouth slowly to ensure that you have it in the correct position. “Glue” the loose crown back in place with dental adhesive. You can apply as much as you want; excess can be wiped away.
Not wearing your crown for a long time after it has come out can cause your teeth to shift, but only a properly seated crown should be worn. If you cannot identify the correct position the crown was in before it fell out, do not wear it. Schedule an appointment with your dentist so he or she can assist you."

You just need to be careful when handling them.) . Then you will need either matcha (green tea powder you can find in most Asian groceries, or either make at home; in this case, you will have to be careful to make a very thin powder) or gallnut (also known as tannins) powder. The choice is up to you, green tea powder is easier to find, gallnut powder is proved to prevent some strains of streptococcus bacteria, but both will work fine for the mixture.;

Skip acidic foods.,
Wear a mouth guard.,

Think about a root canal.",How to Care for Sensitive Teeth," While you probably don't want to cut them out completely, limiting acidic foods can help prevent teeth problems, which in turn can protect your teeth against sensitivity.Consider limiting foods like sodas and soft drinks in general, citrusy foods and drinks, yogurt, and wine.


Using a straw can help when drinking acidic drinks.
When you do indulge, try drinking some water or milk afterwards to cut down on the acidity in your mouth.Or, chew a piece of gum with xylitol in it to help recreate the basic pH. However, never brush immediately after drinking something acidic or you may wear down the enamel on your teeth.;
, Some people with sensitive teeth grind their teeth at night. You may not even realize you're doing it. Wearing a mouth guard at night helps protect your teeth. Your dentist can provide you with a custom fit one, though those are more expensive. You can also buy the boil-and-bite kind at drug stores., If you want to bleach your teeth, make sure you are doing it under your dentist's supervision, as bleaching can lead to more sensitivity. Your dentist can help you choose the best option for bleaching.The best way to do this is by using a low hydrogen peroxide gel in three or four appointments over the course of a year, rather than having it all done in one session with a stronger substance.

, Using a toothpaste made for sensitive teeth can sometimes help decrease pain. Look for one on the toothpaste aisle. It should say ""for sensitive teeth"" on the package. If you're not sure which one to choose, ask for a recommendation from your dentist.Keep using sensitive toothpaste, as it takes more than one use to make a difference.
Choose a toothpaste that has fluoride in it, as that will strengthen your teeth. Also, make sure that the toothpaste you choose has the American Dental Association's (ADA) seal of approval, which will be on the packaging., It's important to keep your teeth healthy once you get treatment for your sensitive teeth. Make sure you are brushing twice a day. Also, be sure to use a soft-bristled brush, as that's better on your gums, and don't brush too hard. You only need to use soft, gentle strokes.Make sure to change out your toothbrush every three months or so, as that helps keep your teeth healthy and also change the toothpaste if you find it too abrasive.

, You may not see how flossing can help sensitive teeth. However, flossing prevents tooth decay. Tooth decay can cause sensitive teeth or make it worse if your teeth are already sensitive. Therefore, flossing regularly can prevent you from gaining sensitivity., One way to help sensitive teeth is to apply fluoride as a gel or varnish. Your dentist can apply it just to the areas that are sensitive. This process will help make your teeth stronger in those areas, which cuts down on your pain overall.Taking fluoride may also be an option if you're not getting enough from your water supply.

, One reason your teeth may be sensitive is because you have roots exposed. If that's a problem for you, bonding may be a solution. The dentist will cover the exposed root with a resin, so it's not exposed. In turn, that can lower your pain., Other options to help with sensitive teeth include crowns and fillings. These solutions work best when your sensitivity is not due to exposed roots, but rather, problems with your teeth. Your dentist will know which option is best for you., For extreme cases, you may be able to get a gum graft. This solution also works to cover up exposed roots. Your dentist will take part of your gum from your palate and use it to cover your exposed roots, thus reducing your pain.There are also other techniques which do not use your own tissue, and involve membranes or growth factors. Ask your dentist about all of your options.

, A root canal is generally the last option. It also helps with exposed roots in your mouth, as well as with the soft part of your tooth, which is what causes them to be sensitive. A root canal may sound scary, but it can help reduce your pain overall."

Turns out there are free radicals in baking soda that can penetrate through your enamel, turning stains clear. Just dip your toothbrush in the stuff and scrub away for a couple of minutes, just like you're brushing your teeth.


There has been some uproar about just how safe this is, for the record. While it is effective, some say that it damages the enamel of your teeth, weakening it or destroying it entirely, especially if you use the back and forth brushing method using a toothbrush with hard bristles. To be safe, you may not want to rely on this option in the long-term. Using this option two times a week is more than enough.;
, This delicious fruit contains malic acid, an agent that can tear through stains. Crush up a berry in your baking soda paste, spread it on your teeth, and leave for five minutes. Brush it off and you're good to go! You can sometimes see a brighter tooth surface right away.


If you're in a hard spot, just rub the fruit on your teeth (cut up to get at the juices, of course) and wash off with a glass of water.

, Though it's up for debate, some swear that these two are natural teeth-whiteners, too. Just use them as a mouthwash or rub them onto your teeth and let sit for 10 minutes or so. Brush your teeth afterward, rinse out, and voila!


However, these methods shouldn't solely be relied on. It may take a month or two before you notice any results., As if it could get any easier, right? Your local big box store or pharmacy probably carries a few options when it comes to teeth-whitening kits. Some are rather expensive and some aren't -- but all will warrant results (it's just a matter of time). If you can spring for it, do so.


Check for “hydrogen peroxide” in the ingredients. This is helpful for whitening your teeth. A 6% concentration is more than enough.

, He has access to super powerful gels and trays that you won't find at your local pharmacy. And if he doesn't, for some reason, have any available, he probably knows someone who does. It doesn't hurt to ask!


Trays and gels are super powerful, but the main drawback is that it may not fit your mouth. If your jaw is a little, say, unique, you may find these difficult to work with.
Your dentist can provide custom trays for you that will fit snugly over your teeth and provide a better result.

, Several excellent technologies have emerged for bleaching and whitening the teeth. Although some of these procedures must be performed in the dentist's office, a few can be done at home. Ask your dentist what he or she recommends. The latest procedure is laser whitening.


This is perhaps the quickest method, and definitely the most expensive.
In case of intrinsic stains, veneers or lumineers can also be used (both of these are cosmetic procedures).

, The best way to prevent dental problems and staining is still brushing and flossing, hands down. Be sure to brush before bed and when you get up, but after meals is essential, too. Food left on your teeth can lead to stains -- when it immediately is brushed off, stains can't form.


Aim for brushing a full 2 minutes each time. And brush your tongue and gums, too!

, Though brushing and flossing are more imperative than using mouthwash and gum, the more precaution you take against stains, the whiter your teeth will be (and stay). In between hygiene sessions, just pop in a piece of whitening gum or take a quick swish of whitening mouthwash. It's good for your health, too!


Gum and mouthwashes help to keep your teeth white and prevent staining while also fighting against bacteria and cavities.
These won't have a great effect on their own, but can make a bit of difference when combined with a good brushing and flossing regimen. Think of them as the icing on the cake.

, That includes cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff. All of them are bad for you and your teeth. It's tempting to think that chewing tobacco is better for you (and your teeth) than smoking, but it's not. Chewing tobacco and snuff have at least 28 chemicals that lead to oral cancer and are much more addictive than nicotine because they are directly absorbed through the oral mucosa.You're only good bet is to stay away from them all.

, If you can't start your morning without them, try drinking them through a straw; you want the fluid to bypass your teeth. It's better to cut them out entirely, so if you can muster it, do so.


And no, cream or milk won't make your coffee stain less. The enamel-destroying powers are still there. So unless that cream takes up most of your cup (eliminating room for coffee), that lighter color won't do you much good.Cut back on soft drinks as well because they can also erode your enamel.

, Nowadays tooth-colored fillings are all the rage. However, you may have a dark, highly visible amalgam filling if a natural color wasn't available. If you have a little money lying around, consider having it replaced with a tooth-colored plastic composite, which makes the tooth look intact even when you look closely at it.


A rotten tooth can also be covered up by a porcelain crown. Talk to your doctor about your options.

, Just going in for a teeth cleaning will be sure to keep your smile white and sparkly. And, what's more, your dentist will catch any problems sooner rather than later, so it's a win-win.

, Turns out blue tints (on your body or on your lips) make ivories look whiter.So opt for that navy turtleneck or that berry lip gloss instead of the bright red sweater and matching lipstick. Sure, the effect goes away when you take it off, but it's a quick fix!


Don't go for matte lipsticks or glosses, though, even if they are blue-tinted. They'll make your teeth look dingy or less pearly. Stick to glosses for sheen and shine.

, Apples, fresh green beans, celery, carrots, raw cauliflower, broccoli...let's start over. Basically any hard vegetable or fruit can act as a scrubbing agent for your teeth. So if you don't have your toothbrush in your pocket and you just downed that cup of coffee, that apple may be your new best friend.


And all of these are good for your health, too!

You can choose from the available kits based on the types of gems you want.Choose a kit that has been developed with or by dental professionals to avoid doing damage to your teeth.
At home tooth gem kits will allow gems to stay on for up to several weeks. If you want your gems to last significantly longer, have them applied professionally, by a dentist.;
, Your tooth gem kit should come with a small battery powered UV lamp. Take it out of the kit and test it. This may require taking the batteries out of the lamp and removing any paper or plastic that was placed between the batteries for shipment.Always wear UV-protective eyewear, such as sunglasses, before testing or using a UV lamp.
Turn the lamp on to test it. It should create a blue-purple light when it is on.
Look in the kit for any additional instructions on using the particular UV lamp it contains.

, Applying tooth gems means working with a number of small objects in a short amount of time. Make sure to lay out all of the different tools, including the gems you’ll use. This will allow you quick and easy access to the tools you’ll need when you need them.Lay everything out on a clean surface.
Make sure you have plenty of light so that you can see what you’re doing.

, Chances are that your kit has come with a variety of gems. Select which ones you will apply. Place them gem side up so you can see them and pick them up easily. You can put the other gems to the side or back in the kit.If you plan to apply multiple gems, lay them all out now. You want to be able to apply them all in a short time while the glue is fresh.

, Your kit may not come with this, so you’ll need to get it on your own. Place a small dollop of hand cream with your tools. You’ll need it for getting the gem to stick to the applicator wand.Choose a simple cream that won’t overwhelm you with fragrance when it’s near your face.
You only need a tiny amount of hand cream.

, Brush your teeth well as you normally would. Make sure to rinse with water afterward to remove any residue or remaining toothpaste. Wash your hands so that they’ll be clean when they touch the gems and your teeth.Tooth gems will not impede brushing or other dental hygiene once applied.
Tooth gems can only be applied to natural enamel teeth. They will not stick to implants or dentures.
Don’t apply gems to damaged or cracked teeth, or teeth in need of other dental treatment.

, You’ll want clean hands since you’ll be touching things that will be going in or near your mouth. If someone else is helping you apply the tooth gems, make sure they wash their hands as well.Use soap and warm water to properly wash hands.

, The best way to do this is to smile in a way that shows your teeth. Once you’ve done this, take one of the provided cotton balls and place it between the tooth and the lip to keep the lip away from the tooth.This is done to keep the tooth exposed and dry. If the lip still touches the tooth, use more pieces of cotton around it to pull the lip from the tooth.
Place another cotton roll between the upper and lower teeth and bite down on it.

, Use a piece of provided cotton to completely dry the tooth. This is a crucial step to making sure the gem will adhere to the tooth. If the tooth is not completely dry, it will not allow the glue to adhere., Your kit should come with applicator wands for the glue. Use one to stir the glue. Check your specific kit’s instructions for how to stir the glue and for how long.Some kits say to stir the glue for five seconds.

, Now that the applicator wand has glue on it, place a dab of glue on the tooth. Place the glue in the spot where you want the gem to sit. You only need a little bit of glue, so don’t overdo it.Do this relatively quickly so that the glue is freshly stirred when it’s applied.
Apply two coats or dabs of glue.

, Dip the other end of the applicator into the small amount of hand cream that you laid out. The hand cream will help the gem stick to the applicator wand. You only need a small amount for the gem to stick to it.Once you've dipped the applicator in the hand cream, touch it to the gem side of the gem. The flat side should stay clean and not touch the hand cream at all.
Once the gem is on the applicator wand, bring it to your tooth and press it into the place when you dabbed the glue.
The gem should stay on the tooth.You can move the gem into the right place if it isn’t exactly where you want it. Use the wand to do this.

, Different kits will have different amounts of time that the glue needs to set for. However, four minutes may be a minimum amount of time. Hold the lamp as close to the tooth and gel as possible without touching the tooth.Make sure you’re wearing your UV protective eyewear, as is anyone else watching the procedure.

, Your gem should now be affixed to the tooth. If your gem has been successfully adhered, it should be able to stay put through normal dental hygiene. Be sure to brush well under and around teh gem regularly, as that area can become more prone to decay if not taken care of.Take all of the cotton out of your mouth.
When you want to remove the gem, there are a few options. If you want to take it off before it falls off naturally, you can sometimes use dental floss to help pull it off from the top down. Otherwise, make an appointment with your dentist, who will remove it the same way they remove dental brackets."

Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve) or aspirin are likely best for toothaches that involve significant inflammation — common with gingivitis and mild mouth trauma.Painkillers are likely better for toothaches without much swelling, such as nerve irritation and tooth decay. The most common OTC painkiller is acetaminophen (Tylenol, Paracetamol).


Don't place aspirin or painkillers directly against the gums because it can burn or irritate the gum tissue. It may also cause an allergic reaction if you are allergic to substances in the product.
Acetaminophen, and not aspirin or ibuprofen, should be used for infants and children with toothaches.
Anti-inflammatories and painkillers should always be short-term strategies for pain control. Taking too much of them at a time or taking them for too long increases your risk of stomach, kidney and liver problems. Visit a dentist as soon as possible before the problem gets worse and more painful.;
, Sparingly apply an OTC antiseptic gel, cream or ointment that contains benzocaine, a mild anesthetic that causes localized numbing.Put it directly onto the achy tooth and surrounding gum tissue for temporary relief — up to a few hours usually. While the medication is absorbing into the tissue, try not to swallow much of it as it can numb the throat and cause nausea. Breathing through your mouth for a few minutes can help reduce the need to swallow.


Use caution with products containing benzocaine because it can lead to a rare condition called methemoglobinemia, which reduces the amount of oxygen the blood can carry.
Don't use benzocaine on kids younger than two years of age without medical supervision.
OTC benzocaine products are just meant for short-term use prior to seeing a dentist.

, If the toothache is caused by mouth trauma to the tooth, identify where the majority of the pain and inflammation is coming from and apply a cold compress to the outside of the cheek.Applying cold therapy is effective for swelling because it reduces blood flow by constricting (narrowing) local blood vessels. It also tends to numb the pain for a while. A cold compress can be made with crushed ice, ice cubes, frozen gel packs or a small bag of frozen veggies.


Always wrap anything frozen in a thin cloth before you apply it to skin — this will prevent skin irritation and frostbite.
Apply the cold compress for about 15 minutes three to five times daily until the inflammation/toothache subsides or fades away.
Significant trauma to the mouth and teeth should be examined by a dental professional as soon as you can make an appointment — make sure you tell the dentist it is an emergency so you can be seen right away.

, Perhaps the most simple and inexpensive way to combat some types of toothache is to swish your mouth out with some warm salty water.Swishing the water around the achy area can disinfect it and provide soothing relief. It can also help to dislodge any potentially irritating debris stuck between the teeth. Salt water also draws out some fluid from the gums that cause swelling.


Add a teaspoon of sea salt into a cup of boiling hot water and let it cool down until there's no risk of burning your mouth. Then take a mouthful and swish it around for at least 30 seconds or more before spitting it out.
Take a second mouthful to swish and also gargle with it for a few seconds before spitting it out. Repeat this procedure three to five times daily until the pain fades away or you can see a dentist.
If you don't have sea salt, then table salt is also an effective antiseptic, but it doesn't contain any trace minerals which may contribute to pain relief.
Keep in mind that the pain may return after a few days and it may be even more intense. If this is the case, see your dentist right away.

, Another traditional home remedy for alleviating toothache is applying oil of cloves (active ingredient is eugenol, a natural anesthetic).Apply the oil to a small cotton ball or piece of tissue and then place it directly onto or against the achy tooth and surrounding gums to numb the area. Biting down on the cotton ball might be more effective as it will hold it in place firmly.


Clove oil needs to be used carefully because it's pretty strong and can irritate sensitive gums/tongues/lips if poured directly onto them.
Oil of cloves is found in virtually all health food stores and most mainstream pharmacies.
As an alternative, consider using some powdered clove or a whole clove on the tooth. Chew the clove to release its oil and numb the area.

, For some people, toothaches can be caused by exposure to very hot or cold foods and beverages.The nerve roots are overly sensitive and can generate pain with sensations at the extreme ends of the spectrum. As such, avoid drinking hot coffee and teas, slushy drinks and beverages with ice. Don't chew on ice if you have a toothache — it might help with any inflammation, but it will likely also irritate the nerve roots and increase the pain. Avoid hot soups, stews and casseroles, at least until they've cooled down.


The first sign of tooth decay may be pain sensations in teeth while eating something exceptionally hot or cold.
In addition to ice cubes, crunching on hard nuts, seeds and beans can also exacerbate toothaches and potentially cause more damage to broken teeth.

, In addition to extreme temperatures (hot/cold), excessively sweet foods and beverages can also cause or acerbate toothaches.It's the refined sugar that can further irritate decay from cavities and exposed nerve roots, so fruits are usually okay to eat. On the other hand, don't eat candy floss, toffee, chocolate bars, fudge, donuts, ice cream or really sweet baked goods. Avoid drinking soda pop and sweetened iced tea or coffee drinks.


Hard candy can be a ""double whammy"" to toothaches: very sweet and hard enough to do damage to cracked teeth or poor dental work.
Even healthy snacks, such as granola bars, can be problematic for toothaches due to the honey, sweet raisins and dates, and hard nuts.

, Not every little twinge of pain in your mouth requires a dental exam, but many toothaches don't go away and get progressively worse with time. As such, schedule an appointment with your dentist if you have: tooth pain that persists for more than a few days; signs of an infection, such as lots of swelling, increased pain when you bite, red inflamed gums and/or the presence of white pus mixed with blood; trouble breathing or swallowing; any kind of fever combined with the pain.Your dentist will examine your mouth and likely take dental x-rays. Cavities, abscesses, gingivitis, cracked teeth and uneven wear are all common causes of pain that can be treated at your dentist's office.
Tell your dentist if you or your child had any recent mouth trauma.

, Tooth decay happens when the enamel is destroyed by bacteria and other factors, such as excessive acidity and wear. Pits or cavities appear in teeth and achy or sharp pain develops when the nerves are irritated. If your dentist sees a cavity, they will recommend filling it. Fillings restore teeth damaged by decay back to their normal function and shape. Materials used for fillings include gold, porcelain, composite white resins and amalgams (alloys of mercury, silver, copper, tin and zinc).Before you get a filling, your dentist will first remove the decayed part and sanitize the area. You'll get an injection of anesthetic to kill the pain.
Your toothache may also be caused by a previous filling that's come loose or cracked and allowed more bacteria in.
There are growing health concerns regarding the use of amalgam fillings (due to the mercury content), so ask your dentist what's the best material for your long-term health.

, Root canals are often necessary when the pulp (soft tissue inside the root canal) becomes inflamed or infected.The inflammation or infection has many potential causes: bacterial decay, too many dental procedures, and/or trauma to the tooth. If pulp infection is left untreated, it can cause pain or lead to an abscess (larger infection that involves pus).


In addition to a moderate-to-severe toothache, other signs that your may need a root canal include: tenderness with chewing, fever, discoloration of the tooth, being unable to open your mouth (trismus), or tenderness in nearby lymph nodes.
There is some controversy surrounding root canals because it's very difficult to completely sterilize a root-canaled (root-filled) tooth, which can provide protected space for bacteria to grow and release toxins into the bloodstream.
There are a variety of root canal procedures, so ask your dentist about the pros and cons of their technique.

, Sometimes an achy tooth has to be pulled (extracted) if it's damaged and/or decayed too severely.This usually isn't a problem with a young child who still has their milk teeth, because the permanent teeth will simply grow in and fill the void eventually. With adults, it's a more serious procedure, although crowns, caps, dentures and artificial teeth are advanced enough that most people never feel or notice a difference (aside from no more pain!).


Some teeth (such as wisdom teeth) are not as essential for chewing or as cosmetically important, so these can be pulled without much concern; however, you should make every effort to save the teeth at the front of your mouth.
Health insurance plans don't often include the entire cost of dental care, so make sure to check with your provider.

Sleep bruxism is the condition of doing this at night. It is often related to daily stress. However, bruxism may also be due a general or local condition such as occlusal (bite) problems. Some people do grind or clench their teeth during the day, but bruxism often occurs at night when the person is asleep. Because of this, it can often be difficult to self-diagnose bruxism.;
, Teeth grinding occurs at night, so you should check in the morning to see if you have any symptoms. It can be difficult to figure out that you grind your teeth on your own, but here are some signs that may indicate that you do grind your teeth at night:A dull, constant headache.
A sore jaw caused by the masseter muscle hurting (pain when you chew).
Audible teeth grinding sounds as you're falling asleep.
Tooth sensitivity to heat, cold, or brushing.
Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis).
Wounds on the inside of the cheeks (from biting).
Worn teeth (surfaces look different than usual).

, If you sleep in the same bed as a loved one, simply ask him or her if he has ever heard you grinding your teeth in your sleep. Ask him to wake up earlier than you or go to bed later than you and to look out for any signs of teeth grinding. If this person wakes up in the middle of the night, he should also look out for those symptoms.


If you sleep on your own but really want to confirm that you're grinding your teeth along with checking for the symptoms, then you can consider recording yourself while you sleep and listening for any grinding sounds.

, If you suspect that you have been grinding your teeth, consult your dentist. He or she will be able to examine your mouth and jaw for signs of bruxism like jaw tenderness or worn-down teeth. Once you find out that you have bruxism, there are some home remedies that you can try as well as some professional treatments, that can help treat your condition. The dentist will also check to make sure that you are not suffering from some other ailments that cause similar pain such as:Dental disorders that can usually cause trismus, or lockjaw.
Ear disorders or infections.
TMJ or TMD (Temporomandibular disorders).
A side-effect of a medication.

, Stress is one major cause of teeth grinding, so you should aim to relieve your stress. You can relieve the stress in your life by attending stress counseling, exercising, or meditating. You may also consider looking into natural remedies to reduce stress. There is also a large variety of tea plants, like chamomile and lavender, which can calm you down before bed time. Here are some other ways to reduce your stress:Eliminate any major sources of stress in your life. If you're stressed out because of an unbearable roommate or a terrible relationship, it's time to get these negative sources out of your life and move on.
Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. This will give you more energy to deal with your daily life.
Have fun with friends. Make time to laugh, be silly, and just do nothing with your friends. This will help you unwind.
Eat well. Eating three well-balanced and healthy meals each day will make you feel more balanced and less irritable. Make sure that your meals contain some raw fruits or vegetables to exercise your during the day. This may help to reduce teeth grinding at night.

, Stop drinking soda, coffee, and energy drinks and try not to eat too much chocolate. Caffeine is a stimulant which will make it more difficult for you to relax your mind and the muscles of your jaw, especially at night making you agitated throughout the day.

, Alcohol is a depressant which will make it more difficult for you to sleep healthily. Teeth grinding tends to get worse after alcohol consumption. Though alcohol may make it easier for you to fall asleep, it will make you sleep a less restful, more shallow sleep, which will increase your teeth grinding., Stop yourself from stress-related habits that have to do with your mouth. Chewing non-food items is a sign of an increased stress level. For example, if you tend to chew on pencils or pens when you are stressed out, you should eliminate that habit.If this is particularly challenging, you can chew gum or suck on a mint whenever you have the urge to chew on non-foods, and slowly wean yourself off of them.

, If you notice that your jaw is tense or that your teeth are gritted together, practice relaxing the jaw by placing the tip of your tongue between your teeth., Calcium and magnesium are necessary for muscle function and nervous system health. If you don't have enough, you can have problems with clenching, tension, and other muscle problems.Remember that your heart is also a muscle and it can suffer from stress or lack of calcium.


This home remedy can take up to five weeks to work., It is important to reduce stress before bed so that you're more relaxed during the night and therefore less likely to grind your teeth. Here are some ways to relax before bed and have a more restful sleep:Massage the muscles in your neck, shoulders, and face before you go to sleep.Use your fingers and palms to massage the sides of your head, forehead and jaw in calming circular motions.
Soak a washcloth in hot water and hold it against your cheek in front of your earlobe. This will help your muscles to relax and unclench.
Take a warm washcloth and hold it over your whole face. This will both help your muscles relax and put you in a calmer state of mind.
Turn on soothing music or white noise to help achieve a calm state of mind as you drift off to sleep.
Read in bed for at least half an hour before you sleep. This will help you get ready for sleep.
Turn off the television, computer, and any bright lights at least an hour before bed. Minimize your sensory experience before you fall asleep.

, If your teeth grinding persists, you should go in to see a dentist as chronic teeth grinding can result in fracturing, loosening, or loss of teeth. If you grind your teeth too consistently, you may even need bridges, crowns, root canals, implants, partial dentures, or even complete dentures. Braces may also be an option if your teeth are misaligned and causing teeth grinding due to an unequal distribution of biting forces. Your dentist will be able to assess which treatments will work best for you. Here are some treatments your dentist may recommend depending on the severity of your symptoms:Muscle relaxants. Bruxism is very rarely treated with medication, but sometimes muscle relaxants and botox can be prescribed to loosen the jaw and prevent teeth grinding.You may also get good results from a low quantity of botox injection in your muscles or by using a TENS machine.
Having crowns or onlays put onto your teeth. If your bruxism has caused damage to the teeth, your bite may be out of alignment. If this is the case, your dentist can use onlays or crowns to reshape the surface of your teeth in order to repair your bite., Your dentist will most likely recommend a mouth guard or splint at night to protect your teeth from the wear and damage caused by grinding. Here is some more information about mouth guards and splints:Mouth guards can be custom-fitted by your dentist or can be purchased over the counter. However, mouth guards tend to be soft and can dislodge during teeth grinding. A custom-made mouthguard is significantly more expensive than an over-the-the counter one (though much of the cost may be covered by your insurance), but it will fit your teeth more easily and much more correctly than a non-custom mouth guard, and will also create less discomfort.
Self-adjusting mouth guards made of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) are an affordable alternative to try, before committing to the investment of a custom made mouth guard. These mouth guards can easily be molded in hot water and thus adjusted to your bite. Dental splints are constructed of hard acrylic and fit over either your upper or lower teeth. They are also worn at night in order to protect your teeth from being damaged. However, keep in mind that this is just for protecting your teeth. It rarely eliminates bruxism.

, If bruxism has affected how your teeth look and you wish to change that, you can see a cosmetic dentist to discuss options. If your teeth have been shortened or ground down by teeth-grinding, a cosmetic dentist can rebuild and reshape the teeth using dental crowns or veneers.These treatments will restore the look of your teeth so that they are longer and look more even.

Determine what portion of the cost, if any, your insurance will cover.,
Discuss your options with your dentist.,
Ask your dentist if they discount multiple implants.,
Find a dentist that performs all the steps.",How to Afford Dental Implants1," Dental insurance doesn't often cover a large percentage of dental procedure costs, but some plans do cover a fraction of the overall cost. Although it may not be a lot, every penny the insurance company will pay will help in the long run.


Call your insurance company to discuss the best way of paying for your dental implants.
It is important to determine if going to an in-network provider will affect the amount the insurance company will cover.;
, Let your dentist know if the cost of the dental implants is unattainable for you. Some dental offices that do implants may consider offering you a payment plan that would make the implants more affordable. Approach the payment office at your dentist and see if they allow such plans.Scheduling multiple implants at once is recommended to promote the healing process and for improving benefits for a long term result. Scheduling multiple implants at once might also help you save on the cost of office visits, anesthesia, and other charges.
Asking your dentist for a temporary solution until you can afford to get the implants is also a possibility.

, Some dental offices have packages available to help make implants more affordable for their patients. Inquire if they have packages available, or if they provide discounts with multiple implants.

, Dental implants involve many steps, and many times require both a surgeon and a dentist. If you can find a dentist who performs both the surgical and restorative work, you may save money, and there is one person who takes all the responsibility for the entire procedure, which is really important. You also save time this way because the provider is able to combine the visits.

Assemble your materials.,
Shine a light down your throat.,
Flex your tonsils.,
Prepare the cotton swab.,
Poke at the stones gently with your cotton swab.,
Rinse with water and repeat.,
Check for any hidden stones.,
Remove stubborn stones carefully.",How to Remove Tonsil Stones (Tonsilloliths)1," Get together the cotton swabs and other necessary components:


Cotton swabs
Toothbrush
A mirror
Flashlight, flashlight app, or lamp that you can direct.
Running water.;
, Open your mouth and shine the light into your mouth. Do this in front of a mirror so that you can locate the tonsil stones.

, Close off, or flex, your throat muscles while sticking out your tongue. Go ""Ahh,"" and tighten the muscles in the back of your throat. Do this while holding your breath, almost as if you were gargling water. This should push your tonsils forward so you can see them better.

, Run water and dab the cotton swab into it. This will make it softer and less irritating for your throat.Don't put it down, or you risk contamination. Minimize the contact your cotton swab makes with any germ-carrying surface, including your hands. When you remove the stones, shake them off into the sink without touching your swab to any surface, or wipe them on a clean paper towel.


If you touch something like the sink or counter with your swab, trade it for a new one.

, Press or poke at your stone until you dislodge it. Carry it out of your mouth on the cotton swab.


Be very gentle, as bleeding may occur. Although a little bit of bleeding is normal, try as much as you can to minimize the bleeding.Cuts and wounds can get infected by the same bacteria in your mouth that cause tonsil stones.
Rinse if bleeding occurs, and brush your teeth and tongue as soon as it stops.

, Rinse with water and move on to the next stone. Rinse especially if your saliva feel sticky, which sometimes occurs after the throat has been poked. As sticky saliva starts forming, drink water to thin it out.

, After you have extracted all the stones you can see, place your thumb into your neck under your jaw, and your (clean) index finger into your mouth right beside your tonsil and gently try to squeeze any remaining stones to the openings (like squeezing out toothpaste). If no stones appear, don't assume they aren't there. Some craters are very deep and it is sometimes hard to get them all., If you have a stone that won't come out with a cotton swab, it may be especially deep. Don't force it, as this may cause bleeding. Use the back of your toothbrush to gently nudge it until it loosens, then remove it with the swab or with the toothbrush.If the stones still won't come out, you can try gargling with mouthwash for a few days and then trying again.
If that doesn't work, you may want to try using an oral irrigator. If this doesn't work, you can increase the stream a little.
Keep in mind that some people have a strong gag reflex and will not tolerate poking.

Numb your soft palate.,
Squeeze your thumb.,
Put a little table salt on your tongue.",How to Suppress the Gag Reflex1," When an object touches the soft palate, it can trigger the gag reflex. Use an over-the-counter (OTC) throat-numbing spray like Chloraseptic to desensitize your soft palate. Alternatively, you could gently apply a topical OTC analgesic with benzocaine using a cotton swab. The effects should last for about an hour, and your palate will be less reactive.Throat-numbing sprays rarely cause side effects. However, you should stop using it if you experience vomiting, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, and/or stomach cramps.Use the benzocaine remedy with caution. The cotton swab could trigger a gag or choking reflex. Other possible side effects include fatigue, weakness, skin irritation around the ears, blue skin around the lips and fingertips, and shortness of breath.You should avoid the benzocaine remedy entirely if you’re allergic to benzocaine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about interactions with other OTC medications, vitamins/supplements, or herbal remedies you might be taking.;
, Close your left thumb in your left hand and make a fist. Position your thumb under your fingers. Squeeze tightly without causing yourself too much pain. This trick puts pressure on a point in your palm that controls the gag reflex., Moisten the tip of your finger, dip it into some salt, and touch the salt to your tongue. Salt activates the taste buds on the front of your tongue and sets off a chain reaction that temporarily suppresses your gag reflex.Another way to do this is to put a teaspoon (0.99 metric tsp) of salt in a glass of water and rinse your mouth with that. Don't forget to spit!

You want to make sure you are getting the best quality care for the best price. Don't stop at dentists, though; periodontists and oral surgeons also offer dental implants. Make sure you have looked at all your available options.


Widen the net for where you get your implants. If you live in a large city, try finding a quality, recommended dentist in a suburb. Many times, dentists in smaller areas will charge less than those in large cities.
Look for new practices. Newly opened practices may charge less as they build their reputation and client lists. Be sure to check references, like where they went to school and where they worked previously, their type of experience and methods they use, along with reviews from people in the community who have been to the new practice.

, A dental implant center specializes in this kind of oral surgery. The center might charge less because dental implants are what they do on a regular basis, while your dentist might charge more because it is a special surgery. These centers also usually strive to provide lower treatment cost by having one surgical team to work on your mouth, instead of different specialists who charge separate fees.

, Many college and universities have dental schools that provide dental care at reduced costs. Most of these dental schools have recently graduated students working alongside experienced dentists and professors.They may even have better medical equipment, such as computers that they use for guided surgery.

, Try health care financing, like CareCredit or Springstone.Some companies offer special financing for health care related costs at no interest or low, fixed interest rates. Usually these financing option require decent credit scores. If your credit score is low, you can get one or two cosigners on the application to get approved.

, Some organizations offer aid to low-income households who need dental care. Some non-profits and dental associations provide aid to certain demographics, such as people with disabilities, women and children, and others.


The American Dental Association provides a list by state of local dental societies that can help you find affordable payment options., If your insurance doesn't pay for implants, there are dental insurance alternative plans that offer implant coverage. These plans usually require you to use dentists in their network.

, Dental tourism has become a popular method for high priced dental work. Dental implants are cheaper in other countries, such as Mexico, Hungary, Italy, Costa Rica, and many Asian countries. Sometimes, the same dental implants can cost half of the price it would in the US.


Dental tourism should be practiced with caution. Different government health standards means that not every dentist will be equal. Research the regulations, licensing standards, procedures, and the dental office carefully before getting work done. Get an international dental referral if at all possible.
Also, you need to make sure that the implant you get is a high quality one because there are many companies on the market and dental implants have also started to be manufactured in China. Another risk you need to consider is that you may end up spending more money if the treatment doesn't go as planned and complications appear.

, If dental implants are something you really want and need, consider making that a top priority. Instead of buying a new car or taking a vacation, use that money to help pay for your dental health.

, Once you have determined how much it will cost to get dental implants, start setting aside a designated amount each week or month until you save the desired amount. Saving in small increments may help the overall cost seem less overwhelming. Calculate how long it will take to save up enough money for your dental implants and schedule your appointment for that time.

, Don't feel like you need to have all of the dental work done at the same time. If you can only afford to have the teeth extracted at this time, then stop there until you can afford the rest. Dental work is often done in stages, so it is feasible that you may need to pay for one stage at a time until you have completed the process. Even if it takes an extended amount of time, you won't be burdened with the whole bill at once.


Dental implants take time to heal in the bone and this process takes at least four to six months. This means you have plenty of time to gather the money for the prosthetic part.

, If you are in serious need of dental implants but still can't raise the money, think about starting a campaign to raise the money. Websites such as Indiegogo and GoFundMe allow you to raise money for health care. After setting up the account, you can share via social media so friends and family members can donate if they are willing.

Buy an oral irrigator.,
Use the irrigator on its lowest setting.,
Help your stones along with a cotton swab or toothbrush.",How to Remove Tonsil Stones (Tonsilloliths)2," Oral irrigators, such as water-picks, can be used to push tonsil stones out of their cavities.Test it out briefly on your tonsils before you buy it—if the spray is too strong, and hurts in any way, don't use it to get out your stones.

, Place the irrigator inside the mouth but not touching the stone, and switch on the oral irrigator on the lowest setting. Direct the stream of water onto one visible tonsil stone, keeping it steady until the stone has been dislodged.

, If the irrigator is loosening the stones but not removing them, alternate using the pic and using a cotton swab or the back of your toothbrush.


Repeat steps for each visible tonsil stone. Remember to be gentle as you pressurize the stones away with the water.

Gargle with mouthwash after eating.,
Try it with warm water and salt.,
Invest in an oxygenating mouthwash.",How to Remove Tonsil Stones (Tonsilloliths)3," Since tonsil stones often form after leftover food gets stuck in tonsil craters, it's prudent to gargle with mouthwash after eating. Not only will mouthwash improve the health of your teeth and gums, it will also help dislodge tiny bits of food before they become a meal for tonsil stone-creating bacteria.


Make sure to use an alcohol-free mouthwash.

, Mix one teaspoon of salt along with six ounces of water, stirring until incorporated. Gargle the salt water with your head tilted back. Salt water could dislodge bits of food from the crater while helping to soothe any discomfort caused by tonsillitis, which sometimes accompanies tonsil stones., Oxygenating mouthwashes contain chlorine dioxide and natural zinc compounds. Oxygen itself hinders bacterial growth, making oxygenating mouthwashes helpful for treating and preventing tonsil stones.Oxygenating mouthwashes are very strong, however, and therefore should only be used once or twice per week to avoid overuse. Supplement your natural mouthwash regimen with oxygenating mouthwash.

Talk to your doctor about getting a tonsillectomy.,
Consider a course of antibiotics for persistent or severe tonsil stones.,
Ask about laser treatment.",How to Remove Tonsil Stones (Tonsilloliths)4," A tonsillectomy is a relatively simple and effective procedure. It is relatively low-risk, and the recovery period is often short, with throat pain and minor bleeding being the most common concerns.If your doctor is concerned about your medical history, age, or other factors, they may advise you to go another route.
Keep in mind that a tonsillectomy would only be recommended for someone with recurrent or very stubborn or complicated tonsil stones.
You can also ask your doctor about removing your tonsil stones. Your doctor may be able to remove them using special irrigation equipment.

, Different antibiotics, such as penicillin or erythromycin, may be used to treat tonsil stones, but they fail to reverse the underlying cause of tonsil stones, which is food being caught in the tonsils. There may be a relapse, and antibiotics may also have adverse side-effects. Most antibiotics kill off beneficial bacteria in the mouth and gut which would help do battle against the problem bacteria., The tissue that deep tonsil pockets are made of can be removed via laser. Laser resurfacing smoothes out the surface of the tonsils so that they no longer have pockets and craters. This procedure is not without risks of its own, however."

Find out where your gag reflex starts.,
Brush your tongue right where your gag begins.,
Increase the brushing area.,
Move the brush farther back.,
Desensitize everyday.",How to Suppress the Gag Reflex2," You can do this by using your toothbrush to brush your tongue. The point nearest to the front of your tongue that makes you gag is where you should concentrate.You might be more likely to gag earlier in the day. Try to schedule the gag-inducing activity for the late afternoon or evening instead.
Don’t stick your fingers in your mouth. You might induce vomiting.

, Yes, you'll gag, and it will be unpleasant, but it won’t last long. Spend about ten seconds brushing that area (and gagging). Then call it a night.Repeat the process over the next few nights in the exact same spot. Your gag should gradually decrease each time you do it.

, Once you can touch your toothbrush to the original starting point without gagging, it's time to move the toothbrush farther back. Try brushing ¼ to ½ inch (6mm–12mm) behind where your gag used to begin. Repeat the process as you did in the first spot., Do this each time you make progress desensitizing small areas in front. Keep moving it farther back until you've reached the farthest visible point of your tongue. Eventually, the toothbrush will come into contact with your soft palate, if it hasn't already., Be persistent. This process takes about a month to complete. Afterward, you should be able to have a doctor swab the back of your throat without gagging. You might have to repeat the process from time to time, as your reflex might return if you don't.A good way to keep yourself desensitized is to brush your tongue regularly. Not only will it help quell the gag reflex, it’ll also give you fresher breath!

Practice some form of meditation.,
Hum.,
Raise one leg slightly.,
Listen to music.",How to Suppress the Gag Reflex3," Ask your dentist if you can wear earplugs to drown out the sound of equipment they’ll be using during your appointment. This will allow you to focus on calming thoughts and forget about the activity going on near your throat. If you think you might fall asleep, as for a bite block to prop your jaw open., Humming keeps you breathing, which is essential for relaxation. It’s also difficult to gag and hum at the same time. Try this at the dentist’s office while you’re getting x-rays or having impressions of your teeth taken., Do this while you’re sitting or lying in the dentist’s chair. Concentrate on keeping your leg raised. Switch legs if your first leg gets tired. This trick will distract you from the work going on in your mouth and near your soft palate.Word of warning! This trick won’t work so well if you rest one leg on top of the other.

, Ask your dentist if you can play your MP3 player during your cleaning or filling. Play songs that make your mind wander or interesting podcasts that demand your full attention. Either way, you’ll be too busy focusing on audio to notice what the dentist is doing."

Start by applying denture cream to your upper denture.,
Place three to four dabs on your lower denture.,
Put the dentures in your mouth and press them together firmly to keep them in place.,
Use only one application a day.",How to Apply Denture Adhesive1," Zinc is often overused in denture adhesives, so much so that zinc-free paste adhesive is now available. Using a paste adhesive that contains zinc combined with a diet high in zinc can lead to excessive zinc in your body and possible health issues.If you use a paste adhesive that contains zinc, only use it as directed on the label and do not use too much adhesive.;
, Before you apply adhesive, you need to clean your dentures under running water and your normal denture cleanser. Then, pat them dry. Dry dentures will help the paste adhesive to stay attached to the dentures, and to your gums.This will ensure a very stable bite and will prevent food from getting underneath your dentures.

, Do not use more denture adhesive than directed on the label. Always begin with a small amount of adhesive so you don’t put too much on your dentures.Apply three to four dabs of the paste the size of a pencil eraser to the upper denture, equally distributing the paste on the inside surface. Do not apply the paste too close to the edge of your denture.

, The dabs should be no bigger than a pencil eraser and should not be too close to the edge of your denture. Again, make sure the dabs are evenly spaced along the inside surface of the denture., If any of the adhesive oozes out on the sides of the dentures, you have used too much adhesive. You may need to remove the dentures, clean off the adhesive and reapply, using less on the upper and lower dentures., If you put the adhesive on your dentures properly, you should not need to reapply the adhesive throughout the day.A standard 40 g tube of adhesive should last at least four weeks, a 47 g tube should last five weeks, and a 70 g tube should last at least eight weeks. Avoid overusing the denture adhesive or using too much every day.

Sprinkle the powder evenly onto the surface of either denture.,
Place your dentures in your mouth.",How to Apply Denture Adhesive2," Zinc is often overused in denture adhesives. If you have a diet that is high in zinc and/or take vitamins containing zinc, and also use a denture powder containing the mineral, you can experience serious health problems, including nerve damage.Look for powders that are specifically marked asa being zinc-free.


If you use a powder adhesive that contains zinc, only use it as directed on the label and do not use too much adhesive. Your prosthodontist may also be able to recommend a powder denture adhesive that does not contain zinc.

, Use your usual denture cleanser to give your dentures a good clean before you apply the adhesive.Keep your dentures moist and do not dry them off. The moisture will help the powder adhesive stick to your dentures.

, The key is to distribute the powder in an even layer over your dentures. Shake or vibrate the dentures in your hand to ensure the powder gets on both dentures. Think of this as similar to flouring a cake pan., Use your thumb and forefinger to press the upper and lower dentures into your mouth.Powder adhesives may not make your dentures stay in your mouth as long as paste adhesives. Usually, adhesives are more effective on your upper dentures than on your lower dentures. Liquids and foods can loosen your lower denture, so you may want to consider using a paste adhesive for your lower denture.

You can then try to use the paste adhesive again, or try a different type of adhesive.You will also need to remove your dentures at night before going to bed. You should clean your dentures well and place them in a container with water or a commercial denture cleanser.

, Before you remove your dentures, you need to moisten your mouth and remove any food debris from the day., Pull gently at your lower denture and move it back and forth in a rocking motion. It should slowly release from your gums., It may be more difficult to remove your upper denture, as there is a higher surface area for the denture to adhere to.Use your thumb to press against the front teeth. Then, press upward and outward with your thumb towards your nose. Your upper denture should dislodge and come out in your hand.
You can also grab it on the lateral sides and go as deep as possible with your index fingers, then pull it down vertically.
Do not use any other objects besides your fingers and fingernails to remove your dentures as this could lead to injury.
If you cannot get your dentures out and you do not want to sleep with them in or keep them in overnight, you may need to seek medical care at the nearest hospital or clinic. You can also contact a 24-hour dental service for assistance.

, Don’t leave the adhesive residue on your dentures at the end of the day, as your dentures may not adhere properly the following day when you try to put them in.Use your denture cleanser to clean your dentures. Then, combine hot water and toothpaste in a bowl. Use a soft bristled toothbrush to remove the adhesive residue from your dentures.
You should also use the toothbrush to clean any adhesive residue from your gums, your tongue, and your mouth.

Lay off the wine.,
Cut out soft drinks.,
Run from sports drinks.,
Limit fruit juices.,
Avoid diuretic drinks.",How to Protect Your Teeth from Acid Wear1," Wine is highly acidic (both red and white), which of course wears on the enamel of your teeth. If it is a sweet wine there is also a significant amount of sugar in it. The combination of these is not a good thing for teeth., High in sugar and carbonated with enamel weakening CO2, soft drinks are one of those dietary disasters that provide nothing positive and are detrimental on many levels. Their high acid content strips enamel from teeth like paint thinner removing layers of paint.


Corrosive acids like phosphoric, malic, citric, and tartaric are the culprits. Clear, citrus-flavored bubbly beverages are pinpointed as the worst, dissolving enamel at a staggering 2-5 times more than colas.

, Studies have shown sports drinks are even worse for your teeth than soft drinks or energy drinks. They contain large amounts of citric acid, sugar, and caffeine, not only damaging tooth enamel but the roots as well.

, While some fruit juices and most if not all fresh squeezed juices contain a great many vitamins, they also contain a lot of natural sugars and most are high in acid content. Even OJ, the least acidic and whose processed juice is often fortified with calcium and vitamin D, should be followed up immediately with a good rinsing.Cold pressed juices often have other juices that even out the alkaline so that they are not nearly as harmful to your teeth. Make sure, however, that you check before buying so you can be sure to do what’s best for your teeth.

, These beverages, including caffeine and alcohol, cause dehydration which in turn lowers the beneficial effects of saliva. As saliva serves to protect the enamel of teeth (by creating a mineralized coating which is also a pH neutralizer), this in turn exposes teeth to damage they normally would easily avoid.

Don’t eat candy.,
Pass up vinegar-based salad dressings.,
Rinse after eating fruit.,
Reduce carbohydrates.,
Practice balanced eating patterns.,
Stay away from processed snack foods.,
Avoid grazing through the day.",How to Protect Your Teeth from Acid Wear2," While obvious it must be stated again: candy is not good for you or your teeth. High in sugar, it's also sticky so it seals that sugar directly to your teeth, and your saliva turns those sugars to acids. Add in the fact it has no healthy benefits whatsoever and it’s easy to see why candy should be cut from your diet., This is particularly true for children and teenagers, whose enamel is not yet mature and therefore even more susceptible to the erosion caused by the acid content of vinegar. Regardless of age, after eating foods containing vinegar it’s a great idea to wash your mouth out afterwards.Also look to avoid vinegar in places you might not consider right away, such as potato chips, sauces (especially hot sauces), and pickles. Pickles may be the worst offenders as they contain vinegar AND sugar.

, Grapefruit and lemons are the worst offenders among fresh citrus fruits due to their higher acid content. Perhaps even worse, however, are dried fruits. Not only are they high in sugars but their fibrous biology causes them to stick to teeth, wedging that sugar and acid into the cracks, crevices, and porous surfaces of teeth.


Don’t forget that tomatoes are a fruit. They also have a high acid content and can damage enamel both raw and as a sauce. Your best bet is to eat them as part of a meal so that you can enjoy their flavor and nutrients while cutting down on their acidity levels.
Some citrus fruit each day shouldn't be a problem — these fruits, after all, have a great many benefits. Just be conscious of how much you are eating and try to notice any affects on your teeth.

, Saliva breaks down carbs while you chew, turning them into enamel-eroding acid. Even healthy carbs like brown rice, whole-grains, and sweet potatoes are flagrant perpetrators. White carbohydrates are even worse — they are the most incriminated factors that produce cavities. Carbohydrates also tend to get stuck in teeth and continue to wear down enamel all day long, developing aggressive bacterial sites.

, For example, eat something that counterbalances the acidity of fruit, such as nuts, at the time of eating the fruit. This will turn enamel-wearing acids into friendly bases in your mouth, sparing your teeth the wear-and-tear.

, Most snack foods are carbohydrates in one form or another, contain sugar, and some of them are also acidic due to the presence of vinegar or other additives. So in addition to being, basically, devoid of nutritional value they also wear out the enamel on your teeth.

, If you enjoy nibbling on food all day long, you may be endangering your teeth. The best solution is to ensure that the foods that you consume are either low in acidity or are combined with foods able to counteract the acidity and reduce your need for the acidic food.


For example, consuming nuts or cheese with fruit may be one way to reduce the effects of acid wear. Nuts and dairy foods are considered helpful balancers to acidic foods.

Drink water in small amounts at regular intervals.,
Time your brushing effectively.,
Stop over-brushing your teeth.,
Rinse your mouth with baking soda.,
Use a straw.",How to Protect Your Teeth from Acid Wear3," Water is a much healthier alternative to processed drinks. In addition to helping keep your tooth enamel protected (as it is non-acidic and keeps your mouth in an alkaline state), it is great for hydration, clear skin, digestion, and delivers a host of other healthy benefits., Avoid brushing your teeth for one hour after consuming acidic food or drink. While this may seem counter-intuitive, acidic foods and drinks soften the tooth enamel and leave it prone to damage from brushing. After an hour, saliva will restore lost minerals and re-harden enamel ., Too much brushing or brushing too hard or incorrectly is abrasive and wears down your teeth. Plaque is relatively soft and could be removed with a cloth if you could reach every crack and crevice with one. Be gentle on your teeth.Use proper tooth brushing technique. At a 45-degree angle, brush up and down in short strokes. Rely on dental floss and toothpicks in between morning and evening brushing. Be sure to throw your toothbrush away once it starts to show wear; the tips become jagged and can harm tooth enamel and gums.Alternate your electric toothbrush with a manual one as the electric ones tend to scrub the surface harder due to an increased number of movements.

, To reduce the acidity in your mouth, regularly rinse thoroughly and gargle with a spoonful of baking soda (bicarbonate of soda) in water., Reduce the contact of juice and soda drinks with your teeth by drinking through a straw. This is only a minor improvement so don't rely on it as a major solution. Sometimes, however, something is better than nothing.

Avoid food and beverage triggers.,
Raise the head of your bed if symptoms interfere with sleep.,
Consider losing weight.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Eat slowly.,
Check that your stomach isn’t under undue pressure.",How to Cure Hyperacidity Naturally1," You may want to keep track of foods and beverages that cause you any problems. Write down the foods you eat and see how you feel about 1 hour of eating. If the food you ate an hour ago is bothering you, you should eliminate that from your diet.Commonly reported hyperacidity triggers include:


Citrus fruit
Caffeinated beverages
Chocolate
Tomatoes
Garlic, onions
Alcohol
Note: Most of these foods have not been studied enough to make a definitive claim.It's more important to find out what triggers your symptoms than to avoid this exact list.;
, If your bed allows for it, raise the head of it by 6 to 8 inches. Gravity will keep the acid in your stomach. Don't just pile up pillows, though. These tend to bend your neck and body in such a way that increases the pressure. It will make the hyperacidity worse., Losing weight may reduce some of the pressure on your lower esophageal sphincter, keeping stomach acid from leaking through., Decrease the amount of food you eat at any one time. This may reduce the amount of stress and pressure on your stomach., This helps your stomach digest food more easily and quickly, leaving less food in the stomach adding pressure on the LES., Pressure will increase the discomfort of hyperacidity. You can experience excess pressure because of hiatal hernias (when the upper part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm), pregnancy, constipation, or being overweight.Don't wear clothes that constrict your stomach or abdomen."

Eat an apple.,
Drink ginger tea.,
Adjust meal habits.,
Avoid stress.,
Try herbal treatments if you have related bowel conditions.,
Take a probiotic supplement.",How to Cure Hyperacidity Naturally2," Many people with hyperacidity settle their stomach by eating an apple. Apples are generally safe for this condition, so why not give the wisdom of the crowd a go?Just remember this is anecdotal evidence, and claims about apples having antacid properties are completely false., While there's no solid evidence behind its use as a hyperacidity treatment, ginger does seem to soothe the stomach.Either get ginger tea bags or better yet, cut up about 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger, add boiling water, steep for about 5 minutes and drink. Do this anytime during the day, but especially about 20-30 minutes before meals.


Ginger can also help with nausea and vomiting. Ginger tea is considered safe for pregnant women., Although not definite, many specialists believe that late night eating can make symptoms worse.Don't eat for 2-3 hours before bedtime to reduce the risk of food putting pressure on your lower esophageal sphincter (LES) as you sleep.

, Based on early research, stress makes reflux symptoms feel subjectively worse but does not affect the objective condition.For your own comfort, identify situations that you find stressful and exhausting. Find ways to avoid those situations or prepare for them with various relaxing techniques.


Start incorporating meditation, yoga, or just regular naps into your daily routine. You could also try deep breathing, acupuncture, getting a massage, taking a warm bath, or even saying a series of simple, affirmative statements in front of the mirror.

, None of these are proven treatments. However, if your hyperacidity symptoms are related to ulcerative colitis or bowel inflammation, there's a little evidence that these could help. Do not rely on these as your main treatment.


Drink 1/2 cup of aloe vera juice. You can drink this throughout the day, but don't drink more than 1 to 2 cups a day. Aloe vera can act as a laxative.
Drink fennel tea. Crush about a teaspoon of fennel seeds and add a cup of boiled water. Add honey to taste and drink 2-3 cups a day about 20 minutes before meals. Fennel helps settle the stomach and decreases the acid levels.Take slippery elm. Slippery elm can be taken as a drink or as a tablet. As a liquid, you'll want to drink about 3 to 4 ounces. As a tablet, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Slippery elm is known to soothe and coat irritated tissues.Take DGL tablets. Deglycyrrhizinated licorice root (DGL) comes in chewable tablets. The taste might take some getting use to. But, it works very well to heal the stomach and control hyperacidity. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dosage. You'll usually take 2 to 3 tablets every 4-6 hours., Probiotics are mixtures of ""good"" bacteria normally found in your gut. They may include a yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii or cultures of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium, all naturally found in your intestines. While studies so far show generally improved bowel health, it's not yet possible to make specific claims.For the simplest way to get your probiotics, eat yogurt with ""active cultures"".

Know the symptoms.,
Consider using medications.,
Take antacids.,
Use H2 blockers.,
Try Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs).",How to Cure Hyperacidity Naturally4," Before starting remedies for hyperacidity, be sure that that’s what you’re really experiencing. Symptoms of hyperacidity include:Heartburn
A sour taste in the mouth
Bloating
Dark or black stools (from internal bleeding)
Burping or hiccups that won’t stop
Nausea
Dry cough
Dysphagia (a narrowed esophagus that feels as if there is food stuck in your throat)

, If you experience chronic hyperacidity, are pregnant or nursing, or otherwise, have any concerns, see your doctor. If you've tried treating your hyperacidity naturally, but aren't feeling relief, you may want to try medication. Medication can decrease the amount of acid in your stomach. Untreated or long-term hyperacidity can cause esophagitis, esophageal bleeding, ulcers, and a condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can increase your risk for esophageal cancer.


If you are taking medications that may be causing your hyperacidity, call your physician to discuss dosage or medication adjustment.

, These are available over-the-counter (OTC) and neutralize the acid. Antacids usually give short-term relief. If you still need antacids after two weeks, you should call your physician. Long-term use of antacids can affect mineral balance, affect the kidneys and cause diarrhea.


Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and don’t overdo it. Even antacids, if overdone, can cause some problems.

, These reduce the stomach’s secretion of acid. H2 blockers include cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid) and ranitidine (Zantac). They're available in lower doses OTC, or your physician can prescribe higher doses. If you are using OTC H2 blockers, follow manufacturer’s instructions. Side effects of H2 blockers include:Constipation.
Diarrhea.
Dizziness.
Headache.
Hives.
Nausea or vomiting.
Problems with urination.

, They also block acid production by the stomach. Examples of PPIs include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant) and omeprazole/ sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid).If you are using OTC PPIs, follow manufacturer’s instructions.

Do not eat poorly cooked food.,
Avoid unsanitary areas.,
Recognize accidental transmission.",How to Avoid an H. Pylori Bacterial Infection1," No matter where you live or are traveling to, you should avoid food that is poorly cooked as it increases your risk of food poisoning and other causes of infection. Poorly cooked food is a major conduit of H. Pylori because the food is not heated to a temperature high enough to kill the bacteria. This can be hard to detect, but if your food is cold or raw, avoid eating it because it could possibly be a carrier of the bacteria. Avoid food that has been inadequately cleaned, like vegetables, or handled, like meats and fish. Improperly cleaned and mishandled foods also increase the risk of all types of foodborne infection.
You should also cook any food you make yourself to a high temperature as well. Since you may not know where all the food came from that you are cooking, you need to be certain you cook it well. This way you can avoid contaminating yourself with the bacteria as well.;
, One of the major ways that the H. Pylori bacteria is transmitted is through unsanitary conditions. This includes food and beverage production, living conditions, and activity areas as well. Food that is cooked in a poorly sanitized setting can transmit the bacteria from one individual to another. Avoid roadside locations or food carts where it is evident that there is no proper facilities for hand washing or cleaning utensils.


You should also avoid living arrangements near unclean water sources, sewage locations, and other areas where unclean and dirty water may be prevalent.
Avoid places where people don't use gloves, where there are inadequate restroom and cleaning facilities, or places where workers touch money and other people and then handle food or merchandise., The main way that the bacteria is transmitted is through the fecal-oral route or the oral-oral route. This means that food, water, and objects are contaminated with the bacteria because of poor sewage practices and poor hygiene. Since many individuals do not know they are carrying the bacteria, it can easily be transferred from one individual to another. Accidental transmission often occurs when a person is carrying the bacteria and does not practice proper hand washing practices.


The bacteria can be found in saliva, feces, vomit, and other gastric and oral secretions. Any of these substances from a carrier getting into your mouth, or if you touch your hand to your mouth after touching something with the bacteria on it, will increase the risk of infection with H. Pylori. "
"
Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Eat in sanitary places.,
Stop interacting with those infected.,
Get tested.,
Get adequate nutrition.",How to Avoid an H. Pylori Bacterial Infection2," Since the main form of transmission of the H. Pylori bacteria is through touch, you should always practice proper personal hygiene and hand washing. You should wash your hands thorough and often, especially after using the restroom or before handling food.


Proper hand washing starts with warm water, at least 120 degrees, and a decent sized helping of liquid soap. Place the soap in your hands and wet them briefly. Wash them for a total of 15-30 seconds, scrubbing around your fingers, along the front and back of your palms, and around your fingernails. Then rinse them in the warm water and dry them with a clean, sanitized towel or clean paper towel., When you are in a non-industrialized nation, eat only in restaurants with sanitation standards similar to an industrialized country's standard of sanitation. Kitchen utensils should be washed in hot water with antibacterial soap. Once the utensils are cleansed, they may become reinfected if handled by a carrier who has touched his mouth or not properly washed his hands after using the restroom. Because of this, ensure that you only eat at places where employees wear gloves as well.


The use of hand sanitizer is helpful in these questionable scenarios., If you are married to or in a relationship with someone infected or if you have a family member who has H. Pylori, you should be very careful with your interactions with them. If you are married or dating someone infected, do not kiss them or engage in any sort of sexual activity until they have been treated for the infection. Also keep their toothbrush, cups, and utensils in a different area so the bacteria cannot be transmitted through saliva.


You should also not let anyone in your family with the bacterial infection prepare food, serve drinks, or touch things that are consumed so they cannot transmit the bacteria accidentally through touch or other contamination., If a family member gets sick with the bacterial infection, you need to get checked as well. In terms of prevention, eradication is a large part of avoiding the bacteria in the future. Since it is spread by poor hygiene and sanitary conditions within families, it is recommended that, to eradicate H. Pylori from your family, all family members get tested for the H. Pylori bacteria.


If a family member is positive, they must be treated then retested for the bacteria after 4 weeks of treatment. Reinfection can occur and start the cycle over if you do not make sure that the bacteria is eradicated from the entire household. , One great way to help prevent a H. Pylori infection is to eat a balanced diet. This helps you stay healthy and fight off the bacteria if it gets into your system. You need to maintain a diet containing adequate proportions of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water to sustain good health. The exact proportions of each type of food vary based on your weight, gender, and activity level. However, a good place to start is to maintain a calorie intake of approximately 2000 calories a day.


The majority of your calories should come from fresh fruit, vegetables, legumes, grains, and low fat proteins.
Even with attempts at a balanced diet, 67% of dieticians recommend daily multivitamins to fill nutritional gaps in diet that are not being met by food alone.Ensure that you get adequate vitamin C intake, which is suggested as 1000mg daily. Eat citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits, as well as green leafy vegetables to get more vitamin C in your diet."
"
Drink plenty of water.,
Stimulate saliva.,
Avoid foods and beverages that trigger dry mouth.",How to Prevent Dry Mouth1," Drink water and other sugar-free beverages throughout the day. Drink water with your meals to ease chewing and swallowing. Add water or other fluid-based mixtures (such as creams, dressings, soups, sauces, etc.) to foods to ease swallowing.


Bring a water bottle or thermos with you as you move through your day.
Drink room-temperature fluids when you can. Avoid drinking beverages that are extremely cold or hot.;
, Chew sugarless gum to stimulate the production of saliva. Avoid gum with sugar, as this can lead to tooth decay. It can also help to suck on sugar-free hard candies. Cinnamon and mint flavored candies may help encourage your saliva.If your dry mouth is temporary, you can eat tart foods such as lemons, limes, and sour candies — these are not proven remedies, but some claim they help with dry mouth. If you have chronic dry mouth, however, you should avoid acidic foods, as they will increase the likelihood of cavities., Get serious about preventing dry mouth. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can aggravate dry mouth symptoms. Avoid salty foods, which can increase dryness. To protect yourself from the negative health consequences of dry mouth, avoid sugary, spicy, salty, and acidic foods.


Avoid drinking caffeinated beverages (coffee, tea, sodas, energy drinks, etc.), as caffeine can dry out your mouth.Avoid sugary and acidic food to prevent tooth decay.
Avoid spicy and salty foods to prevent irritating your mouth.
Processed foods tend to contain deceptively high levels of sodium, which can dry out your mouth. Avoid canned food, fried food, and any frozen or instant meals.

Buy the right toothpaste.,
Get the right kind of mouthwash.,
Breathe through your nose as much as possible.,
Treat snoring.,
Use a humidifier.,
Give up drugs and cigarettes.,
Try artificial saliva.,
Be sparing with over-the-counter cold medications.",How to Prevent Dry Mouth2," Dry mouth decreases the amount of saliva in your mouth, which can lead to tooth decay. Buy toothpaste containing fluoride to help protect your teeth. Avoid toothpaste that contains sodium lauryl sulfate. This product will dehydrate your mouth.Look for toothpaste without sodium laurel sulfate in the natural foods aisle of your local store.

, Avoid any mouthwash or rinse containing alcohol or peroxide, as these products will dry out your mouth. Instead, look for mouthwashes that contain xylitol or fluoride. Fluoride will strengthen your teeth, while xylitol is a sweetener that may help minimize dry mouth., Instead of breathing through your mouth, make a conscious effort to breathe through your nose. If you have a dry, stuffy nose, you may have trouble breathing comfortably through your nose. Moisturize your nasal passages by using a nasal saline spray, which will help with a dry, stuffy nose. , A common cause of dry mouth is snoring. Try using nasal strips or external nasal dilators. Sleep on your side, and elevate your head with an extra pillow or a tilted mattress. Limit your use of alcohol and sedatives.Losing weight can help you stop snoring if you are overweight.
Try to monitor your sleep patterns and seek medical treatment. Snoring can be caused by a deviated nasal septum, sleep apnea, or long-term congestion. Your doctor may be able to help you treat these issues.

, A humidifier adds moisture to the air, and is particularly useful in dry regions or during the winter months when home heating makes the air inside your home dry. Run the humidifier in the bedroom while you sleep. Do not use more than the manufacturer recommends. Decrease humidifier use if you notice condensation or mold on your walls.Avoid sitting in front of a heater, fan, or air conditioner, as these can dehydrate you.

, Smoking and chewing tobacco can cause dry mouth.If you use methamphetamines, quit immediately. Prolonged meth use can cause severe dry mouth, leading to tooth loss. Visit your doctor or a local health clinic for information on how to quit smoking and drug use.

, There are over-the-counter and doctor-prescribed products that create artificial saliva and stimulate the production of natural saliva. Artificial saliva is not a complete substitute for natural saliva, since it does not contain the digestive and antibacterial enzymes that natural saliva contains. But it can be useful in relieving the discomfort of dry mouth. Artificial saliva products may be available in rinses, sprays, toothpastes or washes.


Many of these products do not require a prescription, but they are not often easy to find. Ask your pharmacist to help locate these products.Artificial saliva is rarely prescribed unless you are suffering from a severe syndrome, such as Sjögren's syndrome.

, Antihistamines and decongestants dry up your mucus production, thus worsening dry mouth. If you have a cold or need to treat congestion for any reason, visit your doctor instead of taking a non-prescription decongestant."
"
Talk to your doctor or dentist.,
Manage your medications.,
Get tested for autoimmune diseases.,
Talk to your doctor about your injuries and disorders.,
Rule out false perceptions.",How to Prevent Dry Mouth3," Find out what is causing your dry mouth. Your doctor or dentist may be able to spot symptoms of gene disorders, medication side effects, allergies, or other untreated causes of dry mouth. Make an appointment, and write down any symptoms you have been experiencing and any treatments you have tried.


Bring information about your diet, smoking habits, oral hygiene routines, medications, and medical history.
Bring a complete list of prescription and over-the counter medications that you take regularly.

, Take inventory of the medications you currently take. If you take any medications, these may add to your dry mouth symptoms. Dry mouth is one of the most common side effects for over a thousand prescription and over-the-counter medications. If you have been prescribed medication for depression, anxiety, nerve pain, or other pain management, that may be the cause of your dry mouth.


Cancer patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy often experience dry mouth. This can be a temporary change, or it can be chronic — radiation to the head and throat may permanently damage the salivary gland. Talk to your physician about treating your symptoms.
Older people often experience dry mouth as a result of medications.

, There are serious medical conditions that trigger dry mouth. If you experience dry mouth as well as dry eyes, talk to your doctor about Sjögren’s syndrome, a disorder that affects the immune system, and is predominantly found in women aged 30 – 50. Your doctor may be able to prescribe certain medicines to decrease these symptoms., Dry mouth can be a side effect of many conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, cerebral palsy, and endocrine disorders. If you have already been diagnosed with one of these conditions, ask your doctor about the possibility of dry mouth being a side effect.


If you have recently had a bone marrow transplant, this may have caused your dry mouth.
If you have recently suffered nerve damage to your head or neck, this may have caused your dry mouth.

, Certain conditions can cause you to misdiagnose yourself with dry mouth. If you have Alzheimer's disease, or if you have recently suffered a stroke, you may perceive your mouth as dry despite normal function of your salivary glands. Check your symptoms: Is your saliva thick or stringy? Have your teeth begun decaying at a faster rate, despite normal oral hygiene? Do you have bad breath? Is it difficult to wear your dentures?"
"
Visit the bathroom.,
Apply a warm compress to your stomach.,
Stand up and touch your toes.,
Let yourself vomit.,
Take a hot bath.,
Massage your stomach.,
Take an over-the-counter medication.",How to Cure a Stomach Ache1," Often people who experience nausea or generalized abdominal pain are simply in need of a bowel movement. Before you try anything else, then, try sitting on the toilet for a few minutes while leaning forward with your knees drawn up to your chest. This position naturally encourages bowel movement without undue stress.Don’t try to force a bowel movement by straining or pushing. Undue force can cause serious complications such as hemorrhoids.
If you have blood in your bowel or your stool you should seek medical attention immediately, this is call hematochezia and hematemesis, respectively.;
, Warming your stomach area can help to relax your muscles and reduce any tightness or cramps.Use a hot-water bottle, microwaveable compress, or electric heating blanket and place it over your stomach for several minutes.


If you don’t have any of the instruments listed above, fill a pillowcase or clean sock with some rice and microwave it for a minute or two.

, Mild indigestion can often by fixed by releasing some of the gas stored in your stomach and intestines. You can help your body do this by touching your toes and performing other, similarly simple exercises.


For example, lie on your back with your legs and feet elevated, or crunch your knees to your chest while rocking gently. Elevating your feet will reduce pressure on the abdominal region, release pent-up gas, and relieve discomfort., If you’re seriously nauseated, your body might be telling you that it needs to vomit. This unpleasant action may seem like the worst case scenario, but in fact it’s your body’s way of expelling ingested bacteria, viruses, or food which are causing irritation. Just be sure to visit the doctor if you continue to to vomit over several days, as it could indicate a serious underlying condition.


If you’re nauseated but can’t vomit, try nibbling on some soda crackers or slipping on some anti-nausea magnetic bracelets to ease your queasiness.
Vomiting can cause dehydration quickly, so drink electrolyte-supplemented sports drinks if you’re purging more than once. These replenish the sodium and potassium in your body which it needs in order to fight illness.

, Immersing yourself in warm water will increase your circulation and relax your muscles. This can mitigate abdominal pain and also help to relieve any stress you’re experiencing. Stay in the bath for 15-20 minutes at least and add one or two cups of Epsom salt to help draw out inflammation., Stomach cramping may be caused by muscle constriction. You can lessen this by giving yourself a gentle massage: apply light pressure to different areas of your stomach and back. Focus on parts that feel particularly sore but don’t overdo it and push or rub too hard.While massaging, focus on breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Deep breathing can help relax your muscles and distract you from the pain.

, There are many over-the-counter medications available for run-of-the-mill nausea, indigestion, and cramping. You don’t want to rely on these meds on a consistent basis, but moderate use is generally safe and effective. Follow dosage instructions carefully and ask your pharmacist for additional tips or warnings which apply to the specific medicine you're thinking of purchasing.


For indigestion, look for medications containing bismuth or calcium carbonate, as they coat the stomach lining and reduce pain and nausea with little to no side effects or contraindications.If pain persists after taking bismuth, try a medication with a low dose of acetaminophen rather than aspirin or ibuprofen. Just be sure not to overuse this drug, as it can eventually lead to liver damage."

Ingest prunes or other high-fiber foods.,
Drink peppermint, chamomile, or ginger tea.,
Mix up a solution of baking soda and water.,
Drink apple-cider vinegar.,
Sip on aloe vera juice.",How to Cure a Stomach Ache2," A common cause of stomach ache is constipation: your body needs to move its bowels, but something is blocking or impeding this movement. You can ease constipation by eating or drinking fiber-rich items such as prunes, bran, or broccoli. Prunes are particularly powerful as they contain the natural laxative sorbitol, as well as packing a mean, fiber-full punch.If constipation persists after consuming fiber-rich foods and drinks, try a mild laxative such as a water-soluble powder or sennoside-containing tea.
A cup of coffee can also stimulate your digestive tract muscles and cause a bowel movement. Don’t gulp it down all day long, though. Coffee is a natural diuretic, so too much of it can cause dehydration and exacerbate constipation.Prune juice is well known to help stimulate the bowels and get them moving. Drink a small glass in the AM, and a small glass in the PM to help with constipation.

, Studies have shown that these three herbs can help mitigate nausea and general abdominal discomfort. Ginger regulates digestion, while mint and chamomile can be particularly soothing to cramped muscles.


You can also chew on boiled mint leaves or drink ginger water rather than drinking teas made from these herbs. To make ginger water, toss a few chunks of ginger in hot water, steep, and strain., Most over-the-counter antacids contain baking soda as their primary ingredient, so next time skip the store and make your own antacid at home. Simply dissolve a tablespoon into a glass of warm water and drink the solution slowly.


Repeat this process every few hours until your indigestion or nausea subside.

, Unlike regular white vinegar, apple cider vinegar alleviates nausea by absorbing unwanted nutrients in your stomach. Mix two to three tablespoons of it into a glass of lukewarm water. If the taste doesn’t put you off too much, you can sip on a glass every few hours until your nausea goes away.Purchase an organic, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar which clearly states that it contains ‘the mother.’ This means that it holds the raw enzymes and bacteria which are particularly useful for intestinal health., Aloe vera juice has shown to decrease the pain of stomach cramps. It also has ties to helping with constipation and indigestion as well. It used to be available exclusively at specialty and health food stores, but increased popularity in recent years has made it much more widely available."

Watch what you eat.,
Drink after your meal.,
Avoid oily and spicy foods.,
Wear clothes that are loose around your waistline.,
Take supplements to promote digestion.,
Add a probiotic to your diet.,
Take artichoke leaf extract three times a day.,
Check your consumption of nitrates and anti-inflammatory drugs.,
Rest after eating.,
Consult your doctor about a prescription medication.",How to Cure a Stomach Ache3," If you experience indigestion or heartburn frequently, you should focus on treating the cause of your indigestion rather than simply addressing its symptoms. Start this process by monitoring your consumption and meal habits. Seemingly small habits such as eating too rapidly, taking large mouthfuls, or overeating with excessive portions can aggravate your indigestion.Once you’ve noticed your bad mealtime habits, correct them by eating smaller meals over a longer period of time. Eating slowly allows your stomach more time to digest and smaller portions lessen its workload.
Problems with the stomach after eating is called non-ulcer dyspepsia, which is also known as indigestion.

, Waiting until an hour after mealtime to drink a beverage can help ease indigestion. While it may seem counterintuitive, chugging water with your meals can dilute the digestive acids in your stomach and make them less effective.Opt for water or milk rather than soda, coffee, or alcohol, as these can be abrasive to your stomach lining and make you more uncomfortable.[

, Indigestion is frequently caused by consuming hard-to-digest foods which aggravate pain and increase acid production. One of the easiest ways to curb indigestion, then, is figuring out which foods trigger dyspeptic symptoms and eliminating them from your diet.Instead, opt for bland foods such as oatmeal, broths, toast, applesauce, crackers, and rice. These items are easy to digest and thus won't put undue stress on your digestive system.

, This can seem like a small consideration, but in fact your clothes can have a big impact on indigestion and acid reflux. Super tight waists on pants or skirts can dig into your abdomen and put pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, impeding regular digestion and causing stomach acids to rise up your esophagus.This doesn't mean you have to ditch your favorite skinny jeans entirely. Just make sure you slip into some looser fitting clothing before digging into a big meal.

, Digestive enzymes, hydrochloric acid supplements, and enteric-coated peppermint oil are three widely available supplements which can make a big impact on your indigestion. For example, taking enteric-coated peppermint oil gel capsules daily has been shown to reduce or cure indigestion for up to 75% of users.Although many times indigestion is thought to be the cause of overactive stomach acid, it can also be the result of insufficient stomach acid. Ask your doctor if you think this could be your issue, and try a hydrochloric acid supplement if they recommend it.
No matter which supplement you decide to try, be sure to follow the dosage directions and consult a doctor if you experience any side effects.

, Probiotics are good bacteria that grow in your stomach and aid digestion. Studies have shown that taking probiotics can improve certain chronic digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome and infections diarrhea.Eating yogurt and other cultured milk products on a daily basis can boost your probiotic levels, but make sure that you check the label and purchase products containing live cultures.If you can't stomach yogurt, you can swallow a gel capsule supplement with water instead. Good supplements include Florastor and Align, which are probiotic supplements that help with your GI health.

, Artichoke boosts the production and flow of bile in your stomach, allowing food to move more rapidly through the digestive tract. Recent studies have shown that taking artichoke extract can significantly mitigate symptoms of indigestion such as flatulence and a premature sense of fullness.Though widely used in Germany, artichoke extract can be more difficult to find in other countries. Look for the product in health food stores or browse online retailers which can ship to your home.

, Many commonly prescribed and consumed drugs can cause indigestion or heartburn, so check your medicine cabinet to see if you're taking anything that could be contributing to your problem. Don't just quit important meds cold turkey, though. Ask your doctor if you can stop using the drugs and how you can substitute for it.Nitrates are often used for heart disease as they widen blood vessels, and common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen are typically used for addressing pain.

, You should take a break before doing any physical activity in order to let your food digest. If you exercise too soon after eating, your body interrupts any digestion it was doing so that it can provide blood and energy to your active muscles and lungs. This interruption delays digestion and can cause a stomach ache.Sit upright or lounge for up to an hour after eating your meal.


If you've just eaten a large meal with a lot of fat in it, you may need to wait two to three hours before vigorous exercise., There are many over the counter prescriptions that can treat your indigestion, but many of these have unpleasant side effects if used over a long period of time. If your indigestion persists despite making dietary changes and taking supplements, talk to your doctor and find out if there's a medicinal option to address your problem.For example, your doctor might decide to put you on a proton pump inhibitor or an H2-receptor antagonist. These medications work to lower acid production in the stomach or reduce existing acid levels."

Manage stress through stretching and meditation.,
Exercise regularly.,
Keep a food diary.,
Manage your weight.,
Drink 2.2 liters of water per day.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Cure a Stomach Ache4," Stomach problems including nausea and indigestion are more common if you experience high levels of stress. In order to lower your stress, try stretching slowly and meditating. These measures can all relax your body and mind while reducing your odds of future stomach pain.Recent studies suggest that deep breathing can also alleviate mild heartburn. Unlike most preventative medications, breathing exercises carry no unwanted side-effects, so there's no downside to trying it out next time you experience a bit of heartburn!, Frequent exercise boosts your metabolism and helps prevent constipation. Over a long period of time, your exercise regimen can even strengthen your digestive tract, making it more efficient and consistent at removing waste and clearing its bowels.If you take up long-distance running, you might find yourself more prone to bouts of diarrhea due to the sustained jarring impact and decreased blood flow to your bowels. You can limit these adverse side-effects by avoiding caffeine and sugar substitutes before setting off on a run., Writing down everything that you eat on a daily basis can help you identify foods which cause indigestion so that you can avoid them in the future. You don't have to do this indefinitely, but take at least a week where you note all the foods you eat and in what quantity, as well as when you get a stomach ache and what kinds of pain were associated with it.For example, don't just write, ""Pizza. Stomach ache afterward."" Instead, say something like, ""Two slices of pepperoni pizza. Half hour later experienced sharp heartburn for about an hour.""

, Studies have shown that even a little extra weight can increase your chances of painful heartburn. While the reason for this correlation is unknown, doctors speculate that it arises when fat around the belly presses against your stomach. This added pressure causes acidic fluids to rise up into your esophagus, ultimately causing heartburn.To shed some unwanted pounds, get regular aerobic exercise, cook healthy meals, hydrate frequently, and do resistance-based strength training.

, Your body needs plenty of water to accomplish effective digestion and regular bowel movements. Without sufficient water intake, your bowels can't excrete built-up waste, causing painful constipation, polyps, and hemorrhoids.Be sure to drink water at room temperature. Cold water can present a shock to your system, slow digestion, and even cause mild stomach aches., If you're fighting a stomach virus, your body needs to rest and conserve its resources in order to fight the virus. If you're simply suffering from acid reflux, sleep deprivation can make the problem worse by increasing the time that your esophagus is exposed to acid.If your stomach ache is keeping you up at night, ask your doctor what kind of medication or homeopathic remedies you can take to promote sleep.

Visit the dentist regularly.",How to Keep a Cavity from Getting Worse," Ideally, brushing your teeth will help prevent cavities altogether. However, brushing is also important to prevent cavities from getting worse. Buildup of food stimulates the growth of bacteria. This will get into the cavity and make it worse. Focus on the cavity while brushing to clean away excess food and slow the cavity's progression.Use a soft-bristled brush and don’t press too hard as you move it. Move the toothbrush back and forth in gentle motions for at least 2 minutes total.Brush your teeth twice a day and after eating. It’s particularly important that you keep your mouth clean when you have a cavity, since plaque begins to form within 20 minutes of eating.;
, Tooth decay happens gradually, and sometimes, cavities can exist and progress without showing many symptoms.This is one reason why it’s important to get regular dentist checkups. There are a number of signs that either a cavity is forming or has already taken hold of your tooth. If you experience the following symptoms, make an appointment with your dentist. While you wait for your appointment, take steps to prevent the cavity from getting worse.A white spot on your tooth. This can be an early sign of tooth decay or of fluorosis. It represents a spot where acids have eaten away the minerals in your tooth enamel. The decay is still reversible at this point, so take action if you notice this in your mouth.
Tooth sensitivity. Sensitivity commonly occurs after consuming sweet, hot, or cold foods or drinks.Sensitivity is not always a sign of decay, and many people have sensitive teeth normally. But if you've never had sensitive teeth before and suddenly start feeling sensitivity to certain foods or drinks, this could be a cause for concern.Pain when you bite down.
Toothache. When your cavity has progressed so far that it’s affecting the nerve of your tooth, you may experience persistent pain in the affected tooth. This may or may not get worse when eating and drinking. Pain may also be spontaneous.
A visible hole in your tooth. This indicates that your cavity is far advanced and has significantly eroded your tooth.
Cavities can exist and enlarge over time with no symptoms.

, Fluoride is bacteriostatic, which means that it keeps bacteria from multiplying in your mouth. It also strengthens your teeth by re-mineralizing enamel, which makes your teeth more resistant to cavities. If you've caught a cavity early enough, a good fluoride treatment may even reverse the decay. You can purchase fluoride-enriched products over-the-counter, but for stronger products you must get a prescription from your dentist. The best option is a professional fluoride application from the dentist, but there are several products you can use while you wait for that.Fluoride toothpastes. Most of the toothpastes available over-the-counter have around 1000 ppm to 1500 ppm of sodium fluoride. Dentists can also prescribe fluoride-enriched toothpaste that contains roughly 5000 ppm of sodium fluoride.
Fluoride mouth rinses. Fluoride mouth rinses can be used daily. These mouthwashes generally contain 225 to 1000 ppm of sodium fluoride. Look for a mouth rinse with an ADA seal of approval to indicate that the rinse has been evaluated by the American Dental Association.
Fluoride gel. Fluoride gel is thick and will remain on your teeth for a longer period of time. You squirt the gel into trays that you then fit over your teeth.

, A dry mouth can speed up tooth decay by allowing the buildup of cavity-causing bacteria. Keep your mouth moist to slow the cavity's progression and rinse away food particles that could make decay worse.If your mouth stays dry regardless of how much water you drink, this could be a symptom of a larger medical condition, or caused by prescription medication. Talk with your doctor if dry mouth remains a problem for you.

, Xylitol is a naturally-occurring alcohol that is extracted from plants. It has anti-bacterial properties and is used to prevent infections. Gum that contains 1–20 grams (0.035–0.71 oz) of xylitol helps kill bacteria that causes cavities and makes them worse. If you suspect you have a cavity, try chewing xylitol gum to slow its growth until you see the dentist.Look for chewing gum with the ADA seal. This ensures that you won’t accidentally be doing your teeth more harm than good.
Chewing gum also stimulates saliva production, which can help wash away food particles and keep tooth enamel strong., Salt water has antiseptic qualities, and dentists often recommend it when treating wounds or infections in the mouth. Salt water can also kill the bacteria that causes cavities, slowing their growth until you can get to the dentist.Dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water.
Swish a mouthful of this water around your mouth for 1 minute. Concentrate on the affected tooth.
Repeat this treatment 3 times daily.

, Although it hasn't been studied extensively, there is evidence that licorice root can help prevent and slow the growth of cavities. It may kill cavity-causing bacteria and can cut down on inflammation.Try using licorice root for a home remedy to slow cavity growth while you wait for an appointment at the dentist.


Some toothpastes made by Tom's of Maine contain licorice root.Alternatively, you could buy some licorice root powder at the store and mix it with your toothpaste.
Make sure to look for deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), which does not contain glycyrrhiza, a compound that can cause unpleasant and often serious side effects.Always consult with your doctor before you use licorice root. It can interact with certain medications, including ACE inhibitors, insulin, MAO inhibitors, and oral contraceptives. It can also cause health problems for people with certain medical conditions, including liver or kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure or heart disease, or hormone-sensitive cancers., Cavities are caused by acid-producing bacteria that thrive in acidic environments. These bacteria use sugar found in dental plaque as fuel. This is why sugary foods and beverages should be minimized. If possible, brush your teeth after eating.Foods high in starch, like potatoes, bread, and pasta, also provide a welcoming environment for acid-producing bacteria. Keep your simple and refined carbohydrate intake low, and brush your teeth after eating., Depending on your cavity's progression, your dentist may recommend different types of treatment. If you have any questions about treatment procedures, ask your dentist.

, If your cavity is just beginning and is still very small, your dentist may be able suggest no invasive treatment and to treat it with a heavy application of fluoride. This is usually painted onto the tooth and left to sit for a few minutes. It will help restore the enamel in the affected area and, if done early enough, will remineralize the tooth.While this treatment usually only takes a few minutes, you won't be able to eat or drink for at least 30 minutes afterward to allow the fluoride to properly sink in.

, Most often cavities aren't caught early enough for fluoride to be effective. The cavity will then require a filling. During this process, the dentist will drill out the affected portion of your tooth. S/he will then fill the hole with some sort of material.Commonly, your dentist will use porcelain or a composite resin to fill a cavity, especially for front teeth. These are top choices because they can be shaded to match your tooth’s natural appearance.Dentists may fill cavities in back teeth with silver alloy or gold, as these tend to be stronger. Plaque also usually builds up more extensively on the back teeth., S/he will remove the infected pulp of your tooth, use an antiseptic to remove bacteria, and then fill it with a sealing material. This is usually a last effort to save the tooth before extraction.In most cases, you will need a crown (a “cap” for your tooth) when you require a root canal., In this case, the dentist will extract the affected tooth. After this, you can have the tooth replaced with some form of dental implant, both for cosmetic purposes and to prevent your other teeth from shifting position., Keep your teeth clean and healthy by brushing them twice a day. Use a soft-bristled brush, and replace it every 3-4 months. To ensure that you're brushing your teeth effectively, use the following instructions from the American Dental Association.Angle the toothbrush 45 degrees to the gumline. Plaque tends to build up on the gumline.
Gently move the brush back and forth using small strokes. The strokes should only be about the width of one tooth.
Brush both the outer and inner surfaces of your teeth.
Continue brushing for about two minutes.
Finish by brushing your tongue. If you miss your tongue, you'll leave behind a lot of bacteria that will recontaminate your mouth as soon as you stop brushing.
Repeat this at least twice a day.

, Along with brushing, flossing is crucial for maintaining a healthy mouth. You should try to floss at least once a day, though twice would be ideal. Follow these simple steps to make sure you're flossing your teeth properly.


Take about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss. Wrap most of it around the middle finger of one hand, the rest around your other middle finger.
Grasp the string tightly between your thumb and forefinger. Use a rubbing motion to guide it between teeth.
When the floss reaches the gum line, form a “C” shape to follow the shape of the tooth.
Hold the strand firmly against the tooth, and move it gently up and down.
Repeat the entire process with the rest of your teeth.
Use fresh sections of floss as you go.
If your teeth are packed very tightly, look for a waxed or “easy glide” floss. You may also find the small pre-threaded flossers more helpful. The most important thing is to floss faithfully., Some mouth rinses only mask bad breath without killing the bacteria and removing the plaque that causes bad breath and cavities. When buying a mouthwash, look for the ADA seal of acceptance, indicating that the ADA has examined this product and approved its plaque-fighting ability.Click here for a complete list of ADA-approved mouthwashes.


Make sure you purchase a mouthwash that can help reduce plaque, fight gingivitis and cavities, and reduce bad breath.There are plenty of low-alcohol or no-alcohol mouthwashes that can still be good for your oral health. If you can’t handle the “burn” from traditional mouthwashes, look for one of these.

, What you eat has a big effect on your oral health. Some foods are beneficial for your teeth, while others should be kept to a minimum or avoid altogether.Eat foods high in fiber. Fiber helps push plaque off of your teeth. It also stimulates production of saliva, which helps clean harmful acids and enzymes off your teeth. For fiber, eat fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grain products.
Eat dairy products. Milk, cheese, and plain yogurt also stimulate production of saliva. They also contain calcium, which strengthens your tooth enamel.
Drink tea. Nutrients in green and black tea help break down plaque and slow the growth of bacteria. Brewing your tea with water containing fluoride will give you a double dose of nutrients for your teeth.
Avoid sugary foods and drinks. Sugar increases the growth of plaque and bacteria, leading to tooth decay. Keep candy and soft drinks to a minimum. If you do eat sugary foods, do so with a meal and drink plenty of water. This way, your mouth will produce more saliva which will help wash away the sugar and reduce acid and bacterial growth.
Brush your teeth after eating starchy foods. Foods like potatoes and corn get stuck in between teeth more readily, leading to tooth decay. Be sure to clean your teeth after eating these foods to avoid cavities.

, Drinks such as soft drinks, alcohol, and even fruit juice are acidic, and can promote bacteria growth that causes tooth decay.Consume these in moderation, or not at all.


The biggest culprits are sports drinks like Gatorade, energy drinks like Red Bull, and sodas such as Coke. Carbonation may promote tooth wear.Drink plenty of water. Rinse your mouth with water after drinking an acidic beverage.
Remember that even 100% pure fruit juice contains sugar. Dilute 100% pure fruit juice with equal parts water, especially for kids. Limit your consumption and rinse your mouth with water after drinking fruit juice.

, Usually dentists like to see their patients every 6 months. Stick to this schedule to ensure your mouth stays healthy. During your visit, the dentist will give your teeth a thorough cleaning, eliminating any plaque that has built up over the last few months. S/he will also check for any signs of cavities, gum disease, or any other issues you may have with your oral health.Your dentist can also help you catch cavities while they are very small. If your dentist catches a cavity early enough, s/he can treat it without invasive procedures.
For example, lifestyle changes, proper mouth hygiene, and fluoride treatments may be enough to treat very small cavities. They can stimulate “remineralization,” a natural regeneration process."

Try a sugar-based scrub.,
Apply a baking soda scrub.,
Use a honey sugar scrub.",How to Exfoliate Lips1," Mix equal parts olive oil and sugar in a small bowl to get a paste.Stand over your sink so you don't make a mess. Use a clean, soft washcloth to gently massage the mixture onto your lips using a circular motion. Rinse the mixture off with warm, not hot, water – cup your hands and splash water onto your mouth until it’s clean. Pat your lips dry and apply petroleum jelly or hydrating lip balm to moisturize your lips.


You can use white or brown sugar, but not powdered.
Coconut oil is a tasty alternative to olive oil.
The longer (and harder) you rub the mixture on your lips the more intensely it will exfoliate. Do this for about a minute, maximum. Too much exfoliating can make lips sore or chapped.
Oil-based scrubs are great for dry skin because they're very hydrating.;
, Mix baking soda with water to form a gritty paste; you may have to experiment with the ratio. Use a clean washcloth or old toothbrush with soft, straight bristles to rub the paste onto your lips in a gentle, circular motion.Rinse with warm water, gently pat dry, and apply lip balm or petroleum jelly.


Baking soda and water do not moisturize your lips at all, so be sure to apply a moisturizing lip balm when you’re done.
This scrub may be a good choice if you have oily skin around your mouth because it's non-greasy.

, Mix 1/3 honey and 2/3 sugar in a small bowl.Apply it to your lips in a circular motion. You can use your finger if you wash your hands first, or a soft toothbrush, clean washcloth, or cotton swab. Leave the paste on for 2-3 minutes. Wash it off with warm water – honey is sticky so it may take a few minutes of washing. Rub your lips gently with a cloth, then moisturize.


You can also leave this scrub on overnight if you wish. After you apply the scrub, put a strip of paper towel on your lips and lightly push it down – this will keep the scrub from getting all over your bedding and face. Sleep on your back and keep your head upright. Remove the paper strip in the morning, wash the scrub off, and moisturize your lips well.

Use a toothbrush.,
Exfoliate with lemon juice.,
Nourish and soothe with oatmeal.,
Use rose petals on your lips.,
Purchase a premade lip exfoliant.",How to Exfoliate Lips2," Take an old toothbrush, preferably one with straight bristles that are very soft, and put a bit of petroleum jelly on it. Rub the toothbrush on your lips in a circular motion.Leave the petroleum jelly on to rehydrate your lips, or apply a little more if most of it gets rubbed off.


You won’t want to use this toothbrush to brush your teeth again. You can save it in a clean dry place to use for exfoliation, but don’t contaminate it by using it for other purposes.
For sensitive lips, try a children’s toothbrush. These are usually extra soft.If you don’t want to use a toothbrush, you can do the same trick with a soft, clean washcloth.

, Mix a tablespoon of lemon juice with a tablespoon of castor oil or glycerin.Apply this to your lips and leave it on for an hour or so. Then, gently rub the mixture off with a soft washcloth wet with warm water. Moisturize as usual.


This works well for chapped, dry lips and skin.

, Because of its grainy texture, oatmeal exfoliates well and can effectively absorb and remove dirt and impurities from your skin. Mix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oatmeal with 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of warm water or milk, and rub the mixture onto your lips in a circular motion for 1-2 minutes. Afterwards, rinse your lips with warm water and then cold water., Not only does it sound romantic, but using rose petals to exfoliate can moisturize your lips and add some red color to them. Soak some clean rose petals in raw milk for about 3 hours. When the petals are completely soaked, mash them up to make a paste. You can use a mortar and pestle or just the back of a large spoon. Once this is mashed to a paste, apply it to your lips in an even layer.This is a gentle exfoliant and moisturizer and may be helpful for sensitive skin.

, There are many lip scrubs on the market, such as LUSH lip scrub and e.l.f. lip exfoliator.Look for products with natural ingredients like aloe or shea butter, and avoid salicylic acid which can be too harsh.Proceed with caution with new products – use gentle pressure to avoid over-exfoliating.


If your lips feel irritated after using a product, stop using it.

Plug your nostrils.,
Dry out your mouth.,
Drink cold water.,
Drink a strong alcoholic drink.",How to Dull Your Taste Buds1," Your taste buds only recognize five tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and savory (""Umami""). The rest is in the nose. If you can avoid smelling the food, you'll avoid a large part of the flavor. Pinch your nose as you eat or drink anything to neutralize a significant portion of the taste involved.When the taste is truly to be avoided, take a sip of a drink before un-pinching your nose to avoid any taste left on the tongue. Slosh the liquid around your mouth for good measure.
If you're eating in public or anywhere where you can't politely pinch your nose, exhale immediately before taking a bit/drink to avoid the taste. Be sure to take a small bite if doing this to avoid choking when trying to breathe again.;
, Your taste is all about saliva. You taste different things depending on how that food reacts with the saliva in your mouth. Take a paper towel and complete dry out your mouth and tongue; this will eliminate nearly all of the taste. But remember, the saliva in your mouth is replenished every few seconds, so eat quickly after drying your mouth.Cotton swabs such as Q-Tips are a discreet alternative to a paper towel, though you'll most likely need more than one.
If you know just when you'll need to eat something unpleasant, try to refrain from having any water beforehand during the day. Drink caffeinated drinks like soda or coffee to dehydrate yourself; your mouth should be reasonably dry come time to eat.

, You might have noticed that any food might taste a little different depending on it's temperature. Why is that? It's the same food, after all. The fact is that generally, cooling numbs your palate, toning down flavors. If you can drink a glass of cold water right before eating or drinking something unpleasant, you'll be better off. If you can chill the unpleasant food or drink, that's even better.For a more uncomfortable alternative (though preferable perhaps if you have teeth which are sensitive to cold), you can scald your tongue with a hot drink like tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. The heat will make your taste buds much less sensitive in the moments after sipping something really hot.

, A drink with a high alcohol concentration (such as whiskey) has the effect of a mild anesthetic on your taste centers in your mouth and nose. Try to eat or drink whatever is unpleasant quickly after drinking the alcohol for the best possible effect.If you're underage or have no access to hard alcohol, try a hygienic mouthwash which contains disinfecting alcohol such as Listerine. This too will help to numb your taste as well as distract with (usually) a strong mint flavor.

"
"
Over-salt your food.,
Make a peppermint mouthwash.,
Use a straw.,
Have better food on hand.",How to Dull Your Taste Buds2," If possible, salt whatever unpleasant food you have to eat to excess. Once you've added enough, it should only be salt you taste when you have to take a bite. Avoid adding so much, however, that the excessive saltiness becomes just as unpleasant.In theory, you can do this with any spice (sugar included), though salt is usually always at hand and salting to excess rarely draws any attention.

, Pour a bottle of peppermint extract into a small cap (like you'd find on a 24oz soda bottle). Toss the capful into your mouth. Swish it around as you would mouthwash. Spit out the extract and rinse your mouth with cold water. Your taste should be slightly numb for a number of minutes due to the menthol quality of the peppermint extract.


Spearmint extract will have the same menthol quality as peppermint and is an adequate replacement.
If you have no extracts of the mint variety, you can also reach for over-powering tastes such as almond or chocolate extract. Coat your mouth in the same way (using only a capful) and whatever you eat next will take on the flavor of the extract.

, If the flavors you're trying to avoid are in a liquid, use a straw so that you can bypass your tongue. Aim to have it land at the very back of your tongue so that it may go straight down your throat so as to avoid any contact with the taste buds on your tongue.


This is same logic can be used with food. Push whatever you're eating to the sides of your mouth and chew alongside your cheek so that the food cannot reach your tongue.
Try and keep your head tilted back slightly to encourage your food/drink to leave your tongue quickly and continue down your throat.

, With food or drink you do not want to taste, try eating it beforehand with food you like and following it with more. Try eating it quickly, but be careful not to choke or hurt yourself. The less time you allow whatever taste you're attempting to avoid to mingle with your taste buds, the less vulnerable you'll be to the unpleasant taste.

See a doctor.,
Start tongue-scraping.,
Expand your palate.",How to Dull Your Taste Buds3," If you find things are beginning to take on an unpleasant taste, or if food you have enjoyed in the past is no longer desirable, this may be indicative of a larger problem. There's a long list of causes for a lingering bad taste, from the side of effects from over-the-counter medication to use of tobacco products and so on. If you find yourself looking to dull bad tastes often, consider an appointment with a physician., A good, well-kept hygiene regimen is crucial to having your taste buds at their best. However, normal brushing and flossing won't always remove every last lingering bacteria which might cause consistent foul tastes. Tongue scrapers are inexpensive and using them is an easy addition to your morning and night routines.Many toothbrushes today include their own tongue scrapers on the reverse side of the brush head. Look for these for an economic option.

, Many unpleasant tastes might be the unfortunate consequence of perception or circumstance. Maybe something you ate or drank prior made something taste poorly, or perhaps whatever you're eating might not have been made as best it could. In any case, don't be afraid to revisit things that have put you off in the past.


If there's a particular cuisine you avoid, consider it again at a restaurant you've never patronized. One which is well-recommended online or by friends. Never let one bad experience turn you away from something entirely.
If there's a particular dish which you've found middling or inconsistent, try looking up recipes online and learning to cook it yourself. When you cook for yourself you'll have ample opportunity to alter the dish to your taste.

It can be caused when only part of the tooth has “erupted” into the mouth, or if crowding near the wisdom teeth has made flossing and proper cleaning difficult.To figure out whether your wisdom tooth is infected, it is important to be able to identify the tell-tale signs and symptoms. Look for the following:Bright red gums or red with white spots on your gums. The gums will be inflamed around the particular tooth.
Moderate to severe pain in your jaw and difficulty chewing. You may notice swelling that looks like a small lump in your cheek. The swollen area may also feel hot to the touch.An unpleasant, metallic taste in your mouth. This is caused by the blood and pus at the site of the infection. You may also experience bad breath as a result.Difficulty opening your mouth or swallowing. This may mean that the infection has spread from the gums to the surrounding muscles.Fever. A temperature above 100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C) indicates that you have a fever, which means that your body is fighting off an infection. In severe cases, the infection may be accompanied by muscle weakness. If this is the case, you should contact a dentist or doctor immediately.
In some cases, the root may also be infected. If this is the case, your dentist will likely extract the tooth.;
, Salt is naturally antiseptic. Using a saltwater rinse can help kill bacteria in your mouth.Add ½ to 1 teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of lukewarm water. Mix well to combine.Take a mouthful of the rinse and swirl it around your mouth for 30 seconds, concentrating on the infected area to kill the bacteria.
Spit out the salt water after 30 seconds — do not swallow. Repeat this process 3 to 4 times per day.
You can use this treatment in combination with any antibiotics your dentist prescribes.

, Depending where you live, it might possible to buy antibacterial dental gels at your local drugstore. These gels help to control the infection and alleviate any pain or inflammation.To apply the gel, rinse your mouth thoroughly and apply one or two drops of the gel directly onto the infected area using a cotton applicator tip.
Don't use your fingers to apply the gel as you risk introducing more bacteria.
Apply the dental gel 3 to 4 times per day for best results.

, If you are experiencing severe discomfort as a result of the wisdom tooth infection, you can take a pain reliever that also relieves inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually available over the counter at pharmacies and drug stores.Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin are the most common NSAIDs. Do not give aspirin to children under age 18, as it has been linked to the development of Reye’s Syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage.Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is not an NSAID and does not reduce inflammation, but it can help relieve pain.Follow the dosing instructions on the packaging, or as instructed by your doctor, and do not exceed the maximum dosage.
Keep in mind that each drug has its own list of side effects, so read the product advice information on the packaging before taking any medication. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if needed.

, If you don’t want or can’t take medication, apply an ice pack to the infected area. It will relieve pain and reduce the inflammation until you can seek treatment.If the swelling is severe, seek emergency medical treatment.


Pour ice cubes in a plastic bag or in a towel. Press the bag against the painful area for at least ten minutes.
You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables, such as peas or corn. (Don’t eat bagged veggies that have been thawed and refrozen.)

, It is very important that you schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. If you do not get adequate medical treatment for your infection, it could spread to other parts of your mouth and body.Pericoronitis may also lead to other complications such as gum disease, tooth decay and the development of cysts. More severe complications include swollen lymph nodes, sepsis, systemic infection, and possibly even death.
If your dentist is too busy to see you immediately, visit an urgent care clinic or go to the hospital. Many have emergency dentists.

, S/he will examine the infected area and take an x-ray. to determine the severity of the situation and identify the best treatment.S/he will examine the position of the tooth to see whether it has fully or partially emerged from the gums. Your dentist will also take note of the condition of the surrounding gums.
If the wisdom tooth has not yet emerged, the dentist may need to perform an x-ray to locate the tooth and identify its position. These factors will influence whether or not the tooth will need to be removed.
Don’t forget your medical history. Your dentist will want to know if you’re allergic to any medication.

, Consult with your dentist about how much the procedure will cost. You should also ask about all the risks and benefits of the treatment, as well as any alternative treatments that may be an option.


Don’t be afraid to ask questions. You have the right to understand your medical care.

, If the wisdom tooth is about to emerge from the gums without any problems and the infection is not too severe, the dentist may be able to clear the infection by simply cleaning the area with an antiseptic solution.


The dentist will remove any infected tissue, pus, food debris or plaque from around the area. If there is an abscess on the gums, sometimes a small incision will be made to drain the pus.
After the cleaning, your dentist will recommend home care for you to follow over the next few days. This might include mouth gels to bring down inflammation, antibiotics to fully clear the infection, and painkillers to relieve any pain.Commonly prescribed antibiotics include Amoxicillin, Clindamycin, and Penicillin., One of the main causes of wisdom tooth infection is when a section of gum covering the wisdom tooth — known as the gum flap —becomes infected due to bacteria, plaque and food debris becoming trapped underneath it. If the tooth is still buried within the gums (but is positioned to emerge from the gums correctly) it is often easier to remove the infected gum flap than the tooth itself.Your dentist might schedule a minor surgical procedure called an ‘operculectomy’, in which the soft gum tissue covering the wisdom tooth is removed.Once removed, the area will be a lot easier to keep clean and free of plaque and bacteria, which greatly reduces the chances of the wisdom tooth becoming reinfected.
Before the procedure, your dentist will numb the area with a local anesthetic. S/he will then remove the infected tissue flap using surgical scalpel blades, lasers or electrocautery methods., If you have suffered from multiple infections and your wisdom tooth shows no sign of emerging on its own, it may be necessary to have the tooth removed. Extraction may also be necessary if the infection is very severe.Depending on the position of the tooth, the extraction will be conducted by your dentist or by an oral surgeon.The dentist will give you a local anaesthetic and will remove the tooth.You may be prescribed antibiotics and painkillers to prevent further infection and relieve any pain. It is essential that you follow your dentist's advice regarding good oral hygiene practices.
You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your dentist to inspect the gums to ensure they are healing properly. The dentist will check the positioning of the opposite wisdom tooth, in case it need to be removed also.

, In order to avoid future infections, it is essential to maintain good oral hygiene. The first step to good oral hygiene is to brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled toothbrush. Hard-bristled toothbrushes are too harsh and can wear away delicate tooth enamel.Hold your toothbrush at 45-degree angle to your gumline.Brush your teeth using small circular motions, rather than brushing back and forth (as this can damage tooth enamel).
You should brush your teeth twice a day, for at least two minutes at a time. Make sure to brush down to the gum line and don't forget the teeth at the back.

, Flossing is just as important as brushing, as it removes built-up plaque and bacteria from between the teeth that the toothbrush cannot reach. If this plaque isn't removed, it can lead to tooth decay, infection and gum disease. Floss at least once a day.Hold the floss firmly between both hands and work it gently down between the teeth using a gentle back and forth movement. Try not to ""ping"" it down onto the gums, as this is irritating to the gums and can cause bleeding.
Curve the floss into a “C” shape against one tooth. Slide the floss gently between your tooth and your gum.
Holding the floss tightly, rub the tooth with gentle back and forth motions.
Make sure to floss between every tooth and at the backs of your rear molar. You should always rinse your mouth after flossing to remove the dislodged plaque and bacteria.

, Using an antiseptic mouthwash helps to control the level of bacteria inside the mouth, while also keeping your breath nice and fresh. Look for one that has the ADA Seal of Acceptance; these have been approved by the American Dental Association as effective for your teeth.You can use mouthwash before or after brushing. Pour a small cap-full of the mouthwash into your mouth and swish it between the teeth for approximately 30 seconds before spitting out.
You can use a commercial brand antiseptic mouthwash, or simply rinse your mouth with undiluted chlorhexidine, which is available at most pharmacies.If you find the “burn” of mouthwash too strong, look for an alcohol-free version.

, Scheduling regular check-ups with your dentist is the best preventative measure you can take to avoid wisdom tooth infection and other dental issues.You should see your dentist every six months, particularly if your wisdom teeth have not yet emerged. Your dentist may recommend that you visit more frequently if you have certain health issues.

, Avoid smoking or using tobacco products when suffering from an infected wisdom tooth, as these activities irritate the gums and can make the infection worse.Cigarette smoking is bad for your health in general, and your oral health is no different. Talk to your doctor about ways to quit as soon as you can.Smoking can also stain your teeth and tongue, slow your body’s ability to heal, and cause gum disease and oral cancer."

Check for signs of mild to moderate dehydration.,
Recognize signs of severe dehydration.,
Choose the correct rehydration liquid.,
Rehydrate yourself.,
Make your own oresol.,
Rehydrate a child.,
Seek immediate medical help for at-risk groups or anyone with severe dehydration.",How to Control Cholera1," The primary objective to treat cholera is to replenish your lost fluids.If you have cholera, you are likely dehydrated since dehydration is the number one symptom of this condition. Dehydration can range from mild and moderate to severe. The first step in treating cholera is to determine the degree of dehydration of the individual. Mild to moderate dehydration signs include:


A dry, sticky mouth
Feeling thirsty, dizzy, or lightheaded
Feeling tired or a decrease in activity
A decreased output of urine, which in infants this means no wet diaper for over three hours
Limited tear production
Dry skin
Headache
Diarrhea
Constipation;
, While being dehydrated is definitely cause for concern, being severely dehydrated means you should be hospitalized immediately. It is a life threatening situation, so act quickly. Signs of severe dehydration include:


Sunken in eyes with raised skin around them
Chapped and dry lips
Extreme thirst
Reduced elasticity in your skin, which will not snap back into its normal position when pinched
Fever
Little to no urine production, which is extremely dark if produced
Rapid heartbeat and breathing
No tear production
Fussiness or sleepiness in children
Confusion, Without rehydration, about half people who have been infected with cholera die. Restore lost fluids and electrolytes as soon as possible when cholera symptoms appear, by drinking any of the following:Treated, cholera-free water
Coconut water
Electrolyte-rich drinks like Gatorade
Soup or bouillon
Oresol or other oral rehydration solutions

Avoid undiluted fruit juice, soft drinks, and coffee, since these can worsen diarrhea., If you know you are dehydrated, rehydration is key. Rehydration is a two to four hour period where medical treatments are focused on bringing individuals back to baseline levels of hydration and electrolyte balance. Oral rehydration is the best way to replenish your fluid floss for mild to moderate dehydration. Severely dehydrated patients will need IV Infusion rates of 50 to 100 mL/kg/h.


IV infusion is not recommended for mild to moderate cases unless you can’t tolerate oral rehydration.After rehydration, you enter the maintenance phase. During this phase, you should continue on a rehydration treatment plan until diarrhea and other symptoms are resolved., Oresol, or oral rehydration liquids, can be bought commercially with brands such as Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, Resol, Rice-Lyte, or ORS. If do not have any oresol, you can make your own rehydrating drink. Drink at least one cup of this mixture after every time you have diarrhea because of your cholera.


To make your own oresol, wash your hands, utensils, and bottle or cup for your drink with clean, sanitized water. Mix one liter of clean, treated drinking water with eight teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon of salt. Shake or stir the water to make sure the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, and then drink.The World Health Organization suggest a rehydration solution made by mixing 3.5 grams (0.1 oz) of salt, 1.5 grams of potassium chloride, 20 grams (0.71 oz) glucose (sugar), and 2.9 grams (0.1 oz) of trisodium citrate., Dealing with a dehydrated child can be a little trickier than dealing with yourself or another adult. Rehydrate the child as soon as possible, right after the first bout of diarrhea. The exact treatment depends on the age of the child, and the degree of dehydration:If the child is severely dehydrated, seek medical attention immediately for IV fluid restoration. Give fluids by mouth as well if the child can drink.
If there are signs of moderate dehydration, give oral rehydration solutions (see above for storebought and homemade versions):

Children weighing less than 5kg need roughly 200 to 400 milliliters (6.8 to 14  fl oz) of fluid. (typical weight for children under 4 months of age)
Weighing 5 to 7.9 kg: requires 400 to 600 milliliters (13.5 to 20.3  fl oz). (age 4–11 months)
8–10.9 kg: 600 to 800 milliliters (20.3 to 27.1  fl oz) (12–23 months)
11–15.9 kg: 800 to 1,200 milliliters (27.1 to 40.6  fl oz) (2–4 years)
16–29.9 kg: 1,200 to 2,200 milliliters (40.6 to 74.4  fl oz) (5–14 years)
30 kg+: 2,200 to 400 milliliters (74.4 to 13.5  fl oz) (15 years+)
Give more fluid if the child wants it or continues to pass watery stool.


If there are no signs of dehydration, give enough oral rehydration solution to replace the water lost to diarrhea and vomiting, plus more if the child wants it.

, Infants, elderly persons and persons with chronic or debilitating illnesses such as diabetic renal failure are particularly vulnerable to complications of dehydration caused by cholera. If anyone in these groups shows signs of cholera, need urgent admission to the hospital for rehydration and close monitoring. Anyone with severe dehydration will also have much better odds of recovery if they get to a hospital immediately for IV fluid restoration.Seek immediate medical attention for children of all ages with severe dehydration.

Figure out how long it takes your filling to set.,
Take pain medication if needed.,
Avoid food and beverages until the anesthetic wears off.,
Avoid very hot and very cold foods and beverages.,
Avoid hard, chewy, or sticky foods.,
Chew on the opposite side of your mouth to the filling.,
Check for high points on the filling.,
Contact your dentist if you’re having any issues.,
Brush and floss every day, including after meals.,
Control your intake of sugary and acidic foods and beverages.,
Use fluoride gels.,
Avoid mouthwashes and toothpastes that contain alcohol.,
Don't grind your teeth.,
Get regular checkups and cleanings at your dentist’s office.",How to Care for a Tooth Filling," There are several types of dental fillings and each takes a different amount of time to set. Being aware of the setting time will give you a general time frame for which you should be especially careful not to inflict any damage on the filling.


Gold, amalgam, and composite fillings take about 24-48 hours to set.Ceramic fillings set immediately with the help of a blue dental light.Glass ionomers set within 3 hours of filling, but it may take 48 hours for them to feel hard.;
, You can take over the counter pain medication before the anesthetic wears off and continue this treatment until your sensitivity subsides. This will help with any swelling or pain you might experience.Ask your dentist if you need to take pain medication to manage post-operative sensitivity. Follow the package or your dentist’s instructions for taking pain relievers after a filling.Sensitivity will generally improve within one week., Your mouth will feel numb for a few hours after a filling because of the anaesthetic administered during the procedure. If you can, avoid eating or drinking until the anesthetic wears off so that you don’t injure yourself.If you do eat or drink, the numbness may make it difficult to gauge the temperature or you may end up biting the inside of your cheek, tongue or tip.If you can’t wait to eat or drink, try soft foods like yogurt or applesauce and simple beverages like water. Chew using the opposite side of your mouth than the filling to help ensure that you don’t injure yourself or damage the filling., Your teeth and the filling will likely be sensitive for a few days after the procedure. Avoid consuming food and beverages that are very hot or very cold to control sensitivity and pain, and also that might damage your filling.Very hot or cold foods and beverages can disrupt the bond of fillings. Composite fillings are generally bonded to the tooth. The bonding process continues for at least 24 hours, so it’s advisable to consume lukewarm foods/beverages during this time.
Hot and cold temperatures make the filling material expand and contract, especially if they are metal. This alters the filling adaptability, shape, and strength of the material and may cause fractures or leaking.Make sure to allow cooling time for hot foods like soup or baked dishes including lasagna as well as heated beverages such as coffee and tea before you consume them.

, Try to avoid foods that are hard, chewy, or sticky for a few days after a filling. Foods such as candies, granola bars, and raw vegetables can cause potential problems, including pulling out the filling.Biting hard foods can fracture your filling or your tooth. Sticky foods can adhere filled tooth surfaces for a long time and make them more susceptible to cavities.
Food stuck in between the teeth can weaken a filling and puts you at higher risk for more cavities. To avoid this, rinse your mouth out after every snack or meal and use fluoridated mouthwash after brushing and flossing.

, When you finally eat, make sure to chew on the opposite side of your mouth to the filling for a day or two. This will help ensure that the filling sets properly and doesn’t get damaged., Because the dentist “fills” a tooth, it is possible that he adds too much material to the filling site. Check for a high point in the filling by gently biting down. Contact your dentist if you feel any high points to prevent fracturing your filling or causing post-operative pain.


High points may prevent you from closing your mouth properly or biting correctly. They can also cause problems like pain, the inability to eat on the side of the mouth where the filling is, fracture of the filling, earache, and clicking in the temporomandibular joint., If you notice any issues with your teeth, mouth, or fillings, contact your dentist. This will help ensure that there aren’t underlying issues and may prevent further damage to your teeth.


Watch for the following symptoms and contact your dentist if you experience any of them:
Sensitivity in the restored toothCracks in the fillingMissing or chipped off fillingsDiscolored teeth or fillingsIf you notice the filling is shaky and seepage is occurring at the margins when you drink something., Brushing and flossing every day and after meals can maintain the health of your teeth, fillings, and gums. A clean environment may help you avoid further fillings as well as unsightly stains.


Make sure to brush and floss after meals if you can. If you have food stuck in your teeth, it promotes an environment that is rife for further cavities and can damage current fillings. If you don’t have a toothbrush, chewing a piece of gum can help.Coffee, tea, and wine can stain your filling and your teeth. If you drink any of these beverages, Try to brush your teeth afterward to prevent staining.
Tobacco and smoking can also stain your fillings and teeth.

, Sugary and acidic foods and beverages may contribute to your need for fillings, and controlling your intake of them can lead to better oral health. Tooth decay can easily occur underneath an existing filling. Over time fillings will naturally breakdown and leak, so it’s important to maintain a healthy diet and good hygiene to prevent decay from forming under existing fillings, too. Brushing your teeth after consuming these foods may help prevent you from needing further fillings.If you can’t brush, because for example you're at school, then rinse your mouth with water. Increase your water intake. Limit your snacking frequency, avoid sticky foods.
Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet of lean protein, fruits and vegetables, and legumes can help with your overall well-being, including oral health.
Even some healthy foods are acidic, including citrus fruits. Continue eating these, but limit how much you consume and consider brushing your teeth when you’re done. Consider diluting juices with 50/50 water.
Examples of sugary and acidic foods and beverages are soft drinks, sweets, candies, and wine. Sports drinks, energy drinks, and coffee with added sugar also count.

, If you have multiple fillings, ask your dentist to prescribe you a fluoride gel or paste. Fluoride helps to protect your teeth from new cavities and can promote general oral healthFluoride gel or paste also helps to strengthen your enamel, furthering the life of your fillings.

, Mouthwashes and toothpastes that contain alcohol can decrease the durability of fillings or even stain them. Use non-alcohol colored toothpaste or mouthwashes to avoid these problems.You can find toothpastes and mouthwashes without alcohol at most grocery and drug stores or online retailers.

, If you have a bad habit of clenching and grinding your teeth at night, you may damage your fillings and teeth. If you're a tooth-grinder, ask your dentist about using a mouth guard.Grinding wears your fillings and can cause sensitivity and damage including small chips and cracks.Nail biting, opening bottles or holding objects with your teeth are also bad habits. Try to avoid them so that you don’t damage your teeth or fillings.

, Regular checkups and cleanings are an integral part of maintaining oral health. See your dentist at least twice a year, or more often if you’re having any issues with your teeth or fillings."

Take antibiotics.,
Use zinc supplements.,
Practice proper hygiene while sick.",How to Control Cholera2," Doctors prescribe antibiotics to help control diarrhea brought on by cholera. These antibiotics won’t necessarily kill the bacteria responsible for cholera, but they will shorten your symptoms. Talk to your doctor before to get these prescriptions. Typical medications that are prescribed are:Doxycycline only requires a single pill. It is not recommended for children or pregnant women due to possible effects on tooth development, but should still be used if it is the only option.Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, known as TMP-SMX, Bactrim, or Septra, is recommended for children.
Tetracycline, like doxycycline, is not recommended for children if other options are available.Furazolidone is recommended for pregnant women.

, In order to combat diarrhea, take zinc supplements. Studies show that zinc supplements can help control diarrhea problems because zinc makes the lining in your stomach and intestines less vulnerable to irritation, even when you have cholera. It is recommended that you take:


50 to 300 mg per day if you are an adult
20 mg a day for 10 to 14 days for children six months or older
10 mg a day for 10 to 14 days for children younger than six months, Despite feeling weak and awful, it is really important that you continue to keep up your hygiene practices. You don't get sicker or spread the cholera to others. Wash your hands whenever you go to the bathroom or deal with dirty diapers.


To prevent further water contamination, make sure you dispose of your and others human waste properly, even if you do not have a proper toilet.

"
"
Drink safe water.,
Purify your water.,
Wash your containers.,
Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Dispose of waste properly.,
Eat only fully cooked food.,
Maintain your hygiene.,
Understand the most common risk factors.",How to Control Cholera3," If you are traveling through or living in an area where cholera is present, only drink water that is either bottled or has been treated. Bottled water is always a good bet, so long as the bottle cap is sealed when you purchase the water.


Make sure you wipe the lip and cap of any bottle to remove any lingering cholera bacteria that might have gotten on the outside of the bottle.

, If you are in an area known to have cholera, treat or purify any water you get before you drink it. There are many ways to purify water, but some of the best and most efficient include:


Boiling the water. Put the water in a clean pot or heat-resistant container and bring it to a boil over heat. Continue to let the water boil and bubble for at least one minute, then remove it from the heat. Let the water cool down a bit before you drink.
Use bleach. Add around eight drops of bleach to a gallon of water or two drops of bleach for every one liter of water. Shake and let the water stand for at least 30 minutes before you drink it.Use iodine purification tablets or liquid. Iodine works as a water purifier, which you can get prepackaged as tablets at most outdoor adventure stores and pharmacies. Follow the instructions on tablets’ packaging. If you have a liquid 2% tincture of iodine, you can add five drops to every quart of clear water., Storing your clean, treated water properly is very important. Make sure you keep your water in clean, airtight containers. Use treated water to clean your containers and keep them covered if you store them outside.


This will ensure that cholera bacteria does not get on the containers through contaminated rinsing water.

, To prevent the spread of cholera bacteria, you should follow proper hand hygiene. Follow the three minute rule when washing your hands. Start by wetting your hands and lathering them with soap. Rub your palms together and then rub the backs of each of your hands for at least 20 seconds. Clean the areas between your fingers and then work your way up to your wrists. Rinse your hands thoroughly with clean water and then pat them dry. This should all take about three minutes.You should also wash your hands often.


Wash your hands before preparing a meal and eating. You should also wash them after eating.
Remember to wash after going to the bathroom, changing soiled diapers, and caring for someone with diarrhea.
Clean your hands with hand sanitizer if there is no soap present.

, You should always defecate in a bathroom. However, sometimes this may not be possible, like when you are hiking in a remote part of a third world country. If you do have to go to the bathroom outside, make sure that you get as far away from a water source as possible because it can contaminate the water.


After going to the bathroom, bury your feces and wash your hands with clean water and soap.You can also defecate into a plastic bag, tie it up, and bury it far away from a water source.
If you are concerned a bathroom might have cholera in it, clean it with a bleach mixture. Mix one part bleach with nine parts water and clean everything thoroughly.

, The cholera virus thrives in contaminated water, which means you should not eat food that is raw. This means that all your food, including meat and vegetables, has not been cooked at all. This is a good rule to follow whenever you are in a foreign country, but is particularly important when you are in an area affected by cholera.Always check to make sure that your food is thoroughly cooked. One of the best ways to do this is by cooking the food yourself. If you do happen to go out to eat, don’t be afraid to ask the waiter how a certain dish is prepared.
Always wash fruit with treated water and stick to fruit that has a protective layer that you don’t eat, such as a papaya, passion fruit, or orange.
Only eat cooked seafood. Make sure that it is cooked all the way through and try to eat it while it is still hot. , Make sure that you and your surroundings are always clean, which will help to keep you from getting cholera. Bathe twice a day with water that has been treated. If you can’t bathe with treated water, try to keep water from getting into your eyes, mouth, nose, and ears.Ensure that your bathroom is at least 30 meters, or 98.4 ft, from your water source. This will prevent your water source from contamination.

, There are certain situations that are cause more of a risk than others. During these situations, you need to be extra careful and follow as many safety precautions as possible. These situations include:


Travel to epidemic areas
Exposure to food or water that has been contaminated
Having O type blood, since these individuals are more severely affected by cholera compared to blood group type AB
Having a low gastric acid secretion
A history of gastrectomy
Taking acid-suppressing medications"

After your have followed the specific checklist to your aircraft.,

When you have received clearance or provided other traffic with your intentions taxi onto the runway and align with the center line.
,

Apply full throttle to the aircraft (push throttle all the way in), ensure that the airspeed indicator comes alive by checking that it shows an increasing reading of airspeed.
,





When the aircraft reaches the targeted airspeed of 50 knots (no X-winds), gently apply back pressure on the control column to ""Rotate"" the nose gently off the runway.,
As the aircraft gains some altitude make adjustments to the amount of back pressure applied on the control column so the airspeed indicator reads 68 knots.,

To alleviate the need for constant back pressure on the control column in order to maintain the targeted speed you can trim the aircraft.,
Every 500 feet (152.4 m) of altitude you gain gently lower the nose by pushing forward on the control column so that you have a good view of what's in front of you.,
Once the lookout has been performed and it is safe to continue the climb allow the aircraft to bring its nose back up.,When you have reached your desired altitude lower the nose so that the plane is no longer gaining altitude by pushing forward on the controls.,

When the climb has stopped decrease the amount of throttle so the RPM indicator shows between 2300-2400 rpm.
,

Trim the aircraft using the trim wheel so that the aircraft no longer wants to climb by itself.",How to Take off in a Cessna 150 and Climb to Cruising Altitude at Best Rate of Climb,", Taxi to the runway and hold short (come to a complete stop at the yellow line). Check that there are no other aircraft on final approach. When the way is clear make a radio call to ensure that the tower and other traffic know your intentions.,,, Be sure not to pull back too far and cause the aircraft to lose too much speed. Accelerate and maintain 65-70 knots., This is the speed where the aircraft will gain the most altitude for the amount of time. If the aircraft is going too slow, gently lower the nose slightly until the airspeed rises to the targeted airspeed of 68knots., Once the aircraft is stabilized into a climb at 68 knots trim the aircraft using the trim wheel. To trim the aircraft so the nose points more towards the ground rotate the wheel upwards, rotate the wheel downwards to raise the aircraft nose. This may take some adjustment. After you have trimmed the aircraft correctly it will maintain the targeted speed., Perform a lookout for any conflicting aircraft or terrain that may cause a problem to your flight., Remember that it is still trimmed so this should take little effort from you.,,, This will most likely require you to rotate the trim wheel up so the nose of the aircraft comes down."

Reflect on your work style.,
Identify who (if anyone) has an issue with your work style.,
Talk to the individual(s).,
Do something nice for the individual(s) in your workplace.",How to Improve Work Relationships," There are several things you should look for in the way that you work: Identifying your strengths and weaknesses might help you understand why your work relationship with your colleagues is suffering.


What are your strengths (for example, are you a hard worker who doesn't stop until the job is done)?
What are your weaknesses (for example, do you usually leave things until the last minute)?;
, This might not be very obvious, since most people will choose not to tell you what it is that bothers them about your working style. This will help narrow the list of people you need to improve your relationship with.

, This might be a hard step to take if you had a conflict with this person, but you should not hesitate to address the issue directly with the person. As long as you approach them in a friendly, non-threatening way, you might be able to resolve the problem without conflict. If you are simply looking to improve your relationship with your colleagues, most people will welcome your conversation because they will see it as an effort to improve your interpersonal skills. They will likely offer constructive feedback on what you are doing well, and how you can improve.

, This doesn't need to be something major - it can be as simple as bringing them a coffee or small snack, or helping them out when they need it. If your coworkers see that you are willing to go out of your way to do something nice for them, they will likely be more trusting and supportive of you, and will want to repay the favour in the future.

Start with yourself.,
Set deadlines and tell people about them.,
Work in 90 minute intervals.,
Take breaks regularly.,
Follow the 2-minute rule.,
Take advantage of your commute.,
Commit to multiple drafts of everything.,
Handle your email more efficiently.",How to Improve Your Business Productivity1," If you want to increase the productivity of your business, there is no better place to start than with your own workday. Making yourself more productive will not only be a boost to your company, it will also teach you techniques that you can pass on to your employees.;
, With open-ended tasks or projects, setting a self-imposed deadline can provide motivation to work harder. It works even better if you inform other people of your self-imposed deadline, as this will make you more accountable for sticking to it., Research shows that after 90 minutes, productivity begins to decline. To maximize your productivity, work in four to five 90 minute sessions, with breaks inbetween., Studies show that taking short, regular breaks helps to maintain focus and to prevent a decline in performance.Even briefly switching your attention to another task for a minute or two a few times an hour can help to maintain focus over the longterm.Taking a break to exercise once a day – even if this only means a brisk walk or a couple of trips up and down the stairs – will boost your productivity even more.

, If a task comes up that you can complete in 2 minutes or less, do it immediately. It will take less time than coming back to it later, and it will provide a brief break that will make you more focused when you return to the task at hand., E-mail, to-do lists, brainstorming, and document review are great tasks to get done whenever you find yourself with “bonus” time, whether it’s during your commute or while in the waiting room at your doctor’s office., All your work product – not just writing – should be done in multiple “drafts” instead of wasting time trying to make it perfect the first time around. Hammer out something that works and have someone else look at it, or come back to it later with a fresh mind. You’ll find you can complete projects much more quickly if you do them in four or five “drafts” than if you try to get it just right the first time.

, The average worker spends 28% of his workday managing his email. That’s over 11 hours out of a 40 hour work week. To win back some of that time:Set times to check your email. Checking email seems like work, only it’s a lot easier than a lot of other work, so much so that many people check it 10 or more times an hour. That wastes time. Instead, try checking your email three times a day – when you arrive, after lunch, and before you leave. At most, check it once an hour.

Don’t use folders. It may seem organized, but it turns out that filing your emails into folders is actually a much less efficient way to find them when you need them than simply leaving them in your inbox and remembering when you received them.

Unsubscribe from mail lists. On average, 50% of the email workers receive is junk. It takes only a few seconds to delete that email, but over the course of the year, those seconds can add up to hours.

Apply the same productivity boosting techniques that you use.,
Allow for remote work and flexible hours.,
Show appreciation for your employees.,
Create a culture of accountability.,
Use work teams.,
Give your employees varied work.,
Invest in training.,
Commit to improvement.",How to Improve Your Business Productivity2," Once you’ve learned how to boost your own productivity, you can take what works for you and apply it, if possible, to your work force.



Encourage breaks. Telling your employees to take breaks may not work, so create them: celebrate birthdays, have weekly group activities, organize team lunches.

Create an email policy. If employees want an immediate response, they should call one another or visit one another’s office. Expecting email to be read immediately leads to constant email checking, which wastes time.

Set deadlines. Even for extremely long-term or open-ended projects, your employees will work with more motivation if you create goals and deadlines for them to meet along the way.

Give employees access to a gym. Having an office gym, or giving employees automatic membership to a nearby gym, can increase exercise and productivity. You can also use monthly challenges to boost participation.

, It doesn’t matter where and when work gets done, so long as it gets done. Research by Gallup shows that employees who work remotely part of the time are more engaged and actually work longer hours. Give your employees the flexibility to do their work when and where they work best., Workers who feel appreciated will be more motivated and productive. Praise employees publicly during meetings. Give spot awards. Profile employees and their work in company publications.If an employee puts in extra work on a project, recognize this. If you fail to reward hard work, your employees will not work as hard., If workers are given ownership of their work and know they will receive feedback, they will work more meticulously. Accountability also means giving workers a clear sense of the direction of the company and how their work contributes to driving the company in that direction. If they feel like their work matters, rather than just being cogs in a huge machine, they will work harder.Offering economic incentives tied to clear targets is a great way to increase employee commitment and drive at all levels of your business., Working in teams can improve work product by allowing for multiple points of view. It also makes workers more conscientious, since they do not want to let down the team or appear less competent than their peers. Finally, it prevents the isolation that can leave workers feeling ignored and unimportant., While most of the work each employee does will be in his or her area of expertise, doing the same thing over and over again can lead to burn out. Varying the type of work and the work setting – i.e. solo versus group – can keep tasks fresh, as well as expanding your workforce's skills and giving them a more holistic view of the company., All your employees will benefit from training, as it both makes them more valuable employees and creates a sense of indebtedness to the business, which leads to harder work. Pay particular attention to supervisors and middle managers who are just stepping into leadership roles. They are the key to transmitting upper management's vision and organizing work in an efficient manner, so extra management training for these positions will go a long way towards improving company productivity., To constantly increase productivity, leadership must commit to a constant process of change. This process has four parts:



Determine a baseline. If you are producing service-oriented products, what is your total revenue per hour worked? What are the base services you offer, and how much time do they typically take? If you are manufacturing, how long does it typically take to produce your product? Do you have excess input materials or inventory? What percent of your products are defective when first produced?

Identify Areas for Improvement. Maybe you want to be able to take on more work product without hiring staff. Perhaps you want to decrease the number of defective products that require reworking.

Establish a process of change and metrics of success. This process can take months or even years. You will need to test out new processes to see if they are creating improvement along the established metrics.

Adopt and Train. If a process works, you will need to train your managers first, and via them your employees to implement it.

Purchase technology that works with a minimum of time and effort.,
Get workers the computers they need.,
Provide the technology your workers need to work wherever they are.,
Use virtual meeting and task tracking.,
Have your employees use to-do list applications.,
Invest in multiple programs for specific tasks, rather than trying to do more with one program.",How to Improve Your Business Productivity3," The goal of technology is to increase efficiency and save time, so if it takes a small team of full-time employees to maintain your technology, or your staff is constantly running into problems, then it is not working for you. Opt for the solutions that take the least time and effort to set up and maintain., Old computers may save money, but seconds spent every day booting up or waiting while machines grind away can add up across your workforce. Investing in new computers not only saves time, it shows your employees that you care about giving them the best tools available. They will reward you by giving you their best work., Workers who do some of their work remotely have been shown to be more productive. Another great way to boost productivity is to work during “bonus” time such as a commute or while waiting for appointments. To take advantage of this type of work, your employees need the right technology.



Laptops – Laptops are key for allowing employees to work remotely, but only if they sync with office computers and programs.

Smart phones and tablets – They allow workers to check their email and edit documents while on the go.

Programs that sync across multiple devices – Whatever is on your worker’s desktop computers should be available on their laptops, smart phones, and tablets as well. This creates a connected, flexible workforce. If employees can only access certain programs at their desk, then you lose valuable flexibility that could let them put in more hours.

Collaborative technology – Invest in business social network software like Tibbr, Jive, and Yammer, and use communication services like Skype and Google Hangouts to keep your employees connected even when they are off site.The Cloud – Moving your business onto the cloud makes work easier to share and accessible from anywhere., Think of all the time your employees spend checking in with one another to be sure tasks have been completed, or discussing their progress in meetings. Virtual task tracking software like Flow, HiTask, Producteev and Asana allows team members to instantly update their progress on a project so that other team members can access the information from anywhere.This allows for shorter meetings, less back and forth email, and thus greater efficiency., These inexpensive programs, like Todoist, Wunderlist, Task, and Pocket List, allow you to prioritize your tasks based on deadlines or other parameters, thereby ensuring that projects are finished on time., Programs designed for specific functions, like customer relations management for instance, are much more powerful and easier to use for those tasks than more generalized programs like Excel. Boost productivity by purchasing task-specific software."
"
Aim to be understood.,
Make eye contact.,
Monitor your body language.,
Practice speaking.,
Develop your writing skills.,
Practice active listening skills.,
Pay attention to the other person's body language.",How to Improve Soft Skills1," Your goal, whether speaking or writing, should be to communicate clearly. Fancy or highfalutin language can oftentimes make the point you're trying to make confusing or unclear. Some ideas to improve your clarity in communication include:


Staying on topic. Focus on the point of your communication. This could be something as simple as determining whether your coworker is free for lunch.
Be specific when communicating. You may have difficulty getting to the point. To improve your clarity, use specific terms instead of general pronouns or indefinite periods of time.;
, Acknowledge that you are paying attention to someone by meeting their gaze eye to eye. Eye contact will make your conversation partner feel like you're more engaged. If you have difficulty doing this, turn your body to face the person you're speaking with.


By turning your body to face your conversation partner directly, you'll naturally be more likely to look them in the eye.
If you're uncomfortable looking someone directly in the eyes, choose a point just above or below the eyes, like the bridge of the nose, and look there instead.
Even if there are other distractions in the room, keep your eyes focused on your conversation partner. Allowing your gaze to wander can come across as rude., Show interest by sitting up and leaning forward slightly. Resist the urge to tap your fingers or foot, as this can indicate impatience. You can also connect with conversation partners by mimicking their posture.


Although it might seem odd at first, by mimicking the posture of your conversation partner, you're subconsciously sending the message that you both are the same, which will put them at ease.
Try to curb unconscious motions that could be taken the wrong way, like playing with your hair or bouncing your leg up and down., This includes both public speaking and casual conversation. Even if you're uncomfortable speaking in front of others, practice will make speaking come more easily and improve your ability. Be conscious of your pace and volume while practicing.


If you are uneasy in personal relationships, try practicing with a close friend or family member you are comfortable with.
If you are nervous about speaking in public, volunteer to give presentations within a smaller group and work your way up to a larger one., Much like speaking, the more you write, the easier it will become. You can also take courses to improve your writing. You can do writing exercises on your own. You can also frequently find affordable writing workshops offered at community centers or community colleges.When you finish writing something, be sure to glance it over for grammar and spelling errors. This only takes a minute or two, and can drastically improve the quality of your written work.
Be direct and to the point instead of elaborate. Although you may feel uncomfortable with this at first, being direct can greatly improve the clarity of your writing.

, Listening requires focus and self-discipline. We listen for many different reasons: to understand instructions, to empathize with another individual, or to judge whether a plan is good or not. You can show your conversation partner you're paying attention by:


Paraphrasing and asking questions about what was said. This demonstrates interest and focus. It also helps you understand the situation.
Taking notes when appropriate. This shows that the subject matter is important to you. Practice taking notes in team meetings or staff training sessions.
Refraining from interrupting others. Show you respect your speaking partner by letting them finish saying what they are saying., Observe their posture, tone of voice, eye contact (or lack thereof), gestures, and facial expressions. This can offer clues for how you might best respond and can help you better understand your conversation partner's frame of mind.For example, if your coworker has red eyes and is sniffling, you might surmise that they have allergies or a cold. In this situation, you might want to be more sensitive, as it's likely they don't feel well.
If your speaking partner keeps checking the time, they might be enjoying your conversation but have an appointment to keep.

Build relationships.,
Be friendly with colleagues.,
Manage conflict in a healthy way.,
Network with people inside and outside your organization.,
Practice leading.",How to Improve Soft Skills2," Interpersonal skills are important in the workplace, especially since so many organizations are designed around teams and departments. Seek to build friendships with peers, supervisors, clients, and business partners.


Invite coworkers, colleagues, and supervisors to local events, like block parties, museum events, concerts, and more.

Host a party of your own and invite your coworkers, colleagues, and supervisors. An informal setting might be just the place to cement your relationship., Greet them when they get to work. Invite them to lunch or coffee. Talk for a few minutes in the break room as you are getting a drink. Participate in work events like softball clubs, staff lunches, and training days. These are great ways to strengthen your professional relationships.


Try to avoid gossip. Talking about others is often interpreted as rude, and should the individual you're talking about find out it could harm your relationship with them., Address issues with the individual(s) involved in a private manner. Approach the discussion in a nonjudgmental but assertive manner. Ask questions and try to understand their side of the story. Work together to find a solution.


Some people are uncomfortable with conflict. Get around that discomfort by acknowledging it and saying something like, ""You might feel a little uncomfortable - I do too. But our relationship is important to me and I'd like to talk about..."", Ask people about their jobs and share a bit about what you do. Note connections and ways you could potentially help each other. Exchange contact information and be sure to follow up with them.


Sometimes it can be inconvenient to exchange information in the moment. A business card with your information on it can make exchanging details much easier., Leadership can be defined as your ability to influence other people, oftentimes with regard to making decisions. As such, leadership skills can be used by any employee at any level in an organization. To improve your leadership skills:


Observe your supervisor and note how that individual leads your team. Find positive things that person does and emulate them in your own work.
Practice leading in small group discussions by asking your teammates questions and bringing quieter members into the conversation.Discipline yourself to display a positive attitude in difficult situations. Remain calm in moments of crisis.
Talk about concerns one-on-one with your supervisor instead of in front of the entire team. Doing so will show respect and will set a good example for others."
"
Take initiative.,
Do tasks without being asked by someone else.,
Seek more challenging work.,
Improve your problem solving skills.,
Boost your creativity.",How to Improve Soft Skills3," Show responsibility and enthusiasm for your job by striving to go the extra mile. Finish your work without having to be reminded by your supervisor. When you have spare time, offer to help colleagues.


Be polite when offering to help a colleague. Some might not want help. You might casually mention, ""Hey Alice, I finished my work early and though I could lend you a hand."", Be aware of your surroundings. When you see something that needs to be done, do it. Even small things, like emptying a full garbage can or cleaning the break room when you've got some spare time on your hands can earn you points with your colleagues and supervisors.


At team or departmental meetings, pay attention to the assignment of responsibilities. You may notice that one of your colleagues has a big project, which would be a great opportunity to offer your help with smaller tasks so they can focus on what's important., Strive to develop your technical skills. Learn more about your organization. Ask coworkers about their departments. Take a class, read a pertinent blog, or subscribe to a magazine in your field of work.


There are many professional associations that put out magazines and newsletters. Search for these online and join them to broaden your professional awareness.
There may be a certification or professional accreditation that is associated with your job. These can add a lot to your professional credibility, and can make you a more viable candidate for promotions., When approaching any problem, it's important to be focused on the solution. Keep an open mind so that even unlikely solutions aren't written off. Use open language, like ""what if"" or ""imagine if"" to encourage your brain in finding creative solutions. Games that challenge problem solving can help here too. Some you might try include:ChessVideo and computer gamesCard games (like Uno and Hearts)Scrabble, You might be surprised at the activities that can build your creativity. Walking, for example, will improve your creativity during the walk and for a short time afterwards.Collaborate with colleagues to generate ideas. Find inspiration in other places, like museums or industries other than your own.


Although this might seem counter intuitive, by allowing your mind to wander and daydream, you'll receive a creative increase. When a problem is giving you difficulty, allow your mind to wander for 15 minutes or so, then return to it."

Keep the room clean.,
Make space for people to linger, but only for a short while.,
Design the room so that it doesn't blend in with the rest of the office.,
Provide some amenities.,
Make sure the room is well-maintained.,
Include natural lighting if possible.,
Get feedback from employees.",How to Improve an Office Break Room," Nobody likes a crusty microwave, sticky refrigerator or coffeemaker one or two brews from disrepair. Make it everyone's responsibility to keep it tidy and clean up after themselves, and on an occasional basis, have the room thoroughly or professionally cleaned from top to bottom.;
, Placing a comfortable sofa or TV with a thousand channels isn't a good idea if employee productivity matters, but there should at least be a table with a few chairs for people to eat lunch or snacks.

, The goal is to make it a separate place from the rest of the office, so switch up the paint color, change the flooring or lighting, etc. When it comes to furniture, try buying home furnishings, rather than more office pieces. For employees, sitting in comfortable, homey chairs while they're on break, rather than office chairs or cheap fold-out seats, can make a world of difference in recharging for the rest of the day.

, Generally speaking, even the most basic break rooms feature a microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker, cups, utensils, etc. If you want to go the extra mile, consider putting some healthy food options in the pantry, and put out treats like donuts or bagels every once in a while.


Some offices even go a step further, providing features like espresso machines, free vending machines, or even televisions and video games.

, A broken fridge or lights that need to be replaced give off a bad impression.

, Some studies have shown that exposure to natural lighting in the workplace actually has a positive correlation with better health and overall quality of life for employees.Whether or not you're concerned with the health effects, it's clear that natural light just feels nicer to sit in than traditional office lighting. If possible, make your break room somewhere with windows or skylights; if not, consider at least adding some light bulbs that emulate natural lighting and the warmth of the sun, instead of a colder, harsher light.

, Take their suggestions into consideration on how they would like to see the break room improved. After all, it is meant to be used and enjoyed by everyone.

Although the information on your credit report may not be as thorough as the information you could get from Social Security or from the IRS, it has the benefit of being free.

"
Take a look at the person’s work week.,
Look at his attitude towards money.,
Notice if the person often seems distracted.,
See if he takes on too much.,
See if he constantly checks electronic devices.,
Notice what he enjoys discussing.,
Look out for burn-out.,
Watch out for signs of anxiety.,
See if she experiences sleep disturbance.,
Look out for signs of depression.,
Observe her relationships.,
Talk to the person about what you’ve observed.,
Help the person prioritize.,
Make an electronics-free pact with the person.,
Help the person get support.",How to Identify a Workaholic," Maybe he works more than 40 hours per week on a regular basis. You see he never has time to do anything with you or other people in his life. For a workaholic, work is the top priority. You notice that he misses out on everyday events such as family dinners, walking the dog and getting a good night’s sleep.


You might notice relationship problems. He rarely shows up at events such as his kid’s school play or his friend’s birthday party. Building strong relationships takes time. He devotes all of his time to work instead of his loved ones.;
, He thinks money is the key to a better life. A workaholic overemphasizes the importance of money. He might tell you he’ll be happy once he gets a promotion or a raise. Yet, once he gets the promotion, it’s not enough. He's preoccupied with climbing the career ladder. Or you might notice the person comparing himself to wealthier people. He might want an expensive luxury car or another designer watch to outdo his neighbor. Yet once he buys it, he's not satisfied.Money helps fulfill important needs. Everyone needs money to keep a roof over their head, to put food on the table and to provide for themselves and their loved ones. Aside from meeting the basic needs of survival and safety, money doesn’t help anyone meet other important needs such as self-esteem, love, belonging and self-fulfillment. No one goes to their deathbed wishing they worked more or had more money. A workaholic can’t keep this in perspective., A workaholic is preoccupied with what’s happening at work even during days off. He might even skip vacation because he can’t stand to be away from work. When he is on vacation, he's not relaxing or enjoying anything. A workaholic is fixated on what might be happening at work or what he needs to do once he gets back to work.Recognize the difference between a hard worker and a workaholic. A hard worker takes breaks and enjoys vacation. A workaholic rarely takes breaks and when he has a day off, he wishes he were back at work. A hard worker is dedicated while a workaholic is obsessed.

, A workaholic is usually a perfectionist. He thinks no one can do a better job than he can. The person takes on a lot of responsibility and rarely asks for help. The problem with this approach is perfection is impossible to reach. Humans make mistakes and need help. The person might tell you he hates working in a team. You offer to help him make dinner and he refuses your help. You try to pitch in and he tells you you’re doing it wrong. He's hard to work with and difficult to please.Notice if the person usually underestimates the time it takes to do something. Since he doesn't like to ask for help and is overbooked, he ends up rushing to get everything done. This situation is counterproductive. By taking on everything, nothing gets done well. He starts to get things done late or not at all.
A workaholic wants to control everything. He often sees work as a reflection of himself. If he takes on a lot of responsibility at work, it gives his self-esteem a boost. He wants to be the go-to person for everything. The problem is if something doesn’t go his way at work, his self-esteem will crash. Just like perfection, being able to control everything is a myth. Many things are outside of his control., Laptops, smartphones and tablets blur the line between professional and personal life. You often see the person sneaking in another email or IM message. Checking his work email and working on projects outside of business hours throws off his work and life balance.


You might notice him getting anxious if he can’t check up on what’s happening at work. If you ask him to put down his cell phone, he snaps at you and refuses. A workaholic feels like his world will end if he can’t check on his work email 24/7. If just the idea of being without his electronic device makes him anxious, it’s a sign that the person is a workaholic.

, When you’re having a casual conversation, is work the only topic he brings up? When you talk to him about topics unrelated to work, does the person tune you out? If work is his sole focus, he hasn't spent any time developing interests and hobbies unrelated to work. Work is the only thing that defines him.A workaholics feel like anything unrelated to work is a waste of his time. While work is an important part of life, it’s not the only thing that matters. Developing other interests and hobbies is important and makes a person feel better about himself.

, Constantly working takes a toll. Burn-out means the person is physically and mentally exhausted from overworking. Burn-out makes it difficult for her to cope with normal, everyday ups and downs. She might be impatient and irritable with you and others. You notice the person overreacts to little things. For example, maybe you ask her a simple question and she gets really angry with you. Imagine the person is a cup. As a cup, she can hold only a certain amount of water before it’s spilling over the sides. The person can only handle so much before she has to let things go. If she fills her cup with nothing but work, she has no room for family, friends or herself.

, She experiences excessive worry. She fears things people normally wouldn’t such as hearing the phone ring or going out to public places. The person tells you she dreads going to work or she feels like something bad is about to happen to her. She might experience episodes of panic where her heart beats rapidly and her thoughts race. Sometimes it's so bad that she feels like she's having a heart attack. She might even shake or sweat during these anxiety episodes.Normal anxiety is feeling nervous before a big event such as taking a test or delivering a presentation. An anxiety disorder is feeling nervous most of the time or having intense feelings of panic that come out of nowhere.

, The person might say she never sleeps or only sleeps for a few hours a night. A workaholic either works or thinks about work when she should be sleeping. Sleep deprivation leads to memory loss, lack of concentration and fatigue. A good night’s rest improves energy, motivation and overall well being. There are four phases of sleep that repeat approximately every 90 minutes. When a person sleeps for less than seven hours, she cannot cycle through all the phases. The result is she's tired and sluggish the next day.

, The constant stress from working too much can put a workaholic at risk for depression. See if the person loses interest in things she used to enjoy, withdraws from people or says she feels helpless. Other symptoms include a change in eating patterns, such as overeating or losing her appetite, fatigue, agitation and irritability. You might notice her not wanting to get out of bed or having episodes of crying and intense sadness.Depression is more than feeling down or sad. Everyone has a day here or there where they feel down. Depression is feeling down, irritable and hopeless most of the time for days, weeks or months.

, Since all her time is spent working, she's disconnected from friends and family. People start to resent her. For example, when her child draws a picture of his family, he leaves his workaholic mother out of it. Or when her friends get together, they don’t bother to include the person since she never shows up anyway. Being a workaholic leads to a very lonely existence.


Another difference between a workaholic and a hard worker is the impact of work on her relationships. A workaholic neglects her relationships. A hard worker makes time for her loved ones.

, Prepare for him to deny what you’re saying. Denial is a strong defense mechanism. Denial protects a person from seeing the impact of his actions. The person is invested in seeing the positive aspects of his behavior and denying the negative ones. He either ignores the problems caused by his work obsession or he passes the blame on to others. For example, he might blame his spouse or partner for the problems in his relationship rather than seeing his part in things. Be honest about what you’ve seen. Avoid criticizing or judging. For example, you could say, “Lately I've noticed that you're working a lot more than usual. You don't seem to be sleeping much and you're on the phone frequently, even when we're out to lunch together. I'm worried about you, and I'd like to help.” Avoid saying something like, “You’re crazy for working so much. You must be addicted to work. You need to stop it.”
Remember that you can’t force the person to accept help if he's not ready. He'll need time to thinks about his actions and decide if he wants to change. Be patient and try bringing it up again later. Eventually, he might come around and be ready for change.

, Once he realizes life can no longer revolve around work, you can help him come up with a plan. He needs to change how he spends his time each day. A good way to evaluate how he spends his time is to write down everything he wants to and needs to do. Then categorize the urgent, important and not important tasks. .First, the person writes down all of the tasks he needs to complete in a day. He includes his job tasks, chores, activities with family and friends, pet care and self-care such as sleeping, eating, exercising, hobbies and relaxing. He lists everything in no particular order. He should make his list as inclusive as possible.
He then organizes his list according to three categories: Urgent, Important, Non-important. Urgent means if he doesn't do the task that day, there will be serious and immediate repercussions. For example, if he doesn't pay the phone bill, his service will be cut off. Important things have no immediate repercussions but they may have serious long-term consequences. For example, he needs to exercise so he can stay healthy, or he needs to go to his child’s school play to strengthen his parent-child bond. Non-important tasks have no immediate or serious repercussions. For example, sweeping the floor can wait until another day since no one is hurt by it.
At least 75% of his time should be spent on important tasks, 20% on urgent tasks and 5% on not important tasks. He can shift or eliminate tasks that are taking up too much time. For example, he treats every work email like it’s urgent. He responds immediately regardless of the request and checks his email all day and into the night. Instead, he limits checking work email to three times a day and only responds immediately when it’s truly critical.

, Ask him to agree to unplugging the TV, shutting off his tablet and tucking away his laptop and phone. Designate an electronic-free time each day, and hold him to it. It’ll help the person resist the temptation to check-in on work and encourage him to spend time on himself and his loved ones.Schedule fun activities with the person. It will help him make the most of his electronic-free time. Walk the dog or go get coffee. Engage in activities that encourage face-to face communication and connection.

, If he's tried to change but is still stuck in his work-obsessed ways, help him connect with a counselor or support group. Support from professionals or peers can help him successfully balance work and life.Workaholics Anonymous is a free program with support groups across the United States and the world. People meet with others who are trying to work less and enjoy life more. They support each other through a 12-step program to free themselves from compulsively working.

Realize that there are ""right to work states,"" ""the free press"" and ""freedom of religion"" that guarantee areas that are outside of some various kinds of government force.,
Research, on the Internet, for example educate yourself by reading many different sources and consider calling your state representative, and get news releases about such laws as they occur in your state.,
Find out whether your state is a ""union state"" or a ""right to work state,"" and learn about any related laws and current legislation and similar matters.

,
Get legal help, if your government has or begins putting unionism into your business/home-businesses: this could be related to healthcare or childcare, and other matters as government provides.,
Consider learning about and even joining class-action lawsuits if applicable to you.,
Help to work against unionism in your state which you think is possibly unconstitutional.,
Consider researching about right to work organizations who may provide free legal advise or aid to those in such unionism.

,
Join one or more similar organizations formed of (concerned) citizens such as yourself, which may possibly support related law suits/class actions.,
Consider seeking, supporting, and working in campaigns for candidates who oppose/or favor compulsory unionism and your views on worker rights, and decide how to vote for your candidates!

","How to Help Oppose Automatic, State Forced, Compulsory Unionism (U.S.A.)",";
,


Example: In one situation there are as of May, 2011 about 45,000 ""home-care providers for disabled adults"" in Michigan, individual private contractors required to be unionized by law who receive payments from Michigan's Medicaid (mandated by Federal law) for these home-care providers.,,


Example: In a similar, but different situation, with free legal assistance, homecare workers have reached a settlement with Michigan government ensuring that the state will not continue to force ""home-based child-care providers"" into unions. Michigan had granted UAW and AFSCME union exclusive/monopoly bargaining power after an election in which only 15 percent of eligible child-care providers voted. That began in 2006 when Michigan unionized an estimated more than 40,000 home-based child-care providers into compulsory membership by passing state laws. Although the State of Michigan itself is not the employer for the child-care providers, the state pays a taxpayer subsidy for eligible children part of which goes directly or indirectly to the 40,000 workers in small businesses often run by independent contractors working in their own homes. But, now the new settlement ensures that the state will not force home childcare workers to financially support a union as a condition of taking care of children whose parents receive state assistance., These could set precedents to end similar unionism plans around the country and block unionism hidden in legislation, in your state.


Example: There is an ongoing class-action lawsuit that aims to order AFSCME and UAW union bosses to give back the estimated over four million dollars taken from Michigan child-care providers while this forced unionism was in operation.,


Example: A legal court action has attorneys challenging the Michigan union idea as a violation of the U.S. Constitution, a victory would serve as a precedent in other states and against similar provisions in similar cases around the nation.,, Perhaps join your efforts with others if you wish to pull together.

Understand that if you are opening your chakras, there is no need to try to make over-active chakras less active.,
Open the Root Chakra (red).,
Open the Sacral Chakra (Orange).,
Open the Navel Chakra (yellow).,
Open the Heart Chakra (green).,
Open the Throat Chakra (light blue).,
Open the Third Eye Chakra (Indigo).,
Open the Crown Chakra (purple).",How to Open Your Spiritual Chakras," They are simply compensating for the inactivity of closed chakras. Once all of the chakras are opened, the energy evens out, and becomes balanced.;
, This chakra is based on being physically aware and feeling comfortable in many situations. If opened, you should feel well-balanced and sensible, stable and secure. You don't distrust people around you for no reason.You feel present in what is happening right now and very connected to your physical body. If it's under-active: you tend to be fearful or nervous, and easily feel unwelcome. If it's over-active: you may be materialistic and greedy. You feel as if you should be secure and are unwelcome to a change.


Use the body and become aware of it. Do yoga, walk around the block, or do some manual house-cleaning. These activities let your body become known to you and will strengthen the chakra.






Ground yourself. This means that you should connect with the ground, and feel it beneath you. To do this, stand up straight and relaxed, put your feet shoulder-width apart, and slightly bend your knees. Move your pelvis forward a little, and keep your body balanced, so that your weight is evenly distributed over the soles of your feet. Then sink your weight forward. Stay in this position for several minutes.






After grounding yourself, sit cross-legged, as shown in the picture below.






Let the tips of your thumb and index finger touch gently, in a peaceful motion.






Concentrate on the Root Chakra and what it stands for, at the spot in between the genitals and the anus.






Silently, yet clearly, chant the sound ""LAM.""
All this time, let yourself relax, still thinking about the chakra, it's meaning, and how it does or should affect your life.
Keep doing this until you are completely relaxed. You may have a ""clean"" feeling.
Visualize a closed red flower. Imagine a very powerful energy radiating it: it slowly opens showing four red petals full of energy.






Contract the perineum holding breath and releasing.







, This chakra deals with feeling and sexuality. If open, feeling is released with liberty and are expressed without you being over-emotional. You would be open to affinity and can be passionate as well as outgoing. You also have no problems based on sexuality. If it's under-active: you tend to be unemotional or impassive, and are not very open to anybody. If it's over-active: you tend to be sensitive and emotional all the time. You may also be very sexual.


Sit on your knees, with your back straight, but relaxed.






Lay your hands in your lap, palms ups, on top of each other. Left hand underneath, the palm touching the back fingers of the right hand, and the thumbs touch gently.






Concentrate on the Sacral Chakra and what it stands for, at the sacral bone (lower back).






Silently, yet clearly, chant the sound ""VAM.""
All this time, let yourself relax, still thinking about the chakra, it's meaning, and how it does or should affect your life.
Keep doing this until you are completely relaxed. Again, you may have a ""clean"" feeling.

, This chakra encircles confidence, especially when in a group. When open, you should feel in control and have a good feeling of dignity in yourself. If it's under-active: you tend to be passive and indecisive. You could be frequently apprehensive and this doesn't reward you. If it's over-active: you tend to be imperious and aggressive.


Sit on your knees, with your back straight, but relaxed.






Put your hands before your stomach, slightly below your solar plexus. Let the fingers join at the tops, all pointing away from you. Cross the thumbs and straighten the fingers (this is important).






Concentrate on the Navel Chakra and what it stands for, at the spine, slightly above the navel.






Silently, yet clearly, chant the sound ""RAM.""
All this time, let yourself relax, even more, continuing to think about the chakra, it's meaning, and how it does or should affect your life.
Keep doing this until you are completely relaxed. You should have a ""clean"" feeling (for every chakra).

, This chakra is all about love, caring, and endearment. When open, you seem to be compassionate and friendly, always working in amicable relationships. If it's under-active: you tend to be cold and unfriendly. If it's over-active: you tend to be so ""loving"" towards people that you suffocate them, and you could be seen as selfish for it.


Sit cross-legged.






Let the tips of your index finger and thumb touch on both hands.






Put your left hand on your left knee and your right hand in front of the lower part of your breastbone.






Concentrate on the Heart Chakra and what it stands for, at the spine, level with the heart.






Silently, but clearly, chant the sound ""YAM.""
All this time, continue to relax your body and think of the chakra, it's meaning, and how it does or should affect your life.
Keep doing this until you are completely relaxed, and the ""clean"" feeling returns and/or intensifies within your body.

, This chakra is based on self-expression and communication. When the chakra is open, expressing yourself is easy, and art seems to be a great way to do this. If it's under-active: you tend not to speak too much, so you are classified as shy. If you lie often, this chakra can be blocked. If it's over-active: you tend to speak so much, it annoys a lot of people. You could also be a pretty bad listener.


Once again, sit on your knees.






Cross your fingers on the inside of your hands, without the thumbs. Let the thumbs touch at the tops, and pull them up a bit.






Concentrate on the Throat Chakra and what it stands for, at the base of the throat.






Silently, but clearly, chant the sound ""HAM.""
All this time, keep on relaxing your body, thinking of the chakra, it's meaning, and how it does or should affect your life.
Keep doing this for about five minutes, and the ""clean"" feeling will intensify once again.

, Like its name, this chakra deals with insight. When open, you have excellent clairvoyance and tend to dream a lot. If it's under-active: you tend to look up to other people to think for you. Relying on beliefs too often, you also tend to be confused most of the time. If it's over-active: you tend to live in a world imagination all day long. In the extremes, you could suffer from frequent daydreams or even hallucinations.


Sit cross-legged.






Put your hands in front of the lower part of the breast. The middle fingers should be straight and touch the tops, pointing away from you. The other fingers are bent and touch at the two upper phalanges. The thumbs point towards you and meet at the tops.






Concentrate on the Third Eye Chakra and what it stands for, a little above the center of the two eyebrows.






Silently, but clearly, chant the sound ""OM"" or ""AUM.""
All this time, relaxation of the body should come a bit naturally and continue to think of the chakra, it's meaning, and how it does or should affect your life.
Keep doing this until the same ""clean"" feeling seems to come back or intensify.

, This is the seventh and most spiritual chakra. It encircles a being's wisdom and being one with the universe. When this chakra is open, prejudice disappears from your To Do list, and you seem to become more aware of the world and it's connection to yourself. If it's under-active: you tend to not be very spiritual and may be quite rigid in your thoughts. If it's over-active: you tend to intellectualize things all the time. Spirituality seems to come first in your mind, and if you are really over-active, you may even ignore your bodily needs (food, water, shelter).


Sit cross-legged.
Lay your hand on your stomach. Let the little fingers point up and away from you, touching at their tops, and cross the rest of the fingers with the left thumb underneath the right.






Concentrate on the Crown Chakra and what it stands for, at the very top of your head.






Silently, but clearly, chant the sound ""NG"" (yes, this chant is as hard as it looks).
All this time, your body should now be totally relaxed, and your mind should be at peace. However, do not stop concentrating on the Crown Chakra.
This meditation is the longest, and should take no less than ten minutes.
WARNING: don't use this meditation for the Crown Chakra if your Root Chakra is not strong or open. Before dealing with this last chakra, you need a strong ""foundation"" first, which the Root exercises will present to you.

Decide what information you need.,
Determine how far back you want to go.,
Choose a verification service.,
Get consent from the employee candidate.,
Receive the verification report.,
Meet with the candidate.",How to Get Proof of Employment1," Which service works best for you may depend on the specific details you need to prove for a particular candidate.


Services can confirm the start and end dates of the candidate's previous jobs, the titles and duties of those jobs, as well as salary figures. In some states, you also can learn about the reason for the employee's termination and whether the company considers him or her eligible for rehire.The law regarding what former employers can disclose varies widely among states, so it's worth checking your state's law if you think verifying the candidate's previous job performance, professional conduct, or reasons for termination are important.;
, Typically employers want to verify either a certain number of previous employers or employment for a certain number of years.


The way you want to define this depends not only on your company's needs but the work history of the candidate. For example, if someone applies to work for you who has been working for the same employer for six years, an employment verification that went back five years would only capture that one job.
Many employers favor the approach of reviewing a candidate's past five years of work history or last two employers, whichever is longer.Keep in mind that some applicants may have gaps in their employment history that would cause difficulty if you went with a strictly years-based approach.For example, if you were reviewing the past five years, but the applicant was out of work for two years giving birth and taking care of an infant, your five years would only capture three years of work.

, Based on your assessment of your needs, you can find a verification service that will deliver the information you need the most efficiently and cost-effectively.


Not only are there different verification services that have access to different databases and information, but each service may have several different options from which you can choose the one that best suits your company.
For example, Equifax provides employment verifications through its service, The Work Number. These services vary in price depending on whether you need salary information or simply need to confirm where the candidate worked and how long he or she worked there., Your verification service probably will require a signed consent document before it completes the search.

In some states such as Delaware and Oklahoma, consent from the candidate is required by law if you want to contact former employers or look into his or her employment history.If you're looking for work, you can sign up with verification services yourself and offer a code for employers to verify your employment history. Having this option available can not only make the hiring process quicker and smoother, but also will increase a potential employer's confidence in you as a new hire., Within a few days or a week, the service will send you a report of its findings.Once you receive the report, you may want to compare it with the candidate's application or resumé and assess the validity of the information you were provided.

, You may want to give the candidate an opportunity to explain any discrepancies between the verification report you received and the information he or she supplied to you.


Typically the verification company also must give the applicant the opportunity to dispute any information contained in the report if he or she contends it isn't accurate. Find out the procedures from your verification company and inform the applicant as needed.In some cases, discrepancies may be the result of a misunderstanding. For example, if the applicant was placed with an employer through a temp agency and then hired full time, he may simply list the name of the company for the entire period of employment, even though initially he was not on the company's payroll. This would cause a discrepancy between the verification service's report and the information he gave you."
"
Decide what information you want included.,
Choose a background check service that meets your needs.,
Get consent from the employee candidate.,
Receive the results of the background check.,
Follow up with the employee candidate.",How to Get Proof of Employment2," Depending on the needs of your business and the responsibilities of your employees, you may need to review different aspects of a candidate's background apart from verification of his or her employment history.


The scope and depth of your background check should reflect the nature of the position for which the candidate is applying.For example, if the job entails no financial responsibilities or handling of cash transactions, you probably don't need to pull an applicant's credit report. Likewise, there's no reason to look at a candidate's driving record if his or her job duties won't entail driving for the company (not including the commute to the workplace).

, Among the many different background check services, the best for you will be the one that provides all the information you want and doesn't waste your time or money pulling information about employee candidates that isn't necessary for you to evaluate that candidate's viability with your company.


For example, some companies verify an applicant's education records and driving records, but if you don't need this information, you can save time and money by not requesting it.Make sure the service you choose is in compliance with its responsibilities under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The law mandates specific procedures for providing notification to applicants and ensuring all reported information is accurate and up to date., You must obtain consent before you can conduct a background check on a potential employee.


Federal law requires you to inform the candidate that you are conducting a background check, as well as explaining that the information you obtain through the background check may be used in deciding whether to hire him or her.The law also requires you to have written consent from the employee before any background checks are performed. The scope of the background check should be generally explained in the document the employee signs authorizing the check and report.If you're getting a full investigative report, which can include interviews with people who know the applicant, you also must inform the applicant that he or she has the right to a full description of the scope of the investigation and the types of questions that will be asked., The background check service will provide you a report of the results of the completed background check.


Keep in mind that federal law prohibits using this information to discriminate against applicants on the basis of certain traits such as race, sex, religion, or disability. Make sure you're using the information appropriately, and that any information on which you base your decision is directly related to the job and necessary for you to run your business.Under federal law, you must securely dispose of any background report you receive after one year, regardless of whether the applicant is hired., If the information in the background check raises questions, you may need to discuss these with the potential employee and resolve any discrepancies.


In many cases, a discrepancy may be due to a misunderstanding rather than any intent on the part of the applicant to mislead you about his or her past.
In some circumstances, it also may be helpful to get the employee's story behind what happened or what led to a particular entry on their background check.
If you decide not to hire the applicant based on information contained in the background report you received, you must provide him or her with a written statement specifying the information that led to your decision along with a copy of the report you received."
"
Check state law to determine what you can request.,
Request the appropriate documents from the employee candidate.,
Compare the information on the documents to the candidate's resume or application.,
Contact previous employers as necessary.,
Follow up with the employee candidate.",How to Get Proof of Employment3," Although many employers request that employees provide copies of W2s or tax returns to verify employment, these forms may need to be redacted to remove certain sensitive or potentially discriminatory information.


At a minimum, you probably should request applicants redact their Social Security numbers from these documents.You also should be aware that these documents may contain information about sick pay or benefits that would indicate the applicant is in a class protected by federal anti-discrimination laws. Some states such as California have laws that prohibit employers from even asking questions regarding this type of information, so you may want to ask that applicants black out that information as well., Most employers make the employee responsible for providing tax or Social Security documents as proof of employment.


Keep in mind that even if an applicant refuses to allow you to contact a previous employer, you still can ask for documents such as W2s to verify their income and the years they were employed.Tax or Social Security documents also can be an important way to verify employment if the previous employer has gone out of business and you have no way to get in touch with them to verify the employment.If applicants don't have copies of their W2s, they can order a transcript from the IRS for the years you need proof of employment. Transcripts for the current year and past three years the applicant has filed taxes are available online or by calling 1-800-908-9946.<ref.https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf</ref>
Applicants also can get certified yearly reports of earnings from the Social Security Administration. These certified reports cost $56 for each year requested, although non-certified yearly reports can be retrieved online for free., Once the potential employee has submitted the documentation you requested, you can see if it matches the self-reported information.


Keep in mind that tax or Social Security documents only provide basic information about employment, such as the dates the person was employed and the income he or she received.
If the applicant had any contract or temporary work, the name of the employer listed on the W2 or another document may differ from that he or she listed on the application. In that case, you typically will need to call the temp agency or another service the applicant used to verify where the applicant was placed., If any discrepancies appear, you may want to get the story straight from the employer who worked with your candidate.


Rather than using the contact information your employee provided on their application or resumé, you might want to do an interest search for the employer and find an official address. Keep in mind that the candidate may already have talked to a co-worker or other friend and asked them to provide a positive reference if asked, so it may be in your best interest to skip the information given to you by the applicant and go directly to the source.
Mail a verification request to the human resources department or similar supervisor, and ask for written proof.In most states, you are allowed to ask the dates of employment, job titles and duties the applicant had, and his or her rate of pay. In some states you also may ask about the applicant's performance and disciplinary record, as well as the reason his or her employment ended., Once you've finished your review, let the potential employee know the outcome and any decision you've made based on the information provided.


You also might consider letting the applicant know what will be done with his or her sensitive information and how these documents will be kept secure. Keep in mind that federal law and EEOC regulations require you to destroy any such documents after a year."

Practice speaking in a soothing tone.,
Prepare your subject mentally and physically.,
Tell your subject that he has nothing to worry about.,
Ask for permission.,
Beware that not all people respond the same way.,
Tell the subject to “press my hand.” Stretch one of your hands out in front of the subject and ask him to press his hand against yours.,
Tell the subject to “close your eyes.” As you do this, take your other hand and wave it across his face.,
Tell the subject to “sleep.” As you do this, pull your hand away from his so that he falls forward, as if falling asleep like you told him to.,
Be prepared to urge the subject into a deeper hypnosis.,
Rock the subject's head.,
Try a countdown.,
Begin priming your subject to wake.,
Wake the subject.",How to Use Rapid Hypnosis," It’s imperative that you talk to your subject in a way that calms and relaxes him. Practice speaking slowly, with some rhythm and melody and no harsh or discordant tones. Use this as an opportunity to practice your script; if you struggle with what you want to say during induction it will break the subject’s focus.You also should not sound like you’re reading off a script. Practice will help you sound natural.;
, You will want to make sure that he is relaxed. Inform him that you might touch him lightly, so that he is not surprised in a way that would cause him to break focus. If your subject is wearing a skirt, give her a blanket to put over her legs so that she does not need to worry about the way she positions herself.


Similarly, tell your subject that is okay if he coughs or moves. If he is struggling to suppress a biological function, it will likely break his focus.Similarly, tell him to keep his legs uncrossed, otherwise he might get caught up by repositioning his legs. If he is wearing glasses, have him remove them.

, A distinct sense of fear will prevent him from falling into hypnosis. You want to let him know what you will not be able to manipulate them and that he will not be endangered by the hypnosis.


Simply indicate ""This is a perfectly safe procedure. You will enter into a state of increased relaxation and focus, but you will be in control the entire time.""

, Always begin by asking if he is ready to be hypnotized. Establishing consent is important for ensuring that he is mentally ready and should calm him as well.A simple, ""Do you agree to be hypnotized?"" should be sufficient

, Hypnotic subjects need to be willing to engage in the procedure and psychologically susceptible. Studies have shown that approximately 80% of subjects are moderately susceptible, 10% are highly susceptible, and another 10% have low susceptibility.Susceptibility is positively correlated to how well the subject is prone to fantasy and empathy.His ability to focus while, for example, reading, also correlates to susceptibility. It is often thought that hypnosis is easier in a relaxing environment with few external sounds or distractions. While this sort of hypnosis certainly won't hurt, some studies indicate that hypnosis is equally as easy to reach in disturbing settings, Ideally, he should press down with some force, but only be touching the edge of your hand, so that it will be easy for you to withdraw your hand when you are ready., Do this very rapidly shortly after having him press against your hand. That way, his attention will be occupied with two tasks simultaneously. , The goal is to surprise him.You should speak in a strong, authoritative tone when telling him to “sleep.”This whole process should take about four seconds. Surprise—and thus speed—is imperative.

, The initial shock of the eight word induction will fade if not followed up with a script that takes him into a deeper state of hypnosis. For this, follow up in a calm tone with a couple of sentences asking the subject to fall into a deeper sleep. The two best ways to deepen the hypnosis are described below: rocking the head and performing a countdown. Pick whichever you are most comfortable with; rocking the head will require some physical contact with the subject.

, If the subject is positioned so that he falls over into a slump after you pull away his hand, some hypnotists will begin to rock the subjects head with their hands to induce a more relaxed state. As you do that, you can tell him to let his neck relax and let that feeling of relaxation spread throughout his body. Tell him to let his mind and body relax until he fall into a deep sleep.


Tell him, for example: ""As I rock your head you will go deeper and deeper into a trance. The more I rock your head the deeper you go, the deeper you go the better you feel, the better you feel the deeper you go ... "" , Tell him that he will become more relaxed as you count down from 1 to 5. Every time you count down a number, describe to him how he is felling. “1, the relaxation is spreading through your body. 2, the relaxation is getting deeper. 3, your mind is becoming relaxed. 4, you no longer feel anything but the sense of relaxation. 5, your relaxation is getting deeper with every passing second.” Alternatively try something like: “10, you feel yourself relaxing. 9, going deeper and deeper. 8, doing excellently, keep going. 7, with each number I say you will be in a deeper trance. 6, deeper, excellent. 5, farther and farther, relax completely now. 4, 3, you're doing well. 2, even farther away from the world. 1, 0. You are now in a deep trance.”

, Shortly before you try to awake him, tell him that it is almost time to “wake up” and “become more aware.” To make the transition peaceful, indicate how he will feel when he comes out of hypnosis. Tell him that when he comes out of the trance he will feel “relaxed and comfortable.”


As you do this, use cues that will make him feel like he is returning to the real world. Stop speaking in such a slow, soothing tone and begin talking in a more normal conversational tone, like you would in everyday life. Call the subject by his name to remind him of his regular life., Tell him that he will awaken after you count down from 10. As you count down, talk in a progressively less calming tone. Say something like “10, you are feeling more awake. 9, you are beginning to become conscious. 8, you are remembering your life. 7, 6, you feel like you are waking from a deep sleep.”

Sit in the front seat of a car.,
Focus your eyes on the horizon.,
Keep cool.,
Stabilize your head.,
Take frequent breaks.,
Try to nap.,
Focus on something else.,
Put down the books, phones, and devices.,
Breathe deeply.,
Avoid bumpy roads.,
Buy a motion sickness wrist band.,
Consider alternative forms of transportation.",How to Avoid Car Sickness1," Doctors believe that motion sickness is caused by a conflict between what your eyes are seeing and how your body is interpreting the motion of a vehicle, which uses signals originating in your inner ear to sense balance.For example, if your eyes see the car seat in front of you but your body feels the curves and speed of the road, your inner ear might be thrown off. This then leads to the nausea and dizziness so typical of carsickness.To avoid this feeling, try to have your eyes focused on the road in front of you so that your eyes and your body can interpret the same information. By sitting in the front seat, you are much less likely to experience a discrepancy between what you see and how your body interprets motion.


Driving the car yourself has the added benefit of giving you something to focus on, which can distract you from your sickness.;
, Having a fixed visual point in front of you will help keep your eyes, inner ear, and nerves in check.Look out the front window and find a stable point at the horizon, somewhere in the distance. This point could be a mountain, a tree, a building, or simply a point in space. Concentrate all your visual attention at this point. Hold your gaze there even if there are bumps, curves, and hills. Resist the temptation to look out the side window: only look out the front window.


If you are in control of the vehicle, be sure that you are paying attention to the road and surrounding cars as well as to the horizon in front of you.

, Having a cool, well-ventilated atmosphere can help mitigate car sickness as well as alleviate symptoms such as sweating and nausea. If you can, crack the car windows open to create a cross breeze. Alternatively, you can turn on the car's air conditioning. Point the air vents at your face to get the most benefit.Ventilation can also help reduce food odors in the car. Car sickness can be exacerbated by strong food odors., It can sometimes be hard to keep your eyes focused on a single point when you are in a bouncing, bumpy car. To stabilize your vision, make sure your head is stabilized too. Rest it against the headrest behind you to keep it still. A neck pillow might also help you keep your head — and therefore your vision — steady., Go outside to stretch your legs. Sit on a bench or under a tree and take some deep breaths in through your mouth to help relax. This is especially important during journeys that involve a long distance of curvy roads. Not only does stopping frequently help alleviate car sickness, but it is also good for the driver to take a break every once in a while. Resume driving when you feel alert and when your dizziness and nausea pass.

, Sleeping through your motion sickness can also work wonders for car passengers. You won't be aware of the differences between your visual information and the signals your body is sending because your eyes will be closed. Many people find that sleeping is the best way to get through a long car trip without motion sickness.


If you have trouble napping in the car, consider using a form of sleep aid. If you use a sleep aid, however, you have to be certain that you will not be needed to drive at any point during the trip.

, Distractions are a great way to decrease car sickness, especially for children or those who have to ride in the backseat. Take your mind off of your dizziness and nausea by listening to music, singing, or playing a game of 20 questions with your fellow passengers., Car sickness is worsened when you are concentrating on a visual object that is within the car instead of outside the car. Staring at a book, a phone game, a kindle, or a tablet can heighten the mismatch between your eyes and the rest of your body. To prevent car sickness, make sure the only objects you focus your eyes on are outside of the car, on the horizon in front of you.There are many people who experience car sickness only when reading in the car. Make sure this doesn't happen to you!
Audio books, the car radio, and CDs are a great way to be entertained in the car without causing car sickness.

, Car sickness is made worse by feelings of anxiety and nervousness. Relaxation techniques such as slow, deliberate breathing exercises can help you slow your heart rate and relax your body, making it less likely that you will experience symptoms of motion sickness., The smoother your ride, the less likely you are to experience car sickness. Ways to smooth out your ride include driving on highways instead of stop-and-go city streets and making sure your car has up-to-date shocks.You can also take care in your route planning to avoid hilly or mountainous roads by driving around particularly hilly regions. Aim for as flat a ride as possible.


Driving at off-peak times can also help prevent getting stuck in stop-and-go traffic.

, A motion sickness wrist band provides gentle, constant pressure to your forearm, about one inch from your wrist joint. This pressure is supposed to help alleviate the nausea caused by motion sickness. While anti-nausea wristbands haven't been scientifically proven to be useful, they are relatively cheap and have no negative side effects.You can consider giving it a try to see if it happens to work for you.If you do not own a motion sickness wrist band, you can apply gentle pressure on your forearm (between the two tendons) about 3cm (roughly an inch) or so back from the wrist joint.

, Some people who experience car sickness also experience motion sickness in other vehicles, such as trains, buses, and planes. Some people, however, only experience motion sickness in the car. Trains, buses, and planes might be viable forms of transit. These other vehicles may be a better option because they are able to provide a smoother ride, are less likely to confuse your eyes, and allow you to sit higher up in your seat.


It is helpful to find the most stable seats on these alternative forms of transit. Make sure your seat is facing the direction in which you are traveling (do not choose a backwards-facing seat); sit towards the front of trains and buses; choose a wing seat on an airplane. You are less likely to be bounced around in these seats.For shorter distances, walking or biking might allow you to avoid the car altogether.

Avoid greasy meals and alcohol before trips.,
Eat frequent, light meals.,
Have bland, floury snacks in the car.,
Stay hydrated.,
Consume plenty of ginger.,
Keep a supply of mints and gum at hand.",How to Avoid Car Sickness2," Greasy foods make your body primed to experience nausea.And alcohol can cause hangover symptoms that can worsen car sickness, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, and sweating.If you know you will have to ride in a car soon, stay away from high-fat meals and alcoholic beverages to avoid car sickness.

, Heavy meals can make it easier to experience feelings of nausea. If you are riding in a car--especially on a long trip--stick to light, healthy, low-fat, small meals that you eat more frequently. If you can find a meal that is low in fat but high in protein, that is the ideal food to prevent car sickness.For example, do not eat a hamburger on a road trip. Instead, buy a salad with grilled chicken. Do not drink a milkshake on a road trip. Instead, drink a lowfat yogurt smoothie with added protein powder.

, Plain, bland, flavorless snacks can help settle a turbulent stomach. Snacks such as dry toast, saltines, and pretzels can help absorb stomach acids and make a stomach feel calmer. They are also a good way to ease your hunger pangs without causing indigestion.These snacks also do not have much of an odor, which is helpful because strong food odors and flavors can exacerbate car sickness., Dehydration can exacerbate the symptoms of car sickness. Be sure that you drink plenty of water before and during a car trip in order to avoid feelings of sickness.While water is the best way to stay hydrated, a flavored beverage might help serve as a needed distraction from your feelings of dizziness or nausea: feel free to treat yourself to a soda without added caffeine, such as ginger ale.


High-protein beverages have been shown to help reduce nausea as well., Ginger has been shown to help mitigate car sickness and other forms of motion sickness.You can eat (or drink) ginger in many different forms. There are ginger lollipops, ginger lozenges, ginger teas, ginger sodas, ginger pills, candied ginger, and ginger cookies.Any of these will help settle your stomach. Just be sure that your snack is made from actual ginger--not imitation flavoring.


Ask your doctor about whether ginger is safe for you to take. It is possible that ginger can interfere with certain medications., Peppermint, like ginger, is a natural remedy for nausea. Mint gums and candies also help your body produce more saliva, which can neutralize stomach acids. Moreover, these flavors can serve as welcome distractions when you can think about nothing other than your symptoms.Suck on a peppermint candy or chew some mint gum to help calm your stomach and focus on something else.

Talk to your doctor about car sickness.,
Take antihistamines 30 – 60 minutes before entering a car.,
Ask your doctor for a scopolamine prescription.",How to Avoid Car Sickness3," Most cases of car sickness can be dealt with using lifestyle changes and home remedies. However, sometimes car sickness can get in the way of your job or everyday functioning. In this case, you should talk to your doctor about possible medical interventions, such as over-the-counter or prescription medication.


You should also talk to your doctor if you (or your child) experience symptoms well after you have gotten out of the car, severe headache, difficulty hearing or seeing, and difficulty walking. These could indicate issues that are more serious than regular car sickness.Susceptibility to car sickness may be related to age, race, sex, hormone factors, sensory illness, and migraines. Ask your doctor if you have an elevated risk for motion sickness., There are over-the-counter and prescription drugs that are effective against car sickness. Most of them contain dimenhydrinate (aka dramamine) or meclizine.Some popular brands are Dramamine and Bonine/Antivert. Some of these are available as patches and can be particularly helpful because of their ability to release the medicine over time. Antihistamines can prevent nausea caused by motion sickness by dulling the inner ear's motion sensors. In order to work properly, you should take the medication 30-60 minutes before you begin your car trip.Look into the side effects before using any of these drugs (especially if you're driving), and ask your doctor just in case. Antihistamines can make you feel sleepy and affect your ability to operate machinery., Scopolamine is only safe for adult use--not for child use.It is prescription-only and is worn as a patch behind the ear. You must wear it 4 hours before your traveling commences. While its side effects can be severe (blurred vision and dry mouth), it is very effective at combating nausea caused by motion sickness.Talk to your doctor about whether it might be a good option for you.

Purchase raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar.,
Drink a tonic of fruit juice and apple cider vinegar before each meal.,
Make a salad dressing with apple cider vinegar.,
Eat a snack with apple cider vinegar to curb cravings.",How to Drink Apple Cider Vinegar1," The filtered, pasteurized vinegar on supermarket shelves do not have the same properties as unfiltered vinegar.


Bragg’s organic apple cider vinegar is one of the best brands of apple cider vinegar.
Unfiltered vinegar contains sediment which is referred to as “the mother,” a leftover bacteria from the fermentation process, similar to sediment in kombucha. ;
, Pour 1 cup (237ml) of grapefruit juice and 2 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar into a glass. Mix well.


Replace grapefruit juice with another juice of your choice. Avoid juice cocktails, which are mostly sugar, and choose juices that are high in Vitamin C, for added health benefits.
Apple cider vinegar has a strong taste, so stick with a juice that disguises it well.
The acetic acid in the vinegar may help stimulate fat-burning proteins.Drinking low calorie liquid and water before meals may help you to consume less.

, Use 2 tbsp. (30ml) of apple cider vinegar in your dressing.


Some say, ""For added benefit, avoid using oil in the dressing"" but this is not true - you just need to use organic oils which add health benefits of different kinds depending on the type (such as organic unrefined cold-pressed coconut oil - this is at its purest). The commonly used regular vegetable oil is bad for your health - just use good oils (sesame, olive, etc. - organics). Organic means its not only non-GMO but also not laden with chemicals (inorganic things).






Mix the vinegar with parsley, lemon juice and a clove of garlic in a food processor

To give yourself a little more leeway when you get out of bed, consider taking a shower before bed in the evening. Because you’ll just be sleeping afterward, you don’t have to worry about getting dirty before work. Evening showers can also help improve the quality of your sleep, so you’ll be well-rested for your job.If you’re worried about your hair looking flat or even greasy without a morning shower, dry shampoo is a lifesaver. It soaks up excess oil at your scalp and adds body without any suds or heavy duty styling.;
, Waiting until you get out of bed to find the right outfit to wear to work can make your morning more stressful than it needs to be. Instead, pick out your clothes the night before and lay them out so there’s easy to grab after you wake up. It’s also a good idea to try your outfit on to make sure that everything fits well and is ready to wear for work.Make sure that your clothing is appropriate for work. While you may need to wear a suit if you’re employed at an office, you should choose polished clothing even if your workplace is more casual so you project a professional image, especially if you meet with clients or customers. That means no ripped, torn, or stained clothing.
For example, a man might wear an ironed button-down shirt, dress pants, and lace-up dress shoes in a more casual workplace. Any outfit chosen should be dressy but not too formal.
Getting your clothes ready the night before also gives you time to figure out if anything needs to be ironed, so you don’t wind up at work in wrinkled clothing.
You may want to consider installing wall-mounted racks on the wall of your bedroom or closet where you can hang a multiple days’ worth of outfits. That way, you can plan out your clothing for a week at a time and not have to worry about it each night.

, You don't want to get to work and realize that you left something you need at home, so you may want to organize your work items the night before. Doing so will also save you from running around in the morning trying to track down what you need. Check that you have all of the documents, files, and other paperwork that you might need, as well as your laptop or tablet, ready to go. If you need any special tools or equipment for your job, make sure that they’re organized as well., There are few things worse than being late for work, but we’ve all had mornings where we oversleep. Ideally, you wouldn’t need an alarm clock to wake you in the morning because you’d be on such a regular schedule, but that’s not really practical. If you have trouble getting up in the morning, set a dedicated alarm clock before you go to sleep to wake with enough time to get ready in the morning -- and then set a backup alarm for a few minutes after the first just in case you sleep through the first or hit the snooze. You don’t have to purchase a second clock, though -- just use your smartphone.It's a good idea to place your alarm clock and phone out of reach from your bed, so you physically have to get up to turn it off.
If you are in the habit of hitting the snooze button, you can find some alarm clock apps for your smartphone that actually require you to solve a puzzle or other challenge before the alarm turns off. That may help you wake enough to realize that snoozing is a bad idea.

, It’s tough to face the day if you aren’t well rested. Prepare for work by ensuring that you get enough sleep at night. Make sure to avoid caffeine approximately four to six hours before bedtime, and make your bedroom more conducive to sleep by covering the windows with heavy curtains or blackout shades to prevent light from creeping in. Keep your room between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 24 degrees Celsius) so it’s comfortable for sleeping, and rid your bedroom of any distractions, such as a TV, computer, or tablet.For young adults, ages 18 through 64, seven to nine hours of sleep is usually sufficient to prepare you for the day. If you’re over the age of 64, you can get by with seven to eight hours of sleep., If you're distracted by problems at work or what you have to get done the next day, you'll likely have trouble sleeping. Try to relax by keeping your mind off work-related matters for the night so you can ensure a good night's sleep.


If you have trouble shutting down your thoughts, consider using a sleep meditation when you get into bed to help calm and relax your mind. You can use various apps for your smartphone that guide you through meditations that help encourage sleep.Quietly reading a book in bed before you go to sleep can also help distract you from thoughts of work.

, When you roll out of bed in the morning, you’ll want to make yourself feel as fresh as possible, especially if you’ve showered the night before. Make a trip to the bathroom to brush your teeth, wash your face, and put on some deodorant, so you feel ready to face the workday ahead.Using a peppermint or other mint flavored toothpaste when you brush can help wake you up in the morning.
You don’t necessarily have to use soap or a facial cleanser to wash your face in the morning. Just splash some cold water on your face to help get you going.

, Some people aren’t ready to head to work if they’ve only taken care of their basic hygiene. Men may also need to shave to achieve a polished look for work, while women may want to apply some makeup for the day. Take the time to handle whatever grooming tasks will make you feel more comfortable and confident at work.


To save time, keep all of the toiletries, such as shaving supplies and cosmetics, that you use in the morning in one location in the bathroom so you don’t waste time looking for anything when you’re getting ready.

, If you’ve set out your clothes the night before, getting dressed for work is pretty simple. However, you can still streamline the process. Keep your accessories to a minimum, so you don’t have too many pieces to add at the last minute. It’s also a good idea to separate your outerwear, such as your coat, scarf, and hat, from your regular clothing. Instead, try to keep them in a closet that’s close to the door so you can grab them on your way out.If you usually put on your jewelry as a final finishing touch to your outfit, make sure that it’s organized. You don’t want to have hunt down an earring or detangle a bunch of necklaces when you’re trying to get out the door for work.
Get in the habit of checking the week’s weather forecast. That way, you can make sure that any extras you might need, such as an umbrella or rain boots, are accessible when you need them.

, It’s best to save elaborate hair styles for non-work days when you have more time. Instead, take a minimal approach. For men, that usually means combing it and putting some product, such as gel or pomade, in it. For women, a simple, go-to style such as a ponytail, bun, or braid, is a good option.If you haven’t washed your hair and it’s looking rough, try to just take care of the problem areas. For example, if your bangs are looking flat, wash them quickly with shampoo and give them a quick blow dry with a round brush.

, Exercising before you head to work can be an effective way to energize your mind and body so you're ready to face the day. If you can fit in a run or class at your gym before your workday, go for it. However, even some light stretching can help release endorphins so you have more energy.A brisk walk through your neighborhood is another good way to get your blood flowing.
Create your own quick morning workout by doing a series of crunches, push ups, and jumping jacks.
Keep in mind that if you exercise before work, you may feel the need to shower in the morning, depending on how much of a sweat you work up. Allot some time for bathing in your routine if that's the case.
While a workout can help get you going in the morning, you shouldn't sacrifice sleep for exercise. If you don't have time in your routine, you're better off skipping the workout., Just as meditating before bed can help keep you more calm and relaxed, morning meditation can help get you in the right frame of mind for work. Even five minutes of meditating can help you relax enough to be more focused and productive at work.To meditate, clear a spot on the floor where you can sit comfortably. Relax your body, close your eyes, and try to clear your mind. It usually helps to focus on your breathing.
If you're having trouble clearing your mind, don't try to actively block out thoughts. Acknowledge those that pass through your mind, but let them pass until your mind goes blank.
While you can meditate for as little as a several minutes, the longer that you do it the more relaxed that you'll feel.

, If you’re going to have a successful day at work, you need the right fuel, which means you shouldn’t skip breakfast. It’s important to choose the right foods for the first meal of the day, though. That typically means a combination of healthy carbs, fiber, and protein. While you shouldn’t have too much caffeine, a cup of coffee or tea may help jumpstart your day too. Oatmeal is a healthy breakfast option. You can use the instant variety if you’re in a hurry, but make sure it’s unflavored so it doesn’t have too much sugar. The oats are rich in healthy carbs and fiber, but mix in some nuts for added protein.
Greek yogurt is a no-cook breakfast that you can prepare quickly. Create a parfait by layering it with some of your favorite fruits, such as blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries.
Eggs can be a good, protein-filled breakfast. Add some of your favorite vegetables and some low-fat cheese for a tasty omelet. If you’re worried about cholesterol, use only the egg whites.
If you’re a fan of toast, use whole grain bread instead of white. Swap the usual butter or jelly for almond butter to get a little extra protein.
If you oversleep and don’t have time for a proper breakfast, a protein bar can help keep you going until lunch.

, While you're making breakfast, think about the things that you have to do at work that day. Don't let the list get too long or you may start to feel overwhelmed. Instead, focus on several of the most important tasks -- and then decide which are the most critical so you know what needs to get done right away.Be sure to focus only on what you need to do that day. Don't worry about all the things that you need to get done later in the week.

, Once you know what your priorities are for the day, it's time to make a schedule. Take the time to jot down your plan for the day, including any meetings, training sessions, or appointments that you'll need to attend. When you get to work, you’ll be ready to start right away because you know what has to be done.It's a good idea to build some free time into your schedule. That way, if something comes up at the last minute, you won't fall too far behind on the things that you planned to do that day.

, In addition to work materials, you probably have other supplies that you need for your work day. Before you leave the house, load your purse, briefcase, or other bag with the basics, such as your phone, wallet, charger, and keys. You may also want to include a packed lunch or some snacks for later in the day.If you like to bring your lunch to work, it’s a good idea to make and pack it the night before.
If you require medication, check that it’s in your bag before you head out the door.
If you wear makeup, you may want to bring along some cosmetics for touch-ups throughout the day.

Lower your body's insulin levels.,
Exercise frequently.,
Take dietary omega-3 fatty acids.,
Consume more foods containing lutein and zeaxanthin.,
Avoid trans fats.,
Eat more antioxidants.,
Use Marijuana (Cannabis), where legal.",How to Lower Eye Pressure Without Drops1," Individuals who suffer from conditions such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure often become resistant to insulin, which actually causes the body to produce more insulin. These high insulin levels have been linked to increased eye pressure.To solve this problem, patients are advised to avoid certain foods that can trigger an abrupt increase in insulin levels. These foods include: sugar, grains (whole and organic), breads, pasta, rice, cereal and potatoes.;
, Regularly engaging in exercises like aerobics, jogging, brisk walking, biking and strength training helps to lower your body's insulin levels, thus protecting your eyes from ocular hypertension.


Insulin is a hormone that helps to transport blood sugar (or glucose) into the cells as a source of energy. If we use up this energy through exercising, the blood glucose levels in our body are reduced, along with insulin levels. If insulin levels are low, there is no hyperstimulation of the ocular sympathetic nerve, so there is no buildup of pressure in the eyes.
Try to exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes per day, three to five times per week.
Avoid exercises and positions that place you in a head-down position, as this can increase intraocular pressure. This includes some yoga positions, such as headstands.

, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a type of omega-3 fatty acid that maintains healthy retinal function and prevents pressure from building up in the eyes.DHA (and other omega-3 fatty acids) are found in cold water fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, shellfish and herring. To boost your DHA levels, try to eat to two to three servings of these kinds of fish each week.
Alternatively, you can increase your DHA intake by taking fish oil capsules or algae-based DHA supplements. For best results take 3,000 – 4,000mg of standardized fish oil capsules per day or take 200mg of algae-based DHA supplements per day., Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids, which work as antioxidants that protect the body from free radicals. These free radicals weaken the immune system, which can lead to infection and damage to the optic nerves.Lutein and zeaxanthin also help to lower eye pressure by reducing oxidative damage around the optic nerve. This is important, as any damage in the optic nerve increases eye pressure.
Foods that contain excellent sources of lutein and zeaxanthin include kale, spinach, collard greens, Brussels sprouts, broccoli and raw egg yolks. Try to include at least one of these foods in every major meal of the day.

, As mentioned above, omega-3 fatty acids help to reduce intraocular pressure. However, foods that are high in trans fats prevent the omega-3s from working properly, which can lead to increased eye pressure.


As a result, it's a good idea to limit your intake of foods rich in trans fats. These foods include: processed or baked foods, fried foods, ice cream, microwave popcorn, and ground beef., Dark colored berries, such as blueberries, blackberries, and bilberries, help to improve the overall health of the eyes by reinforcing the capillaries that transmit nutrients to the eye nerves and muscles. This is due to the fact that dark-colored berries contain antioxidants that help to strengthen blood vessels. This reduces the chances of blood vessels hemorrhaging and causing damage.Try to eat at least one portion of dark-colored berries per day.
Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant and is used to prevent and treat a number of eye disorders, including glaucoma and increased eye pressure. Dosage is usually 75mg twice a day.Bilberry is very commonly used to increase visual acuity and combat degenerative eye diseases, including ocular hypertension. One study on a specific product containing bilberry and pycnogenol (an extract from pine bark) was clinically shown to lower eye pressure.Grapeseed extract is an antioxidant and has been successfully used to reduce eye stress due to glare. Grapeseed extract is commonly used to combat signs of aging and improve night vision., Marijuana can be taken as edibles, sublingually, capsules, tablets and oils for vapors. In a 2006 study, one of marijuana's main constituents, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has psychoactive effects, was shown to reduce eye pressure temporarily when 5 mg was taken sublingually, but the other constituent, cannabidiol (CBD), which does not have psychoactive effects, did not reduce eye pressure. "
"
Understand why surgery may be necessary.If high pressure persists, it can cause damage to the optic nerve, leading to an eye condition called glaucoma.Over time, glaucoma can lead to vision loss.Glaucoma is usually treated using a combination of eye drops and oral medications.,
Ask your doctor about drainage implants.,
Consider getting laser surgery.,
Be aware that you may need filtering surgery.",How to Lower Eye Pressure Without Drops2," However, if these measures don't work, surgery will be necessary in order to lower pressure in the eyes.


Surgery for glaucoma helps to improve the flow of fluid within the eyes, lowering eye pressure as a result. Sometimes, a single surgery will not be enough to adequately relieve eye pressure and treat glaucoma. In this situation, a follow-up surgery may be necessary.
There are several types of surgery used to treat glaucoma, depending on the severity of the condition.

, Drainage implants are usually used to treat high eye pressure in children and in people with advanced glaucoma. During the procedure, a small tube is inserted into the eye to facilitate the drainage of fluid. Once the fluid is drained, pressure in the eye is reduced.

, Trabeculoplasty is a type of laser surgery that uses a high-energy laser beam to open blocked drainage canals in the eyes, allowing the excess fluid to drain. After the surgery, eye pressure is checked periodically to ensure that the procedure was successful.


Another type of laser surgery is iridotomy. This type of laser is used in people with very narrow drainage angles in the eyes. During this procedure, a small hole is created on the top part of the iris to allow for the drainage of fluid.
If laser iridotomy doesn't work, peripheral iridotomy may be done. This procedure involves removing a small part of the iris in order to improve fluid drainage. This type of surgery is relatively rare.

, Trabeculectomy is a type of surgical procedure used as a last resort in the treatment of high eye pressure if eye drops and laser surgery remain unsuccessful.


In this procedure, a surgeon creates an opening in the sclera (the white part of the eye) and removes a small piece of tissue in the base of the cornea. This allows fluid to flow freely from the eye, resulting in reduced pressure.
The procedure is done in one eye and is repeated in the other eye several weeks later, if necessary. Additional treatments may be required following this procedure as the opening might become blocked or closed up again.

Practice blinking every 3 to 4 seconds.,
Cover your eye with the palm of your hand.,
Trace an imaginary figure of eight with your eyes.,
Practice focusing your eyes on both near and faraway objects.,
Try zooming.,
Look into biofeedback.",How to Lower Eye Pressure Without Drops3," People have a tendency to avoid blinking when working on a computer, watching television or playing video games. This puts a lot of strain on the eyes.


You can relax and refresh the eyes by making a conscious effort to blink every 3 to 4 seconds, over a two minute period. Use a watch to time yourself, if necessary.
This will relieve some of the pressure on your eyes, leaving them ready to process new information.

, Covering your eye with the palm of your hand helps to relax both the eye and the mind, relieving stress and allowing you to blink freely.


Place your right hand over your right eye, resting your fingers against your forehead and the heel of your hand against your cheekbone. Don't apply any pressure.
Keep the hand in place for 30 seconds to a minute, blinking freely throughout. Uncover your right eye, then use your left hand to cover your left eye and repeat.

, This exercise helps to strengthen your eye muscles and increase their flexibility, making them less prone to injury and high pressure.


Imagine a big number eight on the wall in front of you, turned onto its side. Use your eyes to trace this number eight, without moving your head. Keep doing this for a minute or two.
If you're having difficulty imagining a sideways number eight, try actually drawing one on a large piece of paper and sticking it on the wall. You can trace this with your eyes instead.

, This exercise helps to strengthen the eye muscles and improve your overall vision.


Find a relaxing place to sit, without any distractions. Hold your thumb approximately 10 inches (25.4 cm) in front of your face and focus your eyes on it.
Focus on your thumb for five to 10 seconds, then switch your focus to another object, between 10 to 20 feet (3.0 to 6.1 m) away from you. Alternate between focusing on your thumb and focusing on the far away object for a minute or two.

, This exercise improves your focusing skills and also helps to strengthens your eye muscles.


Stretch one hand directly out in front of you, then stick up your thumb. Focus both eyes on the thumb, then slowly move your thumb towards you until it is about three inches away from your face.
Move your thumb away from you again, keeping both eyes on it at all times. Continue to focus on your moving thumb for a minute or two.

, This technique may also help alleviate eye pressure.Biofeedback teaches you to control normal bodily process, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.A biofeedback therapist will teach you proper technique so you can begin to practice on your own.

Understand how high eye pressure is diagnosed.,
Understand what causes high eye pressure.,
Familiarize yourself with the risk factors for ocular hypertension.",How to Lower Eye Pressure Without Drops4," High eye pressure (medically known as ocular hypertension) is difficult to diagnose, as it does not show any visible symptoms such as redness or eye pain. A diagnosis cannot be made using visual examination alone, so you will need to have your eyes examined by an eye specialist. He will use a combination of methods to identify ocular hypertension.



Tonometry. This procedure is used to measure intraocular pressure in the eyes and gauge whether the level of pressure is still within normal limits. The eye is numbed and then an orange dye is inserted to help the specialist identify the level of pressure. A machine is used to measure the pressure in the eye by applying pressure to the eye.A reading of 21mmHg or higher usually indicates the presence of ocular hypertension. However, other conditions can affect this reading, such as head or eye injuries or a buildup of blood behind the cornea.

Air puff. With this procedure, the patient is asked to look straight into an apparatus while the specialist shines a light into the eye. The apparatus then sends a quick puff of air directly into the eye. A special machine reads the pressure by assessing the changes in the light reflections upon the strike of air into the eye.

, Ocular hypertension is associated with increasing age along with other factors. Several factors may contribute to the development of ocular hypertension, including:Excessive aqueous production. Aqueous humor is a transparent liquid manufactured in the eye. It drains from the eye by means of the trabecular meshwork. If excessive aqueous humor is produced, the pressure in the eye increases.

Inadequate aqueous drainage. Improper drainage of aqueous humor can lead to increased eye pressure.

Certain medications. Certain drugs (such as steroids) can cause ocular hypertension, especially in people with pre-existing risk factors.

Eye trauma. Any irritation or injury to the eye can affect the balance of aqueous production and drainage from the eye and may result in increased eye pressure.Other eye conditions. Ocular hypertension is usually linked with other eye ailments such as pseudo exfoliation syndrome, corneal arcus, and dispersion syndrome.

, Anyone can develop high eye pressure, but studies show that the following groups are at increased risk of developing the condition:


African-Americans.
Individuals over the age of 40.
Persons with a family history of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.
People with thinner central corneal thickness measurements."

Develop a referral network.",How to Become an Admissions Consultant," Admissions consultants work with people applying for college, so it is a requirement that the consultant has successfully applied for a school of their choice. Consider a degree in business, psychology, counseling or human resources.;
, If you know that you want to help students applying for graduate programs, then it is helpful to have experience in those programs. You can return to this step if you want to help people applying for bachelor's degrees in the beginning and move on to more stringent graduate application processes in the future.

, Many high schools, community colleges and private firms hire people to help young students choose their college track. A few years of refreshing the different issues faced when applying for college will help you to qualify for consulting work.


Develop your communication skills. You should learn to be patient with students who are frustrated or unsure of their future. You and the student will need to develop a story about the student's life. You can help the student to develop a message that they will communicate in essays and in interviews.
Develop your teaching skills. Part of college admissions consulting is teaching a student to handle the process in a timely manner. Many consultants teach students to write college essays, which can help them throughout their college career.

, Many admissions consultants were previously employed by colleges or universities. This experience may allow you to command a higher wage, because you are experienced in vetting applications according to college guidelines.

, You will receive pertinent industry information and you can be connected to potential clients or training programs.

, Organizations like HECA and the University of California run training programs on admissions counseling. A training program will cement the knowledge you have gained through experience and highlight the best ways to work with students.

Thankfully, there are foods that you can eat to improve these levels of the hormone and balance them out including kidney beans, fresh vegetables and fruits, spices such as cinnamon and sage and even hops. Not only that but chick peas, lentils and garlic can also help to improve these hormone levels and reduce the frequency and intensity of the hot flashes themselves. There were recently a few clinical studies undertaken examining the effects of sage on menopausal women and those that regularly ate sage in their diet showed less hot flashes with the intensity of them reduced at the same time.;
, Most health stores will be able to help you out at this time of life and there are a few vitamins and minerals that you can take to ensure that your menopause is as easy and as pain free as it can be. One of the best that you can take for hot flashes is called evening primrose oil and has proved to be a massive hit for menopausal women over recent years. Not only does evening primrose oil contain essential fatty acids, but it has many other ingredients, as such, to ensure that menopausal symptoms are reduced.

, St. John’s Wort and Vitamin E are also great for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. OF course, you can find Vitamin E in many food sources such as rice and nuts as well as egg yolks and this vitamin not only helps with things such as vaginal dryness but also promotes healthy levels of hormone in the body to reduce hot flashes. St. John’s Wort should only really be taken under medical supervision and advice as it can play havoc with other types and kinds of medication that may be taken but it can help to reduce both anxiety and mental issues such as depression, both of which can cause hot flashes during the menopause.

Sign the contract.",How to Write a Service Contract," Before creating and signing a service contract, think about the product you are purchasing and whether that product is likely to need the services covered by such a contract.Oftentimes, the product you are purchasing is not likely to need repairs or, if it does, the cost of repairs may be low.For example, you may not need a service contract for a washing machine you buy from a reputable company with a great track record for making quality products. Also, if your washing machine comes with a warranty, that warranty may cover all of the repairs you think you will need.
However, you may want to consider a service contract for a used vehicle you purchase when that vehicle has a reputation for breaking down and needing frequent, expensive repairs. Also, in this situation, it is unlikely a warranty will be included with your purchase, so a service contract may be a good idea.;
, When you are purchasing an item with a warranty, read and analyze that warranty so you understand exactly what it covers. In a lot of situations, a service contract will not include a lot of additional coverage so it may not be a wise addition. Compare the warranty's coverage to that of your potential service contract to determine if the service contract is worth the cost.Consider the duration of a service contract. In some situations, a service contract may only last for a period of months, and therefore may not be worth the cost.Look at the terms of a service contract. In some situations, a service contract may only cover a very limited set of repairs, and therefore may not be worth the cost.However, remember that if you are going to write your own service contract, you will be able define the length of coverage as well as what will be covered.

, If you are purchasing an item and want to enter into a service contract, you need to research the company or individual you will be contracting with. If you enter into a contract with another party, and that other party goes out of business or cannot repay claims, you may not be able to receive the benefits contemplated in the contract.Before you enter into a service agreement, think about the other party's financial stability as well as their reputation.For example, if you are buying a used car from a used car dealership, consider that dealership's history before entering into a service contract with them. If the dealership has been around for a long time, has a proven track record of holding up their contractual promises, and seems to have a solid financial foundation, then you may be okay entering into a service contract with them. However, if the dealership seems untrustworthy or has not been around for a long time, you may want to consider not signing a service contract with them.

, Instead of entering into a service contract, consider saving that money by putting it into some sort of savings account. In this situation, the money you save can be used for any repairs you may need. However, if you think you may need a substantial number of repairs, or if repairs would be prohibitively costly without a service contract, your money may be better spent entering into a service contract.

, At the beginning of every contract, you should include a title, a date, and any general information about the parties to that contract.


For example, your service contract may be titled, ""Vehicle Service Contract"" and might open with a paragraph stating: ""This Vehicle Service Contract is entered into as of the ____ day of _____, 2015 between and ."" You may follow this up with a description of each party, including each of their addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.

, Before you get into the body of your service contract, you need to define the product being bought, which is the product that will be the subject of any maintenance or repairs.


For example, if you are entering into a vehicle service contract, you will want to include a description of the vehicle being covered under the contract. This will include the vehicle VIN number, make, model, year, the vehicle's purchase price, and any other identifying information about the vehicle you have.As an additional measure of assurance, you may want to include a copy of the purchase and sale agreement as an exhibit at the end of your service agreement.

, To have a valid and enforceable contract, each party must give up something of value. In a service contract, the seller of an item will be giving up their services, which will be used when the item needs to be repaired or maintained. On the other side, the buyer of an item will usually give up money, which can either take the form of an up-front lump sum or something similar to a deductible.


If you will be writing this provision to include a lump sum payment, consider stating: ""Buyer shall pay seller , as consideration for the services provided by Seller under this Agreement. In exchange, Seller shall provide Buyer with the services set forth in this Agreement.""
If you will be writing this provision to include a deductible, consider stating: ""In the event Seller is required to perform a Repair or Maintenance on Buyer's product as provided in this Agreement, Buyer will be required to pay a deductible in order to receive service. For each request for Repair or Maintenance made by Buyer to Seller, Buyer shall pay seller in the amount of .""

, A service contract will usually be a term contract, meaning it will stay in effect for a period that is defined in the contract. The length of coverage can be defined by any number of factors, but is usually defined by a length of time or by the occurrence of some event.


If your service contract's effective period will be defined by time, consider stating: ""This Agreement will become effective as of and will expire on .""
If your service contract's effective period will be defined by a set of event's it may look something like this: ""This Agreement will become effective on the date Buyer purchases vehicle from Seller. This Agreement will terminate when Buyer's vehicle surpasses .""

, Once you have defined the parties, the product, and the length of coverage, you will begin drafting the body of the service contract. One of the most important provisions of your contract will be the discussion of what will be covered under the agreement. In a service contract, coverage will include any number of maintenance or repair activities.


For example, if you have purchased a sound system from a seller, that seller may request language that looks like this: ""We, as Sellers, will cover the maintenance and repair activities under this Agreement: ""Sellers will provide an annual inspection of Buyer's sound system; Sellers will provide initial testing and installation services to Buyers; and Sellers will provide Buyers with repair services for any repairs needed as a result of normal wear and tear.""Any list you draft can be expanded and as detailed as you feel is necessary. In general, you will want to be as detailed as possible so there is no misunderstanding between parties.

, Once you have listed what will be covered under your service contract, you will have to define what will NOT be covered under the service contract.


For example, if you have purchased a sound system from a seller, that seller may request language that looks like this: ""This Agreement will not cover the following items: All labor for maintenance and repair for any equipment that is not part of the System; all labor for the movement, removal, reconfiguration, or other changes to any portion of the System; all charges by any third parties in connection with the services Sellers provides under this Agreement, including utilities and other contractors; all state and local taxes or fees imposed with respect to the services provided under this Agreement; and any cost, including labor, necessary to repair equipment due to improper use or storage of the System."", In some service contracts, especially those regarding vehicles, a contract may include a provision about duties. In this provision, which usually favors the seller, there may be extra requirements a buyer will have to comply with before they will be covered under the service contract.


For example, in a service contract regarding a vehicle, a seller may request language that looks like this: ""Before Seller is obligated to perform their duties as defined in this Agreement, Buyer will be required to check and service their vehicle in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, as outlined in the vehicle's Owners Manual. All verifiable receipts must be retained for any service work and may be requested by Sellers before performing their duties."", Another important section will define how claims will be filed, which is to say how the buyer will ask the seller to perform any maintenance or repair.


For example, if you are writing a service contract about a vehicle, a filing provision may look something like this: ""If Buyers vehicle requires maintenance or repair, Buyers must follow these steps in order in order to file a claim: (1) Buyers must prevent further damage; (2) Buyers must take vehicle to a licensed repair facility; (3) Buyers must provide repair facility with a copy of this Agreement; (4) repair facility must obtain Sellers authorization to complete the work requested; (5) Buyers shall pay the required deductible (if applicable); and (6) Buyers shall provide Sellers with any and all receipts received as a result of a repair or maintenance."", Boilerplate provisions are specific clauses included in almost all contracts that have a known meaning and a predictable outcome.These clauses often include severability clauses, entire agreement clauses, arbitration agreements, and choice of law provisions.For a list of common boilerplate provisions, as well as their specific language, look here.

, At the end of your service agreement, you will provide space for all parties to sign and date the contract.

, When the contract is ready, send it to the other party. The other party will examine the contract to ensure that the terms suit them. In some cases the other party will sign and return the contract right away. More often, he or she will respond with a counteroffer. If there is a counteroffer, be sure to read any changes carefully and decide whether they are acceptable before you sign.


If you want to speed things along you can include a date by which the contract should be signed, addressed or rejected. Otherwise, the other party is obligated to respond ""within a reasonable amount of time,"" but this is highly subjective.
You can revoke an offer that has not yet been accepted. For example, if you present someone with an offer and he is considering it but has not accepted the offer, you can tell him that you have changed your mind. However, once the offer has been accepted, you've entered into a binding agreement., It's common for the parties to go back and forth with changes to the contract until they are both satisfied with the terms.


The parties are welcome to change the contract in any way that they want, so long as the other party sees the changes and has the opportunity to respond.
Make sure that you are completely satisfied with the terms before signing the contract. It is very important to read through the whole contract before signing it to insure that there are no changes added without your knowledge. After signing, you are legally obligated to perform under the terms of the contract.

, When you and the other party are both in agreement that the contract is final, sign and date the contract and have the other party do so as well.


Be aware that many companies use electronic signature services such as DocuSign or Adobe Document Cloud with eSign. These electronic signatures are used in place of a written signature and are legally binding.Keep a copy of the contract for your reference, and make sure the other party (or parties) has one as well.
You may want to stipulate that the contract takes effect upon signing. In other cases, you may want the contract to take effect at a certain date."

Review what needs to be done.,
Determine how long the job will take you.,
Decide if you'll need additional help.,
Figure out what materials you'll need.,
Research your competition.",How to Write an Estimate2," Before you can provide a customer with either an estimate or a quotation, you need to know exactly what they want you to do. Expect to ask a lot of questions, as people often can be vague about their needs.Keep in mind that sometimes a customer won't actually know what goes into a job – they just know what they want the final outcome to be. In many professions, this means you must actually visit the customer's work site to evaluate the job properly.
For example, if you are in construction and the customer wants to add a new deck onto the back of their house, you'll need to look at the state of the ground below where they want the deck to be, as well as evaluate how they want to attach it to the house and how the house itself is built.

, For the purposes of an estimate, you only need a rough ballpark. However, it's important to be realistic in your assessment of time to complete the project because this will determine the ultimate price you give the customer.If there will be outside work involved, you'll need to make allowances for possible weather delays depending on the season in which the work will be done.

, If you already have a crew that normally works with you, additional labor may not be as big of a deal for you. However, if you typically work alone, you must assess the job realistically and decide whether you'll have additional expenses for sub-contractors or specialists.The date by which the customer wants the job done also factors into this. For example, it may be possible for you to complete the job on your own, but it would take you three weeks to complete it. However, the customer needs to have the job completed by the end of the week, which means you would need help to meet that deadline.
You also want to keep other commitments in mind. If you know it would take you 20 hours to complete a job on your own, but you've already committed to projects that will take 40 hours of your time during the period the customer wants the job completed, you may need extra help so you don't over-extend yourself.

, Any estimate should include at least a ballpark figure of what the costs will be to you to complete the project. If the job requires tools that you don't own or have available to you, find out the cost for purchasing or renting those tools.Purchasing new tools may be preferable if you anticipate you will need them for other jobs in the future. You typically can deduct these purchases as business expenses on your taxes. Keep in mind that if you decide to do that, you can't pass on the full purchase price to your customer.
If you have basic materials that you frequently use for different jobs, keep price lists for reference so you can save some time when you're calculating an estimate.

, You want your estimate to be competitive, but at the same time you don't want to charge so little that you end up not making any money. Find out what similar professionals in your area are charging and stay in that range.Keep in mind that ""competitive"" does not mean that you should aim to underbid the competition. You won't make any money that way, and potential customers or clients may be suspicious if your estimate seems too low. Have confidence in your skills and your work product.
However, you do want to have a general idea of the skill level and experience of similar professionals in your area. For example, if you have 20 years experience, you would want your estimate to be considerably higher than someone who's only been in business a year, because you have more to bring to the table.
To find out what similar professionals in your area are charging, check listings on websites where professionals can advertise or promote their services. If there is a professional or trade organization in your area, they also may have information on project prices based on survey results.

Adopt a warm professional tone.,
Focus on the benefit to the customer.,
Deliver your estimate quickly.,
Schedule a follow-up.",How to Write an Estimate3," A warm, friendly tone will put the potential customer at ease and help them see you as a person, not just a business transaction. If they like and feel comfortable with you as a person, they'll be more interested in doing business with you.Be sure to thank them for their offer, and speak positively about their project. Avoid making negative statements or implying that their job will be challenging or difficult for you.

, The customer typically isn't interested in the exact process or things you need to do to achieve their objective – they're only interested in the finished product. Keep your language focused on the result, not the process.This is important when you're describing the work to be done. To continue the previous example, you might describe the deck-building work as ""materials for new deck"" and ""installation of new deck."" This keeps your potential customer's attention on the final product, not the work that will go into it.

, Typically potential clients want the work done sooner rather than later. Since many clients end up working with the first contractor they hear back from, you want to get your estimate into their hands as soon as possible., After you've delivered your estimate to the potential client, you may hear back from them immediately. However, you should plan to call them within two or three days after they've received the estimate to find out if they've made a decision.Keep in mind that often people who hire one contractor won't bother to call any others and tell them they've decided to go with someone else. So this follow-up is as much for you as it is for them. Knowing whether you've got the job can help you plan your work time and manage your staff efficiently.

Use official letterhead.,
Label your estimate appropriately.,
Describe the services to be provided.,
Include information about your licenses or accreditations.,
Provide any necessary disclaimers.,
Give alternative estimates for different circumstances.,
Sign and date your estimate.",How to Write an Estimate4," Assume the potential customer has reached out to others for estimates as well. If you have letterhead for your business, it gives your estimate a more professional polish and makes it stand out.If you don't yet have letterhead, you can create something basic on any word processing program. Make sure it includes your name, your business name, and contact information such as address, phone number, email address, and the URL of your website if you have one.
Include your logo in your letterhead if you have one. This is another way to make your estimate look professional and help it stand out from any others.

, If you're sending the potential customer an estimate, it must be labeled clearly as such. Try placing the word ""ESTIMATE"" at the top of the page (directly under the letterhead) in large red capital letters.You might also include a disclaimer immediately under the word to the effect that the actual final cost may be higher or lower than the estimate you've given.

, For an estimate, you don't have to go into extensive detail about the services you will provide. However, you should break down the steps of the job as much as possible.You can group services into broad, general categories for an estimate. This can help you more easily find a ballpark price without having to spend too much time finding exact figures just for the purposes of an estimate.
For example, if you are building a deck for a homeowner, you may have cost breakdowns for ""materials"" and ""labor.""

, If you're an independent contractor, you may be required by state or local law to carry certain licenses or to be bonded. Information about these should be included on your estimate.Memberships in professional or trade organizations also make you appear more trustworthy and can set a potential customer at ease about doing business with you.
If you have badges from any review sites or social media platforms, such as Yelp, you might include those too so potential customers can see what other people have to say about your services., An estimate is never legally binding, and you should state this up front so that your potential customer is aware that the actual price may differ from the estimate you gave.Make a statement at the end of your estimate even if you have something written under the word ""ESTIMATE"" at the top of the page. For example, you might say ""The above price is a ballpark estimate, not an exact quote. Your actual price may be higher or lower depending on a variety of factors.""
You can describe the factors that might contribute to a difference between the actual price and your estimate, but it isn't strictly necessary. If you do include reasons for a difference in prices, don't get too detailed or verbose in your explanation.

, In some cases, there may be significant factors that would result in a tremendous difference in the price. In these situations, it can be helpful for you to give your potential customer several estimates so they can make a more informed decision.For example, suppose the customer said they want their new deck built as soon as possible, but at the latest they need it completed before a holiday gathering they have planned in three weeks. You might provide an estimate for getting the deck completed just by their deadline, and another for getting it done more quickly by hiring additional labor. It may be worth the extra cost for them to have the peace of mind of knowing that their deck will be completed before their party, even if there are weather delays.

, Once you've finished your estimate, proofread it carefully before you print it off. Sign the letter and date your signature, then make a copy for your own records before delivering the estimate to the potential client."

Use a style that is consistent with the original contract.,
Specify the parties to the contract.For example: This contract is between John Doe (""Employer"") and Jane Smith (""Employee"").

,
Include the date upon which the addendum is to become effective.For example: ""This addendum shall become effective as of today, May 5, 2010."",
List the terms and parts of the original contract that the addendum is modifying.,
Add a signature block.,
Add a notary block.,
Make sure your addendum complies with the existing contract.,
Review the applicable law.,
Consult an attorney.,
Agree to the essential terms of the addendum.,
Obtain signatures of all parties who signed the original contract.,
Exchange an additional promise or asset.",How to Write a Contract Addendum," The addendum needs to look like the original contract so that it is clear the two documents are connected.Use the same typeface, margins and font size.
Reference the date of the original contract.
Title the document in a way that shows it is an addendum to the original contract. For example: ""Addendum to January 2, 2009 Employment Contract"".;
,,
Place the date in a way that is consistent with the original contract. If the original contract included the date at the beginning of the text, then follow the same format in the addendum.

, Be clear, thorough and concise in describing the modifications. Specify whether each item replaces a current item in the contract, changes one, or is a new item. For example: ""Item I of the Employment Contract shall be modified as follows with the text in bold added to the Item and the text containing a strikethrough deleted:""
Use strikethrough and italic or bold font to clarify additions, deletions, and modifications.
Attach the original contract to the addendum and reference the fact that you have done so in your addendum. For example: ""the original Employment Contract dated January 2, 2009 is attached and made a part of this document"". This will ensure that any party executing the addendum is clear as to which specific contract the addendum modifies.

, The signature block should contain a blank space for the date the addendum will be executed, lines for each party to sign, and each party's typed or printed name., Each of the party’s signatures on a contract may be notarized in order to prove that he or she did, in fact, sign the contract.

, For your addendum to be enforceable, it must comply with the terms of the existing contract. Often, a contract will specify the circumstances under which it can be amended. Therefore, it is imperative that you read the terms of the existing contract before preparing the addendum. Be particularly wary of contractual terms that:Prohibit addendums to the contract, especially with regard to altering specific rights or responsibilities.
Allow one party to change the terms of the contract without the consent of the other parties involved.
Set forth specific requirements for changing the existing contract, such as requiring that any amendment be made in writing and signed by all parties.

, In addition to complying with the terms of the existing contract, your contract addendum must meet the requirements of the applicable law. The majority of contracts (i.e. employment agreements, leases, business agreements) are controlled by the common law of the state in which the agreement was made. Contracts for the sale of goods are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).Under the common law of most states, a contract addendum is only enforceable if a right or asset of value (known as ""consideration"") is exchanged. Under the UCC, consideration is not required to make an addendum enforceable.Contracts governed by both the UCC and common law generally require mutual assent, meaning that all parties must agree to the important elements of the amended contract., If you are unsure of whether your contract addendum complies with the terms of the existing contract and applicable law, you may want to consult with an attorney. This is particular true if the contract:


Involves high stakes or a lot of money. May require consideration to be enforceable, since what constitutes sufficient consideration varies depending on the circumstances of the contract and state law.Specifies rigorous requirements for modifying the contract and you are unsure how to meet them., Generally, unless the terms of the contract specify otherwise, a valid addendum requires mutual assent. This means that all parties must fully understand and agree to the important elements of the addendum. If any of the parties do not understand or agree to an essential term of the addendum, it will not be enforceable.Before preparing the addendum, discuss the changes you want to make with the other parties. Make sure everyone understands and agrees to their new rights and obligations under the addendum.
Once you have a draft of the addendum, send it to the other parties for their review. Do not sign the addendum until everyone has reached an agreement regarding the essential terms.

, Generally, unless the terms of the contract specify otherwise, a valid addendum requires the signature of all parties who signed the original contract. This provides evidence that all parties agreed to the addendum, though for the agreement to be enforceable, all parties must also understand what they are signing.If one of the parties who signed the original contract is not available, an agent can sign in his place. For an agent's signature to be sufficient, the original signatory must have expressly granted the agent the authority to sign contracts on his behalf.

, In most cases, an addendum requires an additional exchange of ""consideration"" to be enforceable. This does not usually apply to contracts for the exchange of goods, since these are governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).Consideration is a benefit that each party expects to get from the contract. For example, if you rent an apartment, you receive the benefit of using the apartment and the landlord receives the benefit of your paying him rent. Employment agreements, leases, business agreements are contracts that may require additional consideration for an addendum to be binding.
Consider consulting an attorney if you believe consideration may be required, since what constitutes sufficient consideration varies depending on the circumstances of the contract and state law.

Use a more formal business format.,
Label your quotation.,
Break down how long it will take you to complete the job.,
Get total costs for materials and labor.,
Determine your profit margin.,
Describe the job in detail.,
Provide a total cost for your services.,
State how long the quote is valid.,
List any additional payment terms.,
Sign your quotation.",How to Write an Estimate5," Since a quotation is a legally enforceable document, you want to be more formal with an exact quotation than you were with any previous estimates. However, you can still strike a warm, cordial tone – it shouldn't be overly formal or filled with too much legalese.In some cases, a customer may ask for a quote rather than an estimate. Or, a customer to whom you've provided an estimate may request a more exact quote.
Thank the customer for the opportunity to work with them, and include a statement about how excited or interested you are in their project. If there is something specific about the project that sparks your interest, mention it briefly. You will give the customer the impression that you are personally invested in their project.
For example, you might write ""Thank you so much for the opportunity to build your deck. I am especially excited to work on the fire pit at the center, which I think will be a lovely addition to the ambience of your backyard retreat.""

, Just as with an estimate, a quotation should be clearly labeled as such so your customer knows it is an exact price that they can rely on when making a decision whether to hire you.The same as with the estimate, you can put the word ""QUOTATION"" or ""QUOTE"" at the top of the page in all caps. If you used red for estimates, you might consider using a different color, such as green, to distinguish the quote from the estimate – particularly if you've given the customer both.

, A timeline for completion is important for the customer to know so they can decide which contractor to hire for their job. Include any deadlines provided by your customer, and make an effort to show completion of the work well before that deadline if possible., For a quote, your prices for materials and labor need to be exact. This means you'll need to contact suppliers to find out about material costs. Be sure to ask how long those prices are good, because you'll need to factor this into how long the quote is valid.Transportation, hired labor, and equipment rentals also should be included here.
Don't forget to include any administrative costs, licensing or inspection fees, and other expenses you will incur as a result of completing the project.

, Your profit margin is one part of your quote that typically will vary depending on the customer, their location, and the demands of the project they've offered to you.For example, you may be willing to work for a limited profit if the customer is a church or nonprofit organization.
To calculate profit, decide on a percentage and then multiply the subtotal by that number. Then add that amount to get the total cost for the customer.

, On the quote itself, outline the specific steps of the job in more specific detail than you did for the estimate. Then you'll want to itemize the cost for each of those steps.The more detailed you are, the more you'll inspire confidence in the customer that you're not hiding anything or trying to charge them for services they're not getting.

, Create a subtotal, then calculate any taxes that you'll have to charge the customer for your services. Add the taxes to the subtotal and provide the total on a separate line, bolded so the customer can see it clearly.Specify that the price is legally binding if accepted by the customer. If there are specific conditions, such as a weather event, that could result in the quote being altered or rescinded, these should be stated specifically.

, Because of the exact nature of a quote, it typically isn't going to be accurate indefinitely. Costs of materials may fluctuate over time. In most cases 30 days is a sufficient length of time, but you should never leave a quote valid for more than 60 days., If you require a deposit, or want partial payment before the work begins, this should be stated clearly on your quote. You also may want to include language that any payment constitutes acceptance of the quote.For example, if you require cash on delivery, you should include the term ""COD"" at the end of your quote.
If you require a deposit, state exactly how much is required and the deadline by which you must receive it in order to start the project on the timeline specified.

, The quotation should be signed by the person who ultimately has legal responsibility for it. If you are a small business owner, this typically is you. However, if you work as a manager for someone else, you may need to get the company owner to sign off on the quotation.Make a copy of the signed quotes for your business records before delivering it to the customer.

Gather the financial documents that detail the money you have made on a particular job.,
Calculate the total amount paid for the work you did.,
Figure out the number of days you worked on the job.,
Divide your contract or salary total by the number of days you worked.,
Repeat this process with other positions you have held to get a good idea of your salary history.

",How to Work out Your Day Rate," This can include your pay stubs, tax documents and/or signed contracts.;
, Remember to include commission, if that is part of your yearly salary. Generally, a day rate is calculated according to the gross income, and it does not factor in taxes, 401 K contributions or medical savings accounts.


Taxes vary from state to state and country to country. If you are attempting to figure out how your daily rate competes against a national or state average, it is especially important to work with gross salary rates.

, For a standard, 5-day, work week and salaried job, you would multiply 5 times 52, the number of weeks in the year. Modify the result, 260, based on any un-paid work days.

, For example, if you received $45,000 and worked 260 days, your day rate would be $173 per day.


Imagine you are working as a freelancer and you were paid $7,000 for a project that lasted 3 months. If you worked 5 days per week, you would multiply 5 times 12 (weeks) to get 60 total working days. Divide $7,000 by 60 to get your $116.67 day rate.

, Next, sit down and write a serious business plan for yourself. It doesn’t need to be a behemoth of an undertaking. Simply set a few realistic goals, reasonable budget, time frame and take a good hard look at what you’re trying to accomplish. Is it feasible and is it a viable money-making opportunity? Consider your target market – is it too much for a small start up to tackle? If so, focus your efforts on a smaller and more manageable niche and then work on growing it out once you’ve reached profitability. Is it too small to reach and sustain adequate levels of profitability over time? If the answer is yes, look to expand your product offering so it meets the needs of a larger market. Or look to sell something else. Then create a road map of all the tasks you need to accomplish and the due dates and milestones you’re going to attach to each one.

, Most online sellers, don’t create their own products from scratch, they locate and resell those products for a profit. A significant advantage to selling on line? You can locate a wholesale supplier who rather than shipping inventory to you, will ship straight to your end customer once an order is placed. This is called a drop ship supplier.

, As an entrepreneur, you have many skills, you’re resourceful, you’re creative, you’ve got a good business sense, and a whole lot of other strengths and abilities that will help you succeed. Website design however, might not make this list, and frankly, it doesn’t need to. There are a number of reputable solutions out there. Depending on your particular needs, you can use do any thing from using their simple tools to set up your own website to hiring one of their professional designers to build a custom site for you. And these services won’t break the bank either. A good professionally designed premium template can cost as little as $1000. Often these services also offer integrated shopping carts and order management systems so you’re not just getting a website, you’re getting a full business solution, which is a huge time and money saver (especially if you don’t have a lot of spare start-up capital). A select number of online storefronts will have even built relationships with a host so you can use them to source products too.

, Once you’ve got your inventory built out and have your e-commerce up and running, you’ll need to spread the word, and get your name out there. This can include submitting your site to search engines, sending out press releases, pay-per-click advertising campaigns, and a number of other options. Whatever strategies you tackle ensure you can track the performance of each one. This allows you to assess which strategies resonate with your target market and which are a drain on your precious capital.

, Providing great customer support will set you apart from the competition and encourage repeat business, which in turn will make you money and keep you in business.

, Keep updating your product lines, your website, stay in contact with your customer base so they keep coming back and you keep making sales.

Research the competition.,
Examine different consulting fee structures.",How to Set Consulting Fees1," Consultants are extremely wary about giving their rate information to people, because they don't want to be undercut by new consultants with lower prices. However, there are other ways to do some research.


Ask friends and family who use consultants in your industry what they have paid for these services. They may not be able to tell you the exact services, but they can give you an idea of what they look for and at what price.
Use a mentor or professional network to ask people in different but similar markets what they charge. If someone is a consultant in a different state, they may be willing to share industry knowledge. Keep in mind that people on the coasts or in cities can charge 25 percent more than in other areas.
Sign up for a consulting session on a business mentor site like PivotPlanet. During these paid sessions, you can ask successful consultants in your industry the tough questions, such as rate setting and service package options.;
, You can price by the hour, the day, by project or with a retainer.


Most beginning consultants use a daily rate or hourly rate structure. If you don't have a package of services set up, this may be the best way to start until you get a better idea of what your clients will want. IT consultants and social media consultants usually charge by the hour.
Other consultants use a project-based rate. This requires you to know the details of the project very well and have a good understanding of your own efficiency. Marketing, public relations, web design and graphic design often charge by the project. If you have to supply something and it isn't heavily dependent on other parties, this can be your best option; however, there are some risks to doing this. If the project gets delayed by the company, or they ask to completely redo it, you can find yourself with a low hourly rate or being unable to bill.
Some professionals, such as lawyers, CPA and financial consultants keep a retainer. They project an hourly rate and how many hours the project will take and ask the client to pay in advance. This is an excellent way to guard against potential non-payment; however, a retainer is hard to sell in some industries like writing, marketing and customer service.

Take a warm shower.,
Inhale steam to clear your sinuses.,
Apply a warm towel.,
Use a saline spray.,
Use a neti pot.,
Gargle salt water.,
Blow your nose correctly.",How to Cure a Cold With Household Resources1," To reduce nasal congestion, drain mucus, and soothe sore muscles, take a warm shower or bath for 5 to 10 minutes. Keep the water temperature around 40–45ºC. Make sure the water is not too hot or cold, especially if you have a fever. Some studies suggest that warm showers also help reduce anxiety and stress. Lukewarm baths can also benefit children and infants with nasal congestion.People with sensitive skin should only take a warm shower once or twice a week to prevent their skin from drying out.
Keeping your body clean can also help reduce the risk of further viral or bacterial infections.;
, For a quick steam treatment, you can heat up a pot of distilled water to almost boiling (approx. 80–85ºC). When it starts producing a lot of steam, remove the pot from the heat. Place a towel over your head, close your eyes and breathe deeply for about 5 to 10 minutes.Steam helps loosen mucus while also washing away any foreign matter (like dust or pollen) that came into contact with your nasal passages.

, Soak a small, clean towel in lukewarm water for 3 to 5 minutes before wringing out the water. Place it on your forehead or on other sore muscles for 5 minutes. Repeat this process for a total of 20 minutes. Or, you can use a hot water bottle or gel pack to apply a gentle heat. If you have sensitive skin, don't apply heat greater than 30 degrees C. If you have a fever, don't use heat. Instead, apply an ice pack.


Applying a warm towel to your forehead or neck can help drain the mucus and relieve sinus headaches caused by inflammation and congestion in the nasal passages. The heat opens up blood vessels, which increases blood flow and supplies oxygen and nutrients to reduce pain in joints and relax sore muscles, ligaments, and tendons.Don’t use heat on injuries, wounds or stitches. People with poor circulation and diabetes should practice caution when using warm compression.

, Saline sprays add moisture to nasal passages and help clean them of crusts and mucus. You can purchase over-the-counter saline sprays, available as either a pressurized canister or pump spray bottle, at most drug stores. Ask your doctor for a recommendation. Follow the specific packaged instructions on the saline spray that you purchase. Realize that some may sting slightly or cause irritation.Saline sprays work by inserting the spray applicator into your nostril and spraying a fine mist of the solution while you inhale. Most saline sprays are safe to use as often as you like on a daily basis. But, if you experience nosebleeds, discontinue use for a few days. If bleeding or irritation continues, speak with your doctor.

, A neti pot helps you irrigate your nasal passages, which flushes mucus from your sinuses. Place 4 ounces of saline solution in your neti pot.. Tilting your head to one side, insert the tip of the neti pot into the other nostril and pour it into the nostril. The liquid should flow down and out of your other nostril. Tilt your head to the opposite side and repeat with the other nostril. A saline solution is poured into one nostril, and it carries mucus out the other. Start with just 1 irrigation a day. If you notice improvement, use 8 to 16 ounces of solution in each nostril 1 to 2 times a day.Neti pots are available at most drug stores and health food shops.
You can buy a saline solution or make your own. To make your own solution, use ¼ tsp. of kosher or pickling salt, ¼ tsp. of baking soda and 8 ounces of warm distilled water (around 40°C or 105°F).

, Place ½ teaspoon of sea salt in a glass of distilled or sterilized warm (30-35ºC) water and stir until it's dissolved. Gargle the water for 1 to 2 minutes, then spit it out instead of swallowing. If the salt irritates your mouth or throat, you can also use plain, distilled warm water for gargles. Repeat the gargling every few hours to moisturize your sinuses. This will let the mucus drain and can soothe a sore throat.


The salt contains anti-viral properties that kill germs and promote healing. This can reduce the recovery period of a cold., Gently blow your nose when you have a cold. This can keep your sinuses clear. Experts recommended that you blow your nose by holding a finger over one nostril and gently blowing the other into a tissue. Repeat with the other nostril. Wash your hands each time you blow your nose, to avoid chances of other infections by bacteria or viruses.Avoid blowing it too hard because the pressure can impact your ears, giving you an earache on top of your cold. Only blow your nose as often as necessary.

Choose a consulting area where you have a lot of knowledge and experience. A good consultant has the expertise to anticipate what questions and problems a client will have. You should not have to be told what needs fixing.If you are passionate about a field but aren’t entirely up to date in it, get that training now! It’s much better to figure out where you are before you set up your firm than when a client comes to you with a problem you can’t tackle.
Some of the top areas for consulting include the following: accounting, advertising, marketing, communications, grant-writing, public relations, and writing and editing.;
, As a consultant, you will need to be able to explain why your services are the best. Many people may have the same knowledge as you, and this is where skills come in. For example, you might be great with numbers and a ""people person."" This skill would give you an advantage over a consultant who is great with numbers but not a good communicator. Determining what skills you have will help you present yourself to clients and set you apart from the competition.Consider: Are you good at being objective? Are you an excellent writer? Skilled at communicating problems without sounding too harsh or judgmental? A creative problem-solver who can come in and fix issues? Good at teaching or training others? These are all roles that consultants frequently fill. Think broadly about your skills, and you might even find that you have some that surprise you!

, Think about what your priorities and needs are. Some people will be better suited to being their own boss than others because of their personality traits and life goals. To succeed at consulting, you should have the following personality characteristics:A strong sense of organization
A love of networking
The ability to think creatively
The ability to motivate and supervise yourself
The ability to handle risk and unpredictability
Your needs and goals may also help determine whether consulting is right for you. Being your own boss can give you freedom and flexibility. It can also mean that you don’t always have a reliable, steady income, especially when you’re first starting out. You may also not keep a regular work schedule. If these things seem unappealing to you, consulting might not be the right choice., In addition to your small business license, you may also need to file other paperwork to practice consulting in your area. For example, in most states, financial planners, real estate agents, and fundraising consultants need some sort of certification or licensure.The last thing you want to do is establish your firm, set up a network of clients, and then get shut down because you forgot to get the appropriate credentials.Certification usually involves meeting education and work experience requirements. There is usually an exam and a fee. Even if certification in your field is not required, its prestige could give you a competitive advantage in finding work.

, Look for coverage gaps are in your area of expertise. What are other companies already doing? Is there a niche in your area that you can fill? What clients and companies could benefit from your knowledge and skills? Can you target a particular audience to make yourself stand out? What are the going rates for services like yours?Think about how you'll distinguish your services from others. For example, imagine you're a marketing consultant. Your market research shows that all the other marketing consultants in your area specialize in big business. Focus your company on working with small businesses instead. Suddenly, you're the only expert in the neighborhood!
Many businesses, non-profit agencies, government departments, and individuals hire consultants, especially during “crunch-times” like just before large trade shows or during tax season., It’s important to write a business plan to help you figure out how to turn your knowledge and skills into profit. If you have to find investors for start-up capital, you'll need to show them a solid business plan to convince them to invest. A basic business plan will include the following:A mission statement: who are you and what does your company stand for? What are your goals?
Market research on demand for your skills: who needs your services? Who is likely to buy them?
Advertising and marketing plan: how will you attract clients? How do your competitors do so?
Financial projections: how much money will you need to set up your company? How much money will you need to keep your business running?

, Many consultants operate their companies from home offices. This can be a great choice, because you don’t have to find a separate location, pay rent, or think about a commute. Once your business expands, you may need to find a different location. When you’re just starting out, keeping your expenses to a minimum will help your bottom line.Make sure to keep your home office separate from your personal living space as much as possible. If you use a spare bedroom, for example, don’t also use it as a guest room. Keeping your home office on its own will make your life much easier when tax season comes around.

, You need to have an idea of how much money your company will need to stay operational, including travel expenses, any business overhead, and your own salary. Writing your business plan will help you nail this information down. Use this to determine your hourly rate or consulting fees. It can be hard to get information on your competitors’ rates, but you may be able to ask someone in your professional network for advice. Websites such as Careers in Businesscan also help you find out what other consultants in your area earn.


Surprisingly, new consultants tend to undercharge. This can be bad for business for several reasons. Fees that are too low may not give your clients confidence that you are the top person in your field. Charging too little can make it hard for you to keep your business afloat.There are many ways to organize your fees. You can charge by the hour or by the project. You can work “on retainer,” where a business or client pays you a set monthly fee for your continual services. If you’re just starting out, it may be more comfortable for your clients to start with an hourly fee.The business you’re in may also help determine how you charge for your consulting services. IT consultants often charge by the hour, while management or marketing consultants often charge by the project. Financial planners and accountants often work on retainer., Although it’s not always required, registering your consulting company with state and local offices can provide several benefits. For example, a registered business can get a tax identification number from the IRS. This number will allow you to qualify for business bank and credit accounts, among other things. Talk to a lawyer or accountant to find out how to register a consulting company, as the process varies by state.


You may also want to consider incorporating your business, especially if you need to limit your liability (i.e., make sure that your personal assets aren’t up for grabs if you’re sued or take a loss).Consult with a securities attorney and an accountant to help you decide whether incorporation is right for you.

, Determine whether you have time to do it yourself or if it would make more sense to hire an employee to do tasks like mailing sales brochures, answering the phone and setting up appointments.


You may be able to find a service that offers temporary administrative assistance, such as a secretarial support firm. This could be a good option if you only have an administrative crunch a few times a year. It could also be helpful if you just need someone to handle administrative tasks while you get your company up and running.Hiring an employee to officially work for your company usually requires that you have certain business and tax procedures in place. Check with your accountant before you hire an official employee.

, Particularly if you’re just starting out, a strong brand identity will help communicate who you are and what you do to potential clients. Purchase professional business cards, create a website, and maintain social media accounts like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.It’s important to keep your accounts up to date! Post regularly to show that you’re committed to staying in touch with the developments in your field.
Consider starting a professional blog. This can be a great way for you to show off your extensive knowledge and experience. It will also help potential customers get to know you.

, Join local business associations and professional groups to market your services. Attend trade and industry shows in your field. Speak at public events. Teach aspects of your field via local adult education classes. Hold seminars or training sessions to showcase your professional consultant skills.Networking will help you connect with other business experts in your area. These people may end up having connections that can help you out! Be generous with your time and advice, and others will usually want to help you in return.
Invest enough time into networking to keep your business running! Some experts suggest that “close rates” (the number of clients who hire you after your sales pitch) are between 10% and 20% for consultants. This means that you will need to constantly go after new business, meet new people, and market your services., Adjust your schedule to have enough time for sales and networking activities as well as actual consulting. Keep your schedule and work areas well organized to make it easier to take care of tasks and manage your time.


If you’re bad about wasting time on things like social media sites, try making yourself do tasks in short, concentrated bursts. The “Pomodoro Method” involves having yourself set a time for a short period of time, such as 20 or 40 minutes. You will focus exclusively on your task during that time (no interruptions!). Then, you take a quick break before doing your next task. Techniques like this can help you boost your productivity., Unlike traditional sales services, where you usually have a distinct product that people want (doughnuts, cars, dentistry), your skills are the product in consulting. Your clients may not even be aware that they need your services, but cold calling can let them know how much you could help them.Plan ahead! Do a little research on the potential clients you plan to cold-call. Having a little information on the person/company will help you target potential clients that could really benefit from your services. You’ll also feel more knowledgeable and confident when you cold call if you’ve done a bit of groundwork first.
Cold calls should have a ""script"" that introduces you and your services. This shouldn't sound overly formal or rehearsed.You should show that you respect your prospect's time by having a statement like ""I know you're busy and I respect your time, so I'll be brief.""Have a ""hook."" This should be a compelling fact or reason that will get your prospect's attention. For example, ""My firm just saved Lucky's Doughnuts $4,000 on powdered sugar by revamping their shipping plan. I'm reaching out because I wanted to see if there's a way my services can benefit your company too.""
Invite them to talk. If you can get your prospect to talk about their business by asking them a question or two, they're more likely to stay on the line.
Think past the phone. You can also use email and LinkedIn to introduce yourself and your services. In fact, it’s a good idea to send a “warm call” first via email or LinkedIn to tell a prospective client that you’ll be calling them in a few days.Keep emails and messages short!
Don’t be pushy. While you definitely do want to close the sale, you don’t want to come across as being pushy or overly aggressive. Focus on the personal service relationship you can create between your company and the client. How can you help them? That will help you come across as trustworthy, rather than a shill., Some consultants view traditional advertising, such as buying print ads in newspapers or having TV ads, as a bad idea for a consulting company. These advertising types may seem to cheapen your brand. Instead, create original, helpful content in your field of expertise that’s easily found online. Write online and print articles and publish them on your blog, in the local paper, and in various trade magazines. Keep your social media profiles up to date with great information about your field. When customers see your expertise displayed this way, they’ll feel good about hiring you.Advertising in publications by your professional association and trade journals or magazines can be a good idea. These publications are already targeted to a specific audience and ads in them are less likely to be seen as amateurish.Good informative brochures can also be a great advertising tactic. A brochure should tell your potential clients who you are, exactly what services you offer, why they should hire you, and a bit about your successes.Maintaining a newsletter is another great way to keep prospective and current clients informed about your services and your skill set. Keep your newsletter simple and provide a few great pieces of information every month. You can look at newsletters published by other companies by examining newsletter directories such as the Oxbridge Directory of Newsletters and Hudson’s Newsletter Directory, both of which should be available at your local library.Remember that word-of-mouth is still one of the most powerful advertisements for any company. Do a great job and treat your clients like people, not profits, and they will be happy to refer their friends to you.

, You may feel awkward about doing this at first, but keep in mind that if you’ve done your job, your customers should be comfortable recommending your services to people they know. If you’re worried that your clients wouldn’t be comfortable referring you, then you might want to consider why. Is it because you’re not used to taking a direct approach, or is it because you’re genuinely worried that your services aren’t good enough? If you’re not asking for referrals just because you think it’s somehow odd, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity."

Calculate your hourly rate.,
Calculate project rates.,
Calculate your retainer.,
Adjust your fees for expertise.",How to Set Consulting Fees2," Once this is settled, you will be able to calculate projects and retainers from this figure.


Find your pay information from your most recent salaried jobs. Determine what your hourly wage was by dividing your weekly/bi-weekly payment by the number of hours you worked in that time.
Figure out your new consulting hourly rate by tripling this number. Consultants must base their rate on their wage plus expenses and administration of running your own business. When you triple your wage and round up to the nearest multiple of 5 or 10, you should have a reasonable rate for providing for all 3 of these payments.
If you work in a consulting field that has very low overhead, you may need to charge double the hourly wage instead of triple to remain competitive, while still covering your wages and expenses. Internet-based work from home jobs might fit into this category, if you do not have employees.
Compare your calculated rate to those of your competitors. If your doubled or tripled hourly rate is in the range you found during your research, then it is likely you can move forward and decide whether you want to offer project or retainer rates.
To figure out your daily rate, multiply the new consulting hourly rate by the number of hours (around 8), that you will work on the project. Some consultants also offer half-day rates.

, Do some research into past jobs to see how long certain projects tend to take. Try to find 5 to 10 different projects, take an average of them and then multiply the average hours by your newly set rate.


You may be tempted to undercut your competitors with a lower project-based fee. Keep in mind that many businesses identify higher cost with higher quality. If you set your fees high, you can always negotiate a little lower, but it is hard to add to your project costs for repeat customers.
Make detailed notes about what is included in the project, so that you can compare like for like. You will need to return to these notes when starting to set the scope of your projects.

, If a company wants a number of projects in a month, quarter or year, you can sit down and calculate what amount of time you will be setting aside to work on their projects. If you cannot judge by a project basis, then decide how many days per week you will work for that company and multiply your daily rate by that number each month you plan to work.

, If you can advertise that you are a forerunner of your industry, you can charge more. The following are good indicators that you can raise your rates slightly:


You have written a book. In this case, you have taken the time to evaluate the industry and provide professional opinions. This makes you both a teacher and an expert. People will pay more money to have a consultant who is an author.
You have been consulting in some capacity for years. If you are starting a new consulting business, but you can prove that you have completed projects for 5 to 10 years, you can place yourself on the high end of the fee spectrum.
You have moved to a new area. If you have moved from the suburbs or a rural setting to an urban location, increase your rates by around 25 percent. If you are moving away from an urban location, reduce your rates by around 25 percent, even if you are an expert. Your rate is based on cost of living as well as expertise.
You have a number of big name clients. If you do not have a non-disclosure agreement, then advertise the large contracts that you work with. Potential clients will assume that you are worth more if you are chosen by companies they recognize and respect.

"
"
Establish a process for setting a scope for each project or contract.,
Consider free consultations or first-time customer discounts to attract new business.,
Throw in a few extra, non-billed hours, to give the client added value.,
Increase your rates slightly for very short-term work.,
Experiment with rates.",How to Set Consulting Fees3," If you are going by a project basis, you will need to be able to say ""That is beyond the scope of the project,"" so that you are not offering services for free if a client changes their mind. If a client wants to change the scope, build in a renegotiation process so that you aren't doing work you are not working on something for free.

, It is better to break into your consulting field by taking this 1-time hit in payment, than to set low rates. Your client will appreciate the discount, but understand when they are billed in full next time.

, You want to be able to bill at the higher rate, but if you feel that you want the client to be extra-pleased with your work, you have the freedom to bill for fewer hours than you worked. It is not a good idea to do this very often, but it is better than setting a low figure at the start.

, You want the client to see the value in employing you on larger projects, so raise your rates for small projects, and then offer to discount them if you take a larger role.

, If you are brand new, you can start high and send out proposals until you find a ""sweet spot"" where your services are billed at the right level. You may find that this level is higher than you expected.

Never give Siberian ginseng to a child. People with high blood pressure, sleep disorders, heart disease, schizophrenia, autoimmune diseases, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Siberian ginseng.

, Elderberry is commonly used to treat respiratory illnesses, sore throats, coughs and fevers due to its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. It also stimulates the immune system. Elderberry extract can be found as a syrup, lozenge or dietary capsule supplement at most nutrition or drug stores. You can also try steeping 3 to 5 grams of dried elder flower in a cup of boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Drink this as a herbal tea, up to 3 times per day.

Elderberry is a blood thinner and may not be recommended for people with low blood pressure.
Do not use unripe or uncooked elderberries as they may be poisonous.
Elderberry may have some side effects for pregnant women, people with autoimmune disease, and people taking diabetic medication, laxatives, chemotherapy drugs, or immunosuppressants. Talk with your doctor before taking a supplement.

, There are several ways to apply or use peppermint. Use peppermint lozenges, take peppermint extract in dietary supplements, drink peppermint tea, use peppermint essential oil, or use it as a fresh herb (as a garnish or flavoring in meals). Peppermint contains menthol, which can help soothe sore throats and dry coughs. It works as a decongestant to thin mucus and help break up phlegm. Just be sure not to use peppermint or menthol for children under 2 years old.To make your own peppermint tea, steep 1 bag (3- grams or 1.5 teaspoons) of dried peppermint leaves in a cup of hot water. Take it 3 times a day.
To use peppermint as a rub, dilute peppermint essential oil in a carrier oil, like jojoba or almond oil. Add 5 drops of peppermint essential oil to 1/2 fluid oz (approx. 15ml) of carrier oil. Store any unused portions in a dark-glass dropper bottle that has a tight screw top. Massage the oil onto your forehead, back of your neck or wrists for 3 to 5 minutes. Never take peppermint oil orally.

, Eucalyptus can also be used in a variety of ways. You can buy eucalyptus lozenges, cough syrups, and vapor baths to sooth sore throats. Topical ointments containing eucalyptus leaves can applied to the nose and chest to relieve congestion and loosen phlegm which can prevent mucus from aggravating the throat. For adults, eucalyptus is generally safe when applied to the skin. Eucalyptus contains a compound (cineole) that works as an expectorant to fight respiratory infections, reduce congestion and alleviate coughs. It also has antioxidant properties that protect against free radicals, molecules that can damage and infect cells.To make eucalyptus tea, steep 2 to 4 grams of dried eucalyptus leaves in a cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. Take it up to 3 times a day.
To make a eucalyptus gargle, steep 2 to 4 grams of dried eucalyptus leaves in 1 cup of warm water for 5 to 10 minutes. Gargle the liquid after meals to reduce bad breath, help drain mucus, and soothe your throat. Do this up to 3 or 4 times a day.
Do not take eucalyptus oil by mouth as it can be poisonous. People with asthma, seizures, liver or kidney disease, or low blood pressure should not use eucalyptus without asking their doctor.

It also makes your body sweat, which can cool your body and reduce fevers. Blue vervain also has anti-inflammatory properties to flush toxins from your body. You can take it as a supplement, tea, or syrup. Take 1 capsule with a meal and glass of water at least once or twice a day.To make blue vervain tea, steep 1/2 teaspoon of blue vervain in 1 cup of boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes. Strain the liquid and drink the tea up to 2 times a day, especially before bed.
Blue vervain should not be used if you are taking diuretic medication or caffeine, as it may cause dehydration. Ask your doctor before using blue vervain if you are pregnant, have a digestive problem, or are taking any other medications.

, Eating licorice root can help alleviate a cough or sore throat commonly associated with a cold. There are several licorice root pills and serums you can buy at health foods stores, or you can eat 1 to 5 grams of real licorice root at home. When buying licorice, look for licorice with a main ingredient of licorice root (not anise or licorice flavoring).To make a licorice tea, soak 1 to 5 grams of licorice sticks in a cup of boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes. Strain and drink the liquid once a week.
Don't give a child licorice tea for more than a day without talking to your doctor. Never give any licorice tea to an infant or toddler. Licorice should also be avoided by anyone with high blood pressure, hepatitis, liver or kidney disease, or is pregnant.

Get enough sleep.,
Sleep on your side.,
Prop your head on a pillow.,
Relax once you get into bed.,
Tell your doctor if you have sleep apnea.",How to Cure a Cold With Household Resources3," Getting enough sleep is important in order for your body to heal itself when you have a cold. Studies show that sleep deprivation can weaken the immune system, increase the production of stress hormones, put you at higher risk for chronic disease and lower life expectancy. Make sure you get quality sleep by:Avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and sugary drinks 4 to 6 hours before sleeping. These can act as a stimulant to keep you awake.
Creating a quiet, dark, and cool environment. Use heavy curtains or an eye mask to block light, a powerful cue that tells the brain that it's time to wake up. Keep the temperature comfortably cool—between 65 and 75°F—and the room well ventilated.
Avoiding activities like work or exercise 3 to 4 hours before sleeping. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can make your body secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with increasing alertness.
Having a regular sleep schedule which creates better quality and consistent sleep. Try to set a routine by going to bed early and waking up early to set your body’s internal clock.

, If you have a cold or nasal congestion, try to lie on the side that is least congested. This might allow the mucus to drain. Sleeping on your side, especially if you have a cold, flu, or ear or nasal infection can help you breathe more comfortably, leading to a better night’s sleep.Avoid sleeping on your stomach since this can obstruct breathing and cause unnecessary stress.

, If you have trouble breathing, try to prop your head up on a pillow to improve airflow and keep mucus from blocking your sinuses. The pillow for your head should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable. If your pillow is too high, it can put your neck into a position that causes muscle strain on your back, neck, and shoulders. Instead, your pillow should be adjustable to let you to sleep in different positions.If you sleep on your side, a firm pillow between your knees will prevent your upper leg from pulling your spine out of alignment. This also reduces stress on your hips and lower back. Pull your knees up slightly toward your chest.
A rolled towel or small pillow under your waist may also help support the curve of your spine.

, If you have trouble falling asleep, relaxation techniques can help relieve physical and psychological stress. Once you have found the things that help you relax, make them into a bedtime ritual. To help yourself relax, try reading a book, listening to calm music or practicing breathing exercises.You may get frustrated if you struggle to fall asleep. If you are awake for more than 20 minutes in bed, move to a different part of the house without bright lights. Do something relaxing for a while, until you begin to feel tired and then come back to bed.

, If you have frequently interrupted breathing during sleep, also known as obstructive sleep apnea, ask your doctor for treatment options. Your doctor may recommend surgery or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP is a common therapy for sleep apnea which includes a small machine that supplies constant and steady air pressure, a hose, and a mask or nose piece.Some CPAP devices even come with a heated humidifier to help with a dry, stuffy nose.

Get moderate exercise.,
Manage your stress through breathing techniques.,
Practice tai chi to reduce stress.,
Do yoga to relax.,
Run a humidifier.,
Use an air purifier.,
Get an indoor houseplant.,
Quit smoking.",How to Cure a Cold With Household Resources4," Mild to moderate exercises such as walking or stretching can improve your immune system, which reduces the recovery period and alleviates cold symptoms. Regular exercises also reduce the risk of infection over the long term. A daily 30 to 45 minute workout with moderate intensity exercises such as brisk walking, jogging and swimming is recommended. Try to avoid intensive training when you have a cold, fever or headache.Consider consulting with a physician or fitness instructor to help create a personalized fitness plan if you have certain heart, respiratory or bone-related conditions.

, Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Take a slow, deep breath, sucking in as much air as you can. As you're doing this, your belly should push against your hand. Hold your breath and then slowly exhale.Some studies suggest that practicing relaxation techniques on a regular basis may help reduce the duration of a cold or the flu., Tai chi is a gentle exercise program that is a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It is composed of slow, deliberate movements, meditation, and deep breathing, which enhance physical health and emotional well being. Many practitioners recommend practicing tai chi for about 15 to 20 minutes twice daily at home, since regular practice is essential for mastering the forms and achieving lasting results.Before beginning a tai chi program, you should check with your doctor and discuss your health needs with the tai chi instructor.

, Yoga is a mind-body therapy that improves fitness, lowers blood pressure, promotes relaxation and self-confidence, and reduces stress and anxiety. It uses physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve overall well-being. As with any physical activity, yoga can cause injury if not done correctly. It’s important to practice yoga with a trained teacher.Be sure to check with your doctor before trying yoga if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, or a recent back injury.

, Set the humidity in your home between 30% and 55% using a gauge called a humidistat, which you can buy from most hardware stores. If the humidity in your home is too high, mold and dust mites may thrive, both of which are common causes of allergies. Mold also causes an unpleasant smell and can discolor surfaces. If the humidity falls too low, it may cause dry eyes, throat and sinus irritations.Dry air can make it harder for mucus to drain from the nasal passages, prolonging congestion. Using a humidifier in your bedroom or living room adds moisture to the air to prevent dehydration, help clear your sinuses and soothe your throat.
Both portable and central humidifiers must be cleaned thoroughly. Otherwise, they can become contaminated with mold and bacterial growth that may be blown through the house. Stop the humidifier and call your healthcare provider if you develop any respiratory symptoms that you feel are related to the use of a humidifier.

, Using an air purifier or ionizer may help to keep allergens such as mold, dust, and pollen out of your air.Filtering these particles out of the air may improve your household air quality and make it easier for you to recover from a cold.


Air purifiers help clear the air of allergens that can irritate your nose and throat. They also keep your house smelling nice and clean.

, For a natural humidifier, consider getting a houseplant. Due to a process called transpiration, in which water vapor is released from the flowers, leaves and stems, plants can help regulate indoor humidity. Indoor plants also help clear the air of carbon dioxide and other pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene, which may otherwise irritate your nose and throat.Good indoor plants include aloe vera, bamboo palm, weeping fig, chinese evergreen, and various species of philodendron and dracaena.

, Cigarette smoke can irritate nasal tissue, often leading to frequent headaches and chronic coughing, also known as “smoker’s cough”. This can increase the duration and severity of your cold. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other hazardous fumes which can also cause irritation and discomfort. Ask your doctor about ways to reduce and quit smoking.Smoking deprives your body of the oxygen needed to repair and build cells. Smoking narrows the blood vessels that carry blood to the leg and arm muscles and to the brain, which can cause many respiratory and heart illnesses, difficulty breathing, and even stroke."

Remember the other resources available to you.",How to Set up a Home Tutoring Business," Tutors can provide assistance in nearly every subject that students take from elementary school all the way through college. Break down the grade levels and subjects with which you are comfortable enough to tutor students.Don’t forget to include those at a lower level. For example, if you’re comfortable tutoring in math all the way through calculus, then you shouldn’t forget to include algebra and geometry students.
If you’re not a retired teacher, substitute, or otherwise familiar with curriculums in your area, then check with your state’s department of education to see what you must be proficient in to tutor certain grade levels.Common Core standards have also been adopted by a number of U.S. states, so you can look into your state’s adoption of these standards for curriculum information as well.;
, Call other reputable tutoring services in your area to learn their services and rates. Find out if those rates are based on tutors who are certified or not as well. This research will help when you eventually decide on pricing, and it will also give you the chance to see the areas in which your competition specializes.Use this information to help set your service apart.

, Most states do not require any specialized training for someone to work as a tutor. However, parents are essentially entrusting the academic development of their children to you (not to mention paying for the service), so tutoring certifications can help separate you from the crowded tutor pack—not to mention translate into higher hourly fees. The National Tutoring Association (NTA) and American Tutoring Association (ATA) are two separate organizations that offer certifications to help distinguish your tutoring business.You can expect to spend between $200 and $500 for the certification depending on the subjects and course levels at which you seek certification., Once you know your areas of specialization, you can start building a brand for your business. Choose a name that sets your service apart, and Google it to ensure that it’s not already taken.You’ll additionally need to choose a name for the business before you can file for the business license in your state.

, While you’ll spend the bulk of your time as a tutor assisting students, you must remember that you are still starting a small business. You’ll have to file for the appropriate small business license in your state, perform bookkeeping duties, pay taxes, market your services, etc.For more information on these aspects, of the process, check out the information available at How to Start a Small Business.
If you’re unfamiliar with setting up a business, then you may want to see a tax specialist concerning the best way for you to file.However, you will most likely want to file your business as an LLC or limited liability corporation. This will protect you as the owner from the debts of the business if it fails or any judgments against it.You may also want to spend some time talking to a small business attorney who can point you in the right direction regarding state and local ordinances pertaining to liability, such as how to protect yourself in the event of a student injuring himself or herself while in your home., No parents will leave you alone with their children in your own home without first taking a tour of your setup. You’ll need to create a comfortable space with good lighting that is free of noise and other distractions that can interrupt student focus.Your space will obviously need to be clean and properly stocked with the necessary supplies and reference materials for your chosen subject as well.


Remember to track the expenses of all business-related purchases. You should even calculate the percentage of your monthly rent or mortgage payment that corresponds to the size of your tutoring space. All of these expenses amount to tax deductions that you can apply to your business when filing for the year.
You should always keep the rest of your home extremely clean as well. The parents will notice as they drop off and pick up their children if other areas of your home appear untidy and unprofessional.

, Do you want to tutor as an additional source of income, or do you want to tutor full time? Before you can determine your fees, you have to decide whether or not tutoring will become your sole source of income.Keep in mind that you’ll have to market specific services if you plan to tutor while most students are actually in school. This includes tutoring students on extended leaves of absence due to injury or illness.Tutoring at the college level helps with the daily scheduling since those students have varied schedules.
It’s normal to tutor in addition to your full-time job (or even another part-time job) as you build up a client base that allows you to transition to tutoring alone with more confidence as well.

, Deciding what to charge for your services can be one of the hardest parts of setting up a tutoring business. If you plan to work as a full-time tutor, then you must take both the business expenses as well as your general living expenses into account when setting up your fees.Plan to set aside three to six months of living expenses before you quit your current day job in hopes of developing your tutoring business.Remember that the higher the grade level and more advanced the subject, the higher you can charge for the service. Tutors may only charge $10 an hour to teach long division, whereas someone tutoring calculus derivatives can charge much more., Now that you’ve taken care of the legal and logistical aspects, you’re ready to start finding clients. Create a plan for how you want to market yourself. Get in touch with schools, libraries, and student organizations where you can leave flyers or business cards.Keep in mind that while your business applies to the students, you’re ultimately marketing yourself to the parents who will pay your fees., Word of mouth is a great way to begin accumulating clients, but a website will also go a long way to build your brand and your business.Many parents—even those who hear positive word-of-mouth recommendations—may not take your business seriously if they can’t find more information on the internet.


Consider having a blog on your website as well. You can regularly update it with general study tips or other helpful information that helps show you’re active with your website.A Facebook page for your tutoring service is another great way to help spread the word.

, Each student will have varying needs and areas for improvement, but you should set a consistent set of ground rules to provide students and their parents.This can include anything from coming prepared with certain materials to not allowing students to bring beverages into your house that can stain carpets. Organize your rules and create printouts that clearly communicate them.

, When you first meet with each student and his or her parent(s), come up with a tutoring plan. Layout a clear idea of the material you’ll need to cover, the number of sessions you anticipate the material taking, how you’ll measure improvement, etc.The clearer and more organized your plan for assisting the student, the more impressed and trusting the child’s parent(s) will be with regard to your abilities.

, Don’t take any of those business relationships for granted once you develop them. Provide regular updates to parents regarding what you covered with their children and how far the students are coming along with their respective subjects.The parents will appreciate the progress reports and proof that your service has been a worthwhile investment.


You may choose to provide feedback on other potential areas of improvement for the children if you see them, but do so tactfully since parents might not react well to hearing that their children need help in other areas.

, You’re likely to have questions about the business aspects of your tutoring service as you go. Remember to take advantage of resources such as the Small Business Administration (SBA) and local organizations meant to help small businesses in your area.These small business experts want you and your business to succeed, so don’t be afraid to reach out for help.

Persevere.",How to Stay Disciplined when Working Remotely1," Working remotely, for most people, is going to mean working at home. You need to designate a space where you dedicate your time and your materials to the work you are doing. You need to have the tools of your work readily at hand, whether these include a telephone, copier and computer, or art supplies, or any other kind of trade tools you might need.Treat the space as your “office” and provide yourself with what you need for success.Setting up a designated office at home can have tax benefits as well. To be allowed a deduction, though, you must have an office or other area that you use exclusively for work, and you must keep records of the time you spend there.;
, Whether you sit at a desk or draw at a drafting table, write on a computer or prefer an antique typewriter, you need to work in an environment that is conducive to accomplishing what you need to accomplish. For most people, this means minimizing distractions, whether those are from your children, the telephone or television. You need to set in your mind, and in the minds of those who share your space, that this is your “work time,” and you need to respect it as such.Obviously, emergencies may arise, and you may need to get called away. But working at home or any other offsite location has a tendency to lead to more interruptions than working in a standard office. You need to try to reduce those interruptions.
For some people, a positive work environment requires complete silence. For others, you may find that you work best with some music, either on headphones or in the room around you., Staying disciplined when working remotely is primarily a matter of good habits. You need to develop some routines for your work. By doing this, you will be more inclined to work efficiently when your routine says that it is “work time.” You will also enjoy your rest periods more and get more out of them when you know that you are not stealing from your work.For example, you could actually write down a schedule for your day. The schedule might say something like:9:00-11:00 Work on drafting project
11:00-12:00 Break for exercise and lunch
12:00-1:00 Telephone calls for work
1:00-3:30 Resume drafting work
3:30-5:00 Submit reports



, If you have a family and you work from home as a second income, for example, you should plan your work time when the rest of the family is away. You may need to see your children off to school and spouse to work, and then plan your work from about 9:00 until the children return from school. Another alternative that works for some people is working very early in the morning or very late at night.

, It is a good practice to write out a daily ""to-do"" list of tasks that you want to get done. By prioritizing this way, you will be more inclined to focus on getting those certain things done. The list will help you keep from feeling overwhelmed and will help you pay attention to the things that are important., If you have some bad habits about surfing the Internet when you should be working, you can use some computer tools to force yourself to stay on task.LeechBlock works on FireFox. It allows you to ban yourself from whatever sites you believe draw your attention away from your work.WasteNoTime performs this same function on Safari.StayFocused will do this on Chrome., Particularly if you are beginning a new task or are working on a project that is difficult, you may feel overwhelmed. When this happens, it is human nature to lose focus and drop your attention to your work. The quality of your work can suffer, as well as your efficiency and overall effectiveness. To combat this, sometimes you just need to be persistent and take things one step at a time. Focus not on the end product, which may appear too far away, but on the first step. Then the next. In that way, proceed until you reach the end."

Understand cold diffusion.,
Allow the scent to diffuse from bottle.,
Soak a cotton ball.,
Use warm water.,
Rub it into your skin.,
Use a fan.",How to Diffuse Essential Oils1," Diffusion is, by definition, a spontaneous and random process. This means no heat should be added because then the process no longer spontaneous. While heated diffusion is popular, heating essential oils also decreases their effectiveness. Heating can cause chemical reactions in the essential oil, changing the types of substances in that oil and causing an allergic response.


Essential oils are also flammable, which means heating them is an unnecessary risk.;
, The easiest method to diffuse an essential oil is to open the bottle of the essential oil. When you do this, wave your open hand over the top of the bottle and inhale from the air you are wafting from the bottle.


You can also put the oil in a bowl and sniff directly from the bowl. This will help alleviate how strong the oil is directly from the bottle because it is less concentrated.
Avoid directly sniffing out of the bottle. Essential oils are very strong and may cause strong reactions., You can also try soaking a cotton ball in the essential oil of your choice. The cotton ball can be held under your nose, placed in a cup, or laid out in a room to diffuse the oil. Bring it to your nose and mouth and move it gently so that the aroma wafts toward you.


You can also use a piece of cotton cloth, a towel, or a gauze pad., For more rapid diffusion of your essential oils, you can place a few drops of it into warm water. Make sure the water isn’t warmer than your body temperature so it doesn’t change the composition of the oil.


To use this method, place the warm water and the bowl of oils in a central location in the room you’re in. You can also sniff from this bowl as well if you want a more concentrated sniff of the oils., If you want a more direct placement of the essential oils, you can rub it into your skin. Place a drop of the essential oil on your wrists, chest, or temples. This will allow the essential oil to diffuse in the air around you.


If you want, you can also rub some into your palms and bring them to your face to sniff in the aroma of the oils., A method that increases the rate of diffusion is fanning. Place a few drops of the essential oil into water and placing the bowl near a fan. You can also place it about six to 12 inches from any source of blowing air.


During cool weather, place the bowl about a foot away from a heat register. Make sure it isn't too close. It’s not likely that the heat can present a safety hazard, but you do not want to overheat the essential oils."

Wash your hands regularly.,
Keep your house and bedroom clean.,
Use a tissue when sneezing and coughing.,
Avoid sharing utensils.,
Reduce your exposure to common allergens.",How to Cure a Cold With Household Resources5," One of the fastest ways to get sick is to interact with a sick person, or go out in public, without washing your hands before touching your face. There are lots of germs everywhere, so it's important to wash your hands with warm water and soap often. Keep hand sanitizer with you to help disinfect your hands on the go or when you’re busy.Tell your kids to wash their hands regularly, especially when around someone who has a cold and before touching babies.

, There are several things you can do to keep your home clean. Disinfect things that get dirty or come into contact with germs that could lead to congestion. Wear a filtering mask when cleaning to avoid inhaling dust or harmful free radicals. Regularly clean telephones, TV remotes, and computer keyboards with non-toxic disinfectant wipes and sprays. When you travel, clean phones and remotes in your hotel room.Try to change and wash your bed linens at least every week. Allergens such as dust and bacteria can accumulate on your sheets over time, irritating your nose and throat. These make it more likely for you to catch a cold.

, Use a tissue when you sneeze or cough to avoid spreading germs through the air. This also prevents letting other bacteria or viruses into your lungs when you inhale.If you don’t have a tissue on hand, sneeze or cough into your elbow rather than cupping your hands over your face, to avoid spreading germs to your hands.

, The germs that cause viral and bacterial infections are contagious. Sharing foods, drinking glasses or bottles, and utensils with a person who has a cold or cough can quickly cause you to catch the infection too. Use separate, clean utensils when drinking or having meals. Avoid touching public drinking fountains with your mouth as well.If you have children that go to school, remind your children to use their own bottles and utensils.

, Reducing your exposure to allergens may also help make it easier for you to fight off a cold. Allergens irritate your sinuses, cause congestion and difficulty breathing, and aggravate the throat. Flower pollen, dust and mold are some of the most common allergens. Other common allergens include:Hazardous fumes, cigarette and secondhand smoke
Certain foods such as shellfish, shrimp, fish, eggs, milk, peanuts, wheat, and soy
Pet allergies caused by shedding from cats, dogs, hamsters, mice or rabbits.
Insect stings such as bee or wasp stings
Certain medications, especially penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics
Latex or other substances you wear or touch, such as chemicals and dyes in fabrics

Drink lots of water.,
Drink warm herbal tea.,
Avoid inflammatory foods.,
Eat a Mediterranean diet.,
Eat warm soup.,
Eat pineapple.,
Eat honey.",How to Cure a Cold With Household Resources6," Try to drink at least eight ounces of water every 2 hours. 2 litres of water is the daily recommendation for the average adult. Your body can quickly lose moisture and get dehydrated by sweating or sneezing caused by a cold or fever. Dehydration can cause your temperature to rise and often leads to aggravating symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, muscle cramps, low blood pressure and seizures. You can also drink non-caffeinated, glucose-free sports drinks with electrolytes, but don't give them to children under 5 years old.If you drink caffeinated beverages, drink an extra cup of water for every cup of caffeinated beverage you drink.
Children and infants should also drink lots of non-caffeinated fluids during a fever.

, Drinking a cup of warm herbal tea, up to 3 times a day, helps promote mucus drainage while reducing inflammation in the nasal passages. Studies show that drinking warm fluids can help relieve cold symptoms such as a runny nose, cough, sneezing, sore throat, and even fatigue. Stick with an herbal tea like chamomile or peppermint to rehydrate yourself. Chamomile is good for reducing stress and fatigue, while peppermint relieves congestion in the nasal passages.You can also try adding a teaspoon of honey or lemon juice to your tea. These have an antiviral effect and help soothe your throat.

, Certain foods can slow down your body’s healing process, impair the immune system, increase body weight and cause inflammation. Try to reduce your intake or avoid these foods which can cause chronic inflammation:Refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pastries and donuts
Fried foods
Sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda or energy drinks
Red meat such as veal, ham or steak and processed meats such as hot dogs
Margarine, shortening and lard

, Certain foods can help reduce inflammation which eases nasal congestion and promotes healing. Limit your intake to green vegetables, whole grains, nuts and oil if you have acid reflux, since fruits with citric acid may trigger gastroesophageal acid reflux, causing nausea, irritation and occasional vomiting. A Mediterranean diet mostly consists of foods that help reduce inflammation, such as:Fruits like strawberries, cherries and oranges
Nuts like almonds and walnuts
Green leafy vegetables such as spinach or kale which are high in antioxidants
Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines
Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, millet, oatmeal and flax seed
Olive or canola oil

, Drinking warm soup produces an anti-inflammatory effect, promotes sweating and increases movement of nasal fluids. This clears the nasal passages and eases congestion. It is important to drink the soup while it is still warm to get the most benefits. Make your own nutritious soup and eat it 1 to 3 times a day until your symptoms improve or clear up. Here are some ways you can prepare your own soup broth:For a natural low-sodium chicken broth: Remove any visible skin or fat from chicken legs and measure 2 to 3 cups of water. Add the chicken and water to a large pot along with 1 chopped onion, 1 tomato, 2 to 3 celery stalks, 2 to 3 carrots or other flavoring and do not add salt. You can also add herbs like parsley or thyme to flavor the soup. If you're using a slow cooker, cover and cook the soup on low-medium heat for 6-8 hours, or on high for 4 hours. If you are using a stove or burner, bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer on low for 1 hour.
For a natural vegetable broth: Use a variety of vegetables such as onions, parsnips, carrots, celery, leeks, mushrooms and tomatoes. Lightly brown them in olive oil or canola oil, then add 2 to 3 cups of water. Bring the broth close to boiling, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer for 1 and a half hours.
If you like, you can add lentils or brown rice to add texture and a thicker consistency. If you like spicy meals, add a ½ chopped cayenne pepper or 1–2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper powder to the broth.

, Eat 2 slices of pineapple or 2 glasses of pineapple juice. Pineapples are rich in an enzyme called bromelain, which reduces the swelling and inflammation of the nose and sinuses that causes congestion. Don't eat pineapples along with potatoes or soy products, since these contain substances that may slow down bromelain’s healing properties in the body.Some people may be allergic to pineapples, and eating it can make allergy symptoms worse.

, If you experience a sore throat or cough during a cold, drinking tea or warm lemon water with honey can help soothe your throat. Take 2 teaspoons of honey once in the morning and once before bedtime to help reduce coughing. Honey is widely available at most supermarkets and health food stores.Never give honey to a child younger than 1 year of age because of the risk of infant botulism, a serious form of food poisoning.

If you're deficient in magnesium, you may notice agitation and anxiety, restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep disorders, irritability, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rhythms, low blood pressure, confusion, muscle spasm and weakness, hyperventilation, insomnia, poor nail growth, and even seizures.It's important to not get too much magnesium since it can reduce your calcium absorption. Talk to your doctor about what dosage is right for you.

, Zinc is an essential trace mineral found in many foods you eat on a regular basis. It has antioxidant properties that help protect cells in the body from damage caused by bacteria and viruses. It’s normal to have slightly low levels of zinc, but taking a multivitamin and eating a healthy diet should give you all the zinc you need. The best dietary sources of zinc are oysters, shellfish, red meats, poultry, cheese, shrimp, and crab. If you take it as a supplement or in multivitamins, remember that you're recommended to take 8 to 11 mg of zinc a day. Avoid taking high doses of zinc, unless advised by your doctor.Zinc lozenges are helpful in treating colds and zinc nasal sprays can also clear up sinus congestion. Be sure to talk with your doctor before taking any zinc supplements or medications.

Plan regular meetings or conversations with office contacts.,
Set rules for communication.,
Make yourself valuable.,
Avoid isolation.",How to Stay Disciplined when Working Remotely2," Whether you are a part of a planning team, or you have an individual boss to report to, or you just have friends who work in the main office, it is valuable to maintain connections. After all, you do work with these people, even if you are not physically in the office. Participate in regular meetings, either in person by going to the office occasionally, or through webinars or conference calls.Even if a meeting is called that may not directly need your participation, attending is a good idea to keep up your connections with the office.

, You and your team, boss or other contacts at work should establish some basic ground rules for communicating. Communication that is not planned well is not going to serve a positive purpose. For example, if your boss is calling you too frequently, you may feel that you are not being respected or trusted. On the other hand, if you are not providing information to the team regularly enough, they may wonder if you are being productive.You should try to set days and times to check in. If you choose not to make specific appointments (Tuesday at 3:00, for example), you should at least have a good understanding of the frequency that is expected on both sides (once a week, once a day, or so on).

, As a remote employee, you may feel that you are occasionally overlooked or uninvolved. You need to make extra efforts to show your employer that you are valuable. You should volunteer for projects (as much as you realistically can) and make sure that your employer knows the work that you are doing. If you disappear from your employer’s view, this is your own fault for not making yourself visible and valuable., If your remote office is in your home, there may be a tendency to isolate yourself in your home. You could wake up, eat breakfast, do your work, have dinner, go to bed, and never see another person. You need to combat this tendency. If necessary, make it part of your daily schedule to get out and see people. Get out and take a walk at lunchtime. Participate in social groups or clubs that keep you involved with others. These extra connections will help you focus more effectively on your work, when you are working.Working too much in isolation may seem super-effective at first. You might be able to dedicate more hours per day to your work tasks. However, habits like this can lead to burnout, which makes you less effective in the long run.

Understand your goals.,
Take pride in your work.,
Address conflicts directly.,
Understand differences in roles.",How to Stay Disciplined when Working Remotely3," When you are working remotely, you need to know what your employer expects of you. For example, if your job is reviewing and editing computer code for a programming company, you should know how many lines of code you are expected to produce in one day. If you are not aware of some general expectations, you should have a conversation with your direct supervisor.


Problems can arise if you are working under one assumption about your productivity, and your employer has another. It is best to clear up any misunderstanding as early as possible.

, If you produce work products that you are proud of, you are going to be more inclined to work diligently and stay disciplined in the work that you do. You need to realize your purpose and function to the company, and you need to know that what you do matters in the big picture. If you ever find yourself doubting any of this, you should stop and review what you have been doing., Always keep in mind that your purpose is the success of your company, whatever that may be. Your company succeeds when all the individual workers succeed and are performing well. If you spot any conflicts or problems, it can be easy when working remotely to avoid them. But avoiding conflicts generally does not resolve or correct them, it only makes them hang around longer. Especially when you work remotely, you need to be alert to any conflicts that arise and be diligent in addressing them.As a remote employee, you may have special problems or concerns that other employees do not experience. Address them early, to keep the problems small.

, One problem that can occur when working remotely is that others in the office may not see or fully understand the work that you do. This can lead to ineffective work if the remote employee becomes disgruntled and feels unappreciated. It is important to realize that your particular job may be more about the thinking that goes into something, and less about a physical product. If you have concerns about your role, you should talk with your direct supervisor."

Use terracotta or sandstone diffusers.,
Buy an electric fan diffuser.,
Try a nebulizers or atomizers.",How to Diffuse Essential Oils2," These diffusers, which can be bought at many different department stores, are highly porous. They allow the essential oils to diffuse first into the stone and then into the air. These can be placed or hung wherever they can be most useful, such as high traffic areas or in a doorway. People walking by will cause waves of air to move by the diffusers. You can also place these diffusers in front of a fan.


Once the oil evaporates, you will have to refill it.
You can also buy necklaces specifically designed to do this as well, which are worn around the neck., Electric fan diffusers are available in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and styles. These typically come with pads that are used to soak up the oils. The oils can evaporate quickly on these, but the pads are changeable.


Avoid any diffuser that heats the oils unless there are settings on the diffuser that you can set to approximate body temperature., Nebulizers and atomizers are like humidifiers. They break up the oil into smaller droplets so they diffuse more easily. These usually contain two basic components, a base that contains the motor for the nebulizer and a glass or plastic bowl where the essential oil is placed.


Glass is preferable to plastic bowls because essential oils won’t stick to glass as much as they will to plastic. Be careful with the glass bowl, because they can be expensive to replace.
There are a number of companies and businesses, both online and in stores, that sell these types of diffusers. See which type seems best to you, and check to see if there are any reviews or customer comments to find the best ones."

Look for symptoms of a cold.,
Watch for signs of nasal infection.,
Get medical attention if you have severe symptoms.,
Learn common cold symptoms in babies.,
Consult an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist.",How to Cure a Cold With Household Resources8," Colds can be caused by more than 100 viruses, so there is no way to determine the exact cause. Signs of a cold can appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Note that a cold does not usually cause a high fever or extreme fatigue. Instead, common symptoms of a cold may include:Runny or stuffy nose
Itchy, sore throat
Cough
Nasal congestion
Mild headache or muscle aches
Sneezing
Watery eyes
Mild to moderate fever
Fatigue

, If your doctor suspects chronic nasal infection, also called sinusitis, you may need imaging tests. These tests can include an x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A cough and sore throat can also be symptoms of nasal infection. Other common symptoms of nasal infection are:Fever and headache. If you have a high fever or severe headache, you should seek medical care immediately.
Pressure in the forehead, temples, cheeks, nose, jaw, teeth, behind the eyes or at the top of the head.
Nasal stuffiness, loss of smell, nasal discharge (usually yellowish green), or post-nasal drip (the sensation of fluid dripping down the back of the throat), particularly at night or when lying down.

Rare complications associated with chronic sinusitis can include: blood clots, abscesses, meningitis, orbital cellulitis which causes inflammation around the eyes, and osteomyelitis, an infection that spreads to the bones in the face.



, If you have severe symptoms of a cold or flu or have been previously diagnosed with any respiratory disease, you should seek professional care immediately. Symptoms that should be checked out by a doctor or in the emergency room include:Cough with green to yellowish phlegm or blood
High fever (104ºF or more)
Ear or nasal infection and nasal discharge
Skin rashes
Breathlessness due to asthma or another respiratory problem.

, Babies are especially susceptible to the common cold since they haven't developed immunity to common infections and are often around other children who may not always wash their hands. Early symptoms of a cold in babies are congested or runny nose, nasal discharge, decreased appetite, irritability, difficulty sleeping or feeding, cough and a low-grade fever. If your baby is younger than 2 to 3 months of age, you should see a doctor early in the illness.See your doctor immediately if your baby has a temperature higher than 100ºF, has red eyes or eye discharge, has trouble breathing and is bluish around the lips and mouth, coughs up blood or coughs hard enough to cause vomiting, and refuses to nurse or accept fluids.

, If your symptoms do not go away after 8 weeks or interfere with your daily activities, your doctor may refer you to an ENT specialist, also known as an otolaryngologist, who can check your ears, nose and throat. The ENT specialist will look to see if your symptoms are from an underlying cause, such as a viral or bacterial infection. You should tell your doctor about any other respiratory conditions you may have.An ENT specialist can also perform a nasal endoscopy using a fiber optic scope. The scope can look at your sinuses for nasal polyps or other structural problems if you have nasal infection. The specialist may suggest an endoscopic sinus surgery.

Set your goal for how much freelance income you plan to make this month.,
List your freelance writing assignments on the same sheet.,
Break each assignment down into parts.,
Decide how many tasks you need to work on each day.,
Determine which assignments are the most important to work on each day.,
Create a list of tasks to accomplish each day, organized by priority.",How to Organize Freelance Writing Assignments on Paper," Write this amount at the top of a sheet of paper.;
, Include what the assignment pays and when it's due. Leave plenty of space between assignments.

, Examples of parts of a freelance writing assignment might include making an outline for the article, researching at the library or on the Internet, setting up an interview, writing interview questions, transcribing notes and then finally writing the article itself.


You may want to break down the payment for each assignment by the number of parts it has to give each part a dollar value.

, Figure how many days out of the month are available to accomplish all the tasks you intend to get done and divide the number of tasks by the number of days. For example, if you have 60 tasks to accomplish in February, and you want to have your weekends free, you need to average 3 tasks per day to get everything done.

, You can prioritize your freelance writing assignments by how soon they're due to be completed, how much you'll earn for completing them, how important the client is in terms of earning future assignments or some combination of those factors. Divide the tasks into highest priority (must get done today), medium priority (need to get done soon) and lowest priority (little things that can wait or can fill spare moments).

, Make this list on a separate sheet of paper, grouped by highest, medium and lowest priority. Generally, you want to do the highest priority items first, but if you want to reserve some of those tasks for the time of day in which you're best at that task (or when the people you need to contact are most likely available), you can. As you complete a task, check it off and move on to another.


If you get stuck on a task, focus on another task on the list instead, preferably one of the same level of priority or the next lowest level. If not, choose a task that will help stimulate your creativity to let you finish the task you got stuck on.

Sign the contract.,
Make copies of the signed contract.,
Keep track of expiration and renewal dates contained in the contract.",How to Negotiate Contracts," All contracts should contain the same basic elements. Although these elements can be negotiated to some degree, your contract should thoroughly address each element. These required elements include:Mutual assent refers to the agreement of the parties as to all contract provisions.
Consideration is a benefit or detriment to one party, exchanged for the other party’s promise to do something. It is the value bargained for by the parties. Typically, consideration involves a payment by one party to another.
Capacity or competency means that the parties must be legally capable of entering into contracts, which usually means that they must be over 18 years of age and mentally sound.Legality refers to the fact that the contract cannot contain any illegal terms. For example, a contract will not be enforced by a court if the bargained-for promise is for one party to provide illegal drugs.;
, Because contracts are legally binding documents, many contract terms are regulated by state and even federal law. In some cases, even if the parties agree to a certain contract provision, that provision will not be enforceable under state law. For example, it is illegal for a landlord to force a tenant to live in uninhabitable conditions, even if both parties agree to it in the lease contract.Before you begin contract negotiations, educate yourself. For example, schedule a consultation with an attorney who specializes in contract law, or search online for a legal advice site where you can verify that the terms of your contract are within the legal parameters of your state’s laws.

, While some states’ laws will uphold an oral contract as legally binding in some circumstances, some contracts must be in writing. For instance, real estate sales, contracts lasting more than one year, real estate contracts lasting more than one year, and agreements to pay another person’s debts are all contracts that are required to be in writing., Some contracts are absolutely non-negotiable, such as an End User License Agreement (EULA), or shrink-wrap license agreement, for a product such as iTunes. If you find that a contract is non-negotiable, you must decide whether or not to agree to it as the terms of the contract exist. Other contracts may be negotiable to some extent. In this situation, you should ask the other party whether he or she is willing to negotiate some of the contract terms if you disagree with them. , Before you attempt to negotiate a contract, you need to have a specific idea about your desired outcome. For example, if you want to extend an apartment rental lease term, then you should know exactly how long you would like the term extension to be., Before beginning negotiations, you should determine exactly where you or your company stands with respect to each of the negotiable terms. Make a list of non-negotiable contract terms that you absolutely require. If you cannot reach agreement with the other party, these terms are so important to you that they will prevent you from entering into the contract.
Make a list of contract terms on which you are willing to compromise or negotiate. These are the terms that, in an ideal world, would be included in a final contract, but you are willing to live without them in order to secure the contract.
Make a list of contract terms that are unimportant to you. In other words, you have no preference as to whether these terms are included in the contract or not.
Do not share these lists with the other contracting parties. You will use these lists during the negotiation process, but keep them to yourself so that you don’t reveal your negotiation strategy with the other parties.

, Know the lowest or highest point you can accept and still enter into the contract. For example, assume that you are a strawberry farmer and you absolutely must get at least $100.00 for a particular shipment in order to make ends meet. In this case, your bottom line sales price would be $100.00., Gather any facts, figures and documents you may need to back up your negotiation points. Doing so will give you support for your position on each issue that may be persuasive to the other party to the contract. , You can share this checklist with the other party prior to beginning the negotiations process. When you negotiate a contract, it helps if both sides agree to this agenda before the negotiation session begins.

, There may already be a deadline in place that you’ll need to follow. For example, if a shipment of strawberries needs to be sold within three days, the sales contract must be finalized within that timeframe.


Prepare for the possibility that you and the other party will not be able to agree on terms within the necessary timeframe. For example, you may agree to schedule a mediation after two failed contract negotiation meetings. On the other hand, you may cease negotiating the contract altogether.

, This technique will help you reach an agreement faster and with less resistance and time-consuming inquiries. While you do not want to provide the other party with your negotiation strategy, you can disclose all of the facts surrounding your contract negotiation requests, provide documentation of any facts or figures you use to support your requests, communicate openly about your interests and be receptive to the other party's counter-presentations., This will promote cooperation and aid both parties’ openness to mutually beneficial solutions. Remember that by signing a contract, you are entering into a relationship with another person or company. You do not want to tarnish that relationship with negativity before it even begins., If you plan to enter into a contract and have been given the opportunity to prepare the initial document, spend some time creating the document. You will want it to look neat and professional, and not contain any illegal or nonsensical terms.Since yours is the first draft, it should be your ideal contract. Include the terms that are best for you, but that are still realistic. For example, don’t include a $1.00 sales price for the strawberry shipment, since this may antagonize or insult the other party, and he or she ultimately may decide not to enter into the contract with you.
If you and the other party have already agreed to some terms, such as contract length or shipment quantity, be sure to include those terms in the draft contract.
Consider consulting with an attorney to help you draft the contract. An attorney may also be able to provide you with a ‘shell’ or ‘skeleton’ contract so you can just fill in the blanks with the information specific to your situation.
Purchase a blank contract from an online resource or an office supply store. Make sure the online resource is reputable (check the Better Business Bureau or other rating organization). However, remember that there is no contract that meets the requirements of the law in all 50 states. Therefore, you must alter the blank contract in order to reflect any requirements of your state’s laws.

, Tell the other party that this is your opening offer. Also acknowledge that you welcome counter-offers or proposed revisions to the contract that you have proposed.


Give the other party a deadline by which you need to receive his or her revised draft or comments on the current draft.

, You may go through several rounds of revisions before you narrow down the terms that are still in dispute. Keep an open mind throughout this process, and be sure to keep your lists on hand so you can make sure you’re not agreeing to terms that are not in your best interest., If you cannot agree to all the terms in the draft contract, identify the terms that you will need to negotiate. You may wish to make a counteroffer that reflects your idea terms, or you may wish to compromise on some terms in order to gain leverage for others. Submit the counteroffer to the other party.If you are comfortable using word processing software, ask the other party to send you the draft contract as a Microsoft Word or other word processing program document. This will enable you to redline your edits and insert comments directly into the document so that the other party can see exactly what you are proposing as a counteroffer.
If you prefer to handwrite your changes, print a copy of the draft contract. Then neatly write your proposed changes and comments on the same document. Having all offers and counter-offers on the same document will enable both parties to see the full picture of negotiations going forward.

, You may go through several rounds of revisions before you narrow down the terms that are still in dispute. Keep an open mind throughout this process, and be sure to keep your lists on hand so you can make sure you’re not agreeing to terms that are not in your best interest., If you and the other party have been unable to compromise on final contract terms, it is time to discuss those terms directly. Determine when you and the other party are available for a discussion, and whether you will meet in person, over the phone, or via Skype, WebEx, or another online platform.


Negotiate disputed contract terms with the other party until you can reach a compromise. In the strawberry example, you may offer a contract for a strawberry shipment in exchange for $200.00. The other party may then offer you $50.00 per shipment. You and the other party can keep negotiating until you land on a number that is acceptable to both of you.Use some of the contract terms that are less important to you as leverage to get to the terms you want. For example, suppose that you don’t care where the strawberry shipment occurs, but you know that the other party needs the shipment to be made to a particular warehouse. You can agree to make the shipment at the warehouse in exchange for a higher sales price.
Remain calm and composed. Negotiations can become heated, especially when the parties are discussing the contract terms that are most important to them. Keep your end goal – a finalized contract – in mind as you proceed through negotiations, and don’t let ego or pride get in the way of that goal. , Once you and the other party have finalized all of the detailed contract provisions, one of you should prepare the final version of the contract. Whether you prepare this document or receive it from the other party, take time to read through the entire contract and make sure it correctly reflects the terms to which you agreed.If the contract has gone through several rounds of revisions and redlines, make sure the final version has all changes accepted and that all comments are cleared from the document., While not every state requires the parties’ signatures for a contract to be legally enforceable, it is always best to have all parties sign. The signature reflects each party’s agreement to the terms of the contract. If one party sues for breach of contract, it is much easier to prove the existence of the agreement if the party can show the court the signed contract.The correct party must sign the contract. If a business is one of the parties to the contract, make sure the person signing on behalf of the company is authorized to do so. Electronic, or digital, signatures may be permissible in place of written signatures. Check with the other party and your state laws to determine whether this is permissible for your contract. It may not be necessary for both parties to sign the same document. As long as the parties sign identical documents, the two signature pages may be combined to create a single document. , Once both parties have signed the contract, make a few copies of the signed document. Keep a copy in a safe location, and consider making a digital copy to store on your computer. The original contract also should be kept in a secure location, such as a safe deposit box, fireproof safe, or a lawyer’s office.

, Contracts often include information regarding when the contract terms expire, and whether and how the contract can be renewed. Keep track of these dates by putting them on your calendar, so that you can take action to terminate or renew the contract as you desire.

Think about the job requirements.,
Consider your personal characteristics.,
Know the company's needs.,
Take a practice test.",How to Pass a Psychological Test for a Job1," As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, the hiring process is becoming more complex. More and more companies are turning to psychological (or personality) assessments to determine whether someone is the right fit for the job. Do some serious thinking about the qualifications that are necessary for the particular job that requires the test.For example, if you are seeking a job as an executive or upper-management, the interviewers will want to make sure that you have strong leadership skills and are an excellent communicator.
If you are applying for a job such as a police officer, candidates will be expected to exhibit an ability to deal with high levels of stress and think on their feet.;
, Psychological exams are essentially an assessment of your personality. Think about why you are applying for this job. It is probably because you feel that you are qualified and have the right disposition for this particular career.For example, if you are applying for a sales job, you know that a portion of your income will be generated by commission. Therefore, you need to be highly motivated. Does that sound like you? Reflect on your personality traits before the test. This will help you be prepared to formulate answers that fit the role.
It's important that you be yourself when answering questions. But you should also remember that you are being evaluated. For example, if you were asked, ""If you knew you would not get caught, would you steal from the company?"", you should answer ""No."" Even if you know that you might consider stealing, that is not something you would want to say during an interview.

, During the interview process, you need to not only highlight your strengths, but you need to convey how you can specifically benefit your future employer. Think about what you can do to improve the productivity of the company. If you are conscious of the company's needs, this will likely be reflected in your personality test.Before your test, feel free to ask the recruiter or HR representative what characteristics are most important on them. Then you can focus your answers on conveying those traits.

, It is impossible to predict the content of the test. However, you can prepare yourself by getting comfortable with the format. Be aware that most psychological exams consist of a face to face interview and a written questionnaire.You can search for practice tests online. Make sure to choose one from a reputable site that has solid psychology credentials.
You can also hire a consultant to give you an in person practice exam. This person will then provide you with analysis and helpful hints.

Purchase jojoba oil.,
Determine how often you will treat your hair.,
Apply the oil to your scalp.,
Apply the oil to your ends.,
Let the treatment soak into your hair before washing.",How to Use Jojoba Oil to Enhance Dry Hair1," Jojoba oil can be found at specialty herbal shops, beauty supply stores, and nicer grocery stores. Most stores stock it in the skincare section. Look for pure jojoba oil instead of beauty products with jojoba oil in them. If you’re having trouble finding it ask a store associate for help.;
, If your hair is damaged and dry, start by doing a leave-in treatment once a week. If your hair is dry but not very damaged, do a treatment every two or three weeks. If you start to notice that your hair looks limp and oily, do the treatments less often. Inversely, if your hair still seems dry, do the treatments more often.


If you do too many treatments and your hair looks oily, shampoo your hair to remove the excess oil.

, First, dip your fingertips into the bowl of oil. Next, massage the oil into your scalp. Make sure to cover the easy-to-miss spots behind your ears and at the nape of your neck. Focus on covering every inch of your scalp and the first half-inch of hair growth.Bend over forward to reach your roots more easily.

, Once your scalp is saturated with oil, apply it to the rest of your hair. Pour out some jojoba oil into your palm and work it into your hair. Apply a thick coat from roots to tips. Depending on how thick your hair is, you may need to use more jojoba oil than you might expect.


When in doubt, use more jojoba oil than you think you’ll need. It’s better to apply too much than not enough.

, You can leave the oil treatment in your hair from 20 minutes to overnight. The longer you leave the treatment in your hair the more time the oil will have to soften your dry locks. Next, wash your hair normally. If you have a lot of trouble washing out the oil you may have to shampoo your hair twice.If you leave the treatment in your hair overnight, wear a shower cap to protect your pillowcase from oil stains.

Be honest.",How to Pass a Psychological Test for a Job2," Use your professional common sense. Show up on time and well-groomed. Make sure to bring any materials that were requested. Schedule your day so that you have plenty of time for the test. This will help you avoid becoming flustered if the process runs long.Make sure to eat a light and balanced meal before the test. Being hungry can adversely affect your personality, so arrive properly nourished.

, You can and should ask questions before and during the testing. Try to determine the format of the exam. You can also ask how your results will be used. It is also good to know who will have access to your results.While you are taking the test, make sure to ask for clarification if any question is unclear. The examiner should be able to provide context or clarification.

, Remember, it is not just your answers that are being evaluated. Your overall persona is also being considered. Testing is part of the interview process, so make sure that you remain professional and confident throughout the entire process.If you become flustered, take a few seconds to gather your thoughts. You can also step outside for a moment under the pretense of using the restroom. This will allow you time to take some deep breaths and collect yourself.

, Do not try to portray yourself as anyone other than who you are. First of all, dishonesty is likely to be reflected in your answers. This would not be seen as an asset for any job.

Think like an employer.,
Understand the validity.,
Be prepared for any result.",How to Pass a Psychological Test for a Job3," Hiring managers are not forcing you to undergo a personality test simply for their amusement. The purpose of these tests are to help them make the most effective hiring decisions. Employers utilize the results to help them decide whether or not you have the right temperament for the position.


Try to view the test as something that can benefit you, not just the employer. You can look at it as an excellent way to determine if this is a job where you can reach your full potential.

, Keep in mind that psychology is not an exact science. Therefore, the results of any psychological exam are never 100% reliable. You should know that prospective employers will be using the results as one of many factors in the hiring process.


Feel free to ask the HR representative how heavily the test results will be weighed when choosing the successful candidate.

, You may or may not get hired. But remember, just because you were not the person best suited for the position, that does not mean you ""failed"" the exam. The employer is looking for certain traits. If you are not the best match, that simply means that you should continue your job search."

Evaluate what the work you are requested to do entails.,
Determine how much time it will take you to complete the work.,
As a freelancer, you must have an hourly rate for the work you do.,
The figure that you calculate in step 3 above acts like a baseline rate, i.e.,

If the client comes back with a rate that is higher than your baseline rate, then you are good to go.",How to Negotiate the Best Rate for Freelancing Work," If it is a project, write down the whole process of doing it from start to finish. Do not leave out any details. This will help clarify in your mind not only what is expected of you but also how much effort you will have to put in. ;
, Render this in hours or days.

, Your hourly rate takes into account how much effort you put in as well as contingencies. You do not need to let your client know this but you need to work out a minimum that you charge per hour of work done. Multiply this rate by the total number of hours it takes to finish the job. If the job takes more than a day then your rate is per day.

, the lowest figure you can accept. Keep this in mind for the negotiation to work in your favor.

, Most people always have an idea of how much they are willing to spend, so just find a polite way of getting to know this. A rule of thumb in negotiation is that the first party to quote a price remains at a disadvantage so do not be the first to mention a figure. If the client is not able to give a figure right away, give him time to work it out but let him know that he needs to get back to you when he is ready.

, If the rate is lower, let him know that there is a minimum you must charge for the work to be done. If he persists, then it is time to go over the work and make him understand what it will cost you to do it.

, Before you use any essential oil, you need to look for possible oil allergies. You don't want to make your itchy scalp worse by causing an allergic reaction.

Pick a place on your wrist or arm and rub a small amount into your skin. Wait at least 30 minutes to an hour to see if you react, such as getting red or itchy skin, sneezing, or developing a headache.
Do not use the oil if you react in any way to it. If you have no reaction, you are free to use the oil., Once you decide on an essential oil to use, you need a way to get it on your scalp. Instead of rubbing it directly onto your scalp, add it to shampoo. Buy a mild shampoo free of additives and preservatives. Add two to five drops of the essential oil you chose for every six to eight ounces of shampoo you use.


You may be able to use more essential oils per shampoo. Ask you dermatologist about increasing the dosage if you aren't seeing the results you want.

Work it into your scalp for about three to five minutes. Rinse with warm water


Repeat this every other day for the first two weeks. After that, repeat twice a week., Head lice are tiny, wingless insects that only live on the head. They attach themselves and their eggs to the hair shaft. As they grow, they cause significant scalp itching. Although they are common among school aged children, anyone can get lice. It is only spread by contact with another person with lice, and is different than body lice.


Your physician may also recommend over the counter shampoos that contain insecticides such as pyrethrin or permethrin to help fight head lice. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions exactly to get rid of the lice with these shampoos., Instead of over the counter remedies, you can try an essential oil infused treatment for head lice. Tea tree oil mixed with lavender oil are used most commonly in these treatments and has been proven effective in killings live eggs and reducing live lice.


To make the mixture, add four to five drops of tea tree oil and lavender oil to a small bowl. Add three or four tablespoons of coconut or olive oil to the essential oils. Mix well.
Massage the mixture into the top edges of the hair, making sure the scalp is saturated. Make sure you massage the mixture in along the hairline at the nape of the neck and behind the ears., Once you've saturated the hair, cover the head with a plastic shower cap or a bathing cap. Leave the mixture on for a minimum of four hours. However, leaving it on overnight is the best option.


If you don't have a cap, wrap the head in a towel, but make sure you tie it off so that it stays on the head.

, To get out the oils, saturate the hair using lots of shampoo and leave it on for about five minutes. Rinse the shampoo out like normal, then get out of the shower. After you get out, saturate the hair with conditioner, which will help remove the lice easier. Use a fine-toothed lice comb to remove the dead and dying lice, rinsing off the comb every few run-throughs.


Rinse the comb into the sink, using hot running water to rinse the comb.
Make sure to start at the scalp and run the comb completely through all the hair. If the person has long hair, work the comb through in one inch sections until you get all the way through.

Contact a doctor, if necessary.",How to Safely Use Essential Oils Topically," Pure essential oils are often more expensive than brands you can buy at supermarkets or drug stores. However, pure and unadulterated essential oil carry less of a risk for adverse reactions as there are less potentially harmful additives. Go for pricier essential oils from specialized health stores or online providers, that are advertised as 100% authentic.Buy essential oils from providers who are upfront about where their products come from. They should provide detailed information on the source of essential oils, as well as information about their educational background and experience selling oils. If a company can provide an oil's botanical name, country of origin, and method of extraction, this is a good sign you're working with a legitimate company.Words like ""fragrance oil,"" ""nature identical oil,"" and ""perfume oil"" are generally red flags. This indicates the oils are not pure. You should also be wary of oils marketed as therapeutic or aromatherapy grade, as there is no official government regulation certifying oils as therapeutic/aromatherapy grade. Companies sometimes use these terms to deceive buyers into thinking their oils are purer.;
, Many people enjoy adding essential oils to baths to provide a pleasant and relaxing aroma. This is safe for many essential oils, but certain essential oils are mucous membrane irritants. This means they can cause a heating or drying effect on areas like the mouth, nose, eyes, and reproductive organs. Some essential oils should be avoided in baths altogether, while others simply need to be diluted heavily in a carrier oil before being placed in the water.Bay, clove, lemongrass, thyme, and cinnamon bark should not be used in a bath at all.
Peppermint and caraway should only be used in the bath if they are diluted in a carrier oil beforehand.

, Certain additives to essential oils increase the risk of an adverse skin reaction. It's particularly important to heavily dilute these kinds of oils before applying them topically.Aldehydes, such as citronellal and citral, can increase the risk of an adverse reaction.
You should also be careful of oils that contain phenols like cinnamic aldehyde and eugenol. These also increase the risk of a skin reaction and should be diluted heavily prior to use.

, Many people use essential oils to treat a variety of skin conditions. However, if you have an existing condition (e.g., eczema, psoriasis, chronic acne) talk to a doctor before using essential oils. A dermatologist may be able to provide you with medications or creams, which may be more effective than essential oils. Essential oils may also aggravate certain skin conditions so it's important to talk to a doctor or dermatologist about risks beforehand.

, Most essential oils carry the risk for skin irritation if applied to the skin directly. You should always dilute essential oils in a carrier oil. A carrier oil is a non-essential oil used as a base. You can use olive oil, grapeseed oil, coconut oil, and a variety of common cooking oils as a carrier oil.The concentration of essential oils should not be greater than 5%. Lower ranges, like 2-3%, may be better if you have particularly sensitive skin.To make a 3% solution of an essential oil, use on teaspoon of a carrier oil. Then, add 3 drops of essential oil. You can use an eye dropper to add the drops to the carrier oil. If you want a higher percentage, add more drops. Five drops, for example, would make a 5% solution., Many people enjoy adding essential oils to a bath. The aroma may be pleasant, and some essential oils help moisturize the skin. Essential oils are not water soluble, meaning they do not dissolve in water, so you will have to add another substance to the bath to help dilute the essential oils.You can add a few tablespoons of full cream milk to a bath to dilute a few drops of essential oils.
You can also try Epsom salt. Mixing one part baking soda, two parts Epsom salt, three parts sea salt, and six drops of something like lavender oil can make for a relaxing bath.

, Some people use essential oils as part of massages. This is usually relatively safe. However, if you plan on massaging essential oil into your skin, you must dilute it a bit more. In massages, a 1% concentration is recommended. This means one drop of essential oil for every teaspoon., If you're letting children use essential oils, you need to be more cautious. As children's skin is generally more sensitive, you have to dilute oils more. In general, essential oils should be between .25% and .5% concentration. Younger children will need a lower concentration of essential oils.If you have an infant, baby, or toddler, talk to a pediatrician before using essential oils. It may be a good idea to hold off on using essential oils on young children until they are older. Children may put their feet, hands, and other body parts in their mouths, and essential oils can be harmful if ingested.
Birch, wintergreen, and peppermint oil should not be used on young children as they contain ingredients that can be harmful to younger skin.
It's strongly recommended you talk to a pediatrician before using essential oils on young children.

, You should avoid applying essential oils near sensitive areas. Do not apply essential oils nears the eyes, ears, mouth, or private parts., If your skin is broken, inflamed, burnt, or otherwise damaged, avoid applying essential oils. If you have a skin rash or are experiencing an allergic reaction, talk to a doctor instead of applying essential oils. Using essential oils on damaged skin can worsen symptoms, even when diluted properly., Sometimes, essential oils may cause allergic reactions. If you notice your skin becomes itchy or inflamed after using essential oils, take measures to manage the reaction. Cease using essential oils immediately and treat the reaction.Use over-the-counter anti-itch creams or substances like calamine lotion. Avoid itching the infected area.
Apply a soft, clean washcloth diluted in cold water for 15 to 30 second intervals to the rash.
Go for mild soaps and detergents while the rash heals. You should also wear loose clothing to prevent your clothes from irritating the rash.

, If you're having a bad reaction an essential oil, the rash will probably clear up on its own within 2 to 4 weeks. If the rash does not clear up in this timeframe, and if symptoms get worse, make an appointment with a doctor. A doctor can help figure out how to best treat the rash and may offer prescription medications or creams."

Store your oils in dark glass bottles.,
Make sure the caps are airtight.,
Use solid caps instead of rubber bulb-capped lids.,
Keep stored oils out of direct sunlight.,
Store oils in a refrigerator.,
Avoid heat sources.,
Keep the cap tightly closed on the bottle.,
Consider investing in an aromatherapy storage box.,
Avoid storing oils on easily-damaged surfaces.,
Check when oils were blended or bottled.,
Check the label for higher-quality oil.,
Look at the price of oils to assess their quality and purity.",How to Store Essential Oils," Exposure to light can cause essential oils to oxidize rather quickly. As this happens, they typically lose their fragrance and any therapeutic qualities they may have had. Because of this, clear glass and plastic bottles should be avoided at all costs.Amber and cobalt-blue glass bottles are fairly common. Green and violet glass is also somewhat common.These dark glasses will help reduce the risk of oxidation, but they will not eliminate that risk.
Plastic, no matter what color it is, should generally be avoided. PET and HDPE plastics will not deteriorate from oil storage, but most other plastics are easily broken down by oil.;
, Exposure to air can cause oils to oxidize just as much as exposure to sunlight. Because of this, it's important to ensure that your bottles have an airtight seal.Most screw-on caps will have a good seal, but any bottle that uses decorative plug-in stoppers should be checked to make sure air cannot get in and oil cannot get out.

, Many oil bottles come with a rubber bulb built into the cap. This is to facilitate easier application of the oils inside. These lids may be convenient, but the rubber will deteriorate over time. Even after a relatively short period of storage, the rubber inside the bulb can disintegrate and may even leak down into your oil.Choose solid screw-on caps. Only use rubber bulb applicators when you're actually drawing out or applying the oil.

, Avoid storing your oil in any location that leaves oil in direct sunlight, including bathroom or bedroom shelves. Sunlight can cause oils to oxidize in just a few months.You can store them in a closet or inside a drawer, though there's no way to regulate the temperature in a storage spot like this. The best place to store essential oil is in a cool, dry place with a well-regulated temperature.

, Refrigeration is ideal for oil storage. Keeping the oils in a refrigerator will protect them from sunlight, reduce the chances of air exposure, and help keep the oil stable in the cooler temperature. The actual temperature is important, but it's more important to prevent fluctuations in temperature.Set your refrigerator between 41 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 10 degrees Celsius) for optimal oil storage.Don't be alarmed if certain oils congeal or solidify at normal refrigerator temperatures. The quality will not be adversely affected, and the oil should return to its liquid state after being removed from the refrigerator.
Try to take oils out of the refrigerator approximately 12 hours before you'll be using them. This should be an adequate amount of time for the oils to return to room temperature.
Do not put oils in the freezer, as freezing may damage the oil and diminish its quality., Most essential oils are flammable. They're often made with alcohol, which can quickly catch fire if left near a fire, candle, or stovetop.If properly stored, though, and kept away from sources of heat, your oil should be perfectly safe to keep around the house.

, Leaving the cap off your bottle of oil will expose the oil to the air. This may result in oxidation, diminished fragrance quality, and even evaporation. Only take the cap off the bottle when you're ready to use that oil, and make sure you tightly seal the bottle immediately after using the oil., If you're serious about building your essential oil collection, you may want to consider purchasing an aromatherapy box. These containers are built to store all of your oils in one place and shield them from sunlight. Some boxes may also provide some slight insulation from extreme temperature fluctuations., Preserving the oil shouldn't be the only precaution you take in storing your bottles. Leaving pure essential oils on certain materials, such as paper, plastic, or painted/polished surfaces, could damage those surfaces. Oil can easily stain, so be careful of what you get your oils on and where you mix or store them., Most diluted essential oils should be marked with a bottling or blending date. This date lets you know when the pure essential oil was altered to produce the diluted product.Any essential oil, whether pure or diluted, has a limited shelf life, and proper bottling won't guarantee a quality oil after prolonged storage.There are many different types of essential oil, though they usually fall into a narrower category. Talk to an aromatherapy expert or search online to determine which category your essential oils fall into.


Blended oils should typically be used within four to six months. Oils that are diluted with distilled water should ideally be used within two weeks.
Citrus oils are typically somewhat short-lived. Try to use citrus oils within six to nine months, if possible.Monoterpene-rich oils, Aldehyde-rich oils, and Ester-rich oils have a shelf life of one to three years.
Oxide-rich oils generally last between one to four years.
Monoterpenol-rich oils, Ketone-rich oils, and Phenol-rich oils usually last three to five years.
Sesquiterpene-rich oils and Sesquiterpenol-rich oils have a shelf life of six to eight years, with some oils lasting even longer if properly stored.

, How a bottle is labeled can tell you a lot about the quality of the oil inside. However, it's important to remember that essential oils are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, so there is no way of verifying that the information on the label is 100% accurate and true.Most quality essential oils will display the Latin name of that oil's plants on the label.
Pure essential oils should be labeled as such, though there's no guarantee that labels won't mislead consumers. If the label says ""pure essential oil"" or ""100% essential oil,"" though, there's a good chance it's a higher quality oil.
Avoid any oils labeled as ""fragrant oil"" or ""potpourri oil,"" as these are most likely synthetic.
Synthetic oils may smell like essential oils, but they may cause allergic reactions and will not provide any therapeutic effects.

, A high-quality oil will typically come with a slightly higher price tag, while cheaper oils are typically of a lower quality. Just as labels aren't necessarily a guarantee of quality, the cost of a given oil may also be inflated. However, as a general rule, you get what you pay for."

Enjoy your rose essence powder.",How to Make Rose Essence Powder," Be sure to only pick rose petals that have never been treated with chemical pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, et cetera. If in doubt, don't use it.;
, Being in nature, the petals are likely dirty and need to be cleaned. Gently rub each petal individually under running water until clean. If there are any that you cannot clean, discard the petal.

, Fill a 300 ml (about 1.2 cups) container with cleaned rose petals. Then, fill the rest with unflavored vodka.

, After sealing the container, shake vigorously for about a minute. This makes sure that no petals are stuck together, gaining as much of the oil as possible. Leave in a cool, dark place for two weeks.

, Right now, the liquid is not concentrated enough and would have almost no rose taste. Drain off the liquid into another container, replace the rose petals (be sure to repeat steps one and two),  reseal the container, and repeat step four.

, Repeat step five until you reach the desired concentration; three times is the normal amount. You now have rose oil, but you want rose essence powder.

, The liquid is mostly vodka with a little rose oil mixed in. You have two options here; you could vaporize the vodka, which will take some time and a lot of work, but provide the best result or you could burn off the vodka, which will take much less time and work but provide a less desirable result.

, Pour the liquid into a fry pan and place it in the oven at 50 degrees Celsius (about 120 degrees Fahrenheit). This temperature is inhibitive towards bacterial growth and will accelerate the drying process. Be sure to not use the broiler, as this will burn the rose powder.

, This will take a long, long time that varies depending on the vodka used and the humidity of your environment. Do not leave the oven running overnight, even though it is just at 50 degrees. When all the liquid is gone, scrape it off, and you are done!

, This step is an alternative to the previous step. Pour the liquid into a shallow fry pan, get the corresponding lid to the pan and a long mit before you start. With great caution, use a long match or long lighter to light the vodka. If flames begin to reach whatever is above the oven or higher than your head, put on the long mit and quickly place the lid atop the pan.

, While it will be exciting at first, the veracity of the blaze will decrease as the process continues. With a metal spatula (avoid plastic and wood because they will melt or burn), move the liquid around until the flames die away. What you have left is rose essence and water.

, Set the stove to its lowest setting and evaporate the water. Keep the mixture moving lest it begin to settle then burn. Do not completely dry the liquid.

, What you have now is a rose and water mush. This has just enough water in it to rot, so smooth it out on a baking pan and follow step 8, then complete step 9.

, In recipes with rose water, syrup, essence or oil, just replace the liquid form with the solid. Use the following ratios, with the essence powder as the second number; rose water - 5 to 1, rose syrup - 1.5 to 1, rose essence - 1 to 1, rose oil - 2 to 1.

The effectiveness of essential oils for healing ailments is still up for debate, even though many have been used for centuries. Overall, there is more scientific research needed to verify their true benefits., When giving your pet essential oil therapy, you want to use a small amount because many pets have very strong senses of smell.

Add more plant material.,
Repeat the process until your essential oil is at your desired strength.,
Store correctly.",How to Make Natural Essential Oils1," You can use a common oil, like olive or canola oil, to extract essential oils from plant material. You can also use ethyl alcohol to extract the oils, if you would prefer. Both methods use the same basic process. To start, gather the right supplies.You will need plant material in the form of herbs of flowers, depending on the type of essential oil you're making. For basil essential oil, for example, use basil herbs. For rose essential oil, use rose petals. You can find herbs or flowers at a local grocery store or florist. Make sure any flowers you use are grown organically, as pesticides may be harmful to the skin. Get a large amount of whatever herb or flower you're using, as only a small amount of essential oils can be extracted at a time.
You will need two non-metal containers, such as ceramic crocks. You'll also need a strainer. You will need sealable bottles to store your mixture when you're finished.
You'll need a carrier oil, like canola or olive oil. If you want to use alcohol instead, aim for ethyl alcohol. If you cannot find this, you can also use unflavored vodka.;
, To start, pour a portion of your oils into your non-metal container. Pour enough to coat the bottom of the container, and then pour the alcohol or oil into the container. Pour just enough to cover the plant material completely., Find a safe place to store your container. Your container should be set somewhere where it's unlikely to be knocked over. You should keep it out of reach of children and pets. You'll be leaving the container in this place for 24 to 48 hours. If you want stronger essential oils, opt to set the container aside longer.A high cabinet, which can be closed easily, is a good option if you have small children or pets.
Let other household members know you're making essential oils so they know not to disturb the container.

, After the allotted time has passed, remove the container from its storage place. Take your strainer and pour the mixture through the strainer into another, similarly sized container.Press the plant material lightly with your hand to squeeze out any excess liquid. This will result in more oils being released.
If you're using a large container, have someone else hold the other container while you pour to make sure nothing spills.

, At this point, your mixture should be giving off the scent of your chosen plant material. However, only a small amount of essential oil has been extracted so far. Rinse out the original crock and add another layer of plant material. Pour the fragrant mixture on top of the plant material., Once again, set the container aside for 24 to 48 hours, and then strain the mixture. Repeat this until the mixture gives off a very strong scent of your chosen plant material.

Use your oil.",How to Make Cinnamon Oil," Cinnamon oil can be made by using either cinnamon stick or ground cinnamon. Find out what is available in your area by checking at local grocery stores. If you have a local spice merchant, they may be able to help you find higher quality cinnamon than you would get at a local market.


If possible, opt to use cinnamon stick. They provide a richer flavor than ground cinnamon, and some claim that ground cinnamon is not as potent and does not offer the same health benefits.Check out the different types of cinnamon. Look for Ceylon cinnamon if you want a milder taste, and try Cassia cinnamon if you want a bit more heat or a slightly more woody flavor.;
, Olive oil is one of the more common carrier oils used to make cinnamon oil, but any neutral, lightly flavored oil will work. Look at the nutritional value, health benefits, and flavor profiles of your favorite kitchen oils to see which one best suits your needs.Olive oil doesn’t break down quickly, and is good for cooking and baking. Its rich flavor may change the cinnamon flavor, though.
Almond oil is a lighter, nuttier oil that is also safe to use under high temperatures.
Canola oil doesn’t have a strong flavor of its own and is often used for pan frying or baking, but it does not have the same rich nutritional value as some other oils.
Coconut oil may have a lightly coconut flavor, and is best when used in moderation due to its high saturated fat content.
Flax seed oil is rich in certain micronutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acid and has a gentle taste. It does not stand up to heat well, though, and so is recommended for dressing, dipping, or direct ingestion.

, You will want to store your oil in clean glass jars. Find jars with rubber seals integrated into their lids, and select the size best fits your needs. The more oil you plan on using, the larger the jar should be.


Remember that your cinnamon oil will be good for the same amount of time as your carrier oil. Most cooking oils last for no longer than a year. Check the eat by dates and find containers that will fit the amount of oil you think you can consume before it turns rancid.Only use clean, intact jars with undamaged seals. Check the rim of the lid to see if any part of the rubber seal is damaged or missing.

, Before you make your oil, sterilize the jars so that you don’t get any unwanted bacteria in your oil. Do this by using warm water and dish soap, followed by a bath in boiling water.Start by removing the lids from your jars and washing the inside and outside of each jar and its lid in warm water. Use dish soap and rinse thoroughly.
Once the jars and lids have been rinsed in warm water, transfer immediately to a boiling pot of water. Keep the lids off the jars. Make sure there is enough water to entirely submerge the open jars.
Remove the jars and put them face-up on a clean baking sheet. Dip the tips of metal tongs into the boiling water for two to three minutes, then use the sterilized tongs to remove the jars.
Allow the jars to cool before handling.

, If you are using cinnamon sticks, fit them vertically into the jar. Pack as many in as possible. For a quart-sized jar, you may want upward of a dozen cinnamon sticks.


If a stick is too long to fit in the jar, use a kitchen knife to gently saw the stick in half and pack both halves into the jar.You may want to use new rubber or nitrile gloves while packing the jar in order to avoid transferring over any bacteria from your hands.

, Pour your carrier oil into the jar until all of the cinnamon sticks are completely immersed. If the jar allows, try to have at least half an inch of oil above the tops of the cinnamon sticks.


Use a clean butter knife or chopstick to maneuver the cinnamon sticks if the oil is not flowing down to the bottom of the jar.

, If you are using ground cinnamon, you will cook it into the oil before placing it in the jar. Use about a quarter of a cup of ground cinnamon for every cup of your carrier oil.Mix the two together in a sauce pan over a low-to-medium heat. Stir the oil and cinnamon until combined, then let simmer for three to five minutes before removing.
Let cool for up to 10 minutes.
Once the oil is cooked and cooled, place in sterilized glass jar and allow to steep.

, Tightly seal up the jars and place them in a warm, dry area such as on a windowsill. Leave the jars in place for up to three weeks. This allows the cinnamon to release its flavors and certain nutrients into the oil.


The longer you leave the jars, the stronger the oil will taste. Taste test the oil once every week or so, and allow to steep until it reaches the strength you want.
Oil made with ground cinnamon can be used immediately, or may be left to steep for a stronger flavor. Try tasting the oil after a week, as ground cinnamon tends to need less time to steep.
Shake the jar daily. This will help infuse the base oil with the cinnamon, and discourage any molding along the surface of the oil.

, Use a piece of cheesecloth to strain the cinnamon oil into another sterilized glass jar after it finishes steeping. Place the cheesecloth over the mouth of the new jar and secure it with your hand or a rubber band as you pour the oil in.


To get extra oil out, allow the cinnamon to fall into the cheesecloth. Then, twist the cloth tightly around the cinnamon to force out more oil.
This may get messy, so it is best done over a large bowl or in the sink.

, Once the oil is successfully transferred into the new jar, seal the jar using a lid with an intact rubber seal. Store the oil in a cool, dry place such as your pantry or the fridge.


You may also transfer the strained oil to a decorative bottle if you prefer. Simply make sure the bottle is sterilized in the same manner as the jars.

, Extend the shelf life of your oil by keeping it in the fridge. Depending upon the type of carrier oil used, you could get up to double the shelf life from your cinnamon oil through refrigeration.Olive oil lasts for up to three years on its own, and thus does not need to be refrigerated.
If you used coconut oil as a carrier oil, keep in mind that it solidifies at cooler temperatures. Expose it to light heat to re-liquify.

, Cinnamon oil may be used in cooking, topically, or around your house. Some research suggests that five grams of cinnamon a day may be helpful for Type 2 Diabetes, while some naturopaths have used it as a treatment for everything from cystic ovaries to household insect infestation.Try substituting small amounts of your cinnamon oil in baking to get not only its health benefits but its rich flavor. For example, if a recipe calls for half a cup of oil, try a quarter cup of your normal cooking oil and a quarter cup of the cinnamon oil.
Try using cinnamon oil topically as a muscle relaxer after a workout or when you are a little sore.Use cinnamon oil in stir-fry or as part of a marinade or dressing to impart a unique flavor.

Use only high quality essential oils.,
Use a diffuser.,
Make aromatic steam yourself.,
Include essential oils in your bath or shower.,
Keep steam-based aromatherapy under an hour.",How to Ease Stress with Essential Oils1," One hundred percent organic essential oils are always the best option when purchasing essential oils. Aside from the environmental benefits of buying organic products, this will also ensure that you're getting an oil that came exclusively from a plant, without added artificial ingredients.


You will notice a price difference between 100% organic oils and those that contain synthetic chemicals. While organic options will be more expensive, the cheaper options are potentially dangerous to inhale.
Expect to pay around $10 for an ounce of some high quality essential oils, and up to $40 for others. You only use a few drops at a time, so one ounce (30 milliliter) jars can last you a while.;
, You can practice aromatherapy with essential oils via many different methods. One of the best ways to do so is with a diffuser designed for essential oils. The diffuser disperses steam produced by heating a mixture of water and essential oil.Steam allows the aroma of the oil to fill an entire room. Further, you may find the visual aspect of dispersing steam to be relaxing as well.
Diffusers can be purchased from around $20, with larger or more feature-laden models available for $40-$50. Find one at your local health supplies store or online.
Follow the directions on the model you purchase regarding the ratio of water to essential oil. You will likely only need to use a couple drops of essential oil in a full tank of water.

, You can also steam a mixture of water and essential oil yourself. As one option, simply put a few drops of essential oil into a pot full of water and heat it on the stove. Set the burner to keep the water slowly simmering, and add water as needed.Alternatively, you can heat water on its own in your tea kettle. Once it boils, remove it from the burner and allow it to cool down enough to stop boiling, but remain steaming. Meanwhile, place ten to twenty drops of essential oil into a ceramic bowl. Fill the bowl about a third of the way with hot water. The steam will diffuse the oils into the room.
In both scenarios, too much heat risks destroying some of the properties in the oils that offer therapeutic benefits. Further, imperfect mixing of the oil and water may mean the aroma is faint relative to a electric diffuser.

, Add a few drops of your chosen essential oil(s) to a warm bath top to make it even more relaxing. If you tend to take showers instead, add a drop or two of essential oil to a bottle of liquid soap (or directly to your loofa).Fill the tub with water before adding the essential oil. Make sure to mix well.
Some people also find that soaking their feet in a warm foot bath also helps them relax. Try it yourself, and add a drop or two of essential oil directly to the foot bath.

, While the benefits of aromatherapy are well-established, they also have a time limit. An hour is a good benchmark for the maximum amount of time you want to spend in a space that smells prominently of an essential oil. Longer exposure times may actually lead to over-stimulation, which won’t help you de-stress."

Gather the right supplies.,
Fill your crockpot with distilled water.,
Place your plant material inside the crock pot.,
Cook the mixture on low for 24 hours.,
Allow the mixture to sit in the crock pot for another 2 to 3 weeks.,
Collect the oil from the surface of the water.,
Cover the water with a piece of cloth and set aside for 24 hours.",How to Make Natural Essential Oils2," You can also extract essential oils by using steam to extract and capture the oils. You can do this using a crock pot, if you own one. To start, you'll need the following:Plant material from your chosen essential oils
A crock pot
A glass container
A piece of cloth

, Use distilled water here, to make sure your oils are not sullied by chemicals found in tap water. Fill your crock pot about halfway full, or three quarters of the way full, with water., Take your chosen plant material. Place it inside the crock pot, allowing it to float on top of the water.You should use just enough plant material that it comfortably fits in the crock pot with distilled water.

, Turn the crock pot on low heat. Cover as you would when cooking meals using the crock pot. Allow it to cook on low for 24 hours.Be careful where you leave the crock pot. Crockpots cook at low temperatures, and are generally safe to leave on when your'e not home.However, make sure to keep the crock pot in a safe place away from flammable materials.

, After the 24 hour period has passed, you can turn off the crock pot. You should also open the crock pot. Leave the mixture alone for 2 to 3 weeks to allow the oils to be fully extracted from the plants.As you're leaving your crock pot open, it's important to find a safe place for it. This is particularly important if you have children or pets, as the water from the crock pot should not be ingested.
A high cabinet, which closes safely, may be your best option. Let other household members know you are making essential oils and they are not to disturb the crock pot.

, After 2 to 3 weeks have passed, a small bit of visible oil should have risen to the surface of the water. You will want to collect this oil and transfer it to a dark, glass container.You can use a cooking spoon or regular spoon to remove the oil. It may take quite a few scoops before you get all the oil. Be careful to collect only the essential oil, and not any water or plant material.

, Take your cloth and place on top of the glass container. Set the container aside for 24 hours. After 24 hours have passed, any extra water will have evaporated and your essential oils will be safe to use.As with the crock pot, it's vital that you take precaution when storing your container. Keep it out of reach of children and pets and place it in an area where it will not be disturbed.
Your essential oil should last for about 12 months. Place it in a sealable container after 24 hours have passed.

Gather your materials.,
Put your plant material in the cotton or linen bag.,
Place your bag in a pot of water and bring it to a boil.,
Simmer the water for 24 hours.,
Collect the water from the surface of the pot.,
Cover the water with a dark cloth and let it sit for a week.",How to Make Natural Essential Oils3," You may not have a crock pot. You can also use a simple pot of water to make essential oils, although you'll need some extra material. To start, gather the following:Someone to help you, as this method requires two people
A cotton and linen bag, as well as string to tie it shut
Distilled water
A pot
A dark glass container
A piece of cloth

, Take your chosen plant material and place enough of it into your bag to fill the bag. Tie the bag shut securely. Be careful to make sure the bag is tied completely shut. Pull the knots tight as you tie, and hold the bag upside and shake it to make sure no plant material escapes., Remember to make sure the water you're using is distilled. You do not want contaminants from tap water ruining the purity of your essential oils. Once the bag is submerged, bring the water to a boil., It can get complicated to simmer the water, as you should never leave a stove on unattended. You will have to have someone help you. The two of you can take turns watching the pot as it simmers for the full 24 hour period.It's a good idea to do this on the weekends, as no one will have work obligations requiring them to wake up early.
If you're watching the pot late at night, make sure you're well rested. Use coffee and other caffeinated beverages to keep you alert as you watch the pot. If you fall asleep on duty, the stove could start a fire.

, After the 24 hours of simmering are over, you will see some oil has risen to the surface of the water. Use a spoon to collect the oil and transfer it into a dark container. Make sure to get mostly oil and not a lot of water.Squeeze the bag a little after collecting the initial oil. There may be a bit of essential oil still inside the bag.

, Cover the dark container with a cloth. Set it aside for 24 hours, as this will allow any extra water to evaporate. After this, your essential oil should be ready. You can place it in a sealable glass container. It should last about 12 months.Be careful where you store your container for the 24 hour period. You do not want children or pets to drink the water. Keep it in a safe place, out of reach of others.

Accept your oils will not be as pure.,
Make sure to follow all regular safety guidelines regarding use of commercial essential oils.,
Consider whether making your own oils is worth the time.",How to Make Natural Essential Oils4," The major drawback to making essential oils at home is that they will not be as pure as store bought oils. Commercially made essential oils withdraw oils from plant materials using expensive equipment. Professional steaming methods, for example, require materials you would have to get from a chemistry lab. Homemade oils can be a fun project, but do not expect them to be as pure as commercially purchased oils., While your oils may not be as pure as store bought oils, you should follow similar safety instructions. It's better to be safe than sorry when dealing with essential oils. You should never put essential oils on your skin directly, as this can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction. Essential oils should always be diluted in a carrier oil, like olive oil or canola oil.Usually, you should aim for 3 to 10% dilution. Children, however, and people with sensitive skin should use only 1% dilutions of essential oil.

, Essential oils can take weeks to make at home. Even after the process is finished, you'll be left with a product that is not as pure as a store bought equivalent. While essential oils are pricey, the cost of the amount of plant material you'll need for certain recipes may get high. You may be better off simply buying essential oils online, especially if you do not have a lot of spare time.

Burn a candle with essential oils.,
Rub essential oils between your palms.,
Mix essential oils into your skin care products.,
Get a massage with essential oils.,
Do something relaxing during aromatherapy sessions.",How to Ease Stress with Essential Oils2," Another great way to fill a room with the aroma of an essential oil is by burning a candle that contains the oil you're after. You can purchase essential oil candles of various sizes and prices online, at many farmer's markets, or in a home decor store in your area.


Even better, you can also easily make your own essential oil candles with supplies that are readily available at craft stores and online.
You can even purchase candles that are marketed specifically for aromatherapy. While these will often contain a higher concentration of essential oils, they will also usually be more expensive, and hover around $20 each.

, This quick and easy way to receive the calming therapeutic benefits of the scent of an essential oil requires no equipment beyond the oil itself. Drop one or two drops in your hands and rub them together. Warmth generated by the friction will help disperse the oil’s aroma.Alternatively, place a single drop on a cotton ball or paper towel and hold it beneath your nose for a brief period of time. This will prevent your hands from smelling like the oil for a while.

, Unscented skin care products are perfect candidates for an addition of essential oils. Whatever you use, simply add two drops to the bottle and shake to mix. Unscented oil made from almond or jojoba is ideal.Aside from a drop or two on the palms, or in other localized uses, essential oil should usually not be applied directly to the skin unless it has been heavily diluted. Undiluted essential oils can cause skin irritation for some people., Massages that incorporate aromatherapy are said to be more effective in terms of pain relief and mental rejuvenation. Add a drop or two of essential oil to the bottle of massage oil to amplify the relaxation your next massage will provide.Though it is a matter of preference, many people find it especially relaxing to have their neck and/or feet massaged with essential oils.

, Aside from massages and baths, there are other relaxing activities you can try to increase the calming benefits of aromatherapy. For instance, try one of these aromatherapy techniques during your next yoga or meditation session. Other good options include reading or practicing deep-breathing techniques while doing aromatherapy.

Default to lavender oil.,
Check out clary sage.,
Give bergamot a try.,
Experiment with other essential oils as well.,
Blend multiple essential oils together.",How to Ease Stress with Essential Oils3," Lavender oil is one of the most popular essential oils, in part because of it’s especially high therapeutic value.

Use this essential first when trying out aromatherapy to help fight stress, depression, and anxiety.Lavender essential oil has demonstrated similar effects to powerful anti-anxiety medications.When selecting a lavender oil in particular, make sure you choose a product that is high in esters and has little to no cineole.

, Another essential oil known for its ability to reduce anxiety is clary sage. Though evidence is limited, clary sage oil may be especially effective in diminishing depression-like symptoms following a stressful day. Clary sage’s anti-anxiety properties may be especially effective for females., The essential oil of this fragrant citrus fruit is said to improve mood and reduce stress-related symptoms. It has also been shown to facilitate rest, and relieve anxiety. From a less technical perspective, the aroma of bergamot is likely to simply calm your nerves and help you wind down.Bergamot, which is also a common ingredient in Earl Gray tea, may be equally as effective in reducing anxiety as are certain prescription medications.
While bergamot oil is especially effective, other citrus essential oils also help fight depression.Yet another example is the yuzu fruit. Essential oil derived from this plant is said to diminish negative emotional stress and positively affect nervous system function., Jasmine and angelica are other essential oils that are argued to have similar effectiveness in fighting anxiety as are potentially dangerous anti-anxiety medications.Sandalwood essential oil, as well as that of rose geranium and roman chamomile, may also help reduce anxiety., Feel free to mix several different essential oils together. In fact, certain blends have proven to be effective in reducing mental discomfort. For instance, try a mix of bergamot, frankincense, and lavender.Include ylang ylang in essential oil blends. Ylang ylang is another fruit that provides essential oil that can help reduce stress. It is less potent than most other essential oils, so it’s best in combination with others.For instance, blend ylang ylang with bergamot and lavender, or with clary sage.

Eucalyptus oil - another great essential oil you can use around the house for all types of purposes.

Peppermint oil - this is likely more effective against mosquitoes. but also considered to work against horse flies.

, Pour all of the ingredients together into a bowl, and stir until combined. Diluting the essential oils will keep them from immediately evaporating and help them diffuse into the air.


All essential oils should be diluted before use; especially if you want to apply them directly to your skin.
Use an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vodka in the mixture will help preserve it for a second use.

, Place the cloth in the tin and pour the mixture inside so that it completely saturates the cloth or sponge. Place the cloth in the tin and shut the lid. Allow to sit for 24 hours.

, Whenever you need to use the tin, remove the lid and place on the entertaining table. Make as many as you wish to put around the entertaining area to deter flies.

, Once open to the air, the strength weakens and needs to be topped up. Sprinkle more essential oils inside, or make another blend.

Look for retailers who sell only organic or unsprayed oils.,
Smell the oils.",How to Buy Essential Oils," Different oils suit different needs so it’s important to know what you wish to achieve by using essential oil. For example, lavender can be used in a diffuser to relax and reduce anxiety and sage essential oil can be used as an antiseptic in wounds or as an anti-inflammatory., There are many uses for essential oils. You may be interested in dealing with a specific medical issue using essential oils, you may want to incorporate essential oils into your skin care routine, or you might want to use them for cleaning your home. These are only a few different ways they can be used. You can describe your wishes to an herbalist, who can make recommendations about which oils to use and how to combine them with other oils to achieve the results you desire.


On the other hand you might be interested in ways you can use a specific essential oil that you enjoy. For example, you may really love the smell of lavender, but don't know how it can be used. In this case, you can also search the internet, but be aware that not all information on the internet is accurate! Herbalists are typically well-educated on how to use plants and their oils, so don't underestimate the information they can provide.Find out about any warnings a specific oil comes with. For example, some oils are not suitable for ingestion, and others should not come into contact with skin.
Find out about interactions with medications. If you are taking any medications, make sure the oil does not interact negatively with them.
If you are pregnant, make sure the oil is safe for you to use. It is not recommended to use any oils in the first trimester, and oils such as cinnamon, clove, rosemary, and sage should be avoided throughout the pregnancy as they could cause contractions., Depending on your needs, you may find that more than one kind of oil is suitable. In this case, unless you have a clear reason for choosing one over the other, use price as a decision-maker. Essential oils vary widely in price, so you could save a lot of money by purchasing the less expensive one.

, There are many cheaper alternatives to essential oils that can do the same thing, such as hydrosols, absolutes, and fragrance oils. You can also purchase essential oils that are diluted in a carrier oil, such as grapeseed or almond oil. In some cases, these may be a better choice, particularly if you plan to apply the oil to your skin.


A hydrosol, hydrolat, or water essence (e.g. rose water, lavender water, etc.) is a by-product of the distillation process. When plants are distilled, the vapor condenses into essential oils and hydrosols, which are then separated. If dilution is not an issue (e.g. as in some aromatherapy methods), these can serve as cheaper alternatives.
Absolutes are highly concentrated essential oils, which are extracted with solvents, usually from flowers. These can be more expensive than essential oils, but can also be diluted more, and still serve the same purposes.
Fragrance oils (also known as floral waters) are typically synthetic compounds which have an aroma similar to essential oils. They are cheaper than essential oils, but not usually suitable for therapeutic or culinary uses (e.g. they are not safe for consumption or for skin application).

, Take the time to understand how the oil you are after is distilled, what type of plant is used, and where in the world it comes from. Essential oils vary greatly in quality depending on which parts of the plants are included.


For example, lavender oil can be made from the flowers or from the flowers and stalks of the lavender plant. In this case, lavender essential oil made from only the flowers is of higher quality.

, Was the oil distilled using steam or water? Typically, oil distilled using steam is of higher quality. However, there are exceptions to this. For example, essential oils made from the flower typically have to be distilled with water so they don’t stick together., Not all oils will have one, but oils produced in several different countries likely will as they may have a different chemical profile as a result of where they were grown.If you are interested in a very specific oil for a very specific reason, and the oil has a chemotype, make sure you are getting it for the profile you need it for.


For example, rosemary can have different chemical properties depending upon the environment in which it was grown. When looking at the different rosemary chemotypes, chemotype will be abbreviated as, ""ct."" followed by the chemotype. ""Rosemary ct. camphor"" is good for treating aches and pains, while ""Rosemary ct. verbenone"" is useful for its skin regeneration abilities., Once you have determined the right oil for you, try to find the best price for it. Check locally and online, but make sure you’re comparing the same product. Make a list of the best prices and where you found those prices. However, beware of oils that are significantly cheaper than the others, as this may be a low-quality oil. On the other hand, the most expensive oil may not necessarily be the best one.


Is the quantity the same?
Is the dilution of the essential oil the same?
Are you comparing the same oils?

, Decide whether you want to shop online or purchase locally. Read reviews online of the shop you are interested and ask around to see if anyone you know has recommendations or thoughts about a particular retailer.

, The bottle should include important information such as: botanical name of the plant, the country of origin, date of distillation, date of expiration, and the chemotype, if applicable.The botanical name is a latin name given to each species. For example, true lavender is lavandula angustifolia, mandarin is citrus reticulata and grapefruit is citrus paradisi. Knowing the botanical name of the plant used in your essential oil is important because many species have the same common name, but vastly different uses.

, Essential oils should always be kept in dark glass bottles and out of direct sunlight in order to maintain their potency.Oils sold in other packaging should be considered suspect.

, Don’t be afraid to email or stop by to ask questions. It is particularly important to find out whether or not the retailer performs GC/MS testing. This stands for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and although it has its own problems, is a generally well-accepted way to test the quality of the oil. Also consider the following:


Does your essential oil supplier sell all essential oils in appropriate sizes? Essential oils require a huge amount of plant matter to produce. If the retailer sells huge bottles at rock bottom prices, it is unlikely that the oil is of good quality.
Does your essential oil supplier have representatives traveling worldwide to personally inspect the fields and distilleries where the herbs are grown and distilled? Small shops may not have the resources to do this, but bigger shops and suppliers that do are likely to have high quality oils.
Does your essential oil supplier care about the farms they use and make sure they are fair trade? Meaning the local farmers get fair pay.
Does your essential oil supplier grow and distill its own organically grown herbs? Are the distillation facilities part of the farm where the herbs are grown so they are freshly distilled, maintaining their potency?

, Does your essential oil supplier provide knowledgeable staff to answer your questions about use, and supply as much information as possible free of charge? If not, or if they are hesitant to answer questions or pushy about making a purchase, consider going somewhere else.

, Different oils require more or less plant matter, some plants are not as difficult to grow, and some are not as difficult to process. Therefore, prices can and should vary significantly if the retailer is selling high quality oils., If you want to purchase your oils online, find out the shipping costs first. Industrial suppliers may charge upwards of $50 shipping regardless of the weight of the shipment.

, They will cost more, but these oils are better because pesticides can become more concentrated in essential oils., If you are shopping in a store, smell the oils you are interested in. Does it smell rich, organic, and delicate or does it smell strongly of chemical or bland (e.g. like canola oil)? High quality oils will have a rich but delicate smell.

"
"
Consider the quality of essential oils before you purchase.,
Consider the essential oil’s chemotype before purchasing.,
Consider the packaging.",How to Use Essential Oils1," Since you will be using essential oils on your body and around your home, it is in your best interest to select high quality essential oils. There is no standard of quality that all essential oil companies must abide by, so you will have to consider several things before you buy an essential oil.


Have you heard of the company and/or used their products before? Only purchase essential oils from reputable companies.
Is the price of the essential oil comparable to other similar products or much cheaper? Be wary of cheap essential oils because they may not be pure.
Does the bottle list the Latin name for the plants used to make the essential oil and/or the country of origin? These details indicate that the company caters to knowledgeable consumers and is therefore more trustworthy.
Does the packaging have a statement about purity? Look for products that contain 100% essential oil and steer clear of ones that contain less or that do not provide a percentage.
How does the product smell? If the product does not smell like you expect it to smell, then it might not be a quality product.
Does the packaging include a statement about organic growing practices or “wildcrafting”? If not, then the plants used to make the oil may have been mass produced and/or sprayed with pesticides, so you may want to avoid these products.;
, Some essential oil producers offer multiple types of the same essential oil. These different types, or chemotypes, feature slight variations in the scent because of the climate, soil, environment, and other factors. The benefit of choosing a specific chemotype of an essential oil is that you can customize your dilutions.


For example, basil has two primary chemotypes: sweet basil oil and Reunion basil oil. Sweet basil oil has a sweeter aroma while Reunion basil oil has more of a woody aroma.

, Essential oils degrade more quickly when exposed to light and heat. Make sure that the product you purchase is packaged in a dark (usually brown) glass container and that it is well sealed. Avoid purchasing essential oils that have been opened or that appear to have been exposed to lots of sun or heat..

Gather supplies.,
Pour the ingredients into an empty spray bottle.,
Spray the formula onto your skin.",How to Make Natural Outdoor Fly Repellent with Essential Oils2," This fly repellant spray has been used for centuries to ward away bugs, and it really works. It has a strong smell when you first spray it on your body, but the smell will fade as the mixture dries. Here's what you need:


1/2 cup witch hazel
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
30-50 drops of essential oils. Choose any combination of citronella, clove, lemongrass, rosemary, tea tree, cajeput, eucalyptus, cedar, catnip, lavender, or mint.

, You can use an old one that has been cleaned out with soap and water, or buy a new one from the drugstore to reserve for this use.

, Shake the bottle and spray it on your hands, arms, legs, and other uncovered areas. Allow it to fully dry, and reapply when necessary. Avoid getting repellent in your eyes or mouth.


You can use this formula on most clothing as well. Test on a small section first to make sure it won't discolor the fabric.
Do not spray this on children or pets without verifying the safety of the oil involved. For example, tea tree oil is very toxic to cats.
Remember, never apply undiluted essential oil to your skin. Make sure you mix it with a carrier liquid to dilute it first.

"
"
Try tea tree, lavender or eucalyptus oil.,
Try mint oil.,
Use basil oil.",How to Make Natural Outdoor Fly Repellent with Essential Oils3," These three oils are most effective against flies. To make an oil rub from these powerful oils, it's important to dilute them with a carrier oil. Make a 2% solution by adding 12 drops of your chosen essential oil per 1 fl. oz (30ml) of carrier oil, such as olive oil. Apply it to your wrists, neck and other pulse points to keep flies away.


Keep extra oil in a small vial so you can apply it again when necessary.
Applying undiluted essential oils directly onto skin (even lavender or tea tree oil) can result in sensitization, which means that you may become so sensitive to the oil that any contact will cause skin irritation., Mint is another natural fly repellent, and it has that classic, sweet mint fragrance. Peppermint, spearmint, catnip are fantastic at shooing away unwanted flies and keeping you smelling great. Make a 2% solution by adding 12 drops of peppermint essential oil per 1 fl. oz (30ml) of carrier oil, such as olive oil. Rub it directly on your skin.

, Basil is another strong-smelling herb that flies generally dislike, and basil is especially helpful against moths.Make a 2% solution by adding 12 drops of basil essential oil per 1 fl. oz (30ml) of carrier oil, such as olive oil. Rub it directly on your skin.

Be aware that essential oils should not be ingested.,
Determine what type of delivery method is best for your purposes.,
Dilute essential oils in a carrier oil or water if you plan to apply it to the skin.,
Apply essential oils without dilution, also known as “neat” application.",How to Use Essential Oils2," Some essential oils may make you sick or may even be fatal when ingested, so you should not eat or drink any essential oils. You can apply the oils to your skin safely, but most oils need to be diluted first., Essential oils can be applied along with a carrier oil, diluted in water to use as a spray, or mixed with other agents such as bath salts. Identify the way that you plan to use the essential oil before you decide how to dilute it.

, Sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, and avocado oil all work well as carriers for essential oils. These carrier oils do not have a strong smell of their own so they will not overpower or conflict with the essential oils. You can also use water as a carrier. Before you prepare you essential oil solution, make sure that you consider how you plan to use it.


For an essential oil solution that will be applied to a concentrated area of an adult’s body, prepare a 3-5% solution. Add 3-5 drops of essential oil for every teaspoon of carrier oil or water that you use. This dilution is ideal for applying a small amount of essential oil to your temples or wrists.
For an essential oil solution that will be applied to a large area of an adult’s body, prepare a 1% solution. Add 1 drop of essential oil for every teaspoon of carrier oil or water that you use. This dilution is ideal for massage oil mixtures and body sprays.
If you plan to use essential oil on a baby, you should prepare a much weaker solution of 0.25%. To prepare a 0.25% solution, add one drop of essential oil to every 4 teaspoons of carrier oil or water.To use essential oils in the bath, add 3-5 drops to your bath salts or to a teaspoon of carrier oil. Then add the mixture to your bathwater. Mixing essential oils with a carrier before adding them to the bathwater will help prevent direct contact of the essential oil with your skin, which may cause irritation.

, Some sources argue that you should never apply essential oils to you skin without diluting it in a carrier oil first because of the risk of sensitization and irritation.But there have been some studies that have shown that neat applications can be helpful in some cases. For example, one study showed that a twice daily neat application of tea tree oil was effective against fungal infections on nails.Therefore, you may want to consult an experienced aromatherapist before deciding to use neat applications of essential oils.

Then, apply the blend to the forehead, temples and back of the neck. Massage the oil into your skin using gentle circular motions, while inhaling deeply. The best essential oils for headaches include:


Lavender
PeppermintGinger, Essential oils can be used as an effective treatment for acne and are a good alternative to the harsh chemicals found in many acne creams and prescription drugs. In one study, a 5% tea tree oil gel was found to be as effective as benzoyl peroxide (a common ingredient in over-the-counter and prescription acne creams) in the treatment of acne.To create a 5% tea tree oil gel for acne treatment, add 5 drops of tea tree oil to a teaspoon of aloe vera gel. Mix the oil and aloe well and then apply the gel to acne using your fingertips or a q-tip. Store the mixture in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

, Using essential oils will not cure insomnia or its root cause, but using calming and relaxing essential oils before bedtime can help you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep until your intended wake up time. Three of the best essential oils to help with insomnia are lavender - to promote relaxation, roman chamomile - which is a natural sedative, and clary sage - which contains narcotic properties.If you have a vaporizer, add a few drops of lavender, roman chamomile, or clary sage oil to it before you get into bed.
Try adding a couple of drops of oil to your bedtime bath, or try massaging a large area dilution into your legs and feet before bed.
Keep in mind that some essential oils, such as rosemary, cypress, grapefruit, lemon and peppermint, can be particularly energizing and stimulating, so they are best avoided before bedtime.

, Probably the most widespread use of essential oils is to promote emotional well-being by reducing stress and encouraging calmness and relaxation. Essential oils positively affect our emotions because our smell receptors connect to the brain's limbic system - an area responsible for emotions, memory, and sexual arousal.The top five essential oils particularly effective for stress relief are:


Lavender, with its calming, earthy and sweetly floral scent, is widely beloved for the relaxing and balancing effects it provides, on both a physical and emotional level.
Frankincense essential oil, with its comfortingly warm, exotic aroma, is most widely used for its stress relieving properties.
Rose is a popular oil for relieving stress, while also helping with depression and grief.
Chamomile essential oil, especially the Roman variety, addresses stress caused by mental anxiety, as well as helping with paranoia and feelings of hostility.
Vanilla essential oil is renowned for its therapeutic qualities. Many people find vanilla to be a very comforting smell, and some aromatherapists claim that this is because vanilla oil is closest in fragrance and flavor to mothers' milk. Vanilla induces tranquility and stimulates mental clarity.

, Thyme essential oil is the top essential oil used to help with snoring. To use thyme essential oil as a snoring remedy, create a concentrated area dilution (3-5 drops per teaspoon of carrier oil). Rub the oil into the bottoms of both feet before bed.Other oils that can be used in place of thyme oil include cedarwood and marjoram.

, Many store-bought insect repellents are full of harsh synthetic chemicals, which smell unpleasant and may irritate your skin. A strong dilution of lemon eucalyptus oil is an excellent (and great smelling) alternative to help keep the bugs at bay.You can mix the oil with a base oil and apply it directly to skin, or you can place the oil in a diffuser or burner near an open window.


To make your own insect repellent, combine 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of carrier oil, 2 tablespoons of witch hazel, and about 50 drops of lemon eucalyptus oil, 10 drops of lavender oil, 10 drops of cedarwood oil, and 10 drops of rosemary oil. Combine the ingredients in a small spray bottle and shake the mixture well before applying., Topical application of some essential oils can help to naturally clear up ear infections and to ease any pain associated with them. The oils should not be applied inside of the ear, but rather applied along the neck and behind the affected ear.


Tea tree essential oil is one of the best oils for relieving earaches. Create a concentrated area dilution (3-5 drops per teaspoon of carrier oil) and massage behind ears and on the neck., Essential oils can help to relieve symptoms of dizziness associated with vertigo. Peppermint is often lauded as the most effective essential oil when it comes to treating dizziness. It has been commonly used in treating nausea and vertigo as it contains menthol, menthyl esters, and menthone - the components responsible for producing peppermint's cooling and invigorating effect. When dizziness strikes, lace a few drops of peppermint oil onto a cotton ball or handkerchief and inhale. Other oils that help to relieve dizziness include:


Cypress
Basil
Clary sage
Myrtle
Lavender
Ginger
Rose
Rosemary
Tangerine

, Certain essential oils have been used to treat burns for thousands of years, due to their anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. The best essential oils for relieving sunburn include lavender oil, helichrysum oil, rose oil and Australian Blue oil (a blend of several different essential oils). The most effective way to apply the essential oils is to mix them with a little aloe vera gel (1 drop of essential oil per teaspoon of aloe vera gel) and spread directly on the burn.You can also make your own sunburn relief spray by combining:

1 cup + 1 tablespoon Aloe Vera Juice
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 teaspoon vitamin E
8 drops lavender essential oil
8 drops tea tree essential oil
8 drops roman chamomile essential oil


Combine all of the ingredients in a glass spray bottle and shake well.

, Lavender, tea tree oil, eucalyptus, peppermint, tea tree, and several other essential oils can be used to treat minor wounds like cuts, burns or bug bites, thanks to their anti-biotic properties. To use essential oils for a minor wound care, clean the wound first. Make sure that the wound is not bleeding. Then, apply a small amount of a 2-3% dilution of essential oil (2-3 drops per teaspoon of carrier oil).Apply the oil topically 2-5 times a day until the wound has healed. After application, you can also apply a cold compress to the wound to ease bleeding and swelling and to seal in the oils.

, You’ve probably heard that peppermint tea can soothe an upset stomach. Likewise, peppermint essential oil can be used to ease nausea and digestive issues. Simply create a large area dilution (3-5 drops per teaspoon of carrier oil) and rub the mixture on your abdomen to ease stomach pain.Other oils that can be used in this manner include ginger, nutmeg and spearmint essential oils.
Applying a warm compress to the stomach after applying the oils may also help to relieve pain and discomfort.
Most research has found that peppermint oil taken orally is likely to be effective against symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome., Eucalyptus oil can be used to help ease the symptoms of sinus congestion. Eucalyptus oil helps to open up the sinuses and cool the nasal passages. Many people use eucalyptus oil to help combat congestion associated with the common cold and allergies.To use eucalyptus oil as a topical decongestant, mix eucalyptus oil with a carrier oil (3-5 drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil). Apply a small amount of the mixture under your nose and rub some of the mixture into your chest as well.
If you suffer from severe congestion, add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to your humidifier or fragrance diffuser as well.

Cut sprigs of fresh lavender or purchase them dried.,
Let the lavender dry.,
Lightly crush the lavender and place it in a jar.,
Pour oil over the flowers.,
Soak the lavender if you have time and sunlight.,
If you do not have time or sunlight, heat the oil carefully.,
Strain the oil.,
Repeat the process if you wish to make the oil stronger.,
Add a few drops of vitamin E (optional).,
Store your oil in a dark bottle or jar.",How to Make Lavender Oil1," Cut off the stems of lavender along with the flowers, in 6 inch (15 centimeter) segments or longer. The leaves and new stems can be used to infuse oil as well as the flowers, although the woody, thick stems near the base should be avoided.You may use flower buds or strong-smelling flowers.You may wish to pick more lavender than you think you need. Then, if the oil you create isn't strong enough to suit your preferences, you will not have to wait for a new batch of lavender to dry.;
, If you are using fresh lavender, dry it first in shade or wrapped in a cloth, to enhance its aroma and minimize the chance of the oil becoming rancid. Tie the sprig up with rubber bands or a string and let it hang upside down in a dry, warm area. Exposing it to sunlight will dry the lavender out much faster, but could break down some of its aromatic oils. Fresh cut lavender may take two weeks to dry fully. Some infusers dry it for only one to three days, until it is withered but not crunchy; this reduces the chance of spoilage greatly, but does not eliminate it., Crumble the lavender apart with clean hands, or bruise it slightly with any clean, heavy object to expose its fragrance. If using buds, open them up with a knife or fingers. Place it in a clean jar.


Wash your hands and jar first if they are dirty, but dry thoroughly before bringing them into contact with the lavender. Mixing water into the oil may interfere with the infusion., Pour any non-scented or lightly scented oil into the jar, fully covering the lavender but leaving 1–2 inches (1.25–2.5cm) of space at the top to allow for expansion.Almond oil, olive oil, or safflower oil are commonly used for this purpose, although you may wish to smell these first and avoid strong-smelling bottles that could overpower the lavender scent.

, Cover the jar tightly and leave the mixture to soak in a sunny location. It will most likely take at least 48 hours to achieve a noticeable scent, and more typically the oil is left out for three to six weeks. If you do not have enough sunlight or time to use this method, continue to the next step.

, A faster alternative to the sun-steeping method is to heat the oil and lavender mixture in a double boiler or crockpot for 2–5 hours, keeping it at a steady temperature between 100–120ºF (38–49ºC). This is only recommended if you have a cooking thermometer and a well-controlled, low temperature heat source, as too much heat can affect the aroma and the shelf life of the oil., Lay a piece of muslin or cheesecloth over a bowl and pour the oil and herb mix over it. Discard the flowers and other lavender pieces in the compost or garden.

, The same oil can be poured back into the jar and have a new batch of dried lavender placed in it. As described above, leave it out in a sunny location, or heat it at low temperatures, to create a stronger infusion. This can be repeated as many as eight times if you want a powerful oil., Vitamin E can be added at the end of the infusion to increase the shelf life of the oil. This is recommended if you do not have a cool, dark place to store the oil, or if the oil you used is somewhat old or has a short shelf life. Stir in a few drops of vitamin E oil, or cut open a vitamin E gel capsule and pour in the contents.

, Gather up the muslin and squeeze the material to extract as much as you can over a bowl or measuring cup. Transfer this to a bottle or jar made from dark glass or opaque plastic to prevent overlong exposure to light from breaking the aroma down. The shelf life for lavender infused oil depends on the type and freshness of oil used, but can typically last for months if kept in a dry, dark location.

Purchase an essential oil still.,
Build your own still if you don’t want to buy one.,
Use stainless steel and glass parts, if possible.Do not use plastic tubing in place of a glass pipe, as it can affect the quality of the oil.,
Bend the pipe so it can pass through the cooling tub.,
Connect the pipe to the pressure cooker valve.,
Run the pipe through the cooling tub.,
Position the open end of the pipe over the essencier.,
Make sure all your instruments are in stable positions.,
Determine when to harvest your plant material.,

Be choosy if purchasing your plants.,
Dry the plant material.,
Pour water into the tank of your still.,
Add your plant matter to the water.,
Bring the pressure cooker to a boil.,
Keep an eye on the still.,
Filter the collected oil (optional).,
Pour the oil into a container for storage as quickly as possible.",How to Make Essential Oils," Although you’ll likely be hard-pressed to find one in a store (unless you have a specialty store nearby), these stills are easy to buy online. However, beware that they can be expensive — usually around a couple hundred dollars. If you plan on making large quantities of essential oil, a professional still is a good investment.;
, If you want to try building a still, you've got plenty of room for creativity - there are thousands of still designs, and even today, many stills are homemade. The key components of a still are:


A heat source — usually direct fire
A pressure cooker
A 10 mm glass pipe
A tub of cold water to cool down and condense the steam flowing through the pipeAn essencier, which separates out the essential oil from other materials you don’t want in your final product., Some plants react badly with copper, but heavily tinned copper is suitable in all cases. You can also use aluminum materials, but not with wintergreen, cloves, or other plants whose oils have phenols.

, You’ll bring the plant matter to heat in the pressure cooker, and the resulting steam will pass through the pipe. You have to be able to cool that steam back down to liquid by immersing it in a cold water or ice bath. Depending on what you’re using for your cooling tub, you’ll have to bend the pipe in different shapes. For example, if you’re simply using a basin, you might have to bend it into a coil so that it can lay in the open tub. If you’re using a large bucket of ice, you might be able to bend the pipe to a 90 degree angle so that it can go down through the top of the bucket, then out a hole in the bottom.

, Use a small piece of flexible hose that fits snugly over both openings, which should be roughly the same size if you’re using a 10 mm pipe. You can secure the connection using a jubilee clip purchased at a hardware store.


Make sure you cut the hose long enough to allow some room to bend. Otherwise, your pipe will stick straight up in the air, and you’ll have to give it a 90 degree bend so it can run toward the cooling tub.

, If you’re using an open basin, position it so that the coil lies completely inside the tub. It should be completely submerged when the basin is filled with cold water or ice. If you’re using a bucket, drill a small hole in the bottom so the pipe can pass out of the ice bath. Seal the hole using a silicone sealer or epoxy to prevent water from dripping through it and making a mess.

, Once the distillate drips into the essencier, it will do all the rest of the work for you. It will separate the essential oil from the rest of the matter that you don’t want in your final product.

, Depending on the tools you’re using and the shape of your pipe, you may have to work a little bit to find a safe, stable setup for all of your still components. Put the lid on the pressure cooker with the pipe attached to it, run the pipe through your cooling tub, and position the open end of the pipe over your essencier. Make sure the pipe is at a comfortable angle and nothing will get knocked over.

, The amount of oil in a plant depends on where it is in its life cycle, so it’s important to harvest each species of plant at the right time. You need to do some research to figure out when to harvest the plants you want to distill. For example, lavender should be harvested when about half the flowers on the stem have withered.Rosemary, on the other hand, should be harvested when the plants are in full bloom., Just as you need to research when to harvest plants for best essential oil production, you need to research how to harvest them. Careless handling, harvesting the wrong parts, even harvesting at the wrong time of day can reduce the quantity and quality of the essential oils. For example, you only want to use the flowering tops of the rosemary plant when making rosemary essential oil. Discard or use the rest of the plant some other way.


Most essential oils are held in the plant's oil glands, veins and hairs, and these are very fragile. If you disturb or break them, you’ll get less oil from your plants. Handle the plants with care, and handle them as little as possible.

, If you're buying already-harvested plants, you will not have much control over the harvesting process. Look for plants that appear healthy and undamaged, and ask the seller when they were harvested. Generally, plants that are in whole form (not crushed or powdered) are best.


While distillation removes many impurities, pesticides and herbicides can contaminate your oil. It’s best to use organically grown plants, whether you purchase them or grow your own.

, Drying reduces the amount of oil in each plant, but can greatly increase how much essential oil you make per batch. This is because you’ll be able to fit more material into each batch. Drying should be done slowly and away from direct sunlight.Commercially grown plants such as lavender and peppermint may be allowed to dry in the field after cutting for a day or so.


The ideal drying method varies from plant to plant, but in general, you shouldn’t overheat the plants. Drying in the shade or even in a dark room minimizes the oil loss.
Don’t allow the plants to become wet again before distillation. Distill as soon as possible after drying.
You can choose not to dry your plant material if you’d like to skip this step.

, If you made your own still, your tank is the pressure cooker. Use clean water; it should be ideally filtered or distilled and as soft as possible. If you're using a manufactured still, follow the manufacturer's direction. Otherwise, just make sure you have enough water to complete the distillation. Depending on the plant and on the quantity, distillation can take anywhere from a half-hour to six hours or more after the water boils.

, Fit as much plant matter as the tank can contain. As long as you have enough water to last without boiling off, your plants should be fine even if they’re packed in tight. Just make sure that they don’t block the steam outlet in the lid of the pressure cooker.Give yourself a couple inches of leeway.


You don’t need to chop or otherwise prepare the plant in any way — in fact, doing so will cause you to lose some of the oils.

, Seal the lid so that the only steam that escapes must travel through the pipe that’s attached to the steam valve. Most plants will release their essential oils at 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit — the normal boiling point of water., After a while, the distillate should begin to come through your condenser and into your separator. The process should be fairly hands-off, but you want to make sure you don’t run out of water in your still. Depending on the length of the distillation process, you may also need to change the water in the cold-water tub. If the hot pipe warms the water up, replace it with fresh cold water or ice so that the cooling process continues to work.

, Once your distillation is complete, you might choose filter the oil through cheesecloth or similar dry cotton fabric. Make sure that the cloth is dry and clean — detergent residues and dirt can contaminate the oil.


Don’t be disappointed that you get a very small amount of essential oil from a large amount of plant matter. Percent yields vary from species to species, but they’re always lower than a beginning distiller might think., Most essential oils can be kept for at least one or two years, but some have very short shelf lives.To maximize the useful life of your oil, keep it in a dark glass bottle or stainless steel container. Use a clean funnel to pour the oil into the container, and make sure the container is clean before pouring the oil into it. Store it in a cool, dark place.Decide what to do with the hydrosol as well. The other material in the essencier is hydrosol — water that’s been distilled and infused with the scent of the plant.
Some hydrosols, like rose or lavender water are usable themselves.
If you don’t want to save the hydrosol, you can pour it into the still for the next batch if you will be distilling another batch immediately. Otherwise, throw it out.

Treat physical ailments.,
Apply oils aromatically.,
Take a bath.,
Get a massage.",How to Apply Essential Oils1," Many people believe that essential oils have healing properties. Oils are frequently used to help increase physical wellness. If you are having pains or other ailments, it is possible that there is an oil that can help you.

For example, many people use essential oils to help treat acne. To use this method, apply a few drops of lavender or tea tree oil to a fragrance free moisturizer. Rub gently into skin.
Ginger and peppermint can be used to treat nausea. Add a few drops of either oil to a carrier oil, such as grapeseed. A carrier oil will dilute the essential oil, making it safe to apply to skin. Rub mixture onto abdomen.
You can use essential oils to treat a toothache. Apply 2-3 drops of clove or peppermint oil to a cotton ball and place the ball on the sore tooth.;
, Aromatic application means that you will be breathing the oil in. There are several ways that you can safely use aromatic application. Try direct inhalation.To use direct inhalation, you can hold the bottle of oil a few inches from your face. Breathe the scent in and out through the nose.
You can also place a few drops of oil into your palms and inhale. Remember that some oils, such as cinnamon, should be diluted before you inhale them.
Make a steam tent. Place a few drops of oil, such as eucalyptus, into a pot of boiling water. With a towel draped over your head, lean carefully over the pot and inhale the steam.

, A hot bath can be very helpful in treating physical ailments. If you add essential oils to your bath, it can become even more soothing. Choose an oil that will help your particular ache or pain.If you have sore muscles, or are just in need of relaxation try adding lavender essential oil to your bath. Add 6 drops of oil just before stepping into the hot bath.
Remember that oils are not water soluble. This means that the oil will float on the surface of the water.
Try adding bath salts to help the oil disperse. Try mixing one part baking soda with two parts Epsom salts, and three parts sea salt. Add two tablespoons of this mixture to the six drops of oil and add to your bath.

, You can add essential oils to a massage to make the results even more effective. If you are making your own massage oil, you can add the essential oil of your choice. Just remember to use the proper ratio.

You have to be careful when applying essential oils directly to the skin. Make sure that your mixture does not contain more than 1% essential oil. That is only one drop per teaspoon.
Make sure to use a carrier oil, such as coconut or almond, to mix with your essential oils. The essential oil you choose depends on the desired effect.
To nourish dry or irritated skin, try grapefruit essential oil. For sore muscles, try wintergreen or peppermint.

Follow the instructions for creating an infused oil first.,
Shave beeswax using a knife or cheese grater.,
Heat the beeswax and oil over low heat.,
Pour the mixture into containers.,
Harden the mixture in a cool location.,
Clean your pot and stirring utensil.",How to Make Lavender Oil2," This method turns a lavender-infused oil into a salve that can be rubbed onto your skin to lessen inflammation and pain.First, you'll need to create the lavender-infused oil as described in another section, or purchase some from a herbalist store.

, You may wish to use a cheap, extra grater rather than one you use regularly, because the wax may be difficult to clean off. Measure the beeswax before you shave it into fragments; you will need approximately 1 part beeswax to 8 parts oil. Use more beeswax for a harder balm, and less for a softer salve.If your beeswax was sold by weight, you can use these approximate weight to volume conversions: 1 ounce of beeswax = 1 fluid ounce = 1/8 cup = 28 grams., Place the beeswax fragments in a pan. Pour the lavender-infused oil over it. Heat over low heat until they have melted together. It may take 15 minutes or more for all the beeswax fragments to melt. Stir occasionally using a wooden spoon or other heat-safe utensil, preferably one you don't mind damaging if wax ends up stuck to it permanently.

, Pour the melted balm into glass or tin containers, making sure they are clean and dry first. Seal with an airtight lid.

, After 10 or 15 minutes in the refrigerator, or 30 minutes in a cool room or cellar, check on the balm or salve to see how hard it is. If it is still liquid, or too hard to scoop up with your fingers, you may need to melt it again. Add more beeswax to make it harder, or more oil to make it softer.

, Boil hot, soapy water in your pot once it's been emptied of balm, then turn off the heat. Let it cool for a couple minutes, then put on rubber gloves so you can scrub the wax from the sides while the water is still quite hot. Place the stirring utensil in the water only after the water is done boiling to avoid damaging it. Scrub the utensil and pot with a hard sponge or scrubbing brush.

Generally, there are two types:General contractor. This person manages an entire project. They hire subcontractors and supervise them. General contractors also obtain building permits and help schedule inspections.
Specialty contractor. A specialty contractor installs only certain fixtures or products. For example, a contractor might specialize in plumbing, heating and cooling systems, or electrical wiring.;
, If you know somebody who has had a home built or renovated, then ask them if they would recommend their contractor. Ask what they liked and didn’t like about the contractor.


Make sure to check the work the contractor performed. You’ll want to judge with your own eyes whether they did a good job.

, Your local building inspector will know the reputations of people in the building industry. You should call and ask if they can refer someone.Tell the building inspector what kind of work you need done on your home.

, The people who work at your nearest lumberyard know quite a bit about local contractors. For example, they know which ones use only high-grade materials. They also know which ones pay their bills on time.You might feel awkward simply showing up at a lumberyard, so you can call instead. Identify yourself and say you are looking for a contractor. Ask if they know anyone.
Say, “Hi. I’m Michael Jones, and I’m looking for a contractor to remodel my bathroom. Do you by chance know of anyone who does good work? I have no idea where to even find referrals.”

, You can find a remodeler at this association’s website.Visit http://www.nari.org/consumers/ and enter your location.


NARI’s members can qualify as certified, master certified, and green certified professional remodelers. Its members must uphold high ethical and industry standards.
NARI has members in 49 states., Keep your eyes peeled for potential scammers and avoid anyone who makes you uncomfortable. There are red flags you should be aware of, including the following:Someone knocks on your door and asks if you need a contractor.
The contractor offers you a discount if you can drum up more business for them.
The contractor has unused materials from a previous job.
You feel pressured to make quick decisions.
The contractor asks you to pay everything upfront or recommends a lender the contractor knows.
There is no business number in the phone directory for the contractor. The contractor also has no fixed street address.
The contractor asks you to get building permits. This is the general contractor’s job, and if they avoid doing it, then this signals there is a problem.
The contractor offers a long-term or lifetime guarantee on the work they perform.

, You should always check a contractor’s online reputation by doing a general Google search. Also look for review sites and analyze whether a lot of people have complained of being ripped off.You can also check with your local Better Business Bureau or your state’s consumer protection agency to see whether the contractor has a long list of complaints filed against them.Take anonymous reviews with a grain of salt. Anonymous reviews could be posted by a contractor’s competitors or by people with a grudge.

, Not every state requires contractors to be licensed, but you should check with your local building department to ask.If your state requires that contractors be licensed, then ask the contractor if they are licensed and when.


Also double check to confirm the contractor is licensed. If your state requires a license, then there should be a website you can search. Go online and search “your state” and “contractor license.” In Washington, for example, you can search at the state’s Department of Labor and Industries website.At the same website, you may also be able to check whether the contractor is bonded and has insurance. A legitimate contractor should have both.

, You shouldn’t hire a contractor without speaking to them. Instead, make a quick call to everyone on your list. Ask the following questions, at a minimum:How long have they been in business?
Does the contractor accept projects like yours (size, type, location, etc.)?
How many projects do they have ongoing right now?
How do they select subcontractors, and how long have they worked with them?
Can the contractor work around your schedule? For example, you might not want anyone in your house before 9:00 am or after 6:00 pm. It’s best to know this information ahead of time.Can they provide you with an itemized bid?Is this bid an estimate or a fixed price?
What kinds of insurance do they carry? A contractor should carry workers’ compensation, personal liability, and property damage coverage.Can they provide you with certificates of insurance?

, Narrow down your list to three contractors and schedule a time to meet them in person.At the interview, you can explain your remodeling job. The contractor should be able to tell you whether it is feasible.


Pay attention to how personable the contractor is, and whether they explain things simply to you. You will be seeing a lot of the contractor, so you want to hire someone you are comfortable with.

, You should ask a contractor to provide you with at least three references. Call up the references and ask questions. For example, be sure to ask the following:How long ago did the contractor work for them?
Was the project completed on time? Were there any cost overruns?
Were they satisfied with the work the contractor did?
Did workers clean up after themselves or was the jobsite left a mess?

, A great way to see a contractor in action is to visit a job that is currently ongoing. Ask the contractors whether you can stop in and check out how things are going.Check the neatness of the job site. Are materials in the right place or is the place a disaster zone?
Also consider how considerate the contractor is to the homeowner.You should avoid anyone who is careless with a client’s property.
If possible, you might be able to combine your interview with a visit to the job site.

, Your instinct might be to select the lowest bid. However, you should be careful. Someone with a very low bid might try to cut corners or do shoddy work.A contractor with a low bid might also not have much work. As of 2016, the home building business is strong, so there should be plenty of work to go around for a competent contractor.
Avoid choosing someone you can’t afford. Instead, look at contractors who submit reasonable bids that you are comfortable with.

, Communication is key to the contractor-client relationship. You want someone who can explain things to you in a way you understand.Avoid anyone who intimidates you or makes you feel uncomfortable.


If you feel equally comfortable with more than one contractor, then base your decision on other factors, such as their experience or price.

, You should avoid paying for the entire project before it is completed. Furthermore, your state law might limit how much you can pay upfront.Discuss a payment schedule with the contractor.


Research your state law by contacting a local consumer protection agency, which you can find in the phone book or online. Regardless of your state law, try to limit the amount of any down payment to no more than a third.
Ideally, you should not pay with cash. If the project is small, then think about paying with a credit card or personal check.Tie payment to certain benchmarks. For example, if you are having a home built, you can pay a certain amount once the foundation is laid, and another sum after the roof has been put on, etc. Using benchmarks is helpful, because the contractor doesn’t get paid if work is delayed. This provides incentive to work diligently.

, Call up the contractor you feel most comfortable with and hire them. Then make sure you have a detailed contract in place before any work begins.The contractor might draft the contract. If not, then you can hire a lawyer to draft the contract for you. If costs are a concern, then you might need to draft your own. Make sure the contract contains the following:a detailed description of the work, including a complete set of drawings with written specifications
the brand of materials that will be used or installed
the start and finish dates
the payment schedule
any guarantees
your signature and the contractor’s signature

, Don’t sign a contract and then disappear. Instead, inspect the contractor’s work by stopping in. Make sure the contractor is adhering to the schedule as spelled out in the contract.It’s also a good idea to have regular meetings with the contractor to discuss any issues that have arisen. A conscientious contractor should reach out to you, but don’t wait. Instead, call them and ask for a meeting to check in.
If you’re unhappy with anything, bring it to the contractor’s attention immediately.
If something needs to be changed, then write up a change order. Avoid unwritten agreements.

, Hold onto everything. If you don’t have a filing cabinet, then think about buying a small one. Alternately, get a giant folder you can store documents in. You’ll want to keep the following:copy of your signed contract
all correspondence between you and the contractor
proof of all payments, including receipts for tax purposes
any change orders
certificates of insurance

, Your reputation as a client is every bit as important as the contractor’s reputation is to them. You don’t want to develop a reputation of shortchanging contractors. Instead, pay according to the payment schedule.


However, you should never make a final payment unless you are satisfied with the work performed and are assured that subcontractors and suppliers have been paid.In some states, suppliers and subcontractors can come after you by putting a lien on your house if the general contractor has not paid them. Before final payment, ask every subcontractor and supplier for a lien release or waiver.

Determine if you have an employment contract.,
Read your employment contract.,
Determine whether there are any circumstances listed in the contract that allow one party to end the contract.,
Decide if there are any penalties or repercussions for ending the contract early.,
Review the term of the contract.",How to Get out of an Employment Contract1," While you may have a written employment contract in some cases, contracts can be implied in some states. For instance, if your employer has an employee handbook, it may impliedly create a contract by which you are bound, under some states' lawsIf you don't have an employment contract, you are an employee at will. This means that you can be fired for any reason or no reason, so long as that reason is not illegal. For instance, an illegal reason for firing an at-will employee could be racial discrimination.;
, You might not have read your contract fully at the time you signed it, but when you are thinking of ending your employment contract, you should definitely read it. Read the entire thing, but pay close attention to the clauses that discuss termination, cancellation, or any other section that deals with the ending of the employer-employee relationship.

, If the party wishing to end the contract early does not have a legally valid ground for terminating the contract, then the other party can sue him or her. A lawsuit can result in one party being ordered to pay the other damages, or compensation for breaking the contract.Some contracts might have a termination clause if the employee becomes disabled or otherwise physically incapable of performing the acts set forth in the employment contract.
There also may be provisions in the contract that void the contract if one party does not perform as agreed. For instance, if the employer agrees to pay the employee $500.00 when a certain act is completed, and the employer doesn't pay him, then the employee may have valid grounds to terminate the contract.
There may be a chance of early termination of the contract if the employee gives a certain amount of notice to the employer, or if he or she pays the employer a predetermined amount of money. While you might need to pay a financial penalty for early termination, paying the full amount promised in the contract may prevent the employer from suing the employee for breaking the contract.

, For example, an employment contract might require that the party who breaks the contract pay certain fees or damages. Another common provision in employment contracts is that if the contract ends prematurely, the employee might not be able to engage in the same type of business in the local area for a certain period of time. Based on the contract provisions, you will have to determine whether it is worth it—legally, financially, and professionally—to bear those repercussions.

, Some contracts contain a provision stating the effective date and termination date of the contract. If you have been working with the other party for a long time, the contract might have expired. In this case, you will no longer be bound by the terms of the contract and are free to move on..

Determine if the negotiations leading up to the contract make it void.,
Consider whether there is a legally valid reason to end the contract or that makes the contract void.,
Consult an attorney.",How to Get out of an Employment Contract2," There are certain situations in which you may be able to prove that your employment contract is void, or not enforceable. If some specific factors existed that caused you to sign the contract, then you may have grounds to legally terminate it. For instance, if your employer promised you certain benefits and then later refuses to provide you with these benefits, you may have grounds to terminate the contract.If fraud by the other party caused you to enter into the contract, you may have legal grounds for ending the contract without penalties. Fraud in negotiations makes the contract void. For example, if an employer lies to a prospective employee in order to get him or her to sign the contract, then the contract is void. If your employer told you that you would be paid $20 per hour, and, after signing the contract, he only paid you $10 per hour, then you most likely have grounds to terminate the contract.
If the parties made a mutual mistake about information that is central to the contract, then the contract is also void. Mistake might occur, for instance, if you thought you were signing an employment contract to work at a certain location, but your employer assumed that you would be working primarily from another, more remote location.
Undue influence might occur if one party is in a superior position over the other when they are negotiating a contract. This is another factor that might void the contract. This is a common occurrence when an employee is negotiating with an employer, as the employer often has a far superior bargaining position than the employee.
A contract may contain provisions that are so unreasonable that it is automatically void. This occurs when a contract is so one-sided or unfair that the agreement is void. For instance, if an employment contract requires an employee to work an unpaid one-month probationary period, the contract very well may be void.

, Some states require that contracts be in writing and be set for a definite term in order to be enforceable. A contract without these elements would be void. Furthermore, even if there is no applicable provision in the contract that allows you to terminate it, there may be other reasons that you can legally break the contract. For example, if the terms of the employment contract are overly vague or illegal in some way, then you may have grounds to legally terminate the contract.For example, contracts that are impossible to perform can be terminated. In order to be “impossible,” fulfilling the contract must not be simply difficult. The terms of the contract must be impossible to accomplish. For example, suppose that an employer contracts with an employee to work for employer’s car wash, and the car wash goes out of business. In this situation, it is impossible for an employee to work at the car wash, so the employment contract would terminate.
A breach of the employment contract may excuse one party’s performance under the contract. A breach occurs when either party fails to perform his or her duties under the contract. A typical breach in employment contract cases occurs when an employer fails to pay the employee at the time or in the amount that is stated in the contract. This type of breach not only allows the employee out of the contract, but may also give the employee cause to sue the employer for damages.
Entering into an employment contract requires both parties to treat one another fairly. This is commonly referred to as the “covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” If one party acts unfairly toward another, then he or she very well may have violated this legal duty, which can be grounds for terminating the contract. For example, if the parties have agreed that an employee should start working as a manager for a store on January 1st, but the store ultimately does not open until nine months later, the employee has a valid reason to terminate the contract. To expect the employee to go nine months without work or pay would be unfair., If you are unsure about whether you will owe the other party money, or are liable to be sued for ending the contract, you should speak with an attorney. A qualified and experienced employment attorney is the best person to give and employer advice about the consequences of breaking your employment agreement. He or she also can help you determine if there is any way for you to avoid these repercussions and still get out of the contract.

"
"
Consider whether the other party will agree to end the contract.,
Determine how much notice you owe, if any.,
Negotiate the terms of the contract.,
Use a mediator to negotiate.",How to Get out of an Employment Contract3," If you are unhappy in your current employment situation, consider that the other party to the contract may be unhappy as well. If both parties agree, they can rescind the contract and let each other out of the agreement. A mutual agreement to terminate the contract early is often the best-case scenario for getting out of an employment contract.

, Once again, you will need to go back to your contract to determine how much notice, if at all, you owe the other party before abandoning the contract. A typical timeframe is two weeks, but the required notice can vary from contract to contract. Take into account any accrued vacation time into your calculation, if applicable. Failure to give the required notice can lead to you being financially liable to the other party for breaking the contract.

, If your employer is not as eager to end the contract as you are, you may be able to negotiate terms of the contract in order to persuade the other party to allow you to end it early without negative consequences. For instance, you could agree to give your employer time to find a replacement, you could offer to stay on in order to train a new employee, or you could offer an employee a severance package. These sorts of negotiations may help end the contract on good terms for both parties.

, Sometimes, the assistance of a mediator or another neutral third party can help you negotiate the terms of ending the contract. This is much less expensive alternative to going to court and litigating your dispute. Plus, it can help you reach a mutually agreeable settlement that will end the contract in a way that you both can live with.


Most state bar associations maintain a list of mediators who are certified by the laws of that state. Contact your state bar association for more information.

Preserve bridges.",How to Get a Freelance Job," Whether you’re a writer, photographer, mathematician, web designer, marketing guru, illustrator, scientist, or underwater basket weaver, there is probably a freelance job out there for you. What do you enjoy doing? What are your strengths? Make a list of everything that you think you could possible monetize.Don’t write off any of your skills or passions. List everything that you think you’re good at, regardless if you’ve heard of freelancers doing it or not! Don’t limit yourself before you’ve started.;
, While most skills can be effectively monetized, you probably want to consider early on who needs particular skills. If you want to make freelancing your full-time job, you may want to pick a skill that you think a lot of people would be willing to pay for, or at least broaden the scope of what you are willing to do. Conduct a little research on the marketplace before you get started.For example, strong academic writers may find work easier than an expert on 15th century German footwear. Consider how many people will need what you’re selling, and decide if you can broaden your scope.

, Be ready to hit the ground running. If you are going to search for freelance writing gigs, make sure you have a reliable computer and Internet connection. If you’re a photographer, make sure you’ve got a camera. If you’re striving to be a freelance statistician, make sure you have the common software used in the field. Don’t expect to get hired if you aren’t prepared to get to work immediately.


You should be willing to invest into your business. Don’t forget the saying, “You’ve gotta spend money to make money.”

, Figure out a reasonable hourly rate. What are your competitors charging? Remember, as you gain more experience, you will be able to raise your hourly rate. Decide how many hours you want (or need) to work. Of course, once you start freelancing you will get a better idea of how quickly you work, how many hours certain projects will take, and how many projects you can realistically take on at once. However, going into this new job with a plan will help ensure that you aren’t strained for money or time as you are beginning., The best way to learn about a new industry is to talk with someone who has been a part of it for a while. You can find a mentor in various ways. You can ask family, friends, teachers, co-workers, etc. if they know anyone who freelances. You can view work online, and reaching out to someone who does something similar to what you want to do. You can find networking events in your area online. Regardless of your method, you just need to put yourself out there!A mentor can help you determine your rate, give you some pointers, and, ideally, even give you a few contacts to get started.
You need to be able to show your mentor that you’re committed to this endeavor. Make sure you have done your research and gathered your supplies before you reach out to someone.
Remember that they’re doing you a favor by helping you out. Show them gratitude and respect. Work hard to show them that you’re a worthy mentee.

, Don’t forget that as a freelancer, you are your business, and you have to sell yourself to sell your product. Think about what makes you different from the competition. Are you witty? Are you particularly efficient? Do you have an impressive educational background? Whatever desirable traits you have, use them to your advantage.Your personal brand should be clear on your résumé, your online presence, your business cards, and communications you have with potential and current clients.

, When you’re first starting out, you probably won’t have a lot of previous work to show. In order to build a portfolio or a résumé, you should savor any chance you get to show your stuff. Volunteer to do freelance work for very cheap, or even for free. This experience can help you learn as well as give you future references. Beggars can’t be choosers, and most freelancers will typically begin as beggars., Create a webpage, a LinkedIn, a Twitter, a blog, a Facebook, an Instagram, whatever! The easier you are to find, the better. When you apply for jobs and submit résumés, you can add links to your various media platforms. This allows your employers to easily check out your previous work.This is why it’s important to take all the opportunities that come your way (at first). Even if you aren’t making the big bucks when you first start out, any work and experience can be used to fluff up your online presence.

, In the freelance world, it pays to be resourceful, determined, and competitive. Just because you’ve created a website and a personal brand does not mean that employers are going to start flocking to you. Apply, apply, and apply some more to jobs. You have to go searching for jobs you want., When you're working to get your very first client, don't get discouraged. It can take a few tries! Be creative in your search and be open to all sorts of projects, because you need work to build a portfolio, gain experience, and eventually get higher paying jobs. Contact local businesses and explain how your services could benefit them. Send your cover letter and resume to websites you frequent and admire. Use Google to find job posting for the particular service you're offering— you will be shocked at how many different job boards there are for various types of freelancers.


Upwork, Toptal, Elance, iFreelance, Craigslist, Project4hire, Demand Media, and dozens of other websites post new jobs daily. Never underestimate the power of the Internet! Check these websites daily to stay on top of available jobs., When you are beginning your freelance career, the smaller, lower-paying jobs can actually be your best bet. More experienced freelancers may overlook these jobs, so you can snag them. Send the employer a personalized cover letter, and show a sincere interest in the job they are offering, no matter how small. By completing your first projects, you can get start gathering positive references as well as more material for your portfolio., It can be tempting to relax when you are discouraged or between jobs, but this is a time to show off what you can do. Create things for your website, attend networking events, do pro bono work around your community, do anything! Just keep producing content, seeking clients, and marketing yourself. When you rest on your laurels, you may be missing potential clients or letting your skills get rusty.

, Working freelance jobs gives you the luxury of setting your own hours, but it can also become dangerously easy to procrastinate. Try to outline a schedule and stick to it! The good thing is that you can design a schedule tailored to your personal work style. Whether you work best in one hour increments with frequent breaks, or if you work best by sitting at a desk for ten hours straight and pounding out a project, you should still make a plan.Make sure you consider time that will be spent receiving feedback from the employer and making necessary edits.
It can be hard sticking to a schedule when you are your own boss, but it is even harder scrambling to finish a project with an impending deadline. Effectively managing your own time will help you produce quality results, which in turn will lead to more jobs.

, Freelancers typically work for many different employers, which means they constantly tweaking their style to fit a new job’s requirement. With that process comes some growing pains. When an employer gives you feedback, nod your head and take the feedback. They have hired you to complete a task as they see fit, so what they say goes., When you are self-employed, it is crucial to network successfully and have excellent references. No matter what, don’t burn bridges! While a perk of freelancing is that you are your own boss, you are also the face of your whole company. It will be hard to sell your work if you can’t sell yourself, and it will be difficult to sell yourself if you have a poor employment history.Keeping your employers happy will help keep work coming your way.

Issue invoices for all work completed.,
Put all the necessary information on the invoice from the outset.,
Keep a calendar reminder of the due date.,
Be persistent.,
Seek legal advice and recourse.",How to Get Paid on Time when Freelancing," Invoices serve as a record of services performed. There is less recourse to following up complaints if you haven't kept a clear paper trail. Treat invoices in the same manner as a contract; their existence is a formal indicator of work performed and payment promised.;
, Sometimes payment will be held up due to missing information. To avoid this problem, ensure that the following basic elements are clearly outlined as part of the invoice:


Description of the services provided
Cost and method of calculating (hourly, for total or stage of project, additional expenses, etc.)
Detail any permissible additional expenses clearly, such as long distance phone calls, plane travel, etc.
Date and your address and contact details
Tax if relevant
An identifier for your record-keeping system
Your payment terms

, If the invoice has not been paid on time, send a reminder notice or telephone and politely request information about the progress of payment. Calling is useful because it lets people know you are onto the matter and it also helps you to work out whether it's an oversight, or what the delays might be. Try to reach a solution together as to payment if needed. If the client is having temporary cash flow problems, or is out of town, or has misplaced the invoice, these issues can usually be worked through.

, The day after payment is overdue, send a reminder letter to the accounts division or payment officer, advising the client that they have missed the payment date. This lets them know that you have noticed. Over the upcoming week or two, continue to contact the client's office by phone, requesting payment of the invoice and highlighting your terms of payment. Remain calm and polite but be firm. Firm politeness keeps relationships alive and most clients will soon realize that you are on the ball and they won't pay late again. If you're still not getting anywhere and you're not prepared to compromise despite having discussed things with the client, proceed to the next step.

, If you cannot obtain the money owed to you despite trying, it is probably time to seek redress. You can start with a debt collection agency and if your have no luck there, commence proceedings through the courts. Use a lawyer to assist you (it is really useful to have established a good working relationship with a lawyer as part of your freelance business for just such events). You will need to identify the costs involved and whether going to court will be beneficial. Many jurisdictions provide very affordable small claims court services to assist businesses, so it pays to look into it.

Define your business model.,
Focus on a tight niche.,
Select the most powerful marketing tactics.,
Create marketing messages that resonate with your clients.,
Nurture relationships.,
Sell like a consultant.,
Enhance client relationships.",How to Get Clients for Consultants," You must have clear, measurable goals for your business. What revenue/income do you want to earn? What type of work do you want to do? What work-life balance are you're looking for? What geographic restrictions do you have? These parameters will shape the type of marketing and selling you will need to do to get clients for your consulting business. For example, project-based consultants tend to focus on working intensively with a small number of clients, whereas coaches tend to need a large number of clients they spend only a few hours a month with.;
, Unless you're a very large firm, you must focus your efforts on a clearly defined niche where you can build your reputation and credibility. This could be by specialising in a particular client sector (pharmaceuticals, local government, etc.), or a particular function or solution (supply chain, leadership, marketing). It could be a combination of both such as supply chain consulting for pharmaceutical companies. By defining your niche tightly you build up your expertise, become more attractive to clients, and differentiate yourself from generic competitors.

, The best tactics to use will depend on your client niche. Start by identifying where your target clients 'hang out'. Are there networking or industry groups they attend. How about online forums? Who do you know that can refer you to them? Would they search for solutions to their problems online? Generally speaking, the best tactics are those that involve face-to-face interaction - and allow you to identify their problems which you might be able to help with, demonstrate your credibility and build your relationship with them.

, Whenever you introduce yourself to clients or referrers - either face to face or in writing, you need to focus on what's important to them. Marketing that dwells on your credentials, your years of experience and the awards you've won won't be of much interest. Messages that focus on the client problems you can help with and give example stories of people you've helped and the benefits they've seen will be.

, Not everyone is ready to buy the first time you meet them. In fact 80% of the people you meet won't be ready to buy right now. But 90% of them will buy your type of service in the next 2 years. So you need to be top of mind when the right time arises. You do this by keeping in touch and adding value over time. Send them articles, introduce them to useful people you know, invite them to events. Keep investing in the relationship so that when they do get a need you can help with, you're the first person they turn to.

, Selling for consultants is not about fast talking and manipulating clients into buying. It's about starting the consulting process before you're officially hired. Clients buy when they believe you fully understand their problems, you have the capabilities to help them, and the problem is worth solving. By structuring sales meeting so that you're questioning them about their issues and root cause and exploring the business case for solving them, you're positioning your expertise far better than any clever sales pitch could.

, Of course, your best prospects for new business are your existing and previous clients. But it's so easy to get out of touch with old clients when you're focused on doing a great job for a new one. Make sure you're devoting enough time to keep nurturing the relationship and to keep your eyes and ears out for new opportunities.

During the interview stage, you might ask who the client has worked with before. Then call those people up.;
, Type the person’s name into Google and see what comes up. Another freelancer might have complained about working with this person.If the client is a business, you can check with the Better Business Bureau for the city where they are located. Look for complaints.
Realize that anyone can complain anonymously online, so take complaints with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, look for patterns. Have multiple people complained that the client doesn’t pay their bill on time? If so, there’s probably a problem.

, A client with a website that looks like it was created in the 1990s probably doesn’t have a lot of money. Check how long they have been in business. A more established company is probably a safer bet to do business with., You shouldn’t hide how much you charge. Instead, discuss your rates early in the interview process. You won’t know what to charge until you understand what the potential client wants, so ask questions about the scope of the project and its deadline.If your rates are inflexible, then put them on a spreadsheet and give it to the potential client to look over. They should know ahead of time whether they can afford you.

, There are some tell-tale signs that a prospective client might be someone who flakes out and never pays you. Pay attention to the following:The client doesn’t know what they want. You are courting disaster if you agree to work for this person. Chances are they’ll change what they want midstream, thus doubling your amount of work.
The client is disorganized. You might ask for some information before agreeing to work for them. If they never give it to you, or if it is disorganized, then steer clear.
The client is rude. You’re essentially a stranger at this point, and someone who is rude to strangers will not make a good client.
The client objects to your rates. You should charge what you are worth and be prepared to justify your rate. If the client objects, then don’t work with them.

, When rejecting someone, you don’t want to burn any bridges. It’s possible that the client might become more reputable in the future and be someone you want to work with. Accordingly, do the following:Decline with kindness. Thank someone for thinking of hiring you, but say you are too busy right now or that you don’t think you’re a good fit.
Offer alternatives. Recommend the person to a different freelancer, or suggest ways the client can do the job themselves.
Refuse to negotiate. A client might try to get you to work for them by haggling. Stay firm and politely decline.

, You should use contracts with all clients, which will legally protect you. If the client breaks the contract, then you can sue. Search online to find a sample contract in your industry.


You can also hire a lawyer to draft a contract template for you.You can use this contract over and over.

, Draft your own contract by opening a blank word processing document and setting the font to something legible, such as Times New Roman 12 point. At the top of the page, include the title: “Independent Contractor Agreement.”


Identify the parties at the beginning of the contract.For example, you can write, “This Independent Contractor Agreement (‘Agreement’) is made between James Jones (‘Contractor’) and Elizabeth Smith (‘Client’), who agree as follows…”
If the client is a business, then include the business name, not the name of the person signing the contract on the business’ behalf.

, This is the heart of the contract. Describe the scope of the work you will perform so that the client understands what they are paying for. Provide as much detail as necessary, but you don’t have to be too detailed.


One option is to include a list of detailed services in an attachment. In the contract itself, you can simply write, “See Attachment A for a full description of services.”
Be sure to identify the work that you won’t be doing.For example, if you’ve been hired as a wedding photographer, you should clarify that you won’t provide make-up services.

, Explain how much you charge and when the client needs to pay. Also explain when payment is late and whether you will assess a late fee or interest.For example, you can write, “Client shall pay Contractor $20 an hour, due within 30 days of the invoice date. If Client is more than 10 days late with payment, a $25 late fee will be assessed.”

, If you’re doing a large project for a client, then you should identify the schedule and important benchmarks. This lets your client know when they can expect certain work to be finished.


For example, if you are ghostwriting a book of 100,000 words, you can state that the first 30,000 words will be delivered after one month, the next 30,000 after the second month, and the remainder after three months.
Remember to clarify how the client is supposed to approve of the work or suggest changes. For example, you might give the client a week to review your work and then submit changes in writing.

, Either you or your client might want to end the relationship early. You should explain how the contract can be terminated and the grounds for doing so. Specify how the client is responsible for making payments after they cancel.


For example, you can write: “Client may cancel at any time for any reason. Cancellation must be in writing. Client is responsible for payment for all work performed on the project up to the date cancellation is received. If Client cancels the project after its completion, Client must make full payment.”, Your client might not want you talking to anyone about the work that you do. For example, you might be working with confidential information that is valuable. The confidentiality clause should identify the confidential information and explain how long the confidentiality must be kept.For example, you can write, “Contractor acknowledges she may receive information relating to Client’s products, creative works, business strategies, vendor lists, and other proprietary information which gives Client an advantage. Contractor agrees to protect the confidentiality of this Confidential Information for three years. Contractor agrees not to share this Confidential Information with third parties or to use the Confidential Information for her own benefit.”, Look at your sample contract. It probably has standard provisions (called “boilerplate”) that appear in all contracts. Insert them in your own contract:


Choice of law. If you go to court, the judge will need to apply some state’s law. You can choose.Dispute resolution. You might want to avoid going to court. If so, you can choose mediation or arbitration.
Merger. State that the contract contains the entirety of your agreement. This keeps the client from claiming you had an oral side agreement.
Severability. If a judge finds one portion of the contract illegal, they could strike down the entire contract. You can prevent that with a severability clause.

, The contract is only valid if everyone signs and dates it. Keep the original for your records and give the client a copy.

, You can’t get paid unless you can bill accurately. Accordingly, you need to keep detailed records about the work you do. For example, you can create a spreadsheet and note all of the time you spend on a project., The easiest way to ensure payment is to require clients to pay upfront.For example, you might be hired to create an eBook cover for a writer. You can demand that the client pay a certain percentage upfront before you begin working.


It’s up to you to set how much the client must pay. Some freelancers require that 100% be paid upfront. However, others charge 30%.
Even if you feel uncomfortable asking for money upfront, you still need to do it with new clients.Once you establish a business relationship with someone, you can reduce or eliminate the down payment.

, You need to develop a system that allows you to invoice promptly. For example, it’s better to invoice directly after you finish a job than to invoice only at the end of the month.As a compromise, you might want to bill once a week.


Your invoice should contain all important information: your name and contact information, the project name, reference number, and payment amounts.
Invest in invoicing software so that your billing is automated, which can speed up the invoicing process. Popular invoicing software includes Freshbooks and Quickbooks Online.If costs are a concern, you can use Microsoft Office, which has an invoice template.

, Create incentives for a client to pay early. For example, you can offer a discount of 5-10%.This might induce prompt payment.

, The more options you give clients to pay, the more likely they will. For example, you should certainly look into accepting credit card payments. If a client is short on funds, they can use their credit card.


PayPal offers merchant accounts that make accepting credit cards easy.You can insert the PayPal shopping cart on your website.

, Sometimes invoices get lost in the mail, so a client who doesn’t immediately pay isn’t necessarily trying to stiff you. However, you need to gently remind them that payment is due by sending a follow-up letter.


If they don’t respond to your follow up, you can send another letter explaining they are late and that you might need to take legal action.
You should also stop working for these clients until they pay you., You don’t have all day to chase clients for payments. Eventually, you might need to hire a debt collection agency who can hound the client for payment. Make sure the bill is sufficiently large. Debt collectors typically charge a percentage of the debt, and they might not work for small unpaid sums slide.


You can find a debt collector by checking the member listings for the Commercial Collection Agency Association.
Look for collection agencies certified by the Better Business Bureau."

Decide on your craft.,
Create a brand.,
Build a portfolio showcasing your work.,
Develop business-savvy skills.,
Set up an invoicing system.,
Get paying clients.",How to Earn Money As a Freelancer1," Decide what type of freelance work you are committed to doing. Freelancing jobs are as broad as the work force, and you need identify what it is you want to do before you can begin to do it. View your skills as valuable resources that are worth charging and receiving pay for.Reflect on what you're good at. Just about every type of skill can be turned into a freelancing opportunity. Keep in mind that you're ""secondary"" skills, like researching and writing, for example, can be just as useful as a specific set of skills unique to a profession (e.g., graphic designer or computer programming). If you know you're a strong writer, then you could develop a freelance writing business.
It's very easy to believe that you don't have the necessary skills or experience, but in fact you actually need very little experience in order to get started freelancing. Instead, believe in your abilities and focus on producing good work.;
, To get your freelancing operation off the ground and becoming profitable, you need to think about how you will market yourself and your products/work. This is called branding. You need to create a brand for your what you're selling and how it sets you apart from the competition - this is your ""identity and includes your website, logo, tagline, blog, and social media accounts, among other aspects.


Your brand should clearly communicate what you do that is special and what you offer that is worth buying. Try to narrow your focus to a specific industry. For example, if you decide you want to do freelance writing, you might only decide to write for online travel sites and business and thus be a freelance travel writer. Or you might decide you want to write for business and corporate websites. Specializing within the field (in this case, the very broad field of writing) will make you more attractive to potential clients because it shows you have a particular rather than a generic set of skills, also known as a niche.However, don't let the brand be your primary focus. You could have a huge Instagram or Twitter following, but that doesn't really pay the bills. Don't worry about followers or retweets, and instead focusing on producing quality work. That's the ultimate way to build your freelancing business and earn money., A lot of potential clients are less interested in your specific qualifications than in a demonstrated ability to do the job. They want to see samples of your work and decide whether you're a good fit for their particular project. So building a strong portfolio of your work (samples as well as past projects) is key to building your business and in fact, you shouldn't launch your freelancing business until you have this portfolio. Include as well testimonials of people and organizations who you've worked with. Reading glowing reviews will help boost your profile among prospective clients.Generating submissions for your portfolio takes time and resources. If you have no paid assignments or previous work to put in a portfolio, create some by offering your services pro bono or taking your free time to produce some.Remember that more is not always better. Although volume can be good and help with self-promotion, it's also important to try to incorporate some bigger and higher profile jobs, rather than just building a portfolio full of the smallest and least lucrative projects. If you want to make big money by working with high-paying clients, then you need to show those clients that you can produce the kind of work they're looking for. Again, consider offering pro bono when you're first starting out.Don't launch your freelancing career until you've actually created the products or provided the services you plan to sell. Having the portfolio shows clients that you've actually done what you're telling them you can do., You may be a freelancer, but you also need to be a business man or woman. To successfully earn money as a freelancer and turn it into a career, you need to become familiar with the basics of operating a business, like taxes, bookkeeping, marketing, etc. In many cases, these business basics will take more time than the actual freelance service or product you offer!Consider talking to friends (in real life or online) who've earned money freelancing about the business ins and outs. You could also consult a number of books and online sites about how to start up a business from the ground.
Although it might seem premature to worry about the ""business"" of your freelance work, having a business model with goals, deliverables, benchmarks, and so on can help you determine the scope and scale of your freelancing operation. A clear business model, and transparent accounts and books, will also show clients that you're the real deal - a professional freelancer and not just someone working in their pajamas at home.

, Part of doing freelancing as a way to earn real money means setting up a system for charging and receiving payment. Before you reach out to potential clients and start actually doing the freelancing work, be ready for it. It's a lot easier to keep up with accounting and invoicing along the way, rather than leaving it until later on or even until the dreaded tax season. Create a financial framework that will make it easy for you to keep organized financial money. Doing this will also help you track how much money you're earning and whether you're making a profit.Consider doing the following:


Set prices for the services or products you offer. Figure out if you charge an hourly rate or per piece/product. Be ready to explain how you charge for what you're offering (i.e., the breakdown).
Create invoice templates. Using a word-processing tool (like Microsoft Excel, for example), design an invoice that has all of the important information (service rendered, cost, payment, addresses of the payee and payer, etc.).
Establish an accounting plan and consider opening up a business bank account. Often banks have special services and fees for business bank accounts.
Look into how much you should be charging and setting aside for taxes.

, Once you have a portfolio, it's time to get out there and start pitching to clients. Freelancing successfully is a numbers game — the more potential clients you locate and reach out, the more likely you are to get work and, most importantly, get paid.You can begin by tapping into your personal network of family, friends, and old coworkers. Ask them for referrals; this can help bring in some startup work that can get your freelancing operation off the ground. However, you'll also need to make the first move and branch out in a lot of cases in order to earn good money. When pitching your product or services to new clients, pitch only to those clients who are relevant. And pitch to a lot of them.


Try the 10-before-10 rule; pitch to 10 potential clients before 10 in the morning during the work week.If you're still working other jobs, set aside some of your free time to starting building up a client network that you can draw on in the future.
You should know who your target clients are if you've branded yourself properly. Remember that businesses want to work with freelancers who seem like their services/products were designed just for the needs of those businesses. The concept of specialization, mentioned above, creates this sense.You could also try using a freelance market. There are several online freelance marketplaces like Elance and oDesk, where you can offer your services and look up and pitch to clients. These can be very useful for freelancers just starting out."

Have a vision.,
Take time to enter into freelancing.,
Be ready for slow periods.,
Be prepared to hold yourself accountable.,
Be ready to talk about yourself a lot.,
Cope effectively with being alone.",How to Earn Money As a Freelancer2," Know what you want and go for it! The biggest obstacle to freelancing is overcoming that mental blockage that says ""You can't do it and you shouldn't."" To overcome that feeling, show yourself that it freelancing isn't just something you want to do because you want to work from home, but a business plan. This isn't just a fantastical idea, but a business reality.One useful way to start seeing freelancing as a viable option is to being the process of legitimizing it. Come up with a name for your business and a logo or font-type. Once you start creating the vision, it becomes easier to realize that this a real business you're launching. Start the process by establishing a business name and creating a vision for your company brand.

, Don't jump right in and hedge all your bets on freelancing right away. Freelancing can be a great way to earn money, but it can also take a considerable amount of time to build up. Make sure that you are 100% committed to investing your time and effort into freelancing before you decide to quite your other job(s).Keep in mind that a lot of the steps in Part 1 can be undertaken while you are still working at your day job. Focus on setting the ground plan for freelancing while still earning a stable income and you'll feel more confident and comfortable taking the leap.

, In every business, there are slow periods. This will happen for your freelancing operation as well. You'll probably get stressed and think the whole thing is a flop but know that all industries always go through ebbs and flows. Also know that eventually, business will pick back up.


Make sure to plan for slow periods, whether that meanings changing prices or having a savings plan.
The more you freelance, you'll be able to identify trends and peak and slow periods. Ultimately, you'll be able to anticipate when things slow for you and you'll stop getting worried because this will be routine.and you can start to expect the drought and prepare. But it takes a while to get there.

, Since as a freelancer, you are your own boss, you need to make sure that you're doing what you need to do. While most people get excited at the prospect of not having a boss looking over their shoulders, it's also important to remember that bosses keep you motivated and give you feedback on your progress. Without a boss, you'll need to do this yourself most of the time.Engage in daily and weekly reflection about the work you've done to make sur you're hitting your targets. If you're not, then you need to have a serious look at your work habits and system.
Other people - such as editors or mentors if you're a freelance writer, for example - can also help provide accountability. At the end of the day, however you're the boss so be the boss.

, As a freelancer, especially a newly minted one, you'll have to talk about yourself, what you do and what you've done A LOT. You are your own marketer. Opportunities can come from surprising and unexpected places, so it's important that you have a ready pitch of a few sentences about yourself and your freelancing services or products that you can use whether you're at a holiday party or business fair. If you're a private person by nature, try writing down and practicing the pitch until it becomes natural. Over time, you'll get better at talking about yourself and doing self promotion. A little bit of hustling is essential to success in the freelancing world.Make sure to get business cards made so you can hand them out whenever you bump into someone and start chatting. These are an old - but still relevant - way to get your name out there.

, The lack of social interaction and communication of the office environment can make freelancers feel lonely and isolated.While you'll need to learn how to stay goal-directed and on task without the motivation of others, you should also take care to prevent loneliness from taking root. Try working in different spaces a day or two a week; take your computer to a local coffee shop and work there. Even just hearing the buzz of social interaction can make you feel less alone. You could also meet up with other freelancers for lunch or coffee to discuss problems, concerns, and other topics. There are a number of local business networking groups that can help connect people who work for themselves and usually remotely.There are also little things you can do to relieve feelings of isolation. Call someone, instead of sending an email, for example."

Utilize team building strategies.,
Provide professional coaching as necessary.",How to Develop a Consultant Team," Part of building your consultant team is having meetings to help everyone understand the goals and objectives of the business. This includes customer-focused goals, as well as technical objectives for the business.


Help the team to understand where the focus is in terms of engineering and specific consulting services. The more knowledgeable your staff members are in certain key areas, the better they can serve clients.
Identify team goals for customer rapport and proactive relationship building. Allow your team to brainstorm these strategies and get everyone on the same page regarding how your business will interact with its customer base positively to increase productivity and rapport with clientele.;
, Another way to develop the individuals on your team of consultants is to offer relevant, accessible continuing education in the fields in which these individuals work. With such education, they'll possess the most current knowledge on practices in their fields.

, Another part of developing your team of staffers is to encourage interpersonal cooperation among them. Team building has become a popular management technique that helps boost the operation of a staff or crew by promoting good interpersonal relationships.


Allow room for team building in staff meetings. Provide balanced, dignified and relevant activities that will help build natural relationships without pushing team building on your workers. Excessive team building can be a real negative for a business, but reasonable team building efforts can pay out.

, Many consultants may not feel that they need professional coaching, but others might welcome this sort of advanced training to help them reach out to customers and provide their consulting services in the field.

Pay attention to spelling and grammar.",How to Create a Consulting Proposal," A consulting proposal isn't like a resume — it's not a good idea to just send yours out to as many recipients as possible to drum up business. Each proposal should be tailored specifically to the client you're trying to get. The more knowledgeable you are about the client and his or her needs, the better you can write your proposal, so your first step should always be to educate yourself.There are many ways you might do this:


The best and most direct is simply to meet with the client and discuss the proposed job. Take careful notes and ask lots of specific questions so you understand precisely what the work entails.
After this, you can follow up with phone calls and emails to clarify any lingering questions.
As you write the proposal (see below), it may be useful to do a little independent research as. For example, if you're trying to prove why your services will help your client succeed, finding business surveys that support your point is a good idea.;
, You don't want to sign on to work as a consultant only to have your client pressure into doing work you didn't agree to. Having a very clear picture of what the client expects from you is important — this way, you can word your proposal so that your work will be limited only to what has been agreed upon. Things to note include:


Your precise duties and the result the client hopes to achieve
The time frame for your work
Specific milestones that need to be reached by certain dates
Sometimes, you may need to speak to multiple people. For example, if you are hoping to consult about a dispute between management and employees, it would be wise to speak to representatives of both parties as well as the hiring client.

, This is perhaps the most important piece of information of all. If the client isn't willing to pay you what you think the work is worth, you don't even need to bother writing the proposal. Have an agreement with the client about how much (as well as how often) you will be paid before you start writing. This way, you can refer to the agreed-upon payment in your proposal, which the client will need to sign and agree to to hire you.


In addition to the fee for your services, you also want to come to an agreement with the client about secondary costs that you may have while working (e.g., gasoline, supplies, travel, etc.). It's in your best interest to get the client to agree to compensate you for these things.
Do not write a consulting proposal if the client seems uncertain about how much you will be paid (or when).

, Lots of consultant resources will offer advice along the lines of, ""It's easier to write a confirmation of services than a proposal of services.""Keep in mind that a consulting proposal is just that: a proposal that doesn't guarantee you any work. It's perfectly possible for a client to solicit proposals from many different consultants and pick just one, so if you can, try to get the client to agree to hire you before you even write the proposal. This way, when you send it, the client will just be confirming that you can start working — not deciding whether or not you can.

, Start your proposal like you would start a letter: with a short paragraph summing up that you want to do the work for the client and that you are the best candidate for the job (you'll get to the specifics later). Here, it's OK to be somewhat ""warm"" and personal in your tone, though you should always stay professional.Mention the client by name. If you're on friendly names, first names are fine. Otherwise, use ""Mr."" or ""Mrs."" You're trying to show the client that this proposal is specifically tailored to him or her.
See our sample documents below for specific examples of what's needed in each proposal.

, Draw from the discussions you have already had regarding the job to show your client, in a few sentences, that you know what you need to do. Show that you understand the problem that needs solving, the duties the client expects you to perform, and the scope of your work (one-time gig, long-term, etc.).Be specific about the job here, but don't dwell on precise details like money, hours, and so on - you'll get to this later.

, Here, you're trying to sell yourself as the best possible person for the job. Draw attention to things like your training, your experience, and jobs you've done in the past that have gotten positive feedback. You can also reference your attitude and values, though these should take a back seat to more concrete qualifications.


Remember that you may be in competition with other consultants. Try to paint a picture of how you will provide a measurable benefit to the client in terms of money or time saved. This way, you can give yourself an edge over a competitor with similar or better qualifications who doesn't articulate this as well.

, List, using strict terminology and specific details, what you will do to solve the client's problem. Pinpoint the exact results the client will see from you consultation. Be specific regarding your methods and time frame here.


To avoid problems later, it's also wise to describe what you expect from the client during your work with regards to personnel, access to work sites, and equipment. For example, name people that you expect to work with full-time, list the sectors that you will have access to, etc., As a consultant, you want to avoid the problem of ""mission creep"" — gradually having your responsibilities grow without receiving any extra compensation.Isolate the problem you will be addressing and indicate very clearly that related issues are not included in this proposal.


A good way to present this is in a bulleted list — this makes it very hard for the client to miss the relevant information.

, This depends on what you are doing and who your client is. Remember that you may be competing against other consultants, so try to keep your rate competitive for your industry and your situation.


You will also want to describe any extra costs, such as meals, hotel rooms, transportation, etc., that the prospective client will have to pay for you. Having an approval process in place is a good idea (for example, you may specify that you will present your receipts at the end of every month). This makes it harder for the client to refuse paying you with the reasoning that ""they never agreed to pay this much.""

, Like in an academic essay, the goal of the concluding paragraph is to offer a quick, succinct summary of the rest of the proposal was about. Reiterate your fitness for the job, your preparations for the consultation, and your confidence in attaining results. Here, as in the opening paragraph, you can be a little more ""warm"" and refer to the client by name.When you're finished, sign and date the proposal, leaving a space for the client's signature.

, Keep your proposal as short as it needs to be to accurately describe yourself and the job. Quality is your goal here, not quantity. Any excuse the client has to stop reading your proposal and pick up another consultant's is something you want to prevent, so make your proposal a quick read.


For most jobs, two pages is a fine proposal length. If you refer to lengthy datasets in your proposal, attach them in appendices to keep the length of the actual proposal down., While you'll always want to devote some space to your qualifications, the most important person in the proposal isn't you — it's your client. Even when you're talking about yourself, frame your discussion in terms of how well you meet the client's needs (not how great you are).Avoid lengthy discussions of your work history (or your firm's, if you're not an independent consultant).

, Many clients (corporate clients especially) spend all day hearing empty, meaningless phrases parroted by people trying to sound important. Spare them this unnecessary tedium. Instead, write your proposal with clear, succinct language. Don't try to make your promises sound more exciting than they are with flashy jargon. Instead, just make exciting promises.


Examples of buzzwords include things like ""best practices,"" ""synergy,"" ""disruptive,"" ""optimized,"" and more — each industry has its own. These words have effectively lost any power they once had from overuse and vague application.

, This may seem nit-picky, but it's essential. Even if you're not consulting for a position that requires any writing, clean, professional communication shows that you've taken the time and energy to present your best self. Mistakes don't mean you're less-qualified for the job, but they do mean that you didn't pay enough attention to get your proposal exactly right. In a tight competition between two consultants, this may be the deciding factor.


After you finish your proposal, be sure to go over it a second time, editing for grammar and fluency. If you have time, let a friend or family member edit it as well — they're more likely to see mistakes you've missed since they weren't actually involved in writing it.

Begin your research by asking around trusted friends, families and neighbours. A personal recommendation from somebody you trust is perhaps the best review you can get.


Somebody who has first-hand experience of the contractor will be able to give you a clear account of their work and any problems that might have occurred.
You may also consider asking local professionals in the industry, such as the manager of your local hardware store.;
, If you are able to talk to people with experience of using particular contractors, it can be helpful to focus your questions to get the best picture of the contractor’s work. Ask if the contractor maintained open and clear communication throughout the project. Did they answer all questions satisfactorily? You want to make sure that you will be kept up to date with everything that is happening, and your contractors will listen to you.


You should also ask about punctuality and reliability, as well as questioning whether the project was finished on time and on budget.
Finally, ask if the person who hired the contractor was satisfied with the work done, and whether or not he would recommend the contractor to you., Even if you get a glowing review from a friend, you should always try to build up a shortlist of at least three different contractors who you can then approach and discuss the project with. You will be able to find plenty of local contractors through personal recommendations, online listings, and adverts., Before you contact any of the contractors on your list, take some time to look up online reviews. Anybody can leave a review online, and you should be aware that it may not give you the full story. Try to find more than one review to help you build up a more detailed picture of the contractor’s record.You should check with organisations such as the Better Business Bureau, who are an independent company that track complaints made against all kinds of businesses.You may have to critically judge reviews that are overwhelmingly positive or negative., Once you have a shortlist, be sure to make time to meet up with each contractor in person and talk through the job in detail. You shouldn’t be charged for this, and it gives you the opportunity to ask questions. If the contractor is reluctant to meet you, this could indicate that they are unreliable or untrustworthy.


Ask for a detailed estimate about the cost and time-frame for the job, and get details of the business including the address.
Ask for a fully itemised estimate for the work so you can better compare costs and prices across contractors.Ensure that they are fully licensed and able to work in your state.

, When you are in contact with the potential contractors, it’s a good idea to know some things to watch out for that can signal a dubious person or business. If the contractor pressures you to make a decision about whether or not you hire them quickly, you should be wary. The contractor should not request that you obtain any building permits yourself, and should not ask for a cash payment. Other red flags to watch out for include:


If you are quoted a final price before the contractor has seen the full extent of the work.
They only offer lifetime warranties which expire when their company ceases to exist.
You are asked for a large down payment to purchase materials.
You are offered a discount for an on-the-spot hiring decision.
The contractors only provide a PO Box, rather than a full business address.
You are requested to pay the complete amount upfront., When you decide on who to hire, it’s crucial that the agreements you make are as clear and complete as possible. These are the documents that will shape how the work progresses. You will need to refer back to them from time-to-time, and especially if there are any problems.


Try to avoid any allowances in the contracts where a particular fitting or cost is left undetermined because you haven’t gotten round to it yet.
For example, if you getting a new bathroom but haven’t decided on the tiling, the allowance will be an estimate that could be well below the actual cost.These uncertainties at the start can lead to disagreements and disputes later on in the project.

, Having good communication between you and the contractor can help deal with any potential problems before they escalate.Try to agree a schedule to meet or speak daily with the contractor so you are fully apprised of the situation. You could arrange to have a quick chat each morning when he arrives, or evening before he leaves. If you can’t get to the site, arrange for a daily phone call.You should try and strike a balance whereby you are not permanently hovering around his shoulder, but you are updated daily.
Showing that you are fully invested in the work and have a clear vision will help keep your contractor on his toes.

, While you may completely trust your contractor to do a great job, it’s advisable to take time to check the work yourself every day and record what you find. By doing this you are not just checking the quality of the work, but you will also be able to keep track of the overall progress and identify any issues before they escalate.


You should check model numbers on appliances to ensure that they match up with those on the receipts.
Check the position of windows and electrical fittings with the blueprints and plans.Don’t be hesitant to point out a problem if you encounter one, mistakes can happen.
Keeping a project journal is a good way to track the work and keep all your notes in one place., Once the project is in full-swing, it is always possible that something unforeseen can occur which causes the plans to change. It is important that you fully record and document any changes to your agreements and plans in writing, and keep this updated and signed by all parties throughout.Verbal agreements are worthless if there is a dispute about the final bill.
Written agreements protect both you and the contractor, so there should be no problem., If you have concerns about the work or conduct of your contractors, you should try to discuss it in private with the foreman or boss as soon as possible. Set up a private meeting, and don’t raise a problem loudly in front of a group of people. Be professional and create a situation where you can discuss the issue privately and calmly.


Disagreements can arise, but remember that you hired the contractor to do a specific job.
If all the building codes, safety and contract guidelines are being met, you have the final say.You could say ""I'm a bit concerned that some of the work doesn't reflect the original plans.""
You might say ""Can you reassure me that the work will be completed by the time we originally agreed on?""

, If the problem is not resolved in the meeting you should follow it up with a formal letter that is signed and dated. Clearly outline the problem and state how the contractor’s work is not in compliance with the original signed contract. Having a clear paper trail is useful if the issue is not resolved and you need to take it further.Request a return receipt for the letter so you can prove that it was received by the contractor.The letter could state that ""you agreed to undertake work according to the contract, but as of yet have failed to do so.""
Try to be as specific as possible so there is no room for doubt.

, If the letter is not satisfactorily dealt with and the contractor seems unconcerned by the problem, you should consider seeking legal advice. You can have a free consultation with an attorney where you can explain the situation. You may then hire the attorney to write a letter to the contractor to advise them that they are in breach of contract.If the foreman you have been working with is a member of staff at a larger company, it might be appropriate to address the letter to somebody more senior.
If the contractor has taken money from you for supplies, the work has not been done, and the contractor does not respond to your attempts to contact him, call the police.Be aware that if you pursue the case, the cost of hiring an attorney could be larger than the amount of money you recover., Another way to lodge a complaint against a contractor is by contacting an official consumer protection body.Look for your local consumer protection services online, and check to see if your area has a Local Builders Association that may be able to help.Other consumer protection groups to contact include:


The Federal Trade Commission (FTC).The National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators (NACAA)."

Articulate how your contractor will work with your company on a project. Reiterate that the contractor will provide deliverables completely independently of direct supervision. A true independent contractor controls when and how project deliverables arrive at the client's office.
Remind the contractor in writing that he is not a paid employee nor is he entitled to benefits given to employees.;
, This helps clarify any potential misunderstandings about what is expected from the independent contractor.

, Describe the total pay for the job and when you will pay for the work.


Include a clause about project costs. State that the contractor will not earn more than the fee approved for your specific project. Remind the contractor that any amounts in excess of this fee must receive management approval before work begins.
Set up payment terms. Tell the contractor when and how much you will pay for completed work. For example, some companies will pay 50 percent down before the project begins, then pay the balance due after management approval when the project is over.

, Indicate when the work begins and when you expect it to end.

, Outline how project disputes between the independent contractor and the company will be resolved.

Keep track of how many hours you've worked.,
Calculate your income.,
Divide your income by your hours.",How to Calculate Your Hourly Rate1," For this to be helpful, you'll need to decide what your pay period is. You can figure out your hourly rate based on an annual income, for a more accurate figure, or you find your hourly rate for a specific job or time period.


For example, if you get paid by the job or project, you may just want to keep track of the hours for that project to determine your hourly rate for that job. Or you can determine your hourly rate for a shorter period of time, such as a month or a few weeks.;
, Keep track of your paychecks. Be sure to use the same pay period that you selected to figure up hours. Again, this could be for a single project or several paychecks.


You can choose whether or not to include taxes in your calculations. Note that if you don't include taxes, your hourly rate will appear higher.

, This will give you your hourly rate, based on the project or time period you selected.


Income / Hours = Hourly Rate
Example: $15,000 / 2114 = $7.10 per hour
You can check your results against this salary converter, which also allows you to correct for several different variables.

"
"
Calculate your yearly income.,
Calculate how many hours you work in one year.,
Calculate your hourly wage.",How to Calculate Your Hourly Rate2," Many people may already know their yearly salary, but in the event that you don’t, check your most recent pay stub. Use your gross (not net) pay—that is your amount before taxes—and multiply the number by the number of pay periods in a year.


For those on a bi-weekly schedule, you would multiply the number by 26.
For those whose companies offer two scheduled paydays per month, such as the 15th and 30th/31st, you will only multiply the number by 24.

, For a quick rule of thumb, you can use a standard formula such as:


7.5 hours per day x 5 days per week x 52 weeks per year = 1,950 hours worked per year.
8.0 hours per day x 5 days per week x 52 weeks per year = 2,080 hours worked per year.

, Once you have these two numbers, you can divide your totally yearly income by your total number of yearly hours to reach an approximate hourly wage.


For example, if your total income was $15,000 and your total number of hours was 2,080, then 15,000 / 2,080 = approximately $7.21 per hour.

"
"
Adjust your yearly income.,
Add hours to your calculation if you work overtime.,
Subtract hours from your calculation if you receive paid time off.",How to Calculate Your Hourly Rate3," If applicable, add any additional money stemming from your job to your yearly salary total. This can include tips, bonuses, work-based incentives, etc.


Any bonuses or extra work-based incentives you expect to receive should be added directly to your yearly total as well.
If you happen to work a salaried position where you also receive tips, the process becomes a bit more complicated. Keep track of your tips for several weeks or even months, and divide the total by the number of weeks you have been tracking the data. This will give you an average tip total per week. Multiply this number by the number of weeks you will earn tips for the year, remembering to subtract weeks where you won’t earn tips such as when you are on vacation.
The rule of thumb for calculating tips is that the more weeks you can use to tabulate your average, the more accurate it will be.

, For overtime pay, multiply the number of overtime hours you worked by the rate you receive for additional work, and then add this total to your yearly salary.


Your overtime hours can be either paid or unpaid depending on your position. Add the additional hours worked regardless.
Example: Say you work an average of an extra two hours every week except when you are on leave, which is two weeks every year. Your extra hours are 2 hours x 50 weeks = 100 hours per year.
In this example, your adjusted hours worked per year would be: 2080 + 100 = 2180

, Add together the number of hours you take off work each year and subtract this number from the total number of hours you worked in the year. Remember to include holidays, sick leave, special leave, and any time when you start late or finish early.


Remember only to include paid time off that you will actually use. As an example, you may have accrued two weeks of sick time, but you also aren’t likely to use all of it.
For example, say that you take two weeks of paid vacation every year, that you are never sick, and that you always leave one hour early on Friday afternoons. Your reduced hours would be (8 hours x 2 weeks) + (1 hour x 50 weeks) = 66 hours per year.
Your adjusted hours worked per year for this example would be: 2180 - 66 = 2114

Do some market research to see what others are charging for similar services.,
Consider your past salary.,
Decide how you want to differentiate your service from your competitors.,
Include provisions to cover administrative costs when deciding your hourly rate.,
Once you have your base hourly rate, decide if you want to offer any extra value-added services.,
Publish your rates online and in an official brochure so your clients are clear about your prices and services.,
When you meet with clients, tell them your hourly base rate and the cost of additional value-added services.",How to Calculate Consulting Rate," Your clients will have shopped around different services, so they will generally have a good idea of what is reasonable.;
, If you have worked for a consulting company doing similar work professionally, you can take your previous salary into account. Presumably, you don't want to make less by working on your own than working for your former employer.


Divide your annual salary (plus employee benefits like health insurance) by the number of weeks per year (52) and then hours worked per week (40). This is a good base hourly rate for you to start from -- the minimum that you should charge per hour, in most cases.

, You may want to offer the cheapest hourly rate, in which case you should set your fees below everyone else's. You may be able to differentiate by location, if you are the only consultant who offers your type of service in the area. Or you may believe that you provide a higher quality of service by operating independently, exhibiting extensive experience/past successes, etc., in which case you can get away with charging more. Whatever your selling point to a prospective client is should determine how much you want your fees to deviate from the market average.

, Make sure that given the hourly rate you charge and your expected number of clients, you can cover all typical expenses associated with running a business.


Examples include: professional membership dues, insurance, employee training, wages, office overhead, local, state and national taxes, etc.

, For example, if you are a business consultant, you might be able to offer your clients the option of website design. If you are a PR consultant, you might offer to design press kits for your clients. Think of things that your clients are also likely to need if they are coming to you for consulting services. You can simplify their lives and save them money by helping them take care of multiple issues from one service company.


You may need to partner with another organization or hire additional specialists to offer value-added services if you do not have the skills on your own.

, Any changes to your base rate or the cost of additional services should be announced prominently. That way, your clients can trust that you are charging everyone the same amount.

, Let them know that although you cannot predict the exact cost of any project, you can estimate how long their project will take you and provide them with the projected cost. The more details the client can provide upfront, the better your estimate will be.

Check if the company uses the safest packaging materials and methods.,
Look into the company’s offered or promised delivery time.,
Make sure it has reasonable shipping costs.",How to Choose a Trustworthy Logistics Company to Work with," You don’t want to work with a logistic company that is known for providing a terrible brand of service. Unfortunately, there are companies that have “crazy” delivery personnel who literally dumped parcels at their clients’ front door. Some have been known to steal valuable items. To avoid such problems and ensure that your business does not compromise its reputation and lose customers, make sure that the logistics company you hire has a clean record. Read some testimonials, ratings and reviews to verify the reputation of the company you want to hire.
, If the company has certification from the International Organization for Standardization or ISO, it means that it has managed to meet all the stringent requirements to ensure quality of operations at all times. As such, no matter how volatile or fragile the products you want to be shipped are, both you and the recipient can have the guarantee that they have been handled properly and carefully., By looking into this area, you can get the assurance that whatever supplies you get and products you deliver to customers maintain their good quality as they are being transferred from one location to another., The faster the products get to you and your end users, the better for your operations.

Attend to the little things.",How to Build a Writer Client Relationship," While you can't be as choosy when starting your freelance writing business as you can later on, don't take jobs you're not suited for or take on clients who create more stress than you can handle. It helps if you have some common ground where you develop mutual respect for each other as people, as sustainable writer-client relationships are built on respect.;
, If your prospective client is an organization, know who the decision-makers are, as well as who are the people who can best represent you to the decision makers. If your prospective client is an individual, you may want to find a mutual friend who can help represent you to that person.


Once you find those people, make it a point to learn their names and use them. People like to be addressed by name; it shows you respect and value them.

, Providing your clients with the means to reach you and having ready ways to reach them is essential in maintaining a writer-client relationship.


Your correspondence should always include your contact information: name, company name, address, phone number and e-mail address.
Even if you work remotely and communicate with your client via e-mail, you should have your client's physical/mailing address, phone and fax number in case your e-mail communication goes down at a critical moment.

, Having the means to communicate with your clients and them with you establishes the writer-client relationship, but you need to use those means to maintain that relationship.


Lay out your expectations for each other early on and in as formal a manner as you are both comfortable with. Some writers can do this with a detailed project proposal or brief, while other writers and their clients prefer to formalize everything in the contract. Be sure you're promising your client something you can reasonably expect to deliver.
Keep the tone of your written communication professional. Avoid slang and text-message abbreviations in your correspondence, and review it before sending for wording that could be misinterpreted or come off sounding rude or cocky.
Don't be strictly business with your clients; be willing and able to make small talk at the right times to show you're interested in them as people.

, Being organized is important in any business, whether working face-to-face or online.


Knowing the e-mail or instant messaging names of your clients will let you know which files you need to look at before you reply, saving time.
Hang onto your correspondence, both what you receive and what you send. You can set up folders within your e-mail application for messages your clients send you, and you can blind carbon-copy your own e-mail address to send yourself a copy of the messages you send to your clients.

, Not making promises you can't keep while keeping the promises you do make is a great way to build a writer-client relationship and your overall reputation.


Get a clear handle on what your clients want and do your best to give it to them or provide them with a viable alternative. It helps to learn which freelance writers specialize in areas you don't and also who provides related services such as photography, graphic design or desktop publishing. You then have a group of people you can refer that person to so the work gets done. The client may come back to you later with work you can do, or the person you referred him to may in turn refer someone to you.
Reply promptly to client requests. If you don't have an immediate answer, let them know you'll find the answer and give a reasonable estimate of when you'll have it.
Make your reply one that shows you've read the client's request and aren't just giving a pat answer.
Be accessible to your clients during your stated office hours. Constantly getting voicemail or busy signals turns off many prospective clients.

, While working with the right customers and giving them good service is important, it's also important to show them respect in how you deal with them as people.


Shaking hands with your client at the beginning and conclusion of your first meeting shows them you welcome their business and are eager to work with them.
Thanking your customers promptly for their payments or any gifts they give you is a good way to keep them thinking of you in a positive manner.
Many businesses send their customers Christmas cards or acknowledge other events in their lives.

Make a business plan.,
Choose a company name.,
Focus on what distinguishes you.,
Believe in what you are doing.,
Target your niche market.,
Set up your office.,
Organize your business.,
Stick with it.,
Publish something.",How to Create a Consulting Business," Most consultants have years of experience, have worked as educators, or published work in their field. If there is an area of knowledge where people often seek your advice, this is a good place to start. Find out what type of license or certification you may need to consult in this field by searching online or asking similar professionals.;
, Define your goals, business structure and financial projections. Business plans are not set in stone and may change as your business grows, but a plan will help you remain focused.

, Depending on your field, you may use your own name or last name as your business name. Other businesses do well with names that describe what they do. For example, J.D. Marsten Financial Consultants might be just right for the financial industry. A marketing consultant might choose a name like Market Masters, which is more indicative of what they do.

, Choose a consulting niche that focus on one area, like retail sales growth or risk management consultant instead of just ""business consultant."" This will help potential clients seek out your services. Travel consultants might focus on a specific country, like China or a region, such as the Middle East and seek out clients who do business in those places.

, Enthusiasm should shine through every piece of marketing material and every conversation you have. Consult on things you feel good about, and have a genuine interest in seeing your client's success. Business is about relationships, so build good relationships and the money will follow.

, Pinpoint a problem in your market, then offer a solution. Security consultants may discover that banks need software to detect online fraud. Wardrobe consultants may find that female clients need clothes that are both professional and feminine. Legal consultants may choose a market that represents the most pressing legal issues of their area, such as foreclosure, medical malpractice, or insurance claims.

, Start with a home office to keep costs down, if possible. Consultants often work in the field, so prime office space is not required. You need things such as a business phone, computer, printer, business cards, web site and a business license to get started. You also need time to work on your business.

, Get a calendar. Set aside time each day to work solely on your consulting business. When you are not working for clients, work on administrative tasks such as marketing, research or accounting. Create a standard contract that outlines your rates and services for clients. Update this as needed. Have a plan for daily, weekly and monthly administrative duties.

, Most businesses take at least a year and sometimes 3 to 5 years to become profitable. Keep working toward your goals. Push forward with a positive attitude. Don't give up too soon; your own belief in the success of your business is a key to making it work.

, Writing a book, software or teaching curriculum can help establish you as an expert in your field. It also serves as a marketing tool for your business.

Decide how you would like to work as a travel consultant.",How to Become a Travel Consultant," Future travel agents will benefit by learning foreign languages, geography, computer skills and communication skills. This is the only education that is strictly necessary to get a job in travel.


Consider higher education to receive your bachelor's degree. Some large, luxury and educational travel employers prefer that their employees have a bachelor's degree in a liberal arts, business, foreign language or other degree. They may look at your activities and grade point average in order to determine if you are a detail oriented person with good communication skills.;
, The best way to prove you are qualified in the travel field is to develop experience in domestic and international travel. A travel agent's biggest competition is self-planning, so be well-versed in the advantages and disadvantages of online and phone booking for your own personal travel.

, Experience in the hospitality industry, sales and customer service is all useful to a travel agent. Assess your experience, so that you can choose the training program that is most fitting.

, There are a number of pathways you can take to receive training, so look for the 1 that best fits how you would like to work in travel:


Apply for jobs that include on the job training. Many large travel providers hire and train people to arrange their travel. You may need to show an aptitude for language and quick learning. This is the best option for someone looking to work for a company.
Sign up for an International Air Transport Association (IATA) training program. These programs are available to people looking to start in the travel business or brush up on their skills. Most programs include an IATA certification, which is necessary in order to book any flights as a travel agent in the United States. These training programs will allow you to work with a company or work from home, if you want to start your own business.
Attend a travel school. Physical and online travel schools create a program that is designed to teach students about all aspects of the travel industry. They may be more expensive than on the job or IATA training; however, they may be seen as a good qualification for anyone looking to start their own business or people that have little knowledge of the travel and tourism industry.

, Each country has their own national certification boards for travel agencies. If you are looking to be a travel consultant in the United States, seek certifications from IATA and The American Society of Travel Agents, www.asta.org.

, You will need to pay a yearly fee to keep your certification.

, There are many niche travel markets, so you can specialize ahead of time, look for general work or create your own business model. The following are popular ways to work as a travel consultant.


Seek a job as a travel agent/consultant for a tour company, credit card company or large corporation. Unless you have extensive experience, you will need to start at an entry level and work your way up to a job as a senior consultant. You may be assigned a department or territory to work for.
Specialize in student, luxury, adventure, trekking, service, cruise, disabled, senior, educational or other travel. The travel industry is large, and it is fractured into niche markets. If you have a lot of personal experience with 1 type of travel, look for companies that cater directly to that market. Your expertise may allow you to start at a higher salary than an entry-level position.
Start your own travel company. With a high-speed Internet connection, website, a fast computer, some software and a toll-free number, you can work from home until you are successful enough to start your own brick and mortar travel agency. You will need to file paperwork with your state, get insurance and possibly hire employees. You may also find employers that hire people to book travel from their own homes.

Complete your high school education.,
Get a degree in business, business administration, finance, accounting or economics, if you want to advance on the loan consultant career path.,
Get applicable experience, if you do not want to get a degree in higher education.,
Choose a specialization.,
Apply for an entry-level position that includes training in small business loan consulting.,
Mentor a successful small business loan officer.,
Seek a certification or license if they are available.,
Market yourself.,
Stay constantly updated on the loan market.",How to Become a Small Business Loan Consultant," This is the minimum educational requirement to become a loan consultant. You should have aptitudes in mathematics, economics and communication skills.;
, Managing positions and small business loan consultant positions with small firms will most likely require a college degree.

, Working in a bank, in sales or for another financial service for a number of years will also increase your chances of employment as a loan consultant and increase your salary or commissions.


In your studies or experience you must learn to analyze financial statements and study the loan market. You also need to develop the critical thinking skills that allow you to analyze a business's needs and choose the best options from the loan market. Then, you should be able to sell the option to both the financial institution and the client. If you do not have these skills, you should return to school or work to get them.

, After learning the basics of financial loans, you will need to choose between personal, mortgage and commercial loans. To become a small business loan officer, you will need to be a commercial loan consultant, because you will be helping businesses to apply for loans for equipment, inventory or start up capital.

, The Department of Labor Statistics reports that 9 out of 10 loan officers work for banks, credit unions or larger financial consulting firms. If you are starting out in the business, you can apply for a low-level position and work your way up by hitting loan goals, after you receive your training.


Be prepared to be paid according to commission. Even if you work in a financial institution, you will most likely be paid a lower base rate salary, and then receive a high commission if you meet your loan targets. Independent loan consultants may find that there are slow periods, until they have cornered a good percentage of the local market.
If you want to work from home as a freelance small business loan consultant, then you may want to consider taking a course in loan consultancy from an online course or a local lifelong learning class. You can also choose to apply for an internship at a local financial institution in order to get acquainted with this business, and build business contacts. If you are striking out on your own, you will still need to contact financial institutions to inquire about loans and rates.

, If you have been employed by a financial company, they usually provide mentors before you take on the position of Loan Consultant or Loan Officer. If you are starting independently, you may want to arrange a mentorship through contacts, in a location that is not in direct competition with you, so the mentor will be willing to share their best practices and advice.

, Although this mainly applies to mortgage loan officers, some states require you to pass a test and obtain learning credits to do business as a financial consultant. Check with your Secretary of State.

, A small business loan consultant must appear professional and legitimate at all times. The following are ways that you should approach marketing for this position:


Dress professionally at all times when you are, or might be, doing business. In most locales, this means ""business formal"" attire, in a suit and tie. In other, more relaxed locations, this may mean ""business casual,"" where slacks, skirts, button-down shirts and sport coats will do. When going into a meeting or a new job, always err on the side of formal rather than casual.
Network with loan officers and consultants in your city. This is especially important if you want to go into business as an independent small business consultant. To be successful, you must know loan officers at all the major banks, investment firms and credit unions. Go to financial conferences, classes and functions to develop contacts.
Create a professional website and printed materials, if you are an independent consultant. Even if you work from home, most people judge professionalism by appearance. They will do their research before hiring you, which usually starts with a look at your website.
Invest in a marketing campaign, if you plan to be a self-employed consultant. Get in touch with the Small Business Administration to make sure you are listed on their site. Also, do newspaper, radio, magazine, billboard or television advertising, according to what you think will be most effective. Hold free small business training courses to educate people and develop a new client base.

, Financial markets change constantly, so you should be listening to financial news, reading a financial newspaper and checking in at local banks to see what is available and new for your clients.

,


As an independent nursing consultant, you'll have more freedom to choose your clients and the projects you work on. However, you'll also need to understand all of the intricacies of running your own business, from client acquisition to financial management.
If you work as a nursing consultant for a company, you'll have a salaried position that requires you to work on projects your employer chooses.

Consider a master's degree.",How to Become a Management Consultant1," If you're interested in a career in management consulting, spend some time familiarizing yourself with the career first. A management consultant is a diverse career path that allows you to work in a variety of fields throughout your career.


Consulting is a loose term that applies to a variety of advice-giving in the business world. As a management consultant, you would advice businesses on fields like product marketing, public relations, cost reduction, and other day-to-day aspects of running a business. Businesses in all fields need management consultants, to the career outlooks is good. It's a job that will always be in high demand and tends to pay high.Being a consultant is a challenging career path. Much of it is problem solving. Major issues businesses face, such as integrating new staff and restructuring after financial crisis, are often handled by a management consultant. The job can be high stress. However, some also find it invigorating. You're out there day-to-day solving real problems and pushing for quick and tangible results.Some people see becoming a management consultant as a means to an end. People plan on serving as a consultant for a number of years before moving up to higher positions. However, others see consulting as a long term career. The job is relatively stable and pays well but keep in mind hours are tough and your schedule is somewhat erratic. A 60-hour work week is not uncommon for a management consultant.;
, If you want a career in business, you need to start thinking ahead in high school. Work hard and study as it'll pay off later as you apply for college.


Keep your grades up and try to do well on any standardized tests. You can purchase study guides for tests and you can also take classes, online and in real life, that prep you for exams like the SAT and ACT. Good grades and high test scores can help you gain entrance to a reputable business school.
Take relevant coursework. High-level classes in mathematics, business, and marketing can help on a college resume to a business school. If possible, see if you can take a few low level business courses your junior or senior year at a local community college.
Look for relevant work experience as early as high school. Talk to your high school counselor about your career goals and see if he or she can help you find internships for high school students. Even casual work experience, such as working a secretary in a local business over the summers, can help. It will expose you to the professional world. If you have a specific field in mind you want to work in, try to land related work. If your ultimate goal is to work as a management consultant int he medical field, for example, try to get a summer gig as a receptionist at your local hospital.

Your degree should be in business administration or a related field. Talk to a college counselor for advice on what degree type to take.

Having some familiarity with a specific field in addition to a broad understanding of business can help impress future employers.Keep your grades high. While your GPA is not the number one factor employees consider, a GPA of 3.2 or greater is impressive. You should also seek to be involved on campus. Join organizations relevant to your interest and career plans. Want to work as a business consultant for a tech company? Join a club related to computers and computer sciences. Seek out leadership positions in extracurricular activities. This can really help your resume shine down the road.Work while your in school or over the summers. While employers expect college students seeking entry-level work to be slightly lax on experience, some internship experience and relevant employment history is a plus. Work as an administrative assistant for a local business. Seek out internships over the summers related to your field. Data-entry positions also look good on a resume, as they require attention to detail. Many businesses are eager to hire college students for part time data entry work so keep your eyes out for possible data entry jobs., Some businesses and agencies strongly prefer a management consultant to hold a master's degree. A master's in business administration or a related field may give you an edge over the competition on the job market. As you near the end of your undergraduate education, talk to professors, past employers, and career counselors about whether a master's degree would be a good move for you considering your career plans."

, Choose a college with a healthcare administration program and complete your four-year degree. While not all consulting positions require a bachelor's degree, having one will set you apart from less-educated applicants and prepare you for the career.


If your college does not offer a healthcare administration degree, consider a degree in business or public health.

, The minimum education requirement varies between employers, but most prefer applicants with a master's degree. Many healthcare consultants pursue advanced degrees in healthcare administration, human resources, or business.Regardless of their specialties, all medical insurance consultants need to have a strong theoretical and analytical understanding of the various healthcare systems. A master's degree is not required but will qualify you for better positions., To gain a thorough understanding of the Medicare system, volunteer alongside those who use it. Medicare is mainly utilized by the elderly and people with certain disabilities.

, Before you begin employment as a consultant, look for Medicare specialist job listings in your area. Medicare specialists work at hospitals and government centers: they inform potential clients about Medicare's benefits and help them apply to relevant programs., Before you specialize in Medicare consulting, you'll want to gain experience working in a consulting firm. Consulting firms help doctor's offices, nursing homes, and individual clients get the most out of their insurance and maximise claims.


As a consultant within the company, you will be able to specialize in a specific insurance down the road. Focus on gaining experience as an insurance consultant, then brand yourself as a specialist when you have the experience.

, To become a Medicare consultant, you'll need to be aware of any changes made. You will also need to know the differences between different Medicare plans and the benefits offered by specific states.Take informational classes about medicare to keep your understanding relevant.


Take a Medicare-related course at least every one to two years. Courses are available online at the government-run CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) website., After you've gained experience as a Medicare specialist, return to insurance consulting. Ask your supervisors at your insurance consulting firm if you can work specifically with clients using Medicare. Use your knowledge gained as a Medicare specialist and/or from Medicare informational classes to advise your clients.


Remember to keep your Medicare understanding relevant. Information changes at a fairly fast rate, and you don't want to misinform your clients.

, Once you've worked with a substantial amount of Medicare-related clients, begin advertising yourself as a Medicare consultant. Let potential clients know what your specialty is, and network with other consultants who can recommend your Medicare services to others.



Cold call potential clients to let them know about your services and how they could benefit from your specialization.

Promote your services online or in local ads to increase your range of potential clients.

, Once you've gained a considerable amount of experience, you could choose to open up your own consulting practice. This will give you free reign to work with specifically Medicare-related clients.

Consistency is key to a resume. Your use of bullet points, spacing, font, and other aspects of formatting should remain the same throughout your resume. For example, if you describe your job experience for a summer internship using bullet points, use bullet points to describe experience for every other job you list.Creative designs that maintain a level of professionalism can be great marketing tools. You can download creative resume templates online or browse websites such as Pinterest to get inspiration for a fun and creative design. Keep in mind you should know the atmosphere of a company before sending out a more creative resume. If you're applying for a young, hip tech company a creative resume could be a great selling point. However, if you're working in a conservative hospital employers may prefer a more professional document.List your experience in impressive terms. You can find lists of resume buzzwords online that will help you phrase your experience in as appealing a manner as possible. Say you spent your summer taking phone calls for a business manager at a local accounting firm. Don't say you ""Talked to clients on behalf of Mr. Patterson."" Instead say, ""Represented Mr. Patterson to clientele and the general community, maintaining solid public relations and withholding standards of professional conduct.""List relevant experience only. Many people make the mistake of listing every job they've ever held on a resume. Keep in mind the job you're going for. If you're applying for an entry-level position with a local engineering firm, employers probably do not care that you delivered subs to make ends meet during college. However, your summer internship in the engineering department of your college could really help your resume stand out.Take advantage of career counseling in your college when you have the chance. Attend resume workshops. Have a career counselor look over your resume and provide feedback., Hunting for jobs can be a stressful experience. However, you should know a bit about where to find entry level business positions as you start off looking for work in your field.


Networking is the best way to find a job in business. Go back to companies you've worked for in the past, whether it was part time clerical work or internship experience. If you did a good job, they may be willing to hire you or refer you to a firm that is hiring. Let professors and classmates from college know you're job hunting. People may be able to put in a good word for you at their place of employment.Online job boards can also be used to find work. Websites like Indeed, Monster, and Simply Hired frequently post job descriptions for entry level business work.Stay positive. With thousands of recent graduate each year and a limited number of jobs, it can take months to find a position in your field. However, try to maintain a positive attitude. Feeling discouraged can show through in subtle ways when writing cover letters and filling out applications. Try to see finding a job as an exciting challenge rather than a burden.

, Be prepared in the event you land an interview. Always practice solid interview skills so you can wow an employer and hopefully land an entry level position.


Always dress up for an interview. If you're looking for an entry level business job, err on the side of formal. For men, a business suit and tie is best. For women, consider a pantsuit. You could also try a professional looking blouse and dress pants or a skirt.Use body language to convey respect and confidence. As you enter the room, stand up straight and walk with a steady gait. Give the interviewer a firm handshake. Maintain eye contact and smile and nod as the interviewer talks as this conveys you're attentive.Do your research. You should always spend time browsing a company's website the night before a job interview. Make sure you have a sense of a company's goals, ethics, and overall mission going into a interview. Read over a company's about page. You can also find the company on social media and look at their posts to get a sense of their overall atmosphere.Ask questions at the end of the interview. Do not simply asks questions of logistics, like ""When can I expect to hear back?"" Ask serious, open-ended questions that show you have an active interest in the company. Ask something like, ""What is your company's culture like?"" or ""What do you like about working here?"""

Gain some high level experience.,
Look into certification programs.,
Consider your longterm plans.,
Decide whether to continue onto specialization or independent consulting.",How to Become a Management Consultant3," High end experience is vital to becoming a management consultant. Immediately upon graduate, you should be seeking out entry-level experience. Try to move up in a company fast, gaining insight into a variety of aspects of business.


Choose a field related to where you ultimately want to end up. If you're interested in management consulting for hospitals and health care companies, look into working in the business sector of a hospital or health insurance firm.Keep in mind you may have to work for a few years in a low level position, such as an administrative assistant or analyst, before you get a chance to do management consulting. Businesses run on hierarchies and you have to prove your worth through long term hard work in order to gain your dream position. Accept an entry level position if one is offered and work hard every day. Tell your boss and employees you're interested in management consulting. If they're impressed with your skills and work ethic, they'll come to you when a chance for management consulting comes up., As you start off in an entry level position, you should strongly consider pursuing certification in management consulting on the side. It is not required for the job but can greatly set you apart from the competition as you seek out work as a consultant.


The most widely recognized certification program is the Certified Management Consultant Program offered by the Institute of Management Consultants USA. You can complete their program online. In order to be eligible, you must have three years experience in consulting and a four year degree. While worthwhile, the program is challenging. There is a rigorous written and oral examination at the end of the program. Less than 1% of all consultants working in the field today have certification from the Institute of Management Consultants USA.Other, less rigorous certification programs are available online and at colleges and vocational schools across the country. Look into certification programs in your area. Talk to working management consultants about certifications, if any, they hold to get an idea of what programs to apply for., Becoming a management consultant is a diverse career path. As such, it provides you with skills relevant across the business world. Consider your longterm plans as you begin to work as a management consultant.


Many people work as a management consultant as a long term career. As nearly all types of companies need management consultants, work is stable. Pay is generally high. However, the job can be stressful. What you deal with varies greatly from one day to the next. Hours are long, up to 70 hours some weeks, and days off are sometimes interrupted by the needs of a business. You may crave, after some experience, a more stable, less high pressure position.Oftentimes, people transition into different roles after years of consulting. You could work in nearly any field of a company with consultant experience. If you're not sure consulting is right for you longterm, consider what other aspects of business and business management you may be good at. Talk to colleague and co-workers about other longterm employment options in the business world., If you want to stay in management consulting, consider specialization or independent consulting. If you have years of professional experience and a solid reputation, you may be able to take on clients in a specific field without any company backing you. Self-employments carries a significant risk but the independence can be highly rewarding. Keep independent consulting in the back of your mind as a potential longterm goal if you plan to stay in management consulting as a career."

Be meticulous.",How to Become an Accounting Consultant," Today's accountants must have technical skill in both areas to handle the demands and changes of the industry. Start taking advanced math and computer classes in high school.;
, If you aspire to be a consultant, you will want to choose a bachelor's degree over an associate's degree in order to advance quickly and gain leadership experience.As an consultant, you may also want to double major in business administration. That way, you'll have the skills you need to work for yourself if you would like., Check with your state's CPA exam requirements. Some require you to have more than the standard 120 credit hours. Your school should be able to tell you what credits you'll need if you plan to stay in that state. For instance, in Oklahoma, you need 150 credit hours while getting your bachelor's degree.You will also likely need a certain number of upper-division courses to qualify for your CPA. Check with your school or your local jurisdiction (such as your state) to see what is required. For instance, in Oklahoma, you need 76 upper-level credits to take the CPA, as well as 30 hours of graduate courses.Other states require less. For instance, Arkansas requires that you have bachelor's degree with 120 credit hours, with 30 in upper division accounting and 30 in upper division business. You must also get a C or above., It's not absolutely necessary to have a master's degree to be an accountant. However, having this degree will help you stand out in a field of CPAs. You can pursue a master's in accounting or business administration with emphasis in accounting., You should be able to find internships through your school, but you can also contact local accounting firms with your resume. Working at a firm will help you decide what type of accounting you want to do. In addition, it can help you meet the work experience qualification that some states require for you to be licensed as a CPA.

, What requirements you need to meet to take the exam vary by your jurisdiction. You need to check with your state accounting board to find out what you need to do before you take your exam.Jurisdictions are broken down by state.For instance, some states, such as Oklahoma, have residency requirements, meaning you must live in the state before applying to take the CPA exam there.Other states, such as New York, will let you skip some of the credit hours if you can show long-term experience working as an accountant., This bulletin is available on the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) website. The bulletin provides useful information about taking the test., To sit the exam, you will need to prove you meet the eligibility requirements. That means that you will need to have had your college transcripts sent before taking the test.You can get an official transcript from your school's registrar's office. It will be sealed and signed (or stamped). Have them send it to the address for your CPA exam; often the exam board will not accept it unless it comes directly from the school. However, make sure your transcript has everything you need on it by obtaining another copy to review., The first official step in taking the exam is applying to take the exam. Basically, you're showing you meet the requirements to qualify for the exam.In some states, you can submit your application online, through the NASBA website. However, with certain states, you must go directly to the board of accountancy. You can find out which your state allows by consulting the Candidate Bulletin., When you register, you will need to pay for the exam. How much it costs depends on where you live, but it is likely to be $100 or more., Once you register, you'll have access to a tutorial. You'll also be able to look at sample tests. Take some time to review these before taking the exam., The Notice to Schedule just says you are allowed to sit the exam. You can schedule your exam in your local jurisdiction. Be aware that your jurisdiction will likely set a time limit on how long your Notice to Schedule is valid., You can only take the exam 8 months out of the year. That is because they don't hold the exam in March, June, September, or December. If you must have passed the exam by a certain date, make sure you don't let time get the better of you., Once you feel you are prepared, it's time to take the exam. You should note that the exam takes a significant amount of time. In total, it takes 15 hours, which you'll do over the course of several days. If you don't know the answer to a multiple-choice question, guess at the answer, as points are not taken off for wrong answers.The first part of the exam is Auditing and Attestation (AUD). It takes 4 hours, and you will be required to answer 90 multiple choice questions and 7 task-based simulations. Task-based simulations (TBS) are meant to show how you would respond to real-life situations, so you will be required to provide solutions. In this section, TBS will account for 40 percent of your score. The second part is Business Environment and Concepts (BEC). You will have 3 hours for this portion, with 72 multiple choice questions and 3 short essays. The short essays will account for 15 percent of your score.The third part is Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR), which takes 4 hours. You'll answer 90 multiple-choice questions and 7 task-based simulations. TBS will make up 40 percent of your score.The final section is Regulation (REG), which takes 3 hours. You'll have 72 multiple-choice questions and 6 task-based simulations. The TBS will be 40 percent of your score., After you take the test, you must wait for your scores to be processed. The written portion will need to be graded by a person rather than a machine., In some states, you must meet certain requirements before taking the exam, and then you must take additional steps before you actually get your license. For instance, you may need to work for a year or two under a CPA to get your license in your state. Check with your state's accounting board.For example, some states, such as California, require that you have 2 years working under a CPA to qualify for a license., A home office saves you money, as you don't have to rent out a separate space. In addition, you have easy access to your business at all times, making you available when you need to be. Plus, you don't need to commute., When you're first starting out, you'll need to keep your fees low. That way, hiring you is not as much of a risk. Check your fees against others in your area to see if you are on the low end or high end. Once you establish a reputation, you can increase your fees to match your experience., Networking is extremely important when you're a consultant. You have to meet people and be willing to talk with them to build your client base.Make creating connections your goals. That is, if the people you meet think you're just after one thing (i.e. getting clients), then most of the time, they'll walk away. However, if your goal is to meet people and make connections, you'll seem less desperate.Don't dismiss someone because you think she's not important. You never know what someone is going to bring to the table.Do what you say you will. If you say you'll call someone, do it. If you meet someone, don't forget to shoot them an email afterwards to let them know you enjoyed the meeting. Keep the connection going so the person doesn't forget you., Figure out exactly what clients you want to serve. For instance, maybe you're interested in corporate accounting, or maybe you prefer personal finances. It's easier to sell yourself to people if you focus on what they need., Try to learn as much as you can about your target audience. Use census data and other government information to figure out where in your area you can hit that target market., Once you know your market, you can advertise your services to them. You can use online marketing, cold calling services, and mass mail-outs, depending on what your budget is., Once you're ready to consult, use the connections you've made to start building up a client base.For instance, if you met someone recently who's starting a new business, give them a call.


Say something along the lines of, ""Hello! I was excited to hear about your new business the other day. I just wanted to let you know that I am also going into business for myself as an accounting consultant. If you think I could be useful to you, just let me know. My rates are highly competitive.""

, If you want to build your client base, you have to show the clients you have that you are one of the best. That means paying close attention to detail at all times, delivering work on time, and being personable to your clients. When your clients are pleased with your work, they'll pass your name along to others."

A bachelor's degree is a prerequisite to getting into law school so it is imperative you take this endeavor seriously.Law schools will look at your undergraduate education to see what type of degree you earned and what your overall GPA was.


If you already know you want to be a legal consultant at this early stage, consider majoring in a legally related field like criminal justice, legal studies, or political science.While you are not required to major in any specific field of study, immersing yourself in the legal field as soon as possible may help you in the future.Regardless of your major, try to take courses in government, math, English, history, communications, and economics.These types of classes will help prepare you for law school and the legal consultant career.;
, Once you graduate with a bachelor's degree, you will need to take the LSAT in order to build your law school portfolio. The LSAT is a standardized test meant to examine your ability to succeed in law school.It includes five multiple-choice sections testing your reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning.In order to sign up to take the LSAT, you will go to the Law School Admission Council website. From there, you will click on the ""register now"" button at the top of the page, create an account, and follow the on screen instructions.
The LSAT scores range from 120 to 180.Depending on the type of law school you are interested in attending, you may need a score of between 150 and 180., Once you receive an LSAT score you are pleased with and you have gotten into the law school of your choice, you will need to complete the required curriculum and graduate with a Juris Doctor (J.D.), which is the professional degree you earn upon law school graduation.


Law schools will generally look at your undergraduate GPA, your LSAT score, essays, and letters of recommendation when they consider accepting you to their program.Law school is usually a three year program unless you decide to graduate early or you decide to pursue other graduate degrees (i.e., a masters in business administration).
While in law school, your first year will be filled with structured classes in the most common areas of the law such as constitutional law, criminal law, torts, contracts, and property.Your second and third year you will be able to take elective courses chosen based on what your career goals are.For instance, if you are interested in being a legal consultant focusing on corporate law, you may want to take classes in employment law, mergers and acquisitions, and tax law.

, Once you have graduated from law school and earned your J.D., if you are interested in practicing law in order to gain valuable legal experience prior to entering the legal consulting field, you will need to get licensed to practice law in the state you plan on working in. While it is not always a requirement to be licensed to practice law in order to be a legal consultant, most employers will look for attorney experience when hiring qualified legal consultants.In order to get licensed, you will usually have to:


Take and pass your state's bar exam. The bar exam is a two or three day test examining your understanding of basic legal concepts. It is designed to ensure you have the minimum qualifications necessary to practice law in your state. In order to sign up for your state's bar exam, visit your state's bar website. For example, to sign up in California, you would go here.
Pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE). The MPRE is a one day test designed to assess your knowledge of the rules of professional responsibility, which a lawyer must abide by at all times. In order to sign up for and take the MPRE, you must register with the National Conference of Bar Examiners and sign up for the MPRE here.
Submit a moral character application for review. Finally, you will be required to submit a moral character application, which includes personal information about yourself and is designed to ensure your state is only accepting attorney applicants who are upstanding citizens. The application will involve questions about your criminal history, housing history, schooling history, and any other questions your state deems appropriate. For example, California's moral character evaluation process is outlined here.

, If you want to be a successful legal consultant, you will need to build your resume with meaningful professional experiences. You should start doing this as early as possible. While it may be difficult to work while you are in school, particularly law school, you should at the very least try to work during your summers.


In law school, there are often opportunities to participate in summer internships or clinics, which usually provide opportunities to do real world legal work while still being in school. For example, in civil practice clinics, you may get an opportunity to help low income clients with their housing disputes and public benefits problems.

, Once you are licensed to practice law, you should look for entry level legal experience in a field you are passionate about. As of 2012, most employers looking to hire legal consultants were looking for applicants to have a minimum of three years of general legal experience.If you know what type of legal consultant you would like to be (i.e., corporate, medical, real estate), try to get a legal job in that specific field.Entry level legal jobs are usually associate positions with law firms, law clerk positions with organizations, or law clerk positions with various courts around the United States.

, Once you have some general legal experience under your belt, you may want to look into gaining some entry level consulting experience. A lot of employers hiring legal consultants look for their applicants to have between two and six years of experience in their specific legal consulting field.This step is separate from starting your consulting career because you will need to gain entry level experience prior to becoming a leading legal consultant with an agency or on your own.


In order to gain this consulting experience, start networking early and reach out to community members working in the legal consulting field.
Once you get a consulting interview, be prepared for a rigorous process.Consulting interviews often take place in multiple parts with the first couple of interviews being your general personality interviews.However, once you make it past the first couple of rounds you may find yourself taking part in a group interview where you may be asked to solve a problem with other candidates.In this interview, employers are often looking to see how you work as part of a team and how you handle pressure.Finally, the employer may ask you back for one more interview, often the most intimidating, where they may ask you to solve some sort of consulting problem.In this interview they are looking to see how you can handle yourself under pressure.Be confident going into these interviews. If you have followed the path laid out in this article you will be well prepared for this process.

, Once you have gained between two and six years of entry level legal consulting experience, you should begin to think about breaking into your dream legal consulting job. The first step in this process will be to decide whether you want to work with a consulting agency or on your own.


If you are interested in being a part of a consulting team, look for legal consulting jobs online and through your network. Reach out to people you know in the field and ask if they know of any availabilities. Send resumes to agencies you find online, even if they do not currently have any openings. Try looking at indeed or SimplyHired for possible job postings.
If you are interested in starting your own legal consulting practice, you will need to create a business plan, market your business, and gain a valuable client pool. Follow the steps below in order to start the process.

, A business plan is a written description of a business's future, including information on your goals and how you plan to reach them.When you are creating your business plan for your legal consulting business, be sure to identify the services you want to provide and develop a plan to market those services to your ideal clients.For instance, if you are planning on being a legal consultant focusing on human resources, you will want to tailor your marketing efforts and reach out to local and national organizations that attract human resources specialists.Understanding where to focus your efforts will lead to quicker and better results and will allow you to get on your feet faster.

, Once you have gained a loyal client base and you have firmly built your legal consulting career, do not become complacent. Continue to work hard expanding your business, but make sure you are having fun doing it.

Learn about the career.,
Get started in high school.,
Choose the right undergraduate program for your goals.,
Consider furthering your education.",How to Become a Health and Wellness Consultant1," Before going down the career path towards becoming a wellness consultant, you should get a sense of what the career entails. A health and wellness consultant is a diverse career with a variety of specializations and focuses.


In short, a health and wellness consultant helps people live betters lives physically. As a health and wellness consultant, you would advise people on nutrition, physiology, anatomy, and fitness.You would work one-on-one with clients looking to improve certain aspects of their health and well-being. You would have to think of solutions for your clients depending on their lifestyle, physique, and individual wants. As a health and wellness consultant, you have to have a diversity of tactics and plans at your disposal to fit the needs of a number of different clients. For example, the fitness plan you would write up for a single mother of three would be vastly different than the one you'd write for a single 33 year-old businessman.Communication is an important skill to have if you're looking for a career as a wellness consultant. You need to understand your client's lifestyles, comfort zones, and personal wants and needs in order to best assess their situation and advise them on how to improve. You also need to communicate in a way that is encouraging and non-judgmental.There are a variety of specializations in health and wellness consulting. Some people focus on homeopathic, natural lifestyle changes. Others focus on fitness and exercise. Others focus mainly on nutrition. The specializations you choose later in your career will depend on your individual interests and expertise.;
, If you're interested in becoming a health and wellness consultant, your path should begin in high school. Develop a strong interest in fitness and health early on.


Enroll in health classes in high school. In addition to the regular PE requirements, see if your high school offers any electives on nutrition or fitness.
You can get certain certifications, like a CPR certification, as early as high school. Look into what programs are available in your area. Many hospitals and community centers offer CPR classes.
Talk to your teachers about wanting to be a health and wellness consultant, especially teachers from health or fitness related courses. They may be able to suggest college programs.
Take summer and after school jobs that focus on fitness, nutrition, and overall well being. Work at a yoga studio or health food clinic. Lifeguard. Coach little league. Work at a summer camp.

, There is not a standard educational path to become a health and wellness consultant. The level of education you need will depend on your specific goals, but you should start tailoring your education towards health and wellness during your undergraduate years.


Some schools offer career development or certification programs focusing on a specific aspect of health and wellness consulting. They may offer a path to become a fitness consultant, nutrition consultant, holistic health, and other areas that fall under the health and wellness umbrella. These programs may be shorter, and cheaper, but they also tend to limit your focus to one area. Unless you're certain of the path you want to go down early on, it's better to get a four year degree and keep your options open.Biology, health sciences, kinesiology, and nutrition are majors you may want to consider if you want to be a health and wellness consultant. As the career itself is often multifaceted, it might be a good idea to double major. Also, health and wellness requires communication skills and focuses on client's emotional well being as well as their physical well-being. A minor in psychology or communications may help., Yet again, there is no set educational path to becoming a health and wellness consultant. You do not necessarily need more than an undergraduate degree, but furthering your education beyond a bachelor's degree could help you in the job market. This is particularly true if you want to work in a particular field of health and wellness consulting, such as placing your primary focus in fitness or holistic wellness.


If you're particularly interested in one aspect of health and wellness consulting, such as nutrition or fitness, a master's focused in that area can help. You may even consider a doctorate if you're particularly ambitious, but the pay off may not be worth it. While health and wellness consultants are generally high earners, earning around $70,000 a year, student loans can add up fast. Consider the potential debt before going for a PhD.Some schools offer 2 to 3 year master's degrees focusing in health that can prepare you for a career in health and wellness consulting. University of Michigan, for example, offers a program in health informatics that teaches you how to work with and inform the general public about the importance of fitness, nutrition, and overall well being. This degree path, or a similar program, could provide you a good foundation for a career in health and wellness consulting."

Some educational institutions even offer certificate programs or degrees in areas relevant to leasing and property management.Good subjects to study include:Sales
Real estate market analysis
Residential report writing
Fair housing regulations
Contracts
Principles of real estate management;
, In many cases, there are no absolute prerequisite work experiences for gaining a position as a leasing consultant. However, having some background in sales or hospitality can prepare you well to work in leasing services and property management. Fields where you can gain relevant work experience include:


Sales positions, such as at a car dealership or retail store
Hospitality services, such as hotel management
Customer service, including positions within a corporate office, legal firm, etc.

, Some states or regions require you to obtain a license in order to practice as a leasing consultant.Contact your state or regional real estate association to determine if you need a license to practice as a leasing agent. Typical requirements may include:


You must be at least 18 years old
You must be a high school graduate, or equivalent
You must complete an approved leasing agent course and/or examination.
Payment of a license fee

, You can prepare for a leasing license examination by completing a short course; some may be completed in just a few days.You may also be able to use self-study materials to prepare for the examination.Typically, there will be fees for the course or study materials and for the examination itself. Exact requirements vary widely from state to state, but you can generally prepare for a leasing license examination by studying topics such as:The real estate laws of your area
Real estate appraisal
Real estate finance
Human resources
Business law
Business economics
Financial management

, Even before you begin working as a leasing consultant, it is a good idea to have a sense of the property market in your area. You will want to know what kind of properties are leased in your area, and what kind of tenants occupy them. You can find the relevant information by researching the websites of property companies in your area, as well as calling or visiting them.Some leasing consultants work solely with residential properties, some solely with commercial properties, and other with a combination of the two.
Some leasing agents work strictly with a particular site, such as an apartment complex, to lease units at that site. Others work for a property management company that may lease units at many locations.
It is a good idea to have a sense of the tenants in your area by knowing the answers to questions like: What kind of businesses are common in your area? What is the median age and family size in a residential unit in your area? Are short-term or long-term leases the standard?

, You can learn more about working for a particular property management company, apartment complex, or other real estate company by asking to meet with one of its representatives for an informational interview. Let the representative (a leasing agent, property manager, etc.) know that you are interested in working as a leasing consultant, and want to know more about the field.


The informational interview is an occasion to ask questions about the tasks and responsibilities of a leasing consultant, and also an opportunity to network with others in the field of real estate. This may help you to find a job as a leasing consultant.
You might also ask about average salaries for leasing consultants in your area. Keep in mind that many consultants work on commission. This means that a consultant’s base salary may seem relatively low, but commissions based on the properties he or she successfully leases to tenants would supplement it. Commission rates may also be negotiable.
Some information on real estate jobs is also available online from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other sources., Using jobs boards, placement services, social media, word-of-mouth, or any other means, look for advertisements seeking leasing consultants. Make sure that your application materials, such as a resume and cover letter, emphasize that you have the skills and information necessary to succeed as a leasing agent, including:Responsibility
A willingness to lease fairly and ethically
Courtesy and good customer service skills
Excellent oral and written communication skills
Conflict resolution skills (to help handle any tenant issues that may arise)
Attention to detail
The ability to understand and process leases and other property-related documents
Knowledge of the local real estate market and tenant needs
The ability to work independently and/or travel, such as to take prospective tenants to visit a property

, The National Apartment Association (NAA) offers the National Apartment Leasing Professional (NALP) certification.Similarly, the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) offers a variety of courses relevant to commercial leasing agents.


There may be a fee associated with the certification course and/or examination.
Certification courses may be offered in-person, online, on-demand, or in a hybrid format.
Certification may require a certain number of hours of coursework, and/or an examination. Contact the relevant real estate association for details.
The NALP certification course requires you to have worked as a leasing consultant for at least six months you can become certified, although you can begin taking this course before you have six months’ experience.
Some BOMA courses are targeted toward leasing agents and property managers with 3-5 years experience.

, For instance, prospective tenants may only be able to view apartments to lease outside of regular business hours, so you may need to work evenings or weekends to serve their needs. You will also need to keep in close contact with your tenants to serve them well, and so you should expect to sometimes answer phone calls and emails outside of regular business hours.

Find your NAICS classification.,
Gather information about your business.,

Stop thinking, start writing:Just one simple rule that goes well with the explanation- if you don't write, you don't get the job.,
Start writing for yourself first: If you want to succeed in freelance writing then you ought to be a prolific writer.,
Spread the word about your presence in the writing world: Marketing yourself is a necessary evil in any freelancing profession.,
Build a strong network: Make friends online!,
Your first job matters a lot: Money matters and also does not!,
You are only worth what you think you are: Do not fall for some famous lines of clients like-


The pay is less but work is in bulk or have long term work.,
Be clever and cautious.,
Study the market: Search for the kind of writing jobs available in abundant.,
Take risks, be bold!,
Build your own profile, write free!,
Do not hesitate to ask if they need you: Finally get proactive and approach people for work.",How to Become a Freelance Writer Without Experience," Here we are trying to solve the basic problem of not having experience, so go gain some. This does not mean you should sip coffee and wait for work to come your way. That might never happen. Just open your word processor and start typing anything that will make a write up.;
, Start writing without expecting monetary returns for your work. What I mean here is write free for yourself but not for others (you will read more about this in later points). Start your own blog. If you do not want to invest in a custom domain the least you can do is register a blog for free. There are number of free blog platforms like Typepad, Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr, Posterous, etc. Do not forget to add an 'about me' page introducing yourself as a freelance writer, and also a 'hire me' page so that a potential employer who comes across your blog will know you are open for services. Your blog will act as a sample of your active writing habits and skills proving to be of some help to your resume.

, You are lucky to have been starting your writing career in the era of social media. If you have not already registered with social sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Stumble upon, Tumblr, etc then you need to register right away. It might take sometime to get rooted with the aesthetics of social media but you never can underestimate its potential.

, Use your social media accounts appropriately and make some personal connections with your key followers in the field of writing and hiring. Make comments on other freelance writing blogs and also write free articles for big blogs/sites to develop a rapport with the owner. Writing and freelance communities including forums are the best place to be in. Socialize and participate in these places to find opportunities and meet people while you also learn new things.

, Don't be surprised. I am just trying to make one thing clear about choosing your first client and that there are many factors to consider before saying yes for less (money) and no for less (money). Things you need to evaluate before making a decision with your first offer are:


How is it going to help build your experience and writing profile?
Should you really care for money if the company name or the client offer gives a big deal of lift to your career?
Is the client trying to exploit you by offering too little money without you getting added benefits to your career?

, (They might simply mean to hire good freelance writers for less pay. The long term work lies unpredictable!)
You are required to submit two or three samples before we hire you. (It means, they might just collect two samples per applicant for free and vanish off the scene without even notifying you about your selection)

, Only you can allow people to value or exploit you through your developed content. Know your worth and stay off the temptation of bagging some work only for the sake of it. Even doing something for free should have its value. Set a minimum price for which you would like to write and do not take anything that is below the mark. Do not overrate your work and end up losing all the potential jobs. Know your worth for less or more. A self conducted writing skills assessment will help a great deal with this.

, Prepare yourself and update your skills to grab the opportunities as they come your way rather than wondering. Stay with time if not a head of it. Educate yourself about the new developments in the freelancing communities. One important work that needs to be done is research on the rates for different kind of writing jobs. You will know what to quote for the kind of job better.

, Being an aspiring freelance writer, you need to be versatile and flexible while choosing your writing assignments. You may be expert in a particular niche but building your experience profile is what you need to concentrate at the moment. This will help you build your network, spread the word about your work, gain experience, allow you to study the market and rates. You will also be able to gain knowledge about the subject and different level of writing skills. The matter of fact is that you need to keep writing no matter what (in a positive sense). Some times it's a good idea to take risk in the subject matter you choose to build your reputation and gain handsome knowledge. With time the level of difficulty will just turn to become your second nature.

, Remember, what matters ultimately is your work and not the experience in this writing field. There are many small companies online who recruit freelance writers. Bring your work to light and offer to write a free sample so they know your worth. Make guest posting on different blogs who give author's name and bio. This will not only help you gain traffic to your blog (include your blog's link in bio) but also interested clients will find you rather than you trying to find clients. This will also help you to add some published work on your portfolio. Also do not forget that you are in the making of a freelance writer and in the process of building your resume. If people value your writing skills they will never even bother to ask your resume leave alone your experience.

, It is secondary whether they have or offer the job but why lose any opportunities. Who knows they might turn to you in future if not at present!

Consider licensure and certification.,
Gain the necessary skills.,
Learn how to maintain any certification and licenses.",How to Become a Health and Wellness Consultant2," Unlike like becoming a real estate agent or accountant, there is no all encompassing license of exam for health and wellness consultants. The requirements for the career vary by state, field, and specialization.


Figure out what city or state you would ideally like to be employed in and figure out what their specific qualifications are to becoming a health and wellness consultant. If you're unsure of where to find this information, find the contact information of a working health and wellness consultant in the area and ask. Some states may require additional training via a certification program, and a subsequent licensing exam, while other states may allow you to begin practicing as long as you have a relevant college degree.Certification programs are available in most states, broken down by speciality. You can also find programs online, but many people prefer to learn hands-on skills. The certification program you choose should be catered to your interests. If, for example, you're interested in more holistic approaches to wellness and health find a certification program in holistic medicine and exercise.Do your research before committing to any single program. See what kind of training is offered. A program with a lot of hands on work may reflect higher on you in the job market as opposed to an online program, for example. However, an online program may also be cheaper and shorter. Weigh the pros and cons of each program you research., As you begin training and certification programs, begin to work on developing the proper skillet. You want to enter the job market with a diversity of skills specific to your field.


Communication skills are vital, so any part time jobs you take during training should involve working with people. Sales positions, customer service work, and volunteering to coach little league are all things that can help you bolster communication skills.Business skills are also important. It might not be a bad idea to take a college course in business or auditing online during your training. You can also ask universities about the possibility of auditing a course.A solid knowledge of nutrition and health is vital to becoming a health and wellness consultant. Make sure you stay up-to-date on the latest health and fitness trends and know how to research their validity. You might want to subscribe to a variety of health and fitness magazines to get a sense of what's currently going on in the field.Empathy is also important to the career path. This is something that's difficult to learn directly, but doing volunteer work that involves working one-on-one with those in need can help.

, Certifications and licenses generally come with a set expiration date. Make sure you understand when your license expires and what you can do to renew it. For most programs, you'll have to take additional coursework and seminars once a year to maintain your license.

Seek jobs in the right places.,
Work on your resume.,
Practice good interview skills.",How to Become a Health and Wellness Consultant3," A health and wellness consultant can work independently, but it might be difficult to set up your own practice right away. A variety of institutions hire consultants regularly. Try looking for work at some of the following places:


Fitness and Wellness Center
Medical Center
Private Practice
Yoga Studio
Day spa
Natural food store
Restaurant
Corporation
SchoolIt's also a good idea to return to any institutions you previously worked, interned, or volunteered at and see if they're hiring. If not, they may be able to recommend you to an institution that is hiring and put in a good word for you. Networking is one of the main ways people find quality work.

, In order to land a good job, you need to work on your resume. Start drafting your resume as you prepare for your job search.


A resume should have a consistent format throughout. There are no hard and fast rules about punctuation and using bullet points versus small paragraphs for job descriptions, but know that any choices you make should be consistent.You should also use resume ""buzzwords."" These are impressive words to make your work experience sound as impressive as possible. For example, instead of saying, ""Helped customers make good choices while shopping for organic food"" you could say something like, ""Enhanced customers' shopping experiences by educating them on a variety of organic products."" Many websites include lists of buzzwords.Only list relevant experience to the job you're looking for. For a health and wellness consultant, stick to experience related to health, fitness, nutrition, and other aspects of health and well being. The fact you're a certified yoga instructor, for example, is more important than talking about waiting tables in college.You should always have a friend or family member proofread your resume for you. Many people become typo blind when reading their own work and might miss obvious spelling and grammatical errors.

, Good interview skills are a must have when you're on the job hunt. Make sure you practice interview skills while sending out your resume so you'll be prepared when an interview offer arrives.


Show up about 5 minutes before the interview time. Make sure you're dressed in professional attire. If you're unsure of the company wardrobe, it's better to overdress than to underdress.Always prepare for an interview. You should read up about the company online ahead of time and have a sense of its philosophy, ethics, and goals.At the end of the interview, ask questions. When the interviewer asks you if you have any questions, pick a question that's open ended rather than a logistical inquiry about when you can expect to hear back about the job. Something like, ""What is your company's philosophy?"" or ""What does an average day in your company looks like?"" are sure to impress your interviewer."

Begin as soon as possible.,
Review the qualifications for certification.,
Evaluate the set-aside rules and limitations.,
Apply for certification.,
Use the size standards tool.",How to Become a Government Contractor2," The certification process can take anywhere from three months to a year. In the meantime, your business may end up spending tens of thousands of dollars just to earn your first government contract.Once you're certified, you'll be eligible for smaller government contracts that are set aside for specific types of small businesses.

, The Small Business Association (SBA) certifies businesses in three different areas, each of which has its own requirements. You may qualify under more than one certification area.You can be certified if you have a woman-owned business, have a business in certain urban or rural areas, or have an extremely small business that is disadvantaged in some other respect.
Visit the SBA website at sba.gov to review the requirements for each of the certifications and find out if any of them apply to your business.

, Before you go through the process of having your business certified as a small business for government contracting purposes, you need to make sure your business actually could benefit from small business set-asides.The certification process is long and involved, so if you don't see any benefit to your business in getting the certification, there's no point in doing it.
By using SAM, you can self-certify in some areas, such as the size of your business or whether your business is veteran-owned.

, If you believe your business qualifies for one of the more specific set-aside programs, complete an application with the SBA to begin the certification process. You may be contacted by an SBA official.Keep all of your certification materials in one place, and make copies of everything you send to the SBA so you have it for your business's records.
If any of the information changes while your certification is still being processed, contact the SBA as soon as possible to amend your application.

, Many contracts set aside for small businesses simply require your business to have fewer than a specific number of employees. That number varies based on what industry your business is in.The SBA uses the NAICS to set size standards. Get the NAICS classification codes you found for your business.
Type your code into the SBA's size standards tool, available on the association's website at https://www.sba.gov/tools/size-standards-tool.

Search for open federal contracts online.,
Check for smaller state and local contracts.,
Research government agencies.,
Network within government contracting and procurement programs.,
Attend government agency events.,
Find a mentor.,
Train your team.,
Market towards government agencies.",How to Become a Government Contractor3," Open contracting opportunities are listed on the FedBizOpps website, located at https://www.fbo.gov/. The website is operated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), the federal agency that oversees all contracts and government procurement., Particularly if you're waiting for small-business certification, you may want to get your feet wet by bidding for a few state or local contracts before you jump right into federal contracts.Each state has its own process to register as a state government contract. The information you need to get started shouldn't be any different than what you needed to register as a federal contractor.
To find out the registration requirements and open contracts available in your state, visit the website of your state's procurement office or Secretary of State.

, If you want to contract for a particular agency or department, get to understand their budget and operations. This will give you a better idea of how high or low to bid to get a contract.You'll also find up to date information on regulations and safety standards that may apply to your business if your bid is accepted.

, You want to cultivate the government as a client just as you would any other. Get to know the people in departments, especially local contacts.Talking to people in government agencies helps you get a better sense of what the agency's needs are, as well as their budgetary restrictions.

, The SBA and government contracting agencies host conventions, workshops, and other events that allow contractors to better connect to the staff in different government agencies.You also can attend events focused on your particular industry that are hosted by a company in the private sector. In addition to private networking opportunities, government procurement experts frequently attend.

, If you're a small-business owner just getting started as a government contractor, you may want to take part in one of the two mentor programs sponsored by the federal government.The mentor program run by the GSA connects you with a larger and more experienced government contractor in your industry. They help you navigate the bidding process and get you on your way to winning your first government contract.
If you were certified as a socially or economically disadvantaged business under the SBA's 8(a) program, there's another mentor program you can use that will connect you with a successful federal contractor.

, When you work on a federal contract, your business and your team may be subject to federal laws and regulations that wouldn't have applied to your operations otherwise. Your team should be up to date on these requirements so there aren't any problems.Some contractors must complete a mandated training process before they can begin work on a contract. Even if training isn't required for your employees, there typically will still be specific regulations and policies they need to know about.

, When you respond to bids and write proposals, you are advertising your company. Put your research to work by drafting proposals that clearly identify the needs of the government agency and how your business is best-situated to meet those needs at the best price.Looking at previously successful proposals also can give you a good idea of how to structure your proposal and the kind of language to use.
If you have a formal mentor, talk to them about marketing toward specific agencies. Even if you don't have a formal mentor relationship, experienced contractors typically will be willing to share their knowledge with you.

One club related to your field is the Future Business Leaders of America, a nationwide club that likely has a chapter at your school. If it doesn't, you can start your own chapter. In fact, this organization has clubs that run from middle school to university level.Take concurrent classes. If your school doesn't offer business classes, see if you can take concurrent classes at a local community college. Talk to your guidance counselor about concurrent classes.;
, If you're going to work as a business consultant, you'll at least need a bachelor's degree. While some companies may hire you without a degree, to build a solid business as an independent consultant, you'll need at least a bachelor's degree in business or business management.While at university, find the local chapter of the Future Business Leaders of America. Joining your local chapter can help you gain experience and meet other people who want to go into your field.
Most management consulting firms today, excluding IT consultants, require an MBA for employment.

, At some point, you'll need to decide what you would like to specialize in. What you specialize in is up to you, but it can determine what positions you get or what kind of business consulting you run.Some specialties you might consider include sales, management, administration, and human resources. You might also look at IT systems, accounting, finance, projects, and organizational and corporate. Some people focus solely on marketing, as well.
To help determine your specialty, consider taking classes in the areas you're interested in. That way, you can see what you have a passion for.

, While a MBA isn't strictly necessary, it can help you stand out in your field. A master's degree in business, business administration, or a related field is a good idea. Beyond helping you stand out, it will help you gain greater expertise so that you can be good at what you do.If you're looking at a specialty, try to find a program that lets you specialize in that area. Many programs have a master's degrees in very specialized areas or ones that will let you focus on a more general degree.

, After graduating school or between semesters, you should seek a consulting internship or work as a consultant trainee, as the field is highly restrictive at the top levels. Having experience with a well-known employer is often more important than your education or certifications. Work with your school's career development office to locate and apply for these positions.


Having this type of background is especially important if you plan to work for a major consulting firm that works with Fortune 500 companies.

, In the business consultant field, the certification is based on your specialty. For instance, if you want to work with small businesses, you'll likely get your certification with the Association of Accredited Small Business Consultants.On the other hand, if you're going into the health field, you'll likely get your certification through the National Society of Certified Healthcare Business Consultants.You can get a more general certification. For instance, the Institute of Certified Business Consultants offers a certification as a general business consultant.

, In some cases, you will need to have a certain amount of experience in the field before you can gain certification. For instance, the Institute of Certified Business Consultants requires that you have 3 years of experience before you can become certified., With most certifications, you will need to spend time reading or training.In some instances, you just take a review course before taking the exam. Often, this training or review is done at your own pace, as you work through materials and tutorials to learn the information., Most of the time, certification will require that you take an exam at the end of the course. In fact, the exam is often the primary focus of the certification process. Usually, you can take the exam online to gain your certification, but you may be required to visit a testing center for certification.Often, the exam will take a good chunk of time, such as half a day or more, so you will need to set aside time to take it.
Both the course and the exam will cost a fee, set by the organization.

, With some certification, you will also need to fill out an application packet to become certified. Once you've met the basic requirements, you request the packet or fill it out online. Then you send it in to be reviewed by the organization.Certification usually requires that you complete the course and take the exam in a certain amount of time. For instance, the National Society of Certified Healthcare Business Consultants wants you to finish the course and the exam within 90 days.

, As a business consultant, you'll be called in to work on problems in the company, which means that you need to find creative solutions to hard problems. To be effective, you need to use critical thinking and problem solving regularly to solve problems.Start by learning the basics of critical thinking. For instance, it's important to learn to ask questions and don't make assumptions about the problem. If one solution has always been seen as the only solution, ask why. Think about other ways you could approach the same problem.
Use evidence. When you're thinking critically and problem solving, you need to have data and evidence to make a decision. It's not about just pulling a decision out of thin air.
Spend time using your critical thinking skills in everyday life. For instance, when you're looking at a news story, take time to evaluate the source of the story. Look at the data. Are they skewing it to make a point?

, Communication skills are essential in almost any field, but they are especially important in a field where you are selling yourself all the time to businesses. One of the best ways you can improve your oral communication skills is to work in retail.It's also important to to take communication classes in college, such as speech, debate, or business writing. They can help you develop your communication skills.
Make a point to work on your communication in everyday conversation. For instance, pay attention to how fast you're speaking and try to speak slowly. Also, make sure you are enunciating your words and speaking at an appropriate volume in any group you're in. If you're not sure what you sound like, consider recording yourself and listening to the recording.It's also important to actively listen in any given communication. If you're listening, you can respond to what the person is actually saying, which makes the person feel important, a quality you want when you're trying to sell yourself or your business.

, Often in business consulting, you will be working on your own, even if you are a part of a larger consulting company. However, when you go into a business, you will need to be a leader, as that business will be looking to you to help improve the way it works.One way you can improve your leadership skills is to run for leadership positions while you are in college and high school.
Go out for student council. Run for a leadership position in Future Business Leaders of America. These positions will help teach you leadership skills.

, When working as a business consultant, you'll likely need to manage more than one business at once. Because you're working on several businesses and multiple projects, you have to be extremely organized.One way to be organized is to use the tools at your disposal. Email organization, online calendars, and other project management tools can be a big help.Another way to work on organization is to develop your own systems, so that your files are organized in such a way that you can always find them.

, Business consultants often must meet tight deadlines to cater to their clients' needs. Therefore, you must be able to work under stress and to deliver the work when you saying you're going to do so.Going to college is actually fairly good preparation for working on a deadline, since you must manage several classes at once and turn in your work on time. However, when you get out in the world, your job will often depend on you making those deadlines.

, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that about a third of management analysts, a subset of business consultants, works more than 40 hours a week. That means you'll need to be prepared to put in long hours, especially when you're first starting out.This position will also usually require you to travel because most of the time, you won't just be working with businesses in your area. Because much of your work is done with the client at their place of business, you'll need to travel to where they are.

, An internship is a great way to gain experience, and you can even do one while in school. Many businesses, even consulting companies, offer internships to help people get their feet wet in the business.Check with your school to see if they know of any internships in the area, as businesses often contact local schools.
You can also look for internships on traditional job search websites.

, Networking is critical to being a consultant. For one, it can help you get hired by a consulting company. However, it's also necessary to build up a network of people who own their own business or are high up in their company, as those are the people who are likely to hire you for consulting.Attend local meet and greets in your area for young entrepreneurs. You should also attend meetings and social events held by your local chamber of commerce.
As you meet people, strike up conversations. When you find someone you click with, ask for their contact information. Be sure to follow up with them later.
For example, you can shoot them an email talking about your meeting, saying something like, ""Hi Josh, It was great to meet you the other day at that networking event. I was glad to find another Sooner fan in the area. There aren't many of us! Call me if you want to have drinks sometime.""

, To get started in the field, look for entry-level jobs at business consulting firms in your area. You can use standard job search engines like Indeed, Jobs.com, Yahoo, or Monster.

You can also use job listings associated with any clubs or national organizations you belong to.
Don't forget to hunt down specific firms. Sometimes, they will list postings on their sites first.

, Pick jobs that cover your specialties. You'll have an easier time selling your skills to the company if your skills are a perfect fit. However, you may need to take a position that's slightly out of your skill set when you're entering the field. For instance, some business or management consultants start out elsewhere in a company, such as working in human resources or working their way up into management positions.Of course, part of the job interview process is showing how your skills are a perfect fit for the position.
One way to show how you're perfect is to tailor your resume and cover letter to the position you're applying for by highlighting your relevant skills and experience.

, Another option is to go into business for yourself. As a small business owner, you could even work out of your home to get started, meeting with clients at their offices or at local coffee shops. You may want to be working somewhere else while you set up your business, as early on, you may not have much cash flow.Before opening your own business, know that opening a consulting business before gaining actual experience can be difficult, since experience translates into credibility a client's mind. You may want to gain experience and a reputation first before going out on your own.
When setting up your business, consider all the things you do for someone else, such as writing a mission statement, creating a website, making a marketing plan, and creating a business plan.Decide on the legal aspects of your business. You can open a limited liability business, where your business is partially separated from your personal finances when it comes to responsibilities for debt. A sole proprietorship is easier to set up, but you are personally responsible for any debt the company accrues.
Pay for the help you need. If you need legal advice about how to set up your business, hire a lawyer. If you don't understand business accounting, hire a CPA.Don't forget to check your local laws to see what licenses you need to own your own consulting business.

, As a young consultant, you'll need to put in extra hours to bring in clients, as well as to meet all the demands of a very demanding job. You'll be working in a high-stress situation where you must be able to solve problems very quickly and in a turnaround time that you and the client determine together. In addition, if you're working for yourself, you're going to be under more pressure since you can't ask for help from others in your company if you run into trouble.Marketing and selling is not a paid activity; only consulting brings in revenue. You will need to estimate how many hours you will actually work (and be paid) in a year to establish your billing rate. Your billing rate must be competitive with other consultants that may have a higher ratio of work to marketing hours.
Be prepared for the fact that some clients will want to set unrealistic deadlines. If you're on you're own, you'll need to be realistic with the client, as telling them you can meet a deadline you can't isn't good for either of you.
If you're in a firm, ask about company policy for deadlines. It may be that the company will back you up if they have a policy in place about how short a deadline can be set.

, As a consultant, it will be your job to bring in clients, whether for your own business or for a lager consulting company. That means that you have to sell yourself and your skills to that business. Often, that's where your network comes in. You have to convince the people in your network that they need your help to act as a catalyst for their company or to fix problems that arise.Another way you can sell yourself is to show you can save them money. That is, if they bring you in when needed, they don't need to hire a full-time analyst in their company. You might also be hired to help train employees and management in certain skills or figure out why sales aren't going up.
Make sure you are putting your name out there through a marketing plan. You should have a web presence, including a website with testimonials if possible.
It also doesn't hurt to cold call businesses. That is, visit businesses in the area and greet the people who work there, letting them know your services are available should they need them."

Collect on your invoices.",How to Write an Invoice for Payment for Services Rendered," To be professional, you start with your company's information at the top of the page. If you don't have a company name, just start with your name at the top. It can be centered or all the way over to the left.Treat the invoice like a business letter. That is, you can have a professional header at the top, centered in the middle. On the other hand, a simple statement of your business name is also effective.

, Put your address, phone number, email, and any other relevant contact information. Make sure to use your business information, not your personal information.A fax number may also be relevant.
If you accept payment services like PayPal, be sure to use the email you have set up with that account.

, Just like with a business letter, you now move on to the person your billing. If it's a business, use the business address and contact information that the company gave you.If it's a person, use what information you have, but preferably their business contact information.
If you don't have enough information, you may need to contact the person or business with the information you do have to find out more.If it's a large company, you may want to call anyway to ask exactly who to address the invoice to.

, Create a unique identification number for each of your repeat customers. Then, make sure that this number is included on every invoice that you write for this customer. This will allow you to group invoices by customer and, if necessary, assess their payment history or document a consistent failure to pay.

, If you're sending out invoices on a regular basis, it's important that each one has a unique number so it's easy to reference and identify. How you choose a number is up to you, but remember that you must have a new one for each invoice.One simple way is to just start out at one and work your way up. To keep the length of the number uniform, you could start with ""0000001.""Another method is to assign a customer number and then use the date. For instance, if the customer number is 305 and the date is February 2, 2016, you could use 305-02022016 as your number. Just make sure you're clear on what the ""date"" should be. Is it when the service was rendered or when you created the invoice?

, Near the top, put the label ""invoice date."" Next to it, add the date that you are creating the invoice. This helps both you and the customer keep track of the time.You can also include the billing period. The billing period is based on how you set up your invoicing.
For instance, if you invoice once a month, that means your billing period is from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and the services you performed during that period will be included on the invoice.

, This step is the meat of the invoice. You're telling your customer what you're charging and why you are charging it. It's important to not have surprises at this step, so make sure you are upfront with your client at all times.Organize by date. If this invoice is for more than one date, it's easiest to organize by date. Put the date all the way to the left. Either way, you need to include the date the service was rendered.
List the service. Next to it, list the amount you charge per hour or per service. You'll also need the number of hours or the number of times the service was performed. Finally, put the total for that particular service over to the right in the charges column.
Create a new line for each type of service.
List other charges relevant for service, such as charges for parts.

, If you have a delivery fee, you add it at the end, since it's not a part of the service. You can also add any other fees you need to. Just make sure they are labelled well and clear to the customer.The delivery fee may be taxed if you have sales tax in your area, so you can charge taxes on it after you create a subtotal. However, always check with an accountant to make sure you are charging taxes correctly., Add up all the charges that you have on the invoice. Put it in a line below the services as the subtotal with the label ""Subtotal."" It's the subtotal because you still need to add tax in., Next, calculate the taxes. Put the tax rate below the subtotal labelled as the tax rate. If you don't know the tax rate in your area, contact your local sales tax authorities to find out the number.You can also look online to find the sale tax or contact your accountant.


In some states, you won't need to charge sales tax for services. Check your local laws to find out whether you need to charge it in your area. Also, it may very by the type of business. For instance, you may not need to charge sales tax if you're a nonprofit. It also may depend on whether the primary object of the sale is the service (such as at the dentist) or the equipment (such as in computer repair).Taxes are usually charged in the place the service was performed, so if you go to a customer's place of residence in a suburb, you must use that city's sales tax. However, again, always check your local laws.Sales tax is a percentage. To figure out the tax, you multiply the subtotal by percentage, expressed as a decimal. For instance, if your total is $50 and the sales tax is 8.25%, you multiply $50 by 0.0825 to get 4.125. Round the number off as needed. Here the tax would be $4.13.
Add the tax in. Next, you add the number you got to the original subtotal. In the example, you add $4.13 to $50 to get the grand total of $54.13., Finally, list the total amount you just found. Put ""Total"" next to it to make it clear. Also, it doesn't hurt to put a box around the total or to mark the final total in bold., It is best to have a digital copy and a printed copy filed away. If you have any emails, memos, or other documents related to an invoice, you should store those alongside a printed copy of the invoice, as well.

, Your customer needs to know what methods they can use to pay. Do you accept checks? Can the customer pay by credit card, cash, or other payment processing system? If the only way the customer can pay is to come into your store in person, let them know that. Other options include mailing in a payment (either check or credit card number), calling in a payment (credit card number), or paying online., Your customer needs to know when they need to pay the invoice by. Include a due date prominently on your invoice. You can even include it more than once. One place to include it is down near the total amount due, but at the top is also a good option.Payment should always have a due date with a consequence if not met (for example, interest charged on late payments).
You might also include an incentive for early payment (like a 2% discount if paid in ten days), since most small businesses have constant cash flow problems.
You should also discuss whether you have a payment plan option. You can include the information with the letter, or write something like, ""If you can't pay your bill all at once, call our office to set up a payment plan."", Once you're done creating the invoice, send it to your client. It will let your client know they need to pay what is owed you. Make sure to make your company's name prominent on the outside of the envelop.Invoices should be coordinated with accounting system. An invoice, once written, becomes an asset of the company (Accounts Receivable) and should be properly recorded.
If you use accounting software, you may have the option to let the software create an invoice for you.Services like PayPal also have built-in invoice creation., If you don't get a response from the customer after sending your invoice, try making a phone call to make sure the invoice was received. Another option is emailing the client a reminder. It's important to have a well-defined and standardized collections process so that you can more easily collect on your invoices.


You can also send out reminders through the mail. How many you send out before a ""final payment"" notice is up to you. It's important to reiterate you have a payment plan option if you're willing to let the client pay it out over time.
Once you've sent out as many as you're willing, you can send out the ""final payment"" notice that lets the client know you're turning it over to a lawyer or collection agency.To establish a system, try having specific collection actions spaced out regularly across your collections period. For example, try sending notices after the balance has gone unpaid for 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, and so on. Each can specify how many days are left until payment and what actions will be taken if the balances goes unpaid.
Try sending at least one notice by certified mail, so you know the client received it.

Create a title for your contract.,

Provide a description of services.,
Do not be overly detailed if it isn’t necessary.,

Specify compensation.,
Include a description of the work relationship.,

Agree to circumstances for termination of the contract.,
Describe who will own any product you create, produce, or invent.,
Determine if you will need a confidentiality clause.,
Include a choice of law clause.,
Include a severability clause.,
Describe specific relief for breach.,
Include the date.,
Create a signature block.,
Format your contract.",How to Write a Freelance Contract," The title should be descriptive of the agreement, for example: Independent Consulting, Independent Contractor Agreement, or Freelance Web Design Contract. Center your title in bold type at the top of the contract like this:Independent Contractor Agreement;
, After each name, include the title by which you will refer to that party throughout the contract. If dealing with a business, include its full legal name with the “Inc.” or “LLC” suffix; do not include the names of the individuals signing the contract on behalf of that business.Here are two examples:


This Independent Contractor Agreement (""Agreement"") is made and entered into by and between, John Doe (""Contractor"") and Jane Smith (""Client"").
John Doe (""Contractor"") and Jane Smith (""Client"") agree as follows: . . .

, The length of the description will depend on the complexity of the job. There is no reason to make the description more complicated than necessary. Nevertheless, you should define the scope of work with sufficient clarity that the client knows the work he or she will be getting and you know what work falls inside or outside the contract.


“Contractor will help Client throw a party” is too broad. Will you provide food and music, or will you simply hire caterers and musicians to provide these services? Will you hire crew to set-up the party and/or provide cleanup? You need to provide sufficient detail so that the work doesn’t spiral beyond what you thought you were hired to do.

You could write, “Contractor will organize Client’s party by hiring caterers, musicians, florists, and crew to perform set-up and take-down. Contractor will also supervise these same.”


Sometimes a short description will work. This works best for businesses that provide services that can be summarized in a brief paragraph. For example, a social media consultant might describe the job as follows: “Setting up and maintaining social media accounts for Client with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Developing and implementing social advertising campaign, and training current staff to continue with social marketing efforts.”
If you can use a short description, then you might want to type: ""Contractor will provide Client with the following services:"" and then leave some blank lines or space. By doing this, you can reuse the same contract for multiple jobs. With each new job, you can just type or write in the description.

, Some tasks are self-explanatory. If you are confident there will be no dispute over what work is to be performed, you may want to use general terms for this section of the contract.


An example of general terms (as opposed to specific) would be to say ""paralegal services,"" ""secretarial services,"" or ""consulting,"" instead of describing all of the functions of a paralegal, secretary, or consultant.
Using general terms will allow you to leave this section unchanged from contract to contract, thereby reducing errors, and speeding up the process of producing a contract for each client.

, If you provide a service that relies heavily on technical or design specifications, describing a project in your freelancing contract may mean your contract is several pages long and changes drastically from one client to the next. For services such as this, you may want to describe the job as providing client with ""services described in the attached project plan.""


By doing this, you can then attach each client’s personal project plan to his or her contract. Using this format gives you the flexibility of describing each job in detail without having to change your entire contract for each new job.

, Include the compensation you will receive and in what manner and time frame it is due. You may choose to use either flat or hourly rate methods, or include both. For example:


“Client shall pay Contractor $ _____ per hour due on or before the first Friday following the end of any week in which Contractor performs services for Company.”
“Client shall pay Contractor a flat fee of $__________ as total compensation for the project described below. Payment shall be made as follows: a. $_________ due before work will begin, and b. $_________ due upon receipt of final deliverable.”

, Specify that you are a freelance or contract worker and will perform the services at the time, place, and in the manner of your choosing.Because employees and contract workers are treated differently for tax purposes, a description of the working relationship will help ensure that no mistake is made regarding whether you are a freelancer or an employee.


Sample language could be: ""It is understood that Contractor is an independent contractor and not an employee of Client. Client will not provide any fringe benefits, including health insurance, paid vacation, or any other benefits, for Contractor."", Where applicable, the contract should lay out the steps and expected time frames for the project. A web development contract, for example, might specify development milestones, and testing and acceptance periods.A sample project schedule could say, ""Benchmarks. Contractor agrees to provide first drafts by August 22, 2015. After approval of the draft and input from Client, Contractor will then provide an updated draft within two weeks of receiving input from Client...""

, It may be helpful to specify on what grounds either party could terminate the contract, such as missed deadlines or missed payments. In this case, the party has the right to terminate the contract without violating the contract.For example, you could add, “In the event of a material breach of the contract, either party has the right to terminate this contract within 14 days of notice of the breach by the non-breaching party. Client may also terminate the contract immediately in its sole discretion in the event Contractor breaches the Confidentiality Clause.”Or revise this language to reflect the grounds for termination that you and the Client agree to.

, Forms, recipes, research, memorandum, graphics, and software are generally owned by the client. You want to be clear and specific about who owns what.""Including but not limited to,"" is a good phrase to use in this section of the contract. For example: ""all documents produced by Contractor, including but not limited to memorandum, research notes, correspondence, e-mails, pleadings, and reports in the course of his work for Client, shall be the property of Client and Contractor shall retain no ownership, interest or rights therein.""

, If you will be performing services that make you privy to information that is confidential, such as legal or medical files, secret formulas or recipes, or a client's financial or personal information, you should include a confidentiality clause.


A typical confidentiality clause contains the definition of ""confidential information,"" prohibits disclosure generally, identifies exceptions (such as disclosure required by law), and states the duration of the confidentiality obligation.
For example: “Contractor acknowledges that he/she may be furnished with information relating to Client’s products, vendor lists, creative works, business or marketing strategies, pending projects, and other confidential information. Contractor agrees not to disclose this confidential information unless required by law or court order. This duty to maintain confidentiality shall continue throughout the life of the contract.”

, You should specify which law will govern the contract. Generally, people choose the laws of the contractor’s state of residence, but you could also choose the client's state laws. Choose one state only, and specify where you will mediate, arbitrate, or bring legal actions under the contract should a dispute arise.A choice of law clause may look like this:



Governing Law - This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States of America and by the laws of the State of Indiana. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Indiana, as applicable, for any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement, except that in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of such federal or state courts located in Indiana, such personal jurisdiction shall be nonexclusive.

, A severability clause provides that if any of the terms of the contract are found to be unenforceable by a court, all other terms shall remain operative. A severability clause may look like this:



Severability - If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of law to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) that provision shall be deemed amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision, and (b) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby.

, Service contracts commonly contain a specific relief clause which allows client to seek an injunction (a judicial order that either restrains or compels specific action), should the contractor attempt to disclose confidential information in breach of a term of the contract. It may also include an order for a specific performance, should the contractor refuse to perform some duty under the contract which causes the client irreparable harm. A specific relief for breach clause may look like this:



Injunctive Relief for Breach - Contractor agrees that his obligations under this Agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value; Contractor's breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable and continuing damage to Client, for which there will be no adequate remedy at law; and, in the event of such breach, Client will be entitled to injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other and further relief as may be proper (including monetary damages if appropriate).

, This should be the date the parties will sign the contract. If you are unsure of the exact date, leave a blank line where necessary, so that the day, month, and/or year can be hand-written in when you execute the contract.


For example, ""Agreed to this ___ day of February, 2008.""

, Each party should have a line to sign on, plenty of room to sign, his or her title listed, and his or her typed name below the line.

, Each section of your contract should be numbered, and have a section title in bold type. See the sample contract for examples of bold section headings.

Decide whether to start your own practice or join an existing one.,
Calculate business costs.,
Work out the legal stuff.,
Find an office space.,
Set the office up.,
Set goals.",How to Be a Consultant2," You have the experience and know you’re ready to consult. Choosing whether you want to go it alone, or work with an established firm is an important decision and there are multiple things to consider.


Working for yourself – some Pros:

Builds your self-esteem. Any success you have is going to be based on your hard work and decision making. It can be a deeply satisfying experience.
Control. You’re in charge! You pick the jobs. You set the hours. You can work from home if you feel like it.
Tax advantages. You may now be able to take advantage of some worthwhile tax deductions. Check with an advisor before going overboard.
Great income opportunities. Your hard-work and dedication could reap huge rewards, and since you’re the one at the top, you don’t have to stress out about getting your cut.


Working for yourself – some Cons:

Long hours. Getting a business off of the ground is a lot of hard work. Just because you can sleep in and work from home, doesn’t mean that you can get away with this all the time.
No guaranteed salary. Whether or not you make any money is now entirely dependent on you. A lot of the perks that you may have taken for granted like sick leave and paid vacations are probably out the window, also.
A lot of responsibility. All the paperwork and operational chores are now on you, but even more than that, the fate of the business is also on your shoulders. It can be a large burden to bear.



, If you’re going into business for yourself, you’re going to need to supply yourself with everything you need. This may vary from situation to situation, but some important things to consider are:


Office rental
Services such as internet, phone, security, etc. for your office
Office supplies
Travel expenses
Fees for any pertinent licenses or certifications required to run your business
Insurance

, You need to make sure your business is legitimate, or else you can run into some serious problems down the road. These are just a few items to consider, but you can learn more here.


Taxes. You need to determine your tax obligations. The four basic types of business taxes levied by the federal government are: income tax, self-employment tax, taxes for employers, and excise taxes.
You will have to select the form of your business. This will also play into the tax forms you’ll need to file. These are the common forms a business can take:

Sole Proprietorship
Partnership
Corporation
S Corporation
Limited Liability Company (LLC)


Your state income taxes may also vary depending on the form of your business and where you’ll be operating.

, Depending on how you plan to work it, you can rent an office or work from a home office.


Renting an office will be more expensive, but may also have a more professional feel.
Working from home can save you money, but you may also have to keep yourself motivated in that environment and not give into the urge to relax at home.
Make sure you select a location that gives you the best opportunity to communicate with your customers and effectively meet their needs.

, Organization is going to be the key to your company’s success, especially when you’re just getting started. You’ll most likely need:


A thorough filing system. Keeping track of client information as well as any vital legal or tax forms for your company will be crucial to your success.
Hardware. This includes phones, computers, printers, routers, and anything else you may need.
Set up any services that you may need , such as phone, internet, security, etc.
Give yourself a comfortable place to work. Make sure you create an environment that you can perform well in.

, This will be very helpful in keeping yourself on task and will make you feel a sense of accomplishment when you start achieving what you set out to do.


Here are some examples of short-term goals:

Set a number of potential new clients to contact in a day, a week, or a month and then try to beat that number.
Build relationships with other people who can help you. They may not be paying you, but sometimes building out your professional network can lead to opportunities that you couldn’t access before.
Spend a month or so analyzing the competition and piece together a new marketing strategy that differentiates you from them.


For long-term goals, you may want to consider:

Turning a profit. This should be first and foremost on your mind. It may take a while, but keep your eye on the prize.
Double your revenue. Maybe you’re profitable already, but you can always be doing more. Set a goal to double your take by the end of the next fiscal year.
Plan for expansion. Think about what comes next after you’ve been successfully operating for at least a year. Consider taking on more office space, or possibly taking someone else on.

Properly prepare for the interview.",How to Become a Career Consultant2," Different career consulting firms look for different types of education. Many will require a bachelor's degree at minimum. Because there aren't many specific majors in college that apply directly to career consulting, firms will often base their decision to hire you on your personality, experience, and desire to succeed.


Some good majors for career consulting include business management, psychology, counseling, and vocational psychology.Getting your master's or P.h.D. in counseling may open up more job opportunities and get you higher pay.

, More often, employers are looking at social media and your digital presence before they decide to hire you. In fact, a staggering 93% of all hiring managers will take a look at your social media before they decide to hire you.Market everything from your profile picture to the content on your social media accounts. Post things that would make you look desirable to a firm or an employer.


Things like volunteer work or career advice would look great to a firm.
Having a website that lists your expertise would also be a good idea.
Avoid taboo subjects or taking extreme stances and avoid posting illicit or inappropriate photos.

, Career consultancy firms work with a broad range of people from different backgrounds. Being able to communicate effectively to people is something that firms will be looking for during the interview.Effective communication does not only mean that you can articulate your thoughts, but it also includes being able to actively listen and understand the perspective of the person that you're trying to help. Think of your responses before you say them, and stay away from anything that could come off as inappropriate.


Practice active listening by listening to the person who is talking and internalize what they are saying. Reflect what they are saying by repeating them or rephrasing what they just said to you.This shows that you're listening and understanding where they are coming from.

, Career consultancy firms will be looking for confidence when selecting someone to work at their company. Having confidence is something that will ease clients and help them accept your professional advice.Dress as well as you can and maintain good hygiene. Make sure to keep your posture straight and articulate your words. Raising your tone at the end of the sentence can make you appear less confident, so make sure to use a firm and bold tone of voice.Looking and feeling confident on the interview will also increase your chances of landing a job.
Maintaining a healthy amount of eye contact will also make you appear more confident to the firm.

, Check with your university if they have a coop or intern programs available and work with a career coach at your school to help place you. If no such program exists, do research on career consultancy firms and look for intern or fellowship opportunities on their websites. If you can't find one, then help out at your university's career center while you're perusing your undergraduate degree. This will give you insight into the day-to-day operations of a career counselor and could influence your decision to be an adviser.


While you won't be working directly with clients or students, you'll be able to examine and learn from people who are doing it professionally.
You will also gain network contacts that you can call on post-graduation for help.

, Look for career consulting firms on popular job boards or search for consulting firms in your area. Once you find some companies that you are interested in, visit their websites and look under careers to see if there are any jobs available. Make sure that your education and experience match the job listing before applying.

, Preparing for the interview includes having clean, pressed clothing. Be as professional looking as possible and wear a suit. Before a firm hires you to manage other people's careers, they will want to be sure that you can come off as being able to handle your life. Work on things like your posture, vocal intonation, and communicating effectively to nail the interview and get the job.


Use gestures while you talk but don't go overboard and seem frantic. Keeping your palms face up will make you appear more open.Write down and practice responses to commonly asked interview questions before you go in.

Use your time as you work for companies to gain networking connections that could open up leads in the future. You must have the expertise to devise sound strategies that will fulfill your client's career goals.


It may be hard to get new customers if you don't have a proven track record.

, Determine your five-year plan and think about where you want to take your career consulting. You can either stay independent, or start building a team of people to mentor and build your own firm. Decide how much money you want to make as a career consultant so that you know which industries are viable for your goals.


Helping higher end clients land jobs may make you more money in commission.
Make sure that you have a good understanding of business before you go independent.

, As a career consultant, it's important that you have a full understanding of the sector that you're helping people find jobs in. While you don't have to have mastery over the actual work that your clients do, knowing what employers are looking for, common pitfalls of the industry, average salaries and benefits packages, and common traits or skills that are required for the job. It will better enable you to make decisions when it comes to placement for some of the people you're trying to get jobs.


Most professional career coaches specialize in a particular industry.Industries could include consumer products, healthcare, energy, banking, marketing, or technology jobs.

, Make sure that you have a functioning website and have accounts on the most popular social media like LinkedIn and Twitter. Try to gain a following of people online. Provide career advice through social media and try to get it reposted on other blogs.Your website should also be functional and enable visitors to easily contact you.


Make as many connections as you can online so you can increase the exposure for your career related posts.
Be careful not to post anything inflammatory or inappropriate, or it may damage your professional career.
Your website should display your previous success as well as feature your greatest talents and skills.

, Reach out to people that need career management and work with them on their careers. Evaluate their education, experience, skill, in conjunction with their industry of choice to determine if they should find more productive employment opportunities. Reach out to people via social media and talk to employers about job openings that are available. Talk to everyone that you can work within the industry. Do not rely on one client because things can always change quickly.


Because you're independent, you may have a harder time convincing people to hire you before you have a proven record of success.Connect with people on a personal and emotional level by enticing them with a potential future in a better job.
You can say something like, ""I was reaching out to talk to you about your position at SunGard. It's a great company, but I really think with your expertise, the sky's the limit. Hire me, and I'll find you a position you really deserve.""

, Established procedures will allow you to work more like a business. Come up with a standardized way to on-board new customers, do your job search, or contact customers. This could include creating online forms so that you can store client information, or ensuring that you keep in touch with each client on a daily basis using a calendar. Whatever your process is, make sure that you standardize it to save time and effort as you begin to take on more work.


You can take the experience that you've gained from other companies and implement it into your own process.

, Career counseling is an old job but always changes with the changing employment landscape. Talking to other career counselors could help give you the insight that you need to make your operation more efficient or resolve a complex issue that you have with a particular client. Attend workshops or conferences to meet up with other counselors and learn more about the newest techniques in career counseling.

Stay current in your field of expertise.,
Balance your freelancing with the realities of administration.,
Make payments on time.,
Be self disciplined.,
Move out of your comfort zone.,
Don't sit around waiting for work.",How to Avoid the Pitfalls of Freelancing," Despite the fact that you might have 20 years of experience in your field, and have spent a great deal of time working on a particular project in a government department or a big corporation, this doesn't mean that those skills will carry you on forever. Things change and ideas move on. New discoveries mean that students in university now are learning things that you should be aware of but might not be if you assume that you already know it all. The means by which you can stay current and well informed include:


Subscribe to relevant publications online or in print; the journalists and editors will do all the work for you so that all you have to do is read.
Attend seminars, guest talks, workshops, etc., in your field.
Join a professional society or networking group in your field; attend their meetings regularly for updates and exchanges of information.
Go back to school. Not intensely, just find short refresher courses targeted at professionals or tradespeople in your field.
Listening to clients when they tell you that they have heard about this ""new such and such"". If you don't know what it is that they're referring to, go and find out! And always assure them that you'll get back to them on that point.;
, Freelancing is an opportunity to pursue the work that you love doing and are good at. However, it is not an excuse to avoid the mundane administration activities accompanying freelance work. Always keep up-to-date with the administrative side of things by setting aside regular times to prepare and pay invoices, do filing, contact late payers, follow up missing items, tidy your space, etc. Even networking can be viewed as a chore but it is essential when you are freelancing, so set aside time for this as well. Once you are into a routine, it will become easier and you'll be more accepting of the need to be methodical.

, You expect your clients to pay you on time. It is also important for you to pay those you owe on time. Paperwork doesn't just disappear; it has a nasty habit of piling up when you ignore it and then the complaints begin flowing in. The way to stay on top of paperwork is to not treat it like a mountain but to break it down:


Open all invoices upon receipt (using the time you've set aside for administration each day).
Write the check or make the internet payment as soon as you can during the allotted administration time.
Keep all receipts for payments in a safe place, in order if possible. This is important for billing clients for expenses, for taxation purposes, and for record-keeping generally.

, It can be too easy to allow the days to flow into one another, promising yourself there is plenty of time to get around to the job later. When something becomes monotonous and less interesting, remind yourself that it is an essential part of task completion. Try to vary the monotonous things with the more interesting things that you're working on. Give yourself many short breaks rather than one long, never-ending break. The small refreshers will revive you and the reward of persevering is the completion of the tasks at hand.

, A big trap of freelancing is to stay with the work you know inside out and not move into new areas related to what you're doing. Be open to new opportunities as they come up and rise to the challenge. If you're concerned that your skills aren't good enough, learn about the ways to improve them and go about doing so. It's often all right to explain to a client that you're new to a certain aspect of the work and that it might take longer for you get it right; in that case, you might even consider offering them a discounted rate to serve as your ""guinea pig"". Whatever it is, don't let the opportunities to grow pass you by.

, Work doesn't grow on trees and work doesn't find us. We get out there and find the work. That's the way of the world. Until you are so much in demand that you're turning away clients, you are going to have to do the footwork yourself. Get out there and find the clients – network, attend trade fairs, attend professional events, attend business get-togethers and schmooze in the way that befits you. Listen carefully when networking and pick up on the things people need done. And don't be too shy to offer your services to a firm out of the blue by writing to them and suggesting that you have noticed their website/brochures/décor/dirty floors, etc. and offer your services as being new/less expensive/more cutting edge/more understanding than whoever is currently providing those services. You won't know unless you try.

You need to know how much you can spend on flyers, posters or other promotional materials to be successful as a street promoter. Determine the total amount you have to spend on printing and flyers so you know how detailed you can afford to make your promotional materials and how many you can print.;
,


Be a good street promoter by creating a flyer that will catch the eyes of potential clients or attendees and get them interested in the venue or event you're promoting. Use full-color graphics or logos and print all important information about the event or your company in a bold, easy-to-read font.

,


Determine what target audience you want to attract before you hit the streets when you work as a street promoter. This will help you target specific areas to find the right people with your flyers. If you want a young, hip crowd, promote on college campuses. Try your city's business district at lunchtime for wealthy or accomplished professionals.

,


You have to get noticed to be an effective street promoter, so create some way to catch the attention of your target audience. This can be as simple as a t-shirt or costume with a logo on it or as elaborate as a song or table set up with giveaways. Be sure it matches the theme of what you're promoting and the audience you're targeting.

,


You'll need to be able to cover a lot of distance in a limited amount of time to effectively spread your message as a street promoter, so wear comfortable shoes to make it easier. You should look friendly and approachable, but still be dressed comfortably and nicely so people will want you to approach them and want to hear what you have to say.

,


Review all the important facts about the venue or event you're promoting before you hit the streets. It's important to be able to highlight details like a guest DJ or prize giveaways to attract attention, as well as be able to answer any logistical questions about location or cover charge.

,


Be sure all your street promoting efforts are legal to avoid fines or penalties. Only put flyers on car windows or hand them out on public property, not private, and be sure to check with business owners for permission before putting posters in their windows or on buildings.

For example, a birthday card might include an airplane if the client recently earned their pilot's license., Give clients souvenirs which they are likely to keep with your contact information on them. Pens are popular items, but may get lost, plus they are common. You might consider calendar magnets, novelty items such as desk games, or helpful tips on a magnet (and/or wallet-size card). People will often display inexpensive trophies., If you are a workshop leader, party planner, etc., consider presenting your client with a framed photograph of the event or certificate, which they might display at the office. Be sure your contact information appears on the item.


When you give a certificate or photo to a client think about what you would like them to do with it. For example:

A framed certificate or photo is ready to be hung on the wall.
A photo or certificate in a nice folder is likely to be placed in a filing cabinet., Two to three weeks after completing your business with the client, send them a simple survey. This survey should be very brief, and simply ask customers about what they liked and if they have any suggestions for you. This shows clients that you care about improving your service or product.


This survey can be sent through the mail, but it is much easier to organize and send your survey online."

Ask for help.",How to Stay in Contact With Your Clients2," If you are sponsoring or attending an event which you think your clients would be interested in, invite them to join you. Alternatively, send them a note saying ""I hope to see you at this event"", along with the event publicity materials., When attending a trade show, professional meeting, or other venue where your clients might also be visiting, actively look for the clients. Spend a few minutes to talk to them when you see them and to remind them that you remain interested in their wellbeing.


Make a list of people who might be attending the show before going and make a point to seek them out or visit their trade show table (if they have one).For example, ask about their children. How did the little league season work out?

, When you conclude your current sale or project, finish by inviting your client to call you whenever they have a question which you may be able to help them with. Make it clear that this is never an imposition and that you welcome such continued linkages.


To get a more face-to-face experience, you can offer to video chat with your clients using a service like Skype. This can be more personal than a phone call., Whenever you have a question which might benefit from your client's expertise, call on them. Of course, be thoughtful about how often you do this and to what extent you expect their help, but this can be an effective way to stay in touch over time."

Browse your feed on these websites regularly and look out for posts made by your clients. Also remember to update your own page regularly with information about your business efforts and links to relevant online articles., Certain online services offer ways to track mentions of your clients on social media or news platforms. Using one of these services, like Google Alerts, Talkwalker, or Mention, can help you find opportunities to get back in touch with your clients. You can set these services up to track the client's name, company, industry, or anything else of interest to them.


Once you get an alert on a client, try reaching out to them with a ""this made me think of you"" or ""I heard about ____. What do you think about it?"", When you see a posting of theirs which you like, comment on it or ""like"" it. This is especially important for blog posts or website article that your clients write. Many of these posts don't get any comments or ""likes."" This means that your interaction will stand out. Just make sure that you leave a thoughtful comment that shows that you actually read the piece., When you see your clients are online at the same time as you are, say hello now and then. Take advantage of the ease of Facebook messenger or Google Chat and check in on your clients., LinkedIn allows you to recommend other members based on business interactions you've had in the past. Use this service to write a glowing recommendation of the client. If you're subtle about it, you may even be able to plug your own services in the process.


You may also see an opportunity to link previous clients together in a shared business interest. Recommend one client to the other, and make the introduction."

Most prolific bloggers can tell you that money should not be your key goal. It'd be like purposefully picking up a bad gambling habit in the hopes you one day hit it big. So find a site that can let you do what you love, check out the competition, and get to know your new environment.;
, You've passed the point of no return. You'll soon find yourself in a middle-of-the-night sugar-induced stupor, going through your work making sure your commas are rightfully placed and your photo captions are as quippy as can be. But, wait. What is your content actually about? You have an idea for that, right?


Ideally, there will be some void you can fill. The Internet is so huge now that people don't go on it to pay for things they can get for free or even to be marginally entertained. They want to learn things, to get inspired, to laugh their butts off. The only way traffic will come to your blog is if you offer something other people can't. So what's unique to you? What do you know better than anyone else out there in the blogosphere? And then blog about it.

Before you can go any further, just figure out your blog's name, what your content is going to focus on, and who you're appealing to. Then you can go to the next step! Which is...

, It takes money to make money, you know? And they're really not that expensive in the scheme of things -- maybe $100 or so. You could also blackmail a friend of yours into it if you know of someone who's good at web design and would be easy to blackmail. It may seem like an unnecessary step, but the attention span of Internet surfers is becoming infinitely more microscopic by the day; if your blog doesn't look good, the content doesn't matter.


Check out your competition. What do others do that works? What kind of setup is the most user-friendly? What is the most aesthetically pleasing? What color scheme matches the feel of your content?

, In 2013, Tumblr had 101 million blogs. Wordpress and Livejournal? 63 million each. That's not even including Blogger, Weebly, and all the other independent sites out there.So, needless to say, you're not in a small pond. And the number of these blogs that make money? The profitable one is the needle in the haystack. So don't quit your passions, but do keep a logical head about it.


If you do end up making money, it won't be tomorrow. It won't be this week, it won't be this month, and it probably won't even be this year. You've got to build up yourself, your name, and your blog before the money will start rolling in. Would you pay anyone money on a smile and a promise? Didn't think so. So keep blogging.

, Let's get to some real talk kay? If you blog like wit terrible style you won't develop a good website. Just those two sentences are painful. So even if you have a good idea, put it to the written word and put it to the written word well. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Your writing skills need to be on the money. If you'd get last place in the spelling bee or if constructing a legible email is difficult, have a friend go over your work for you.
Think about the length of your blogs. You want sufficient content, but you don't want to drone on and on for so long that it's off-putting. How can you break it up to make it appealing to the masses?
Pictures. Pictures are great. Everyone loves pictures. Correction: everyone loves good pictures. In addition to writing skills, make sure your photography skills are on the money, too.
Have something to say. Talking about your ex-boyfriend Matt's curiously small left nipple doesn't count. Have something people want to read about for minutes at a time. And keep it chatty -- talking like a commercial won't get 'em lining up anytime soon.

, Here's the thing about blogging: to do it well, it's a full time job. But you gotta have a source of income somehow, right? So keep your day job for now and put in time with your blog at night. You'll be busy, but this schedule is only temporary. You can tell your boss where to stick it when the money starts rolling in.

, Maybe two things. In order to develop a following, your blog can't be Seinfeld, as great as that may be. It needs to be about something in particular. It needs to be searchable. It needs to appeal to certain demographics. If you have a great life story, it can be a memoir, but it has to be a great life story. You just have to actually have something to say.


Advertisers won't know what to do with your blog if you don't have something definable about it. What kind of people do you reach? What's the appeal? So whether you're blogging about being a mom, starting your own business, or being a paparazzo in LA, make it your thing if for no other reason than the inevitable piles of money you'll be raking in.

, We've kinda drilled home the ""have a niche"" part, haven't we? Well, it deserves repeating. On the proverbial wheel that is the blog, have a spoke to yourself. Have something you do so well and so uniquely that the competition isn't really there. And as for credibility, there are a few ways to establish that:


Time. It sucks, but with longevity comes wisdom and reputation.
Never steal anybody else's content. Even if you're inspired by someone else, give them credit. They may respond in kind!
Do your research. Think of it like writing for a newspaper: you want to fact check as much as possible. You want to make sure you have all sides of the story. So before you go spouting off about how Kim Kardashian used to be a man, have a quick chat with Google. It'll pay off.

, If you've gone through this list and ticked 'em all off, you are now a valuable member of some blogging community. Now within that community, start linking to your blog like you'd throw a handful of glittery confetti. Get it everywhere. Make friends. Get involved. And when you link on theirs, they'll link on yours, and the symbiotic relationships will bloom.


So when Marge has a recipe up for Salted Caramel Bonbons and you have a recipe for Caramel Salted Bonbons, hit Marge up! Comment on her blog and say, ""Marge! I love your stuff as usual. I made these last week and wanted to mix it up, so I made my own Caramel Salted Bonbons. You should check it out and let me know what you think!"" How could Marge resist?

, The blogs that make money are by people who work on them 30, 40 hours a week.It's easy to think being a blogger means sitting at home in your PJ's waiting for creativity to strike. Oh no, no, no, young padawan. It's taking pictures, processing them, writing notes, writing posts, editing posts, dealing with emails, processing mail, all in addition to finding inspiration. It's really just office work under the thin veil of homemade lattes and 2 PM yoga classes.And that's just the half of it. Eventually there will be dealing with ads, sponsors, lawyers, agents, stalker-y fans (hopefully), book signings, giving talks, and the inevitable technical issues and PayPal snafus. Remember when we said you could quit your day job eventually? Well, that time is coming up shortly.

, Blogging isn't exactly the rarest of hobbies. You can actually take classes on it at community colleges and the like. You may feel like it's something you can just feel out -- but if you want to make money, it's good to know all there is out there to know. So take a class! You'll get into design, maybe even some HTML or CSS, and understand just how the marketing side works. You're investing in yourself, really.


This is a hot topic in non-traditional, adult classes. You don't have to enroll in school again! Check out your local community center or some of the smaller educational institutions in your area. Or even private seminars or workshops. Who knows? Maybe one day the person giving the seminar will be you!

, We're finally getting the meat of the issue: making money. Since it won't just magically appear in your lap overnight, you gotta create a media kit to let advertisers know just who and what they're dealing with. It's basically putting you into a nutshell and telling them succinctly why they should be paying you money. Your business card, if you will. Here's what you need to include:Blog name, address, and tagline
Brief description of your purpose/niche and the author(s)
Your target audience and follower counts (everything from Twitter to LinkedIn to email subscribers)
Significant rankings, press mentions, awards
Contact info
Advertising options (more about this -- and what to charge -- next)

Keep it short and sweet, but don't be afraid to brag a little. You are selling yourself, after all. Routinely update it and use others' kits to emulate, if need be.



, It's the step right before making money: do a good job promoting and the followers will start growing like weeds. And, of course, with more followers, it's way easier to sell ads. Here are a few ideas:


Tweet and Facebook your blog posts. Attack social media with a vengeance.

Use StumbleUpon. It has millions of users that are just looking for topical, interesting content. Submit your site and you could be the next gem they find.

Create an RSS feed. Then each time you post something new, your followers will be automatically alerted.
Pinterest, Google+, Digg, and Reddit are all great sites to think about using to promote your goods, too.

, If you have the best content this side of the Milky Way galaxy, it doesn't matter if no one's seeing it. You've gotta make it so your blog is seen. How do you do this? Basically, make it so Google likes you. The higher your page is ranked, the more accessible it is.


A lot of this has to do with search engine optimization, or SEO. When someone searches ""Caramel Salted Bonbons,"" you don't want yours to be on the 5th search results page.
Keywords are huge, too. If you know what your audience is searching, you can cater your content to it. The more your content matches, the more relevant your blog will seem. Just don't cater it so much you seem like a keyword-mongering sellout.

, If you plant your URL on others' pages and leave it at that, that's a little rude. You want to develop friendships, a reputation, and to be a mainstay in whatever community you're a part of. So reach out! Talk to other bloggers. Answer your emails. Stay active with your readers. Be a real person. When you get more involved, you dig yourself a deeper, sturdier role in the blogging world.


People can start deferring to you. It'll be great! When you've already done something, others will link to it, possibly modify it, and get the word out about you for you. It's all about networking, whether it's real life or not.

, Really, ""cost"" is an idea somebody made up. It's about what you're willing to pay -- in this case, it's about what you're willing to charge. If you're at a complete loss as to what you think your blog's value is, look at similar blogs. Shoot the author an email if they don't have it up on their ""sponsor me"" page. And speaking of which -- you should have one of those pages, too!


Another way to go about it is to go to BlogAds.com. They have a seemingly infinite list of blogs sorted by category and traffic -- you can find one similar to yours and look at the prices by the week or month.You'll want to start thinking about renewal rates and bulk packaging, too. If you get ads for six months, do they get a deal? What about if they advertise over several of your sites? You'll have to keep in touch with them when the ads are up, too!
And when you get paid, is it through PayPal? If so, they may take a cut -- so figure that into your pricing!

, This is where it starts to get real. It's your bread and butter. You have a number of options, so let's break them down. Here are your two main options:Placing ads. The best places to get these? Google Adsense (the biggest), Kontera, AdBrite, Adgenta, Text Link Ads, and Tribal Fusion.
Affiliate programs (you have a product, link to their site to buy it). That means Amazon Associates, LinkShare, eBay Associates, Commission Junction, and AllPosters.

And then you'll have to think about what kind of ads you want to run. Banner? Text? Paid links? Box, badge, or skyscraper?



, These are ads that you have to go and find yourself -- think about when you were on yearbook staff at high school and needed to fill those last pages. But if your blog is well-established enough, this can be a very viable of source of income. You just have to know who to ask.


Your media kit will come in super handy right about now. When you find a company that you think would fit your blog, you'll need to convince them that they'll be reaching new customers through you. Got your salesman cap on?

, There are a ton of businesses out there that will pay you to talk about and review their products. PayPerPost, PayU2Blog, SocialSpark, ReviewMe, and Sverve, just to name a few. Ideally they fit into your content, otherwise your blog will lose the unique flavor you give it. If you do this, just make sure it's relevant, accurate, and entertaining.


Each site is a bit different and so is each product. One review could get you $200, while another, similar one, warrants $20.It's not consistent money, but it can pad that budget.

, Another way to get money, without ads, to is have part of your blog be exclusive. Meaning some of the content is open, but some isn't and requires a fee -- under the guise of a membership, of course. Members have access to things normal readers don't (those plebeians), they get that gold star feel, and you get the cash. Just make sure you have something to offer them!

, Loads of people are turning to creating their own products: namely ebooks. If you're into cooking, you could release a cookbook in the form of an ebook full of brand new recipes you don't have publicly available on your site. If you're telling people how to start a business, you could have the complete guide readily available. Or you could always invent the next iPhone, but that might be a bit ambitious and by that point you might be too big for your blog.


Plenty of bloggers turn into legit writers. We're talking book deals here. So if you're wondering what the next step is beyond being a successful blogger, it's getting published. So if this workload isn't enough, start working on your next masterpiece! It's about time to add ""New York Times Bestseller"" to that media kit of yours, isn't it?

Clean your neti pot.",How to Use a Neti Pot," As a result of sitting in disuse for a bit, your neti pot likely has become the home of some local bacteria. Prevent these germs from entering your system by thoroughly cleaning it with soap and hot water. Allow the pot to air dry completely before use.






;
, Mix a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of finely ground non-iodized salt or a slightly rounded 1/2 teaspoon of coarsely ground salt (kosher salt) in the neti pot with 8 ounces of warm distilled, boiled, or filtered water until the salt is completely dissolved.









Do not use untreated tap water as it can contain amoebas which will make you sick. It is crucial to use filtered or distilled water.Do not use normal table salt. The additives in it can irritate your nose.There are commercial salts available specifically for neti pot use instead., Bend over the sink and turn your head to the side so that your ear is facing the sink. Keep your forehead at the same height as the chin, or slightly higher. You will eventually turn your head slightly so that the saline solution flows out of your opposite nostril.








, In order to close off your throat and mouth from the water rinse, breathe through your mouth. Avoid talking or laughing so that the seal in your throat is not broken, allowing water in.








, Hold it in such a way as to form a seal, preventing water from coming back out the entrance. Raise the pot so the saline solution flows into the upper nostril and out of the lower nostril. If it drains out of your mouth, lower your forehead in relation to your chin. Empty ½ of the pot per nostril.








, Turn your head in the opposite direction and repeat the aforementioned instructions. Use the other half of the saline solution to clear out your opposite nostril.








, When you’ve drained the entire neti pot, rest your head over the sink and blow your nose gently (without using your fingers to pinch it) to remove the excess water. Do this until most of the dripping has subsided and you can breathe relatively easily again.








, Remove the rest of the water and completely clear out your nose by blowing into a tissue. Be sure not to close off either nostril while blowing.








, To prevent high levels of bacteria growth in and on your neti pot, give it a final wash before putting it away for storage. Use warm soap and water and allow the pot to air dry.

Be sure that you're comfortable with writing, that it is a medium in which you can express yourself with ease and clarity, and that it is something you don't mind doing almost every single day of your life without respite. If you don't already have writing qualifications, consider doing a college degree in journalism or English, or taking a workshop so that you're at least aware of the major requirements in writing, and the terminology used. Even if you already have a degree in a non-writing related course, you may find it easier to either get a writing diploma or to get an entry-level job as a copywriter or editor in a field related to what you graduated in.


Decide whether you prefer fiction or non-fiction or perhaps even both. Non-fiction is much easier to sell than fiction,so bear this in mind when making your choice. If you're writing for fun, you have more leeway to experiment, though.
Decide whether you want to write for a living, for extra money, or for fun. The reason for your freelance writing will impact the approach that you take to running your freelance operation. Bear in mind that treating freelance writing as a full-time income will require a lot of hard work and establishing yourself in the niche, so be prepared to put in the effort and time.
If you already have qualifications, from a degree to a diploma, always make use of these to support your expertise. These are extremely helpful in a competitive world where many people are seeking the same thing but who don't have the qualifications to stand out.;
, Unless you want to be the hermit novelist living in poverty, you'll need to reach out to other people as a freelance writer. You'll need to be prepared to market yourself, to drum up business, and to chase leads. You will also need to be happy to turn around work quickly and according to the client's or employer's needs and changes, and all of this requires good negotiation and interaction skills. Fortunately, much of this can be done by email, meaning that you can rely on writing to connect but it does mean you'll need to be prepared to put yourself out there and not just sit about waiting for leads.


As part of this, you'll need to know how to write a query letter. A query letter explains the concept of what you're proposing to write, along with a very brief explanation of your experience and qualifications. This letter has to sell your idea to an editor, blog owner, or website operator and will become a regular part of your toolkit. The sooner you're comfortable with it, the better.

, No matter how much you love writing, there will be occasional writing jobs that you'll hate doing. In this situation, you'll need to learn the art of ""just doing it"" regardless of your feelings, your desire to procrastinate, and your temptation to rush through it. Master pushing through the dislike barrier by treating it as the work that it is and looking forward to the more interesting writing coming up. Some freelance writers find it helps to maintain their own writing on the side, as a means for ensuring that at least something they're writing remains a pure joy.

, Working from home or for yourself can be very lonely at times (no matter how much you love your writing) and you can feel as if you're working in a vacuum. Part of the answer to this is to accept the unusual (and often liberating) nature of being a freelance writer; the other part is to get out and be around people as much as you can. Get portable by having a notebook or laptop, and portable Wi-Fi access, and go and write around people when you're feeling lonely – a cafe, a library, a park, anywhere that you feel involved in society again. You might find you need to do this regularly, or every now and then; just find your own rhythm and don't box yourself inside your house all day.

, If you're planning on making a career from writing freelance, you'll need to have a good sense of responsibility toward your clients or employers and yourself.


Have financial systems set up before you start taking in work and be regular with your invoicing, tax filing, and reconciliation of accounts. You cannot afford to be sloppy when it comes to your income!
Be organized; have a dedicated writing space, all of your reference books in one place and easily obtained, all the writing equipment that you need in good working order, and a decent ergonomic work station set-up. Writing daily can do terrible things to your posture if you don't take good care of it!
Have a deadline system in place. Whether you use a diary, an online reminder system, a wall chart, a whiteboard, or whatever, be sure to have some sort of system in place that allows you to see at a glance what writing work is due when and for whom. That way you can prioritize accordingly and not have last minute rushes.
Communicate well and regularly. It's very important that you feel comfortable reaching out to people to make queries, to reassure them of your skills and ability to meet deadlines, and to keep clients and companies informed as to your progress and any issues that may come up.
Don't take on more than you can do. Part of being organized is knowing your limits. Once you do get into a flow of regular writing, don't be lulled into a false sense of confidence that you can do more than the hours in the day. Remember to maintain a good balance in your daily life.

, If you plan to write magazine, online, and newspaper articles, don't quit your day job until you're making enough money to sustain your lifestyle. This means that you might have to do your writing in the early morning or in the evening or whenever you have a spare moment, such as on the weekends. However, it's good practice to trial your writing aspirations in this way because it provides you with the opportunity to see whether you enjoy writing under pressure and across a broad range of different topics. It also gives you the opportunity to work out whether you can write well enough.


Visit the reference section of your local bookstore and buy a copy of ""The Writer's Market"". This will give you the know-how of writing in easy-to-digest guides.
There are numerous exercises you can do to increase your abilities as an author- submit letters to the editor of your local newspaper, write articles for your church bulletin, create a blog, even write articles for wikiHow.

, There are writing groups and freelance writer associations in many countries and it's a good idea to belong to them so that you can meet other writers, get information and advice, and establish your credentials as a writer. A quick search online should find organizations in your local area or country. Look for a group that has meet-ups, seminars, guest speakers, and offers advice on all aspects of writing including publishing and marketing, as well as having contacts with publishers and networking opportunities. Many of these groups may also be an excellent resource for writing job leads, so being a part of them will soon pay back in terms of contacts and work offers.


Attend conferences and conventions that focus solely on writing, authors, and freelance writing. You can meet publishing professionals on these occasions, as well as having the opportunity to network with other freelancers.
In the United States, you can subscribe to ""The Writer"", a publication which provides information and advice on writing a query letter, finding publishing houses, and how to run a writing business. It's an excellent resource if you're keen to become a full-time magazine writer.

, These days the choice includes print writing (magazines, trade publications, newsletters, and newspapers) and online writing. It's possible to do both, although you may find yourself very stretched trying to keep up. Even within the online writing sphere, there are various possibilities, including blog writing, guest blog writing, topic specific websites (for example, green living, pet care, collectibles, etc.), ""article mill"" sites (these vary in their quality), and so forth. There is also official writing for government, but for this type of writing you'll often need qualifications and experience in the policy-making areas you'll be writing for; contact a company that handles such writing to ask them what they're looking for.


Be aware that many print publications such as newsletters and trade publications are done in-house or outsourced to a company specializing in writing. In this case, you may be better off trying to get on the books of a company that is happy for you to do freelance work across a range of topics using their contacts. They'll take a commission but you'll gain the benefit of their expertise and established market.

, Initially it is important to establish your credentials and build a portfolio. It may be simplest to begin by writing for small, non-paying publications and websites. By writing articles for smaller publications, you will gain experience, get known, and get a bunch of published articles with your name on them that you can use to show clients and employers. You need that portfolio for established publications to take you seriously and hire you. Visit your local library to get lists of publishers and ideas for whom to contact.


Submit a poem or story to a children's magazine such as Owl if you're a young person.
If you're a teenager, join your school's yearbook committee and submit articles to the school newspaper. Regard this effort as good practice for your future freelance career.
If you're a college or university student, craft strong, well-written essays for class that you might be able to later get published. You can also offer your services at the writing lab, and write articles for the student newspaper, literary magazine, and alumni magazine.
For an adult, start with reputable online sites that accept articles – make contact with the owners of sites and blogs that you admire and explain that you're building up your portfolio and would like to write some pieces for free in return for your name being publicized. If you have your own blog or website, this can help you as you can include it as a backlink with your name.

Non-profits are also excellent places to find writing work. Donate your time and effort and get your work published in their newsletters and publications and use those as part of your portfolio.
Turn your best articles into PDFs that can be easily emailed to potential employers or clients.

, When you feel that you're capable of writing professionally, think of something you'd like to write about, then start contacting the relevant people. Find publishers you'd like to write for, then read their guidelines. This cannot be over-emphasized - sending queries and articles in that have nothing to do with the publication is as bad as turning up to a job interview never having researched the company. Know your market and target your writing accordingly. And always send a query letter to a major publication before submitting a completed article, unless you're submitting ""on spec"", or you're happy to waste precious time on an article that may never be published.


For a newspaper: Send a query letter to the city/lifestyles/sports editor of your local newspaper asking if they're interested in publishing an article on the topic. Include the first paragraph of your article and an outline of the rest. Call in two weeks if you don't get a reply. Another approach is to send in a completed article for them to consider ""on spec"". In this case, the editor will read it but doesn't have to publish it.
Magazine or other major publication: Think of something you'd like to write about, then send a query letter to the editor of a pertinent major publication asking if they're interested in publishing an article on the topic. Include the first paragraph of your article and an outline of the rest. Call in four to six weeks if you don't get a reply.
Online: Check online job boards for columnists, bloggers, web content creators, and other writing jobs. Use a query letter approach in an email if it seems appropriate, or simply respond in a straightforward manner to the job's description. For guest blogging, make it clear you have read and enjoyed the blog in question and keep your suggestion short and sweet. Good blogs get an an overwhelming amount of requests and yours needs to stand out to make the blogger want to even read it. For article sites, if they require you to apply to be an approved author, then do so and supply all the needed background information and proof of your qualifications. For those sites that don't need anything more than joining, get on with it and join but don't rely on these sites to make a living!

, If you haven't already sent a full article but just the query, then it's time to get started once the client or employer confirms that they want your writing. (Congratulations, by the way.) Write in your own unique and brilliant way and avoid conforming to the mold of other writers. By all means conform to the required guidelines of the publication in question, but try to avoid cliches, hackneyed turns of phrase, dull prose, and deadly boring content. You've got that worked out already, right?


Keep a thesaurus, dictionary, and grammar book with you at all times. If you're writing in an English that isn't your own dialect, or isn't your native language, also have a grammar resource for the English in which you are writing.

, There are plenty of possibilities in both print media and online media. The difficulty will always be the competition, so you'll need to keep your style sharp and interesting, your list of contacts detailed, and your motivation stoked. Keep improving your writing skills by reading widely, attending relevant talks and seminars, and staying up-to-date in the areas you're writing about. This is especially important if you're writing in areas that change rapidly, such as technology and fashion.


Update your portfolio every time you have an article published.
Learn from your editor's comments. Fix your grammar quirks, mend your heavy prose, and celebrate the fact that someone is giving you golden advice on how to improve your writing skills.

Experiment with phototherapy.",How to Treat Dyshidrotic Eczema," Cold compresses can help relieve the itching and/or burning sensation caused by eczema.Cold therapy can also reduce the inflammation of the blisters and help numb the irritated nerve endings with generate pain. Soak a clean, soft cloth in cold water and put it in the fridge for a few hours before wrapping around your inflamed hands or feet.


Wrap your inflamed skin with the cold compress for at least 15 minutes, two to three times daily or as needed.
To make the cold compress last a little longer, place crushed ice in a small plastic bag and wrap it with a soft cloth before applying to your skin.
Avoid soaking your inflamed hands or feet in ice — it may give relief initially, but it can cause shock to your blood vessels and lead to frost bite.;
, Aloe vera gel is a popular herbal remedy for inflamed and irritated skin. It has a strong ability to not only soothe irritated itchy skin and reduce tenderness caused by dyshidrotic eczema, but it also significantly speeds up the healing process.Aloe vera also has antimicrobial properties, which is helpful if your eczema is triggered or exacerbated by fungal or bacterial infections. Applying aloe vera multiple times per day for the first few days after you notice redness and irritation on your hands or feet can make a significant impact on combating eczema.


Aloe Vera contains polysaccharides (complex sugars) that help to hydrate skin and keep it moisturized. It can also trigger the production of collagen, which gives skin its elasticity.
If you have an aloe plant in your garden, break off a leaf and apply the thick inner gel / juice directly to your irritated skin.
Alternatively, buy a bottle of pure aloe gel from a pharmacy. For best effects, place the gel in the refrigerator and apply it after it becomes cool.

, Oatmeal is another home remedy for soothing irritated skin. It works fairly quickly to reduce inflamed and itchy skin. Oat extract contains compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties, which is helpful to soothe skin inflicted with eczema.Thus, make a batch of oatmeal (not too thick), cool it down for a few hours in the fridge and then apply it directly to your inflamed skin, allowing it to dry. Rinse it off with some running water, but do so gently because oatmeal also acts as a mild exfoliator and you don't want to further irritate your skin.


As an alternative, buy finely ground oatmeal (sold as colloidal oatmeal in health food stores and pharmacies) and mix it with cool water in a small basin or foot bath and soak your hands or feet for 15-20 minutes on a daily basis.
As a money saving idea, make your own finely ground oatmeal by pulverizing a handful of instant or slow-cooking oatmeal in a blender until it has a smooth, fine consistency. You'll find that the finely ground oatmeal mixes with water much better.

, Heavy ointments such as petroleum jelly (Vaseline), mineral oil or vegetable shortening are commonly recommended for eczema because it holds moisture in the skin and provides a layer of protection from potential irritants.Alternatively, creams such as Eucerin and Lubriderm are thicker than most lotions and may also be similarly helpful, although they will have to be reapplied more often than ointments because they get absorbed quicker. Moisturize your skin throughout the day, particularly after taking a bath or shower, to keep water sealed in and to prevent skin dryness / cracking.


If the eczema is particularly itchy and irritating, consider applying some hydrocortisone cream. Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream (less than 1%) is helpful for quickly reducing pain and swelling.
Take the time to massage the cream or ointment into the crevices between your toes and/or fingers, as those are the areas often affected by dyshidrotic eczema.

, Over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratadine (Claritin, Alavert, others) can help relieve the itching and inflammation response that's characteristic of eczema.More specifically, antihistamines block the action of histamine, which is produced during allergic-type reactions.


Reducing the amount of circulating histamine tends to minimize the expansion (dilation) of small blood vessels beneath the skin, which reduces redness and itchiness sensation in the skin.
Antihistamines can cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision and confusion — so don't drive or operate heavy machinery while on histamines.

, Hot water baths and showers can help promote dryness and skin irritation because the higher temperature water is more effective at removing the natural oils that protect your skin. As such, cool or lukewarm baths and showers are a better idea for eczema. Spending at least 15 minutes in a cool bath on a regular basis can actually help to hydrate your skin because skin is quite absorbant.However, hot baths tend to pull water from your skin, especially if you use bath salts.


An Epsom salt bath is usually not recommended for eczema (despite its antiseptic benefits) because it draws water out of the skin.
Buy a shower nozzle filter that filters out chemicals that can irritate skin, such as chlorine and nitrites.

, Regular soap can dry out and irritate the skin of some people with eczema, so select soap with natural ingredients that's fragrance-free and contains natural moisturizers (vitamin E, olive oil, aloe vera).Hypoallergenic cleansers formulated for sensitive skin (Neutrogena, Aveeno) are also a good idea for those with eczema as they can be less drying. Remember to never scrub your skin too vigorously with a washcloth or loofa when cleaning your eczema skin.


In fact, some detergents, household chemicals and compounds found in soaps, shampoos, cosmetic products and perfumes are known to trigger dyshidrotic eczema — similar to triggering an allergic reaction.To be on the safe side, always wear protective gloves when using household cleaners so that your skin does not contact or absorb any chemicals.
Remember to wash your clothes in irritant-free detergents and fabric softeners to avoid any residue that could hurt your skin.

, For inflamed skin and blisters to heal properly, especially any open sores or blisters, avoid scratching your eczema skin. Friction and pressure from scratching will worsen your condition and cause additional skin inflammation and redness. It will also increase the risk of bacterial or fungal infections.Be sure to keep your nails cut short to avoid breaking blisters if you unconsciously scratch yourself.
Consider wearing thin cotton gloves and/or socks to prevent from scratching the skin in those locations.

, If your dyshidrotic eczema is quite severe and involves lots of fluid-filled blisters, don't pick at them or squeeze them. Instead, go see your doctor and have them properly treated. Your family doctor may treat you directly or refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist). Regardless, the doctor will likely apply some antibiotic cream and dress the blisters properly with sterile bandages, so to limit the risk of infection, minimize scarring and promote healing. If the blisters are particularly big, the doctor may drain them first.Change the bandages daily (or immediately if they get accidentally wet and dirty), but remove them carefully so as to minimize skin irritation.
When the blisters do break open, apply an antibiotic ointment to the area and cover loosely with another clean bandage.
Your doctor may also consider other potential causes of your skin condition. Other skin conditions that can mimic dyshidrotic eczema include fungal infection, bacterial infection, scabies, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and chicken pox., Because they modify the body's immune response, cortisone, prednisone and other corticosteroids are thought to decrease the redness, irritation and itchiness of eczema.Corticosteroids also have strong anti-inflammatory properties. Prednisone is stronger than cortisone and is often the better choice for eczema — it decreases skin inflammation by reversing the size of capillaries beneath the skin and suppressing the immune system's inflammatory response.


Wrapping the treated area in plastic wrap can improve absorption of corticosteroid cream and help blisters disappear quicker.If your eczema is severe enough, your doctor may recommend oral steroid therapy (pills) for several days in order to combat the inflammation and discomfort.
Long-term side effects of corticosteroid therapy include thinning of the skin, edema (water retention) and compromised immune response.

, Immune system suppressing creams and ointments, such as tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel), may also be helpful for severe eczema — particularly for people who want to avoid the side effects of corticosteroids.As their names implies, these medications suppress the body's immune response to the irritant that causes the eczema, which means less inflammation, redness and itchiness. However, these drugs can increase the risk of skin infections and even skin cancer, so use them as a last resort.Immunosuppressant creams and ointments are not appropriate for children and pregnant women.
Suppressing your immune system can make you more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as the common cold and flu.

, If other treatments aren't effective for your eczema, your doctor may recommend a kind of light therapy that combines exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light with certain drugs that help make your skin more receptive to the UV radiation.Phototherapy appears to work by increasing vitamin D production in the skin and killing any causative microorganisms on the skin — the effects are reduced inflammation, less itch and faster healing in about 60 to 70% of people.For treating skin conditions, narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) light is the most common type of phototherapy.
Broadband UVB phototherapy, PUVA (Psoralen and UVA) and UVA1 are other forms of phototherapy that are sometimes used for treating eczema.
Phototherapy avoids the UVA portion of sunlight, which is very damaging to skin and can accelerate aging and increase the risk of skin cancers.

Know the potential complications of a hernia.",How to Treat a Hernia at Home," It is recommended to eat 6 small frequent meals per day – 3 major meals and 3 snacks in between.Large or heavy meals are not recommended as this can lead to backflow of stomach contents especially in cases of hiatal hernias. The acid moves back into the esophagus because a part of the stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm into the chest.


This is not an excuse to eat more. The snacks should be complimentary to smaller meals. Start with half or three-quarters of your plate until you get used to the proper portion sizes.;
, In the case of hiatal hernias, avoid eating spicy foods, caffeinated drinks or anything that can upset the gastric contents of your stomach.Foods that were enjoyed but dealt with before now need to be entirely avoided to reduce strain on your digestive system and body.


This includes some teas as well as soda and coffee. Some citrus juices and fruits are also best avoided to keep your stomach's acidity levels balanced.
Taking antacids once a day before meals will help in managing the symptoms of hiatal hernias as well, especially if you wind up accidentally consuming something that may upset your stomach.

, Don’t lie down, bend over, or get active directly after a meal. These activities can lead to a backflow of stomach contents as discussed above. Avoiding these activities can prevent further damage and injury to the affected area.

, Being overweight increases the pressure in the abdominal cavity and causes the intestine to protrude through, therefore causing a hernia. Having a healthy diet (that includes small meals often) and doing exercises appropriate to your level can help you achieve this goal.


Before changing your diet and workout routine drastically, consult your doctor. He or she will give you the proper guidelines to lose weight without compromising your health.

, Painkillers work by blocking and interfering with the pain signals going through the brain. If the pain signal does not reach the brain, then pain cannot be interpreted and felt. Though you can go to your doctor for a stronger prescription, there are painkillers you can take that are also over-the-counter. There are two classes of painkillers you should consider:



Simple painkillers. Commonly over the counter and can relieve certain pains. A common example is Paracetamol. The proper dosage is determined by your weight and condition. Ask your doctor how much is appropriate for you.Strong painkillers. These will be necessary if the pain is not relieved by simple types of painkillers. However, certain precautions must be addressed since it can be addictive and effects may deteriorate over time. Examples of these are codeine or tramadol, and they're only available by prescription.

, These are oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These medicines work by blocking specific body chemicals that cause the affected area to get inflamed. Common examples are Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin.


Similar principles regarding dosage apply here as well. How much and how often you should take NSAIDs is determined by your condition. Consult your doctor and follow the directions on the bottle to eliminate pain and avoid unnecessarily overdosing.

, Especially when surgery is forthcoming, your health care provider may manually press the hernia back into place and advise you to wear a special belt (called a truss) to hold the hernia in place until surgery. Although not entirely proven, wearing a truss after manually maneuvering the hernia in place can help.


However, know that this can be a painful and rather uncomfortable procedure so be ready to take over the counter pain medications such as Tylenol as needed.

, As stated above, a weakened area such as the abdominal wall can result in a protrusion of an organ or intestines. So as a solution, do exercises to help strengthen the body part in which a hernia occurs. Inclined leg lifts are a good place to start. Here's how to do this exercise:


Begin by lying flat with your head lower than your feet.
Slowly lift both legs for about 14 inches (35.6 cm) or 30 to 45°. For extra resistance, you can try this with a partner who applies slight pressure on your legs while you lift them and spread them slightly apart.
Hold this position for a few seconds and then return to your original position. Start with five reps and gradually increase it to ten.

, It is recommended to avoid exercises or activities that involve heavy lifting, pulling or pushing as this can aid in the occurrence of a hernia. Therefore the inclined cycling exercise is a good one to try. Here's how to do it:


Lie flat with your head lower than your feet with your hands at your side.
Bend at the hips and raise your knees over the body.
Using both legs, start with a cycling motion. Once a burning sensation is felt in the abdomen, stop the exercise.

, Pillow squeezes are another great exercise that can strengthen your abdomen – without any expensive gym equipment. Here's how:


Lie flat with your head lower than your feet and your knees bent. Place a pillow in between your knees and hold it.
Start by inhaling. As you exhale, use your thigh muscles to squeeze the pillow. Make sure not to tilt your pelvis. After exhaling, release your thigh muscles.
You can begin with one set of ten reps and increase it to three sets gradually.

, This exercise strengthens the walls of the abdominal muscles, too. If you're not keen on regular crunches, give mini crunches a try:


Lie flat on the floor with the head lower than your feet and your knees bent.
Start by bending your torso for only 30° while tightening your ab muscles. Hold this position briefly and then slowly lower yourself back to your original position.
Begin with one set of 15 reps and gradually increase it to three sets.

, Performing exercises in the water adds resistance and makes it a little bit challenging to maintain balance. This aids even more in strengthening the abdominal area. If you have access to a swimming pool, consider these exercise:


Begin by simply walking in the water for three to five pool laps.
Once completed, do 30 reps of hip adduction and abduction, extension and flexion.
Lastly, do 30 reps of half squats.

, Walking strengthens the upper and lower abdomen and the pelvic floor. Simply walk at least 45 minutes daily at a brisk pace, though it doesn't have to be all at once! Walking – even for 10 minutes at a time – can be effective and, not to mention, very relaxing, too.


Consider making small adjustments, like parking further away from any entrance, taking the dog for an extra walk in the morning, or taking your lunch to the park and walking around to work up an appetite.

, Consult your health care provider first before trying out any strenuous forms of exercise. For some individuals, yoga is not recommended. Also, make sure that you do the poses in the presence of a trained yoga instructor so that he or she can guide you along the way. If you are given the okay to do yoga, the following asanas (yoga poses) are believed to relieve abdominal pressure, strengthen abdominal muscles and compress the inguinal canal:Sarvangasana (supported shoulder stand)
Matsyasana (fish pose)
Utthanpadasana (raised legs pose)
Pawanmuktasana (wind-relieving pose)
Paschimottanasana (forward bend)
Ushtrasana (camel pose)
Vajrasana (diamond pose)

, To avoid putting pressure on your muscles and your abdomen, it's imperative you avoid any heavy lifting. Or, if you absolutely must, consider proper body mechanics. Remember to lift objects using your knees and not your back.


This means that you should bend low before picking up an object, using your knees. Carry objects near your torso in order to distribute its weight. This way you can use up all the muscles without putting too much strain on a specific muscle group.

, Smoking can cause further deterioration of not only your muscles, but also other tissues in your body. If you're not doing it for your heart, lungs, hair, skin, and nails, do it to improve your current condition.


What's more, it's good for those around you, too. Try switching to a nicotine patch or gum to lessen the cravings. Gradually reduce your dependency – you don't have to go cold turkey.

, Sneezing, coughing, vomiting, and defecating can all put strain on your intestines and abdominal cavity. That being said, they are normal functions the body needs to do. Do your best to avoid becoming sick to avoid these being issues.


Avoid straining during bowel movements so that you will not put too much pressure along the abdominal area, if at all possible. And if you have a persistent cough, seek prompt medical attention to avoid further straining your abdominal muscles, too.

, If other measures fail, surgery may be required in order to repair the hernia. The surgery is called ""herniorrhaphy"" and can be done through the following:



Laparoscopic surgery. This uses a tiny camera and miniaturized surgical equipment to repair the hernia using small incisions. The hernia is repaired by sewing the hole to close the abdominal wall. A surgical mesh is also used to patch the hole. Laparoscopic surgery causes less damage to the surrounding tissue and requires a shorter recovery period than open surgery. Still, there is a risk of hernia recurrence.

Open surgery. This is suitable for hernias in which a portion of the intestines has moved down into the scrotum. Open surgery requires a longer recovery process. You can resume your normal daily activities six weeks after surgery.Both types of surgery are performed under either local or general anesthesia. The surgeon repositions the herniated tissue and, if strangulation has occurred, removes the oxygen-starved part of the organ. Hernia surgery is usually performed as an outpatient procedure.



, This is the most common type of hernia. For both men and women, the inguinal canal is found in the groins. In men, it is the area where the spermatic chord, which holds up the testicles, passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. In women, the inguinal canal contains a ligament that helps to hold the uterus in place. Symptoms for inguinal hernias include:


A lump on either side of the pubic bone, most felt when standing.
Pain, pinching or discomfort at the site of the bulge in the lower abdomen when bending, coughing or lifting.Inguinal hernias are common in men because the canal does not close properly, which can leave a weakened spot prone to hernias. Normally, a man’s testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly after birth and the canal closes almost completely behind them. Inguinal hernias develop when the intestines push through the inguinal canal., A hiatal hernia occurs when part of the stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm into the chest. Hiatal hernias are most common in people over 50 years old.Hiatal hernias cause gastroesophageal reflux, causing a burning sensation due to the leakage of stomach contents back into the esophagus. Symptoms for hiatal hernias include:


Gastro esophageal reflux – a burning sensation when stomach acid moves back into the esophagus because a part of the stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm into the chest.
Chest pain. The backflow of stomach contents and acid results in a burning pain in the chest.
Difficulty swallowing. The protrusion of a part of the stomach leads to a backflow of stomach contents and gives the person a feeling that the food is stuck on its way down to the esophagus.

Congenital birth defects can cause a child to acquire this condition as well.



, Incisional hernias occur when the intestines push through the incision scar or weakened tissue after abdominal surgery.


A bulge or swelling at the surgical site in the abdomen is the only ""symptom."" The intestines push through the incision scar or weakened tissue resulting in bulging or swelling.

, Babies under six months of age develop umbilical hernias if their intestines protrude through the abdominal wall near the belly button.


A sign that may suggest that the child has an umbilical hernia is if you notice constant crying and a bulge or swelling near the child’s bellybutton.
Failure of the abdominal wall to close leads to a weak spot leading to the development of an umbilical hernia.These usually go away on their own when the child reaches around one year old. At the age of one, if the hernia is still present surgery is preferred to correct the problem., Hernias can develop abruptly or gradually. They can be caused by muscle weakness and strain to the body.


Common causes of muscle weakness include:Age
Chronic coughing
Damage from injury or surgery
Failure of the abdominal wall to close properly in the womb (congenital defect)


Factors that strain your body and may cause a hernia include:

Ascites (fluid in the abdomen)
Being constipated
Being pregnant
Heavy weightlifting
Persistent coughing or sneezing
Sudden weight gain



, Several factors increase the risk of developing a hernia, including:


Chronic constipation
Chronic cough
Cystic fibrosis (it damages the function of the lungs that causes chronic cough)
Obesity or being overweight
Pregnancy
Personal or family history of hernias
Smoking

Some of these risk factors are within your control. Since hernias can recur, it's best to tackle the factors that you can to reduce your chance of this ailment coming back.



, Each type of hernia gets diagnosed in a different way. Here's how diagnosis works:Inguinal or Incisional Hernia. The diagnosis will be a physical examination. The medical professional would likely feel a bulge in the abdomen or groin that becomes larger when you stand, cough and strain.

Hiatal hernia. A barium X-ray or endoscopy will be performed to diagnose a hiatal hernia. During a barium X-ray, a liquid solution containing barium will be drunk by the patient and a series of X-ray pictures of the digestive tract will be recorded. An endoscopy utilizes a small camera attached to a tube and is threaded down to the throat into the esophagus and stomach. These tests allow the doctor to observe the location of the stomach in the body.

Umbilical hernia. An ultrasound uses high frequency sound waves that create an image of the structures inside the body that will be performed to diagnose an umbilical hernia to a child. Umbilical hernias in babies resolve on their own within four years. Those who are born with this condition only need close monitoring by their physician as time progresses.

, While initially these are sometimes not serious, if left untreated they can grow and become incredibly painful. It's best to consult your doctor at the first sign of any kind of hernia. Two main things can occur if left untreated:



Obstruction in the bowel. This can cause severe pain, constipation and nausea when the portion of the intestine becomes trapped in the abdominal wall.

Strangulation. This can occur when the intestine cannot receive enough blood flow. The intestinal tissue can be infected and damage its function which can be a life threatening medical emergency.

Keeping a supply of honey in your home can ensure you have it when you most need it.Be aware that locally-produced honeys are the most effective at killing bacteria. You can also get medical grade honey. You can get these products at health food stores, local markets, and even some grocery stores.
Be careful when buying commercial honey, which may not be effective at killing bacteria and healing wounds because of unknown additives or origins. Read the label and make sure that commercial honeys are pure, pasteurized honey.;
, You’ll need to clean the wound and remove any superficial debris from the wound before applying honey. This helps clear bacteria and minimizes the risk of infection.Wash the wound gently and thoroughly with warm water and soap. You don’t need any special product for cleansing. All soaps are equally effective at washing away dirt and debris.Rinse the wound until you see no soap residue or superficial dirt and debris.Dry the wound completely with a clean towel or washcloth.
Avoid removing any deeply-embedded debris because can spread bacteria and promote infection.Instead, see your doctor to have this type of debris removed.

, Once your wound is clean and dry, you’re ready to apply the honey. Spread a layer of honey on a bandage and place it on the wound to help protect it and kill bacteria.


Drizzle the honey on one side of a clean bandage, piece of gauze, or cloth. Then place the surface of the side with honey against the wound.Make sure it covers an area that is wider than the wound to kill bacteria in surrounding tissues.Avoid pushing the bandage on to the wound. Instead, gently press or dab it on and around the wound to ensure the honey comes in contact with your skin.
Seal the bandage with surgical tape. You can also use options like duct tape if you’re in a pinch., If you prefer, you can pour the honey directly on to the wound. This method may help you more effectively ensure that honey comes in contact with the wound.


Spread or drizzle a thin film of honey on the wound with a clean finger, cotton swab, or cloth. If you want, you can measure out 15 to 30ml of honey and pour that directly on the wound.Make sure to spread the honey beyond the borders of the wound to kill bacteria int he surrounding tissues.Cover it with a clean bandage and then seal it with surgical or even duct tape., In most cases, you’ll need to reapply honey to your wound every 12 to 48 hours depending on the severity and how quickly it heals. Cleanse the wound and apply the honey as often as necessary until the wound heals. Make sure to consult your doctor if the wound isn’t healing or shows signs of infection, such as redness, warmth, tenderness, pus, or red streaks.r


Inspect the wound at least every two days to make sure it isn’t infected. Make sure your hands are clean and consider putting a clean bandage on the wound any time you inspect it.

, If you have a burn from any type of accident or from a sunburn, honey can soothe the burn and promote rapid healing. For burns, it is more effective to place the honey on a bandage or cloth and then place it directly on the burn. Make sure to seal it with surgical or duct tape and check the wound on a regular basis., Honey naturally moisturizes the skin and can kill bacteria that causes acne. Spreading a thin layer on your skin or preparing a mask may treat and prevent acne and keep your skin glowing.


Spread a layer of warmed honey on your face. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes and then rinse with lukewarm water.
Mix a tablespoon of honey with a teaspoon of baking soda. Gently rub on your skin to gently exfoliate, purify, and moisturize it.A mixture of two teaspoons of honey and one teaspoon of fresh lemon can also kill acne-causing bacteria., Some people develop skin nodules, which are clusters of tissue that appear on different parts of the body. If you have or are prone to nodules, applying a mask of honey may help dissolve them.


Prepare a mask of honey to help shrink nodules. Mix one teaspoon honey with any one of the following ingredients: lemon juice, avocado, coconut oil, egg white, or yogurt.Leave the mask on for a few minutes and then rinse it off completely with warm water.

, Honey may also be effective at killing fungal infections of the skin. You can either apply honey directly to affected area or putting some on a bandage and placing that over the infection.Try honey on the following fungal infections:


Ringworm, also called tinea
Athlete’s foot.
Seborrheic dermatitis.

, There is also evidence that honey can relieve dandruff and its more chronic counterpart, seborrheic dermatitis.Consider regular application of honey to patches of dandruff to relieve dandruff and keep it from relapsing.Mix a solution of 90% honey to 10% water and rub it on to areas with dandruff for two or three minutes. Leave the mixture on for three hours and then rinse it off with warm water. Repeat this process daily for two weeks or until you see results.
Continue application once a week to help prevent relapse of dandruff.

, Allergic rashes, psoriasis, or dermatitis can cause itchy skin, or pruritus.This condition can cause pain and irritation of your skin and may be worse at night. However, applying honey to affected areas may help relieve pruritis and prevent infection at the site of the condition.


Spread a thin layer of honey on itchy skin. You can either cover it or leave it open. However, you may want to cover it if you are wearing clothes or in bed to prevent it from sticking to fabric.

Try a homemade lemon juice bleaching agent.,
Use potatoes to help bleach your skin.,
Make a turmeric mask.,
Avoid scratching your sunburn patches while they heal.",How to Remove Sunburn Patches (for Indian Skin Types)1," Lemon juice is a natural bleaching agent and can be used on your skin when you mix it with an equal amount of water. For the best results, leave the liquid on the dark spot for at least 10 minutes and then rinse it away., Potatoes are another natural bleaching agent that can be used on your skin without a lot of preparation needed. Simply cut a raw potato into thin slices and apply a slice to your dark spots. Allow the potato slice to sit on your skin for about 20-30 minutes before removing it., Mix 2-3 tablespoons of gram flour and ¼ teaspoon of turmeric powder in a bowl. Add lemon or cucumber juice and approximately ½ teaspoon of milk to the powder mixture. Mix these four ingredients together until it forms a smooth paste.Apply the mask to the dark patches on your skin for 10 minutes. The mask will dry as you wait.
Use warm water to gently remove the mask after the 10 minutes is finished.
Use the mask on your dark patches twice a week until the patches have lightened to where you’re comfortable.
The milk measurement is approximate. You’ll want to add enough to turn the mixture into a paste.
If you have sensitive skin, use cucumber juice rather than lemon juice.
Note that turmeric powder can easily stain fabrics, so be careful with your clothes and towels.
Gram flour is flour made from ground-up chickpeas.

, While you’re working on reducing or eliminating the dark patches on your skin, do not scratch them or rub at them with a pumice stone or brush. This is also good advice in general, as rubbing your skin with rough items can cause damage.Use natural items for exfoliation instead, such as loofahs and sponges.
Use soap that has the same pH level as your skin (5.5).
Always shower after you’ve been exercising or sweating for any reason.

Take it in its root form.,
Add powdered turmeric to food and liquids.,
Use a turmeric tincture.,
Make a turmeric paste.,
Take it as a pill.",How to Take Turmeric Powder1," Turmeric can be found in the stem of the curcuma longa plant. A close relative of ginger, you can eat it in its raw root form, although this might have a bitter flavor to it.You should aim for 1.5 to 3 g of the root each day.;
, Turmeric is commonly available in powder form. You should aim to incorporate 400 – 600 mg, three times a day.You can add it to sauces, soups or to drinks like milk and tea.To make turmeric tea, boil 1 cup of water and dissolve 2 grams of turmeric powder into the water. You can also add lemon, honey and ginger to improve the flavor of the tea.
If tea is not your preferred drink, you can also add one teaspoon of turmeric powder into a glass of milk in order to add antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties to it.

, In its tincture form, all of the benefits of the turmeric root have been extracted into a liquid. You can easily add two to three drops of turmeric tincture to water, tea, soup, or any other liquid that you consume on a daily basis.


You can buy turmeric tincture at most health food stores or in the vitamin section of your local grocery store.

, If you suffer from cuts or burns, a turmeric paste might be the best method for reaping its benefits because you can place it directly on the affected area.


Mix water, turmeric powder and ginger powder together. Use a clean, sterilized spatula or brush to apply to the injured area. If you use your hands, make sure they are clean before you apply the paste. Keep on the afflicted area for a few hours.To heal minor burns, you can apply turmeric and aloe vera paste. Mix equal amounts of turmeric powder and aloe vera together to create a paste., Turmeric is also available in capsule form. The dosage may vary between different packages, but pills are generally 350 mg. You should take one to three pills a day. If you are experiencing an upset stomach, you might take a higher dosage (three pills). You can find it in the vitamin section of your local grocery store."

Make an appointment to see your family doctor.,
Have your doctor check if the problem is epidermal or dermal.,
Obtain a prescription for a topical cream.,
Get a chemical peel.",How to Remove Sunburn Patches (for Indian Skin Types)2," Some treatments for dark spots on your skin (due to sun damage) can only be done by a doctor. If you’ve tried home remedies and they have not worked, or if you prefer to start with a medical professional, make an appointment to see your doctor.Your family doctor may refer you to a dermatologist, who is a doctor that specialized in skin issues.

, Unfortunately only dark patches that are being caused by epidermal pigmentation can be treated effectively. If the problem is found to be dermal pigmentation, your doctor may have some other options, or they may inform you that the condition cannot be altered.Epidermal pigmentation means that the dark spot is on the outer layers of your skin and is accessible to various types of treatment.
Dermal pigmentation means that the dark spot is under the epidermal layer of skin and is not likely to be impacted by treatment.

, One of the first steps your doctor may try is to give you a prescription for a topical cream that can lighten the skin. These prescriptions creams contain ingredients like hydroquinone, tretinoin and some type of corticosteroid.Follow the instructions your doctor or pharmacist provides for the application and use of the cream.
Topical creams, in general, tend to take a long time to show a significant change in your skin, so you may have to be patient.
Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent that prevents enzyme reactions in your skin cells.Tretinoin is a type of vitamin A that helps your skin repair and renew itself., Chemical peels with either glycolic acid or trichloroacetic acid is a more invasive option that you doctor may present you with. In most cases a doctor may only recommend this type of treatment for more severe cases that do not respond to topical creams.Chemical peels are normally performed by a trained professional within your dermatologist’s office. A family doctor is not likely to perform such a procedure.
A chemical peel is exactly what it sounds like. A dermatologist will apply a gel or cream-like substance to your skin which contains one of the above mentioned acids. They will then leave it on your skin for a specific period of time before peeling it off.It is likely that you will need more than one chemical peel in order to see a significant change in the colour of your dark patches.

Get into a regular skin care routine.,
Apply sunscreen every day, all year round.,
Protect your skin using clothing and shade.",How to Remove Sunburn Patches (for Indian Skin Types)3," A good skin care routine includes washing all your skin regularly (and your face twice a day) and keeping all your skin properly moisturized and hydrated. Skin hydration can be achieved by using a moisturizer, but it is also important to consume water (and other liquids) to keep your body hydrated, which can also affect your skin., If you are going outside, or if you’re staying inside but there are a lot of windows, always remember to apply sunscreen to your exposed skin. In colder months when most of your body is covered with clothing, it is still important to apply sunscreen to your face every day.Harmful UV rays can work their way through clouds and damage your skin, so it doesn’t have to be sunny for you to obtain sun damage.
Don’t forget to protect your lips by using a lip balm that contains SPF.
If you are outside in the sun, reapply sunscreen every 2 hours.

, In addition to sunscreen, you can also protect your skin using clothing and hats, and you can protect your eyes using sunglasses. It is also recommended that you consider staying in the shade between the hours of 11am and 3pm when the sun is at its peak."

Exfoliate with a pumice stone.,
Apply some salicylic acid.,
Try cryotherapy on warts.,
Cover the wart with duct tape.,
Apply apple cider vinegar.,
Try garlic extract.,
Consider using Thuja oil.,
Use tea tree oil.",How to Treat a Wart at Home," One of the easiest and most cost-effective things you can do for wart removal is exfoliate them with a pumice stone. Pumice stone is naturally abrasive and works well to essentially scrape or sand away your warts, particularly the ones on the bottoms of the feet (plantar warts) that form thick overlaying callouses.A pumice stone is an inexpensive way of removing warts above the surface of the skin, but keep in mind that warts have ""roots"" below the surface of the skin. As such, exfoliate most of the wart away with a pumice stone, then plan on applying a compound that destroys the roots and prevents it from growing back.
Before using the pumice stone as a wart exfoliator, soak the surrounding skin in warm water for about 15 minutes to soften it up — this is particularly important for plantar warts that have a thick callous covering them.
Be very cautious when using a pumice stone on genital warts due to increased sensitivity and thinner skin on the shaft of the penis and labia. A small emery board may be more appropriate for genital warts.
People with diabetes or peripheral neuropathy should not use a pumice stone on their hands or feet because they have reduced sensations and may damage surrounding tissue.;
, Another technique to remove the fleshy part of the wart that appears above the surface of the skin (and the callouses on plantar warts) is applying an over-the-counter salicylic acid preparation, which is widely available at pharmacies. Salicylic acid is a type of keratolytic, which means it dissolves the keratin (protein) of the surface of wart and any callouses that may be covering the wart.It can take several weeks to get rid of a large wart using salicylic acid, so patience is the key.


Keratolytics also destroy/irritate healthy skin, so take care when you apply the liquid, gel, ointment or patch. Before application of the salicylic acid (up to twice a day), soak the surrounding skin and file down most of the wart with a pumice stone or emery board so the medication can better penetrate into the roots of the wart.
Salicylic acid products sometimes contain dichloroacetic (or trichloroacetic) acid, which helps burn away the visible part of the wart. However, be careful not to apply it on the surrounding healthy skin.
For most warts, buy and use a 17% salicylic acid solution or a salicylic acid patch at 15% strength.Warts aren't considered a medical concern and may not require any treatment, especially if they're not painful — sometimes they disappear on their own.

, Cryotherapy means to freeze and it's a commonly used procedure by family physicians and dermatologists to get rid of warts. However, there are some over-the-counter liquid nitrogen products that are available in liquid or spray form (Compound W Freeze Off, Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away) that you can use at home.The application of liquid nitrogen makes a blister around the wart initially, then the blister and wart eventually fall off after about a week. Multiple applications are typically needed so that the wart doesn't grow back. To make cryotherapy more effective, file down the wart with pumice stone or something similar before applying the liquid nitrogen product.


Cryotherapy sounds painful, but it's not too bad. It's commonly used by doctors (in higher prescription strength) on children to remove warts and other benign skin growths.
Liquid nitrogen can mildly scar light-colored skin or cause dark spots in people with dark-colored skin, so be careful when applying it to your wart.
Applying ice is a form of cryotherapy used for sprains and strains, but don't try to freeze your warts with ice cubes! It isn't effective and you may give yourself frost bite.

, There are many anecdotal reports (and some research) claiming that applying regular duct tape to common and plantar warts is an effective treatment, although how it may work is still a mystery.In a 2002 study, 85% of people using duct tape were cured of their warts within 28 days, which was more effective than cryotherapy.As such, cover your wart with silver duct tape, then remove and pumice away the dead tissue and see if it grows back. You may have to repeat the process a few times, but due to its low cost, ease of application and lack of risk, it's definitely worth a try.


Clean your skin with rubbing alcohol and securely attach a piece of duct over the wart. Leave it on for 24 hours at a time before replacing it with a fresh piece of tape and repeat this cycle for 1 week increments (up to 6 weeks if needed). Always pumice the wart and clean with rubbing alcohol before applying new tape.
Some people have reported that other nonporous tape, such as electrical tape, works as well as duct tape for plantar and common warts.

, Apple cider vinegar (made from fermenting apples) has anecdotal reports of numerous health benefits, and one of them is combating warts of all types. Apple cider vinegar contains citric acid and a high percentage of acetic acid, which has antiviral properties (kills HPV and other viruses).However, citric and acetic acids also irritate healthy tissue, so be cautious with application of apple cider vinegar. Try soaking a cotton ball in the vinegar and applying it to the wart, then cover it with a bandage overnight and replace the next day. It may take several days to notice significant improvement.


Applying apple cider vinegar may cause mild burning or swelling in the skin around the wart initially, but it usually fades away quickly. After about a week of application, the wart should become dark in color and then fall off. New skin will soon be seen in its place.
White vinegar is made of acetic acid also, but it doesn't seem to have the impact on warts that apple cider vinegar does. More research is needed to understand why.

, Garlic is an ancient home remedy that's been used for many conditions, although it was eventually discovered that its strong antimicrobial abilities are due to the chemical, allicin, which can kill a variety of microorganisms, including viruses such as HPV.Raw, crushed garlic or store-bought extracts can be applied directly on to warts a couple of times per day for a week or two. Once you apply it, cover it up with a Band-Aid for a few hours until you have to reapply it. Consider doing so at night before bedtime, so the allicin can absorb deeply into the wart and get to its roots.


In a 2005 study, chloroform extract of garlic was discovered to completely cure warts after a few weeks and there was no reappearance noted even after four months.As an alternative, albeit a less effective one to combat warts, capsules of refined garlic can be taken orally, which attacks HPV from the bloodstream.

, Thuja oil is derived from the leaves and roots of Western Red Cedars. It's an ancient Ayurvedic remedy popular for many diseases and conditions due to its strong antiviral properties. It's become a very popular herbal and homeopathic remedy for warts of all types. Thuja oil contains compounds that can stimulate certain cells of your immune system that are efficient at scavenging and killing viruses or viral infected cells, which is helpful for destroying HPV and eliminating warts.Apply Thuja oil directly onto warts, allow it to absorb for a few minutes then cover with a Band-Aid. Repeat twice daily for up to a couple weeks. However, keep in mind that Thuja oil is usually quite potent and can easily irritate sensitive skin, which is especially important to remember if you're applying it to genital warts.


If applying Thuja oil to sensitive skin, consider diluting it with some mineral or cod liver oil.
Thuja oil is often recommended for particularly stubborn warts that are resistant to other treatments. Even still, significant results are usually seen with these stubborn varieties after one to two months of daily application.
Thuja is also available as homeopathic pills, which are meant to be taken under the tongue (and dissolved) a couple times daily. The pills are small and tasteless and have only minute amounts of Thuja extract, but they work well for some people also.

, Application of tea tree oil, an extract of melaleuca alternifolia, on warts can be effective also, but perhaps not to the extent that apple cider vinegar, garlic extract, and Thuja oil are. Like the others, tea tree oil is a strong antimicrobial agent that can destroy viruses such as HPV, but it doesn't penetrate tissue quite as well as some of the above mentioned herbal remedies.Tea tree oil also boosts immunity, which can be helpful in preventing re-infection with HPV. Start with two to three drops of the tea tree oil on the wart, twice daily for at least three to four weeks and see how it works. To make it more efficient, remember to file down the fleshy part of the wart with pumice or a similar exfoliant.


Tea tree oil has been a popular natural antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory for many generations in Australia and New Zealand, but has become better know in North America in the last decade or so.
Tea tree oil can cause both irritant and allergic skin reactions in some people who are especially sensitive, but the prevalence is pretty rare.

By prompting the gallbladder to produce more bile, curcumin can improve digestion and soothe the symptoms of bloating., Curcumin is also an effective anti-inflammatory. As such, it can help ease a wide range of medical conditions, from arthritis and psoriasis to chronic back or neck pain.


Curcumin prevents the activation of the COX 2 gene, which produces an enzyme that can lead to painful inflammation., Turmeric has strong antibacterial properties, which can help heal cuts and protect them from infection., Heart disease is often caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries leading to the heart. Turmeric's anti-inflammatory elements improve blood circulation while also keeping your arteries clear from plaque.Using turmeric for healthy blood circulation can reduce your risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.

, Although there are no definitive studies on the role of turmeric as an inhibitor to cancer, preliminary results suggest that turmeric can slow or prevent the development of cancerous cells in the colon, prostrate and the lungs.Populations in India have some of the lowest rates of cancer in these organs (13 times lower than in the United States). Many researchers believe spices such as turmeric in curry dishes are responsible for these low rates.
Turmeric's strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are largely thought to be helpful in preventing cancer. Inflammation is often a factor in the development of cancerous tumor cells.Do not attempt to cure cancer using only natural vitamins and herbs. If you have cancer, you should work with an oncologist for treatment.

If all else fails, consider tonsillectomy surgery.",How to Remove Tonsil Stones at Home," Before you begin, locate your tonsil stones in a mirror. Ideally, you should have a clear view of the stones while also being able to hold the mirror comfortably. Take some time to get used to looking into your mouth with your mirror — it will save you time and frustration in the long run. If you don't have a mirror handy, try using the reversible camera in your smartphone to see what you're doing (flashlight apps can be handy here).


You're looking for one or more small, hard, whitish pieces of debris at the back of your throat. These may be lodged in the folds of the tonsils, which can make them hard to see.
Before you start, it can also be a good idea to have some towels, warm rinse water, and a handheld flashlight (torch) to help you see down your throat.;
, Many homes are already stocked with this useful tool for tonsil stone removal. If the cotton swab is long enough to reach the back of your throat and stiff enough not to bend under pressure, it should work great. Use only clean, fresh swabs — never ones that have been previously used — and avoid setting your swab down on non-sterilized surfaces like your counter-top during use. Below are a few brief guidelines for usage:


Stroke the stone with gentle but steady pressure repeatedly in one direction. Try not to poke the stone further into the tonsil — if you already have a sore throat, this can cause more irritation.
Note that it isn't harmful to swallow tonsil stones once they're dislodged. However, many people find that this can cause a lingering unpleasant aftertaste.

, Another extremely common tool you can use to remove tonsil stones is an ordinary toothbrush. You can even use both ends of the toothbrush to dislodge reluctant tonsil stones — the bristles can be useful to give the tonsils a (very gentle) scrubbing and remove loose stones, while the blunt end can help remove individual stubborn stones.


If you have an electric toothbrush, try using the smooth (non-bristled) side of the head to vibrate stones out of nooks and crannies in your tonsils.Because tonsil stones often contain foul-smelling bacteria, you may want to give your toothbrush a washing before the next time you use it. However, if you don't, you won't be in any danger.

, Many women keep a supply of bobby pins ready in their bathroom. If this is the case for you, consider using one of these handy pins to remove your tonsil stones. The common black-colored ones work well because they're thin and flexible, yet firm enough to dislodge the stones. Be sure to wash your pin with soap and water before putting it in your mouth. Though unlikely, a dirty pin can potentially transfer infectious bacteria into the mouth, leading to further throat problems.


Use the bobby pin the same way you would use a Q-tip, using a steady stroking motion to dislodge the stones.

, An oral irrigator (or ""water pick"") is a tool frequently used by dentists. Oral irrigators work by shooting water out of a small nozzle at a high speed, creating a narrow jet that can blast obstructions away. This sort of concentrated pressure is perfect for removing tonsil stones. Believe it or not, these devices are actually available over the counter at pharmacies — often for as little as $20-40.Before using the oral irrigator, set it to the lowest setting and test it on a non-sensitive part of your mouth, like the side of your cheek. If your throat is sore, as is common with tonsil stones, an irrigator set to high pressure can be painful.
Aim the water stream at the visible stones and wait for it to dislodge. Do not touch the stone directly with the irrigator's nozzle, as this may contaminate the irrigator with bacteria from the stone.

, If it's uncomfortable to touch your tonsils, try this non-invasive trick. Mix about a teaspoon of iodized salt or rock salt to one cup of warm water and then gargling it at the back of your throat. Since you're not touching the tonsil stones directly, this can take some time, but keep at it. Even if you don't move the harder-to-dislodge stones, the gentle action of the warm saltwater should make them easier to remove with one of the methods above.


The salt in the water acts with the heat as a mild antibacterial remedy and can also help to dull any pain from a sore throat.You may also want to try gargling with neutral carbonated liquids like club soda. Some practitioners claim that the bubbles help dislodge stubborn stones.

, Though there's not necessarily anything wrong with using your index finger to reach for the stones, it's not usually a good first choice. Statistically, people's hands can often be host to a wide variety of bacteria.If your tonsils are already irritated from their stones, this bacteria can cause an infection, leading to further problems that may necessitate a doctor's visit. If you need to use a finger, take the following precautions:


Make sure your hands are thoroughly washed. This will reduce the risk of spreading bacteria and germs.
Trim your fingernails. Long, sharp nails can scratch the tissue around the tonsils and hard-to-reach bacteria can hide under dirty nails.
If you can, consider wearing sterile latex gloves.

, Sometimes, removing a tonsil stone will reveal a small crater filled with pus or other impacted material. This usually has a foul smell and taste. Carefully remove as much of this material out as possible with the tool of your choice. Repeat the process until the crater is empty. Rinse with water or your preferred mouthwash to deal with the smell and taste.


Note that you may feel slight discomfort, pain, or bleeding during this extraction process or during the removal of the impacted material. Usually, this is nothing to worry about. However, if the bleeding doesn’t stop or the pain lasts for longer than an hour or two, consult a doctor — the wound may be infected.

, The internet is bursting with amateur tips on how to remove tonsil stones and keep them away once they're gone. Some of these tips may work well, while others may not. In this section, we've collected some of the most popular online rumors and so-called home remedies for treating tonsil stones. While none of these tricks will hurt you, it's important to understand that since there's no scientific evidence supporting claims that they work, not all may be effective for you.

, Mix a few tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice and a pinch of salt in a cup of warm water to make a stone-fighting mouthwash. Using this citrus solution to gargle vigorously, taking care to swirl around in the pockets in the back corners of your mouth several times per day. According to unverified sources, the acid in the lemon juice may work with the salt and the heat of the water to help loosen the stones from your tonsils.


Lemon juice also contains vitamin C, which is often heralded as a cure for minor ailments like sore tonsils. However, recent studies have cast some doubt on the true effectiveness of vitamin C at fighting colds., Aloe vera juice (which comes from the inner gelatinous, gummy section of the aloe leaf) is often sold as aloe vera jelly over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets. Some sources claim that aloe vera can help with tonsil stones by cleansing the mouth of stone-causing bacteria.There is, in fact, some evidence that aloe vera can act as a mild antibacterial, so this method may have some truth to it.If you want to try this soothing jelly, take a teaspoonful of it in your mouth, swirl it around your tonsils, and let it stay there for a few minutes several times per day. When the time is up, gargle water with the jelly in your mouth, swirl it all around, and spit it out.

, Eating a single solid clove of raw garlic twice a day is sometimes claimed as an effective way of dealing with tonsil stones. Though it may seem unnatural, all you need to do to try this method is pop a whole clove in your mouth, chew, and swallow. Allicin, a chemical in garlic, has antibacterial properties.Allegedly, chewing garlic will allow the allicin to kill the stone-causing bacteria, helping prevent new stones.


While tonsil stones are often associated with bad breath, note that eating raw garlic has its own strong effects on the breath, which some may find unpleasant.

, If you're bold, try gargling olive oil to dislodge tonsil stones. Gargling a few times each day with a teaspoon of the oil may help get rid of your current stones and reduce the chance of new stones forming. Afterward, gargle with water to get rid of the viscous residue.


The logic behind this method is that since olive oil is known to sometimes have anti-inflammatory properties, it can help reduce the swelling of sore tonsils and thus reduce the likelihood of stones forming.However, it is unclear whether olive oil works as an anti-inflammatory when applied directly to the tonsils.

, Apple cider vinegar, an acid, may be able to treat tonsil stones by acting as an astringent. To try this, add a few teaspoons of apple cider vinegar to a glass of water and use it to gargle with. Gargle vigorously at least twice a day as long as needed for the stones come out.


Like lemon juice, the logic behind this home remedy is that the acid in the vinegar helps to loosen and dissolve the stones during the gargling process.

, Chewing hard foods like carrots several times per day may help with tonsil stones. Chewing hard carrots forces the hard pieces of carrot catch on the stones in the back of your throat and loosen them. Consider having a carrot with every meal if you're suffering from tonsil stones.


In addition, carrots are loaded with vitamin A, beta carotene, and fiber, important nutrients that can help keep you healthy and prevent tonsil stones in the future.

, These products are pro-biotics, which means they have beneficial (or good) bacteria in them. According to some online sources, adding these foods to your diet can help balance out the bacteria levels in your mouth and stomach, making it less likely that the harmful bacteria will be able to cause tonsil stones. However, it's somewhat doubtful that bacteria in the digestive tracts act this predictably.

, Believe it or not, some sources claim that eating one full onion each day can have a similar effect to that of a garlic clove (discussed above). According to these sources, the chemicals found in onions can help kill the bacteria that produce tonsil stones. In addition, the increased saliva production that comes with eating onions can allegedly help loosen deeply embedded stones. If you're willing to brave the strong odor and tears that are likely to occur with eating the vegetable, try ending each meal by downing pieces of raw onion.

, These fragrant essential oils can be used for gargling and swirling purposes. While they'll almost certainly help deal with bad breath caused by tonsil stones, they can also allegedly work as mild antibacterials to kill the stone-forming bacteria in the mouth. Try using the procedure below to use this home remedy:


Put about 10 drops of your essential oil(s) in a cup of water.
Take a mouthful of this water and gargle well, with your head tilted back so that the water reaches your tonsils.
Continue gargling with new mouthfuls of water until you finish the cup. Repeat several times per day until stones loosen or fall out.

, Tonsil stones form when small bits of food, mucus, bacteria, or other types of debris get caught in the folds of the tonsils and begin to harden.By keeping your mouth as clean and free of debris as possible, you lessen the chance that tonsil stones will have a chance to form in the first place. For example, try using mouthwash after meals to kill bacteria in the mouth and remove any lingering food debris.


As discussed above, a mild saltwater solution can also be helpful. In addition, saltwater solutions can help dull the pain of a sore throat.

, Always brush your teeth at least twice per day. Ideally, brush after every meal. As noted above, food particles getting caught in the tonsils are one of the reasons tonsil stones form, so removing them routinely may prevent the stones' formation entirely.


Flossing, which removes bacteria and debris between the teeth, doesn't hurt either. Most dental resources recommend flossing daily., Since tonsil stones are most common in people who frequently have tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils), avoiding this condition can make your chances of getting tonsil stones much smaller. Below are just a few tips for avoiding contracting tonsillitis — they're more or less the same common-sense tips that will help you avoid the common cold:Wash your hands frequently, especially after eating or using the bathroom.
Stay away from people with tonsillitis or strep throat until about a day after they start antibiotics.
Get plenty of sleep to keep your immune system functioning at top capacity.

, If your tonsil stones are causing noticeable problems and you aren't able to remove them by yourself, seek medical attention. Your doctor may be able to prescribe you a course of antibiotics to help cure an underlying throat ailment that's inflaming your tonsils and allowing stones to form.


If you're prescribed antibiotics, be sure to follow you're doctor's instructions for taking them. Take exactly as much as you are directed to take. Don't stop taking them early, even if you start to feel better. Poor usage of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic-resistant illnesses, which can be very difficult to treat., The only way to prevent tonsil stones with 100% effectiveness is to have your tonsils removed. Without tonsils, debris in your mouth will have nowhere to get trapped, and stones will be unable to re-form. While tonsillectomy surgeries can leave the throat sore after the surgery, in the long run, they provide permanent relief from tonsil stones. If you are suffering from a serious, recurring case of tonsil stones, this may be the smartest option.


Another surgical option for tonsil stones involves using a precisely-aimed laser to remove the stones.While this option doesn't require you to go under general anesthesia and allows you to keep your tonsils, it may not be as effective as a tonsillectomy in permanently stopping tonsil stones.

Practice active listening.,
Give compliments and encouragement.,
Engage positively with others online.,
Eat with other people.",How to Naturally Increase Oxytocin Levels2," Make eye contact during conversation and otherwise give your full attention to the person you are speaking with. Keep your phone out of sight, square your body towards the person you are listening to, and indicate that you are listening with nonverbal cues like nodding., When you recieve positive comments, you get an immediate oxytocin boost. In fact, any sentiments associated with giving or receiving love and admiration will increase your oxytocin levels. Meanwhile, people tend to exchange positive sentiments with those who feel favorably about them.Get in the habit of saying positive things to other people when they come to mind.
Not only will you give them an oxytocin boost, you’ll make them feel more comfortable speaking affectionately towards you as well.

, People are increasingly using online tools such as social media websites to interact with one another. While it’s important to balance online interaction with face-to-face interaction, you can get a boost in oxytocin by exchanging pleasantries online.Next time you get on Facebook, for instance, make a point of liking at least ten things, and make a handful of positive, friendly comments on friends’ posts.

, Eating with another person is a proven way to bond. It can also calm you down, and provide the opportunity for conversation. Ideally, invite someone to join you for lunch or dinner and offer to cover the tab. Giving and receiving also boost oxytocin levels."

Think positively of others while meditating.,
Cuddle with a pet.,
Share an adrenaline rush with someone.,
Listen to soothing music or comedy.,
Donate or volunteer.,
Be wary of so-called oxytocin ""boosters.” There are plenty of products, such as supplements, that claim to boost your oxytocin levels.",How to Naturally Increase Oxytocin Levels3," Aside from countless other health benefits associated with meditation, you can give yourself an oxytocin boost by focusing on positive thoughts about someone. To do so, sit down somewhere quiet and free of distraction. Close your eyes and simply think complimentary or hopeful things about one person in particular.You may even want to focus on one mantra, such as “Sebastian is wonderful.” Simply repeat this thought to yourself over and over, while pushing away any other thoughts that arise.

, The oxytocin boosts associated with physical contact are not limited to contact with other humans. In fact, another sure fire way to increase your oxytocin levels is by petting a dog.Always ask before petting a stranger's dog, of course. Note that you may find yourself talking to the person as well - you are more likely to have positive social interactions with the people around you when a dog is around.

, You can get massive oxytocin spikes by participating in moderately stressful activities. This is especially true when you share such an experience with other people. Classic examples include activities like riding a roller coaster or sky diving.By experiencing something exhilarating together, you are quickly bonded to those around you. This occurs in part because of a flood of oxytocin released by your brain after an activity that feels dangerous.
In fact, any sort of “adventure” with someone else can boost both of your oxytocin levels. Even a walk around the block with someone will have positive effects on your brain chemistry, as well as your feelings towards one another.

, If you’re on your own and looking for an oxytocin boost, audio can help. Whether you choose relaxing music or something that will get you laughing, both will positively affect your brain chemistry. Furthermore, you’ll be more willing to interact with others after listening to something funny or relaxing., Giving time or money to another person or organization can boost your oxytocin too. In short, being more generous will wind up making you feel more appreciated. Positive feedback loops form when people work together for a common interest and are grateful for one another's contributions., Unfortunately, these claims are often not supported by scientific research.While supplements that make these sorts of claims may be worth taking for other reasons, it's important to note that they are unlikely to increase your oxytocin levels.

Keep activity to a minimum.",How to Make Yourself Feel Better (When You're Sick)," Drink plenty of healthy fluids when you aren’t feeling well—water, juice, etc. This will help to replace any fluids you lose due to your illness, and ease congestion.The amount of fluids you should drink varies from person to person, depending on things like age, climate, level of activity, etc.; drinking at least 6-8 glasses of water or other liquids a day is often recommended as a general guideline.;
, Tea, broth or soup can provide relief from a host of symptoms (including coughing, sore throat, and congestion). The warmth will also provide instant comfort.


Caffeinated beverages are not the best choice when you are ill, as they can leave you dehydrated.Try herbal teas instead. Chamomile, for example, has a calming, relaxing effect.Echinacea is also a good, time-honored choice—some research shows it can reduce the severity and duration of a cold.Honey added to tea will soothe a sore throat and act as a cough suppressant., If the air is dry, running a humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air, soothing congestion and coughing.Make sure you keep your humidifier clean — a dirty reservoir or filter can breed bacteria and mold which can worsen your symptoms., If you have nasal congestion, don’t make things worse by trying to clear it improperly. Hold one nostril closed and gently blow the other to avoid causing an earache.Wash your hands afterwards.


Hot or cold packs around your nostrils are another way to help relieve congestion, as are saline nasal drops and sprays., If your illness has left you with an aching throat, in addition to drinking warm beverages, try using additional remedies at regular intervals to ease the pain.


You can gargle every few hours. Dissolve ¼ to ½ teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and gargle to find some relief.Over-the-counter throat sprays can also provide some relief. Make sure to carefully follow all package directions regarding how much and how often to use.
Cough drops, lozenges, ice chips and even hard candies and popsicles can all soothe a sore throat (just don't give them to small children, as they are a choking hazard)., Neti pots, also known as nasal irrigation, are a system for flushing out your nasal cavities and sinuses when they are congested.


Procedure for use varies according to the particular neti pot, but generally it involves tilting your head, breathing through your mouth, carefully letting a sterile saline solution flow out of the neti pot, in one nostril, and out the other.Use distilled or sterilized water (don't just use water straight from the tap) and a sterilized pot.Carefully follow all directions that come with your neti pot.

, Over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, cold medicines, etc. can help with pains, aches, fevers, etc. Use as directed and heed all warnings.

Trouble breathing (shortness of breath, nonstop coughing, etc.)
Drainage from the ear or eyes
Severe pain
Stiff neck
A rash
Signs of dehydration (feeling very weak or dizzy, dry mouth, or decreased urination)
If you are ever in doubt, seek medical advice.

, This means canceling any plans you may have made and letting others (like your parents, family, or work) know that you are sick. The more attention you can give to taking care of yourself, the better the chances that you’ll get well soon.

, Go wherever you can be comfortable and rest, like a bedroom or living room. If others are around, make sure they can help you rather than disturb you. Have whatever you need to make it through the illness nearby, which can include: blankets or robes to keep warm, a hot water bottle, books to read or movies to watch, fluids to drink, a bucket (if you feel nauseous), etc.


If you have a fever, also keep cool, damp cloths at hand. If you feel hot, place one on your forehead or elsewhere for some relief.
Avoid smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke.

, The warmth will help soothe you so you will be primed to get comfortable and rest afterwards. Also, the steam moisturizes and soothes your nasal passages, which will make you feel better if you are congested.After the shower or bath, go back to the space you have set up to recuperate and stay warm by covering up with a blanket or robe. Sit back, relax, and stay comfortable.

, Take frequent naps when you are trying to feel better. Aim for eight to ten hours of sleep per day while you are sick.This helps your body direct energy toward overcoming the illness.

, While you are sick, don’t overdo it with physical activity—only engage in moderate exercise such as yoga or walking. The exceptions to this are if you have respiratory problems (coughing, congested lungs, etc.) or a fever and/or body aches, in which case you are best to avoid any exercise whatsoever., Try to avoid doing work, surrounding yourself with stress, doing chores, etc. while you are sick. Your goal should be to get better. Do this, and you have a better chance of returning soon to all the things you need or want to do.


If you need to keep your mind busy or are bored while convalescing, try some low-activity entertainment, like watching television or reading a book.
If you can, ask others to help you with day-to-day tasks, getting meals, etc., or if there is something else that must be taken care of while you are sick.

Determine your skin color choices.,
Use different coloring of make-up around your lips.,
Apply a concealer to your lip line.,
Use dark lipsticks.,
Evaluate the results.",How to Make Lips Look Smaller1," This is a step you want to get reasonably accurate early on.


Go to a pharmacy, department store, salon, or similar business with a make-up counter.
Consult with the clerk and/or palette samples to get a sense of what color the skin around the problem lip(s) is--and identify the names of the make-up colors you will need.
Make sure what you choose won't inadvertently offset your skin tone while you are trying to help the appearance of your lips.;
, Make sure you have a good assortment of colors, or buy more if necessary.


You will need a make up applicator, relatively ""muted"" or darker colors and/or a concealer in your make-up kit. Most of these products can be found in a pharmacy or supermarket. If you have trouble finding them, try consulting a salon.
Purples, browns, bronzes and similar are colors you might also consider.
You can use a make-up brush to apply these colors in the area just above the top lip or just below the bottom lip to blend them more with your natural skin.

, You will need an applicator for this. You can either apply the colors or concealer around the lip-line.









Select a concealer that closely matches the skin tone around your mouth.
Apply the concealer to the top edge of your top lip and the bottom edge of your bottom lip--approximately a millimeter away from the lip.
Use a sponge applicator wand (or a cotton swab or your fingers if you do not have the wand) to blend the concealer into your skin using an up and down motion so that the edges of your lips appear to naturally blend into the tone of your skin above or below your lip.
If the resulting line is uneven, smooth it out by dragging the tip of the applicator sponge across the line of concealer parallel to the edge of your lips.

, This can be done in conjunction with the make-up and concealer steps, or by itself.








Avoid the brighter colors in the lipstick selection, they will only make lips appear larger.
Find darker colors that will work with your skin tone. Consider asking a salon consultant.
This can work if there is one lip that needs more attention over another. For instance, if only the upper lip needs to look thinner--use a darker color on the upper lip while you use something slightly brighter to draw attention to the lower lip (or vice-versa).

, If make-up hasn't worked or is not an option for you, then you might need to consider other options.


If make-up is not an option for you to begin with, then more health-care/medical approach may be something you should keep in mind.
If the make-up is not working, you can try other colors near the shades you have been trying to see if there is an improvement before you pursue other methods.
Consult with a salon or medical professional before proceeding with a more extensive make-up or medical procedure.

Apply capsaicin to your skin.,
Plaster your back with capsicum.,
Apply capsaicin to your nostril to relieve headache pain.,
Talk to your doctor about other pain-relieving uses.,
Wash your hands after touching capsaicin cream.,
Take care when using capsaicin.",How to Manage Pain with Herbs3," Capsaicin is a chemical derived from the plant capsicum, and can help fight pain associated with arthritis, nerve pain associated with diseases like HIV and diabetes, and fibromyalgia. If you have any of these conditions, get a tube of capsaicin cream and apply it to areas you’re experiencing pain 3-4 times per day. The full effects of this herb will be felt after 14 days of consecutive treatment.Capsaicin creams are available over the counter and by prescription, and range from 0.025% to 0.075% capsaicin concentrate.
Never use capsicum products near the eyes or on areas with sensitive skin. In fact, a particular form of capsaicin is a commonly used ingredient in pepper spray on account of its ability to cause discomfort to the eyes.
Side effects include skin irritation, burning, itching, sweating, and runny noses.

, A plaster containing capsaicin can be applied daily and left on your skin from 4-8 hours. If interested, speak with a doctor before pursuing this treatment option, and ask their guidance regarding how to go about making a plaster that will be safe for you., If you have recurring cluster headaches, a multi-day capsaicin treatment may help reduce the frequency and severity of the attacks. Apply a 0.025% capsaicin cream, such as Zostrix, every day for 7 days. Only apply the cream to the nostril on the side of your head that hurts.Consider applying a topical pain reliever such as lidocaine to the nostril before applying the capsaicin cream, as the latter can cause painful burning.
Though the irritation will not cause serious side effects, burning pain may be accompanied by sneezing, watery eyes, and a runny nose. After 5 or so days of repeated use, these effects should subside.
Capsaicin cream may also diminish the pain of a migraine headache.

, Capsicum can be used to treat many other conditions as well. In particular, you may find relief from toothache, ulcers, and shingles. Further, if you suffer from prurigo nodularis, an extensive capsaicin regimen may diminish symptoms., Dilute vinegar with water to remove the capsaicin from your hands, as water alone will not do so. This herb can cause burning on sensitive areas of your skin. In particular, be sure never to touch your eyes or use the restroom with capsaicin still on your hands., Avoid using capsicum products when breastfeeding. Never use capsaicin cream on damaged skin. Stop using capsicum products 2 weeks before undergoing surgery. Capsicum products may increase the likelihood of dangerous effects of cocaine use, including heart attack and death.Talk to your doctor before using a capsicum product if you’re using any medications or other herbs, particularly those that slow blood clotting. These include many common over-the-counter pain relievers.

Keep any cuts or injured areas on the lip thoroughly clean with soap and water.
Apply pressure with a clean cloth if there is bleeding.
Use ice/cold compresses to reduce any swelling or bruising.
Small punctures should be treated with antiseptics and/or hydrogen peroxide. But these will usually close on their own. Larger ones will require treatment by a medical professional--and likely stitches.
Any more significant injuries should be seen by a doctor immediately.

, Use a lip balm, preferably oil based, to lock in moisture and keep your lips in healthy condition. This will prevent the skin of the lips from being irritated and swollen.








Lip balms with olive oil, shea butter, lemon, and other ingredients high in anti-oxidants are recommended.
You can apply daily and/or whenever you feel your lips are becoming dry and chapped.
This is especially important to do during periods of cold weather.

, If this is the cause of your lip(s) appearing larger, you can remove them fairly simply.Use tweezers or wax. Tweezers can be used to individually pluck the hairs out by the root.
Waxing. Wax will be applied across the area if it's a swath of hairs and then a tape will be placed on and peeled off to pull the hairs out. Waxing is more efficient, but could be slightly messy and painful.
Electrolysis is an option. This will require an expert who will use a small needle inserted into each hair to destroy it root and all with electric current.
Pulsed laser. This is similar to the electrolysis option in that an expert will use a small but strong powerful light beam to permanently destroy each hair follicle.
Avoid shaving or creams. Shaving or creams, while they can cut the hairs or the creams can slow growth, will not permanently remove hairs on the lip.

, There are other things that could be causing your lips to look large that may not be in your control. If so, you may not not want to pursue a reduction method prematurely.If you wear other gear like braces, you should wait until they are removed before determining if your lips need any action taken regarding their size.
If you have another, more serious medical condition in the area, like a cleft lip or cleft palate, then anything you do to the rest of the lip area will involve complications and should be guided by a doctor.

, If none of your lip care techniques have helped your lip(s) appear smaller, then you may reconsider surgical approaches.


Review if you've exhausted conventional cosmetic and hygienic approaches to reducing the apparent size of your lip(s).
Identify other potential causes of your lip(s) large size.

",How to Make Lips Look Smaller3," Any cosmetic surgery has a number of things that can go wrong, and you should weigh those risks against the value of permanently reducing the size of your lip(s).Complications from anesthesia exist in most surgeries, ask your surgeon or anesthesiologist about them.
There is a risk of infection in and around the operating site--and the lip/mouth area is already a high risk area.
Excessive bleeding or internal damage resulting in more operations can result.
Nerve damage, temporary or permanent, can result--necessitating more operations, leaving the area numb, or in pain.
Scarring can occur in the operating area, resulting in more operations to remove the affected skin.

, This procedure needs to be performed by a American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) certified surgeon. This surgeon is also the doctor who will evaluate if you are a candidate for the procedure.The surgeon will review your medical history, make a clinical assessment of your lips, discuss concerns, and go over the procedure.
If the surgeon recommends the procedure, they will explain its details, costs, risks, and recovery to you.
During the 1-hour long procedure, the surgeon will give you local anesthetic or more complete oral sedation. Then they will make an incision along the length of the lip inside the mouth, remove a strip of tissue, and stitch the cut closed.
The cost of lip reduction surgery can range from $1,500 to $4,000, and because it is considered entirely cosmetic, is usually not covered by insurance.

, Soreness, tightness, and pain are common sensations to feel after lip reduction surgery. Your surgeon may provide recovery instructions and prescribe painkillers to help alleviate the discomfort.Avoid vigorous exercise.
Sleep with your head elevated, perhaps with a couple of pillows under your head.
Avoid highly acidic/citrus foods. Eat softer and pureed foods for the recovery period.
Rinse with antiseptic mouthwash to fight infection at the incision site.
The sutures should be removed within a week-to-ten days of the procedure if all goes well. Most of the irritation or swelling should have subsided by then.
If there are any signs of excessive pain, bleeding, or unexpected side effects, report it to your surgeon or doctor immediately.

Fill a glass or mason jar with 2 ounces cinnamon bark oil.,
Place all of the toothpicks you intend to soak into the jar.,
Seal the jar.,
Let the soak remain undisturbed overnight.,
Prepare a non-absorbing area to dry the toothpicks.,
Remove the toothpicks to the prepared surface.,
Test the sticks' dryness after a few hours.,
Store the toothpicks for later use.,
Save the cinnamon oil for later use.",How to Make Cinnamon Toothpicks," The oil needs to cover the bottom of the jar, and the jar should be one that you can seal with an airtight lid.Make sure the jar is glass, not plastic. This will affect the soak. The jar should probably be 12 to 16 ounces in capacity.
Cinnamon oil is usually available in a drugstore. You may need to ask for counter service to retrieve it.;
, You want to do as many at the same time as you can, so 100 or more per setting is recommended.Toothpicks come in many bundle-sizes, so you should be fine doing up to 500 in a setting if you are so inclined.
If you are concerned about a mess, make sure the jar and area around is on a non-absorbing towel or surface you can clean later. The non-absorbing part is crucial for a later step.

, It is important that this be an airtight cover once the toothpicks are placed in the jar coated inside with the cinnamon oil.The lid will keep the oil fresh and allow it to travel up the wood of the toothpicks to complete the soak.

, The longer the toothpicks soak, the spicier or ""hotter"" they will become.The longer the soak goes on, the more cinnamon flavor the toothpicks will absorb.
Avoid soaking the toothpicks for a full day or they may become hot enough to burn the mouth of someone trying to enjoy them.

, Do this before the soak is complete.Make sure this area is not exposed to direct sunlight.
If there are towels or rags laid out for the toothpicks to rest upon, make sure they will not inadvertently absorb the cinnamon oil from the toothpicks. So, avoid napkins, paper towels, toilet paper, and the like.
Try plastic wrap, cookie sheets, or similar instead.

, Make sure nothing on the surface will absorb the oil soaked into the toothpicks.Lay the toothpicks out flat and spread out on the surface. They will dry more quickly and evenly this way.
Make sure you have re-sealed the jar with the cinnamon oil after the toothpicks are removed. This will preserve the oil.

, They will be ready to use once they are dry. If they are still damp after a lengthy wait, you may attempt to dry them manually.If drying is taking too long, you may want to risk using napkins to dab the toothpicks dry with gentle pat-downs. Don't risk breaking the toothpicks or rubbing off the oils prematurely.
Also consider moving the toothpicks to another location in case the environment itself is perhaps too humid for drying.

, There are a number of containers you could use, but you may want something fairly portable.If your toothpicks originally came in a seal-able plastic container, consider using that again to transport them with you.
A small plastic jar or box is usually best and easily found at most stores.

, Cinnamon has many uses as a spice and health remedy, plus you may want to make more soaks for toothpicks.Keep the oil in the airtight-sealed jar and place the jar in a cool, dark place.
Make sure wherever you place the jar is away from heat sources and direct sunlight.
Spice shelf life can vary quite a bit, from months to years, so check with your seller.
Cinnamon oil has numerous other uses including killing bacteria (particularly in food), it's a preservative, it controls the spread of mosquitoes, it can be used as a massage oil, it can assist with digestive problems, and its often used with warm compresses.

See your doctor.",How to Make and Use an Onion Poultice for Congestion," Red onions typically contain the most quercetin.However, all onions have some of the antioxidant and have demonstrated expectorant properties for those with congestion. Therefore, two red onions may be preferable, but any two medium-sized onions will do.


Onions are known to contain quercetin (an antioxidant) and phytochemicals, both of which may help the body by breaking up the mucus in the chest and head.;
, You should peel, cut, and finely chop both onions.Chop them into small pieces that are only about a quarter-inch thick.

, Don’t add much water to the saucepan. Enough water to cover the bottom of the pan will do.Bring the water to a low boil and then reduce to low heat.

, Use a sieve, colander, or a double boiler and add the finely chopped onion to steam it.Stir the onion pieces and steam for several minutes until they just begin to get soft before removing them.


You can also add fresh ginger—about one-quarter cup—to help combat the infection and reduce fatigue as ginger has shown to have antiviral properties.Peel fresh ginger and either grate the ginger or chop it into very small pieces., Cool and drain the onions in a colander or sieve. Spread the onions out in the middle of a clean cotton towel or sackcloth after they’ve drained. You don’t want to have the onion juice leaking out from the towel or sackcloth, but the towel or sackcloth will be damp with onion juice., Fold the towel so that none of the onions can leak out.You can take the four corners of the towel, gather them up, and tie it off with a string or a rubber band.

, If you are using an onion poultice on a small child, rub some coconut oil on the child’s skin. Rub the coconut oil where you are going to apply the poultice to ensure that the oils from the onion do not irritate the child’s skin.


After removing the poultice, wash the area with soapy water.
You can combat the smell of the onion by putting some lemon juice on the spot where the poultice was.

, Once the poultice has cooled enough, place it directly on your chest to to assist with congestion due to a cold or upper respiratory infection.The onion poultice often quickly induces a productive cough. A cough is your body’s method of getting rid of the congestion.Allow yourself to cough up as much phlegm as you can.


Leave the poultice on for twenty to thirty minutes.

, If you also have sinus congestion or a headache due to sinus pressure, you can place the poultice on your forehead to help act as a sinus decongestant. Ensure that the towel is cool enough to be comfortable and leave the poultice in place for twenty to thirty minutes.

, Turn your head so that the painful ear faces upward. Gently place the onion poultice over your ear. You do not need to press or apply pressure. Simply set the poultice over your ear. Ensure that the poultice has cooled enough to be comfortable.


Rest the poultice on your ear for fifteen to twenty minutes.
If you’re making the poultice specifically for the purpose of treating your earache, then you only need to finely chop one onion instead of two.

, If the glands around your throat or neck are swollen due to a throat infection, use an onion poultice over your neck and throat. Take the poultice and gently place it on your swollen neck glands. Make certain that it is cool enough to be comfortable.Leave the poultice on for twenty to thirty minutes.

, If you want to use the poultice over several spots due to severe congestion, you can gently reheat it over steam or in the microwave. As always, make sure it has cooled before placing the poultice on your skin. Apply as often as desired., Fresh onions (and fresh ginger if you include it) are the best to use. Chop and steam fresh ingredients to make a new poultice every day instead of reheating the day-old poultice., If using the onion poultice doesn’t result in any improvement within two or three days, call your physician. If you see any of the following symptoms, call your doctor right away:


Fever of over 100 °F (37.8 °C) for over twenty-four hours (over twelve hours for children under twelve years of age)
Coughing up blood (red or brown streaks in the sputum)
Any vomiting or nausea
Difficulty in breathing or swallowing
