Make sure the gripe water doesn't have alcohol.,
Avoid charcoal.,
Choose one without sugar.,
Talk to your pediatrician.,
Follow the directions on the bottle.,
Understand gripe water can make things worse.,
Look for these digestive side effects.,
Watch for allergies.,
Understand how it takes away from breastfeeding.,
Pick a different formula.,
Change your diet.,

Help your baby sleep.,
Skip smoking.,
Check to make sure nothing else is wrong.",How to Use Gripe Water for Colic," When gripe water was first invented, it contained alcohol, which was believed to calm babies. While that type of gripe water isn't common these days, make sure that any gripe water you buy for your baby doesn't have alcohol in it, as that is harmful to an infant., Another common ingredient in gripe water is vegetable carbon or charcoal. While it's not toxic to your baby, this ingredient can cause constipation. Therefore, check for this ingredient, and make sure the gripe water doesn't have it in it before feeding it to your baby., Another ingredient you need to keep an eye out for is sugar. A number of gripe waters contain sugar, but your baby doesn't need that extra sugar.Plus, introducing sugar to a baby's diet can lead to dental problems early on.

, It's always best to talk to your child's pediatrician before starting any supplement or home remedy. Your doctor can help you decide if gripe water is safe for your baby, as well as help you chose the best brand for your baby's safety.Make sure to ask about dosing before giving gripe water to your child.

, Every brand will be a little different, so you must follow the directions on the bottle when you give your baby gripe water. Basically, you'll put a dose in the bottle and have your baby drink it instead of milk.Keep in mind that gripe water isn't regulated like medication, so every brand is different.

, In some cases, gripe water can induce colic in babies, which is, of course, what you're hoping to soothe. Therefore, it's important to pay attention to see if the remedy is actually worsening your baby's symptoms., Gripe water can also cause other side effects in babies. Namely, it can cause either vomiting or constipation, both of which can be dangerous, or at the very least, make your baby uncomfortable., Gripe water isn't particularly known to cause allergies. However, any new substance you give your baby can cause an allergic reaction. Therefore, you should be on the lookout for symptoms such as hives, watering eyes, swelling in the mouth or tongue, or trouble breathing. Stomach problems, such as diarrhea, can also indicate an allergic reaction., The World Health Organization recommends exclusively feeding breast milk for the first six months. Regularly feeding gripe water breaks up this process, as it introduces another source of water that may fill up the baby., If you have your baby on formula, simply switching to a different one can help ease colic symptoms. You can switch off a cow's milk formula, to a non-cow's milk formula, for instance, though it can be more expensive. Look for words like ""hypoallergenic."", If you're breastfeeding your baby, you can try changing up your diet. Sometimes, the things you eat can affect the baby. Try cutting common allergens from your diet, such as wheat, soy, fish, eggs, peanuts, and cow's milk., Sometimes, swaddling can help colic symptoms. Simply wrap your baby up completely in a blanket (with their head out, of course), then hold your baby close to you. Gently rocking can also help.Some people also find that carrying your baby more can help.

, You can also create better conditions to help your baby sleep. For instance, you can have a white noise machine in your baby's room, or even use things like the dryer or vacuum cleaner nearby when they're out of their crib. You can also take your baby for a car ride, as many babies find that soothing., While smoking doesn't cause colic, it can make your baby cry more. Make sure you're not smoking around your baby, and if you're breastfeeding, it's best to cut out smoking altogether. In addition, make sure no one else smokes around your baby., In the moment, make sure your baby isn't hungry, tired, or wet every time they cry. It's also important to have your baby child checked out by a doctor if they suddenly start crying more. They could have an underlying condition that's causing the crying."

Rest.,
Ice.,
Compression.,
Elevation.,
Switch from ice to heat.,
Gently massage the area.,
Use comfrey ointment.,
Try witch hazel ointment.,
Hide the bruise.",How to Make a Bruise Go Away," This is step one of the common ""R.I.C.E."" (rest, ice, compression and elevation) plan. If you keep using the muscles near your bruise, it may spread or take longer to heal. Avoid heavy exercise for a couple days because an increased heart rate may send more blood to the area of the bruise.;
, This is step two of the R.I.C.E. plan. Wrap ice cubes in a clean towel or shirt and put the ice over the bruise. Apply for about 15 minutes, then wait at least 45 minutes before you ice again. Repeat this often for the first 24 to 48 hours after a bruise appears. This reduces blood flow to the area, which reduces swelling and spreading.Do not ice for longer than the recommended amount of time or place the ice directly on the skin. This can cause skin damage.
You can use a cold pack or a bag of frozen vegetables.

, This is step 3 of the R.I.C.E. plan. While icing, try to wrap a towel fairly tightly around the area. This further reduces the blood flow that causes swelling in a fresh bruise. Be careful not to cut of the circulation in that part of your body. If you feel tingling, you've made the wrap too tight.

, When possible, keep the bruised area above the heart so that the blood flows away from the bruised area rather than into the bruised area. If the bruise is on your leg, for example, lie down and prop your leg up on a stack of cushions.


Keep your head above your heart, even if the bruise is on your head or stomach.

, Two or three days after your bruise appears, stop icing and start warming. At this point, blood flow is needed to promote healing. Several times a day, soak a washcloth in warm water and lay the washcloth over the bruise until it cools.You can also stop compression and elevation.

, This encourages blood flow, which isn't helpful for a fresh bruise but speeds healing once the bruise has started to fade. Stop if you feel pain.If you're lucky, the bruise will look much better a few hours later. Don't be surprised if it takes longer, especially after a nasty fall.

, Spread a thick layer of 10-percent comfrey root ointment over the bruise. Cover it with gauze or a non-air-tight bandage. Repeat daily for a few days.This should speed up healing and reduce pain.


Never take an oral comfrey supplement. These can be dangerous.

, Rubbing this ointment over the bruise may speed up the healing. Try doing this several times per day. It's unclear how much this helps, but this is more believable than most home remedies.Dab a small amount on clear skin first to test for allergies. Don't use witch hazel if your skin turns red or itches.
Witch hazel has not been studied scientifically on pregnant or breastfeeding women. However, traditional midwives do use it.

, If you've got a black eye and a job interview the next day, stop seeking miracle cures. Instead, use makeup that matches your skin tone to make the bruise invisible. Recruit a friend with the know-how, visit a salon or buy a commercial bruise-covering kit.

Find fresh eucalyptus.,
Wash the leaves in the sink with water.,
Measure 1 cup (8 oz) of oil.,
Strip eucalyptus leaves from stem, and gently crush with your hands.This will start to extract the oil, and your hands will smell of the leaves.,
Combine oil and leaves in a crock pot set on low.Make sure the lid is on your crock pot.,
Pour the eucalyptus oil through a fine mesh strainer when the oil is cool.,
Label the eucalyptus oil.",How to Make Eucalyptus Oil1," Eucalyptus trees grow wild in warmer climates. In colder climates, eucalyptus is sold by nurseries as a potted plant or shrub. You'll need a good handful - approximately 1/4 cup - of leaves for every cup of oil you intend to make.Eucalyptus is found at most florists, as it is a favorite addition to many floral displays.
In warmer climates, you might find eucalyptus for sale at farmer's markets or gardening stores.
You may find eucalyptus for sale online. Although it's technically a tree or shrub, it's also labeled as an herb for its fragrance and medicinal properties.
The best time of day to cut eucalyptus is early in the morning, when its leaves contain a high concentration of oil.;
, Rinse well, and set aside to dry. You may also choose to dry the leaves with a clean, dry cloth or towel.This step is particularly important when buying eucalyptus from a florist, as the leaves may be sprayed with preservative.
Get the leaves as dry as you can, but if there's a little water left it will evaporate,

, The best oil will be a light carrier oil, either cold-pressed virgin olive oil, coconut oil or almond oil.A strong scent is unnecessary because you want the eucalyptus scent to dominate the oil.


If you'd like to make less than 8 oz of eucalyptus oil, use less oil and fewer leaves. For example, if you'd like to make 4 oz (1/2 cup) of oil, measure 4 oz of oil, and use approximately 1/8 cup eucalyptus leaves.
If you want to make more, just keep the proportions the same: 4 parts oil to 1 part leaves.

,


You can also chop the leaves with a sharp knife. If there are bits of stem and twig in the mix, that's okay.
If you want to use mixed herbs to create your oil, you should add them at this time.

, There should be about 1/4 cup of oil resting above your leaves.


Allow the mixture to steep for at least 6 hours. The longer it steeps, the stronger your eucalyptus oil will be.
The scent of the steaming oil will be fairly strong throughout your home. Make sure you're making your eucalyptus oil at a time you can enjoy it.

, Catch the oil in a jar. Ideally, this will be a dark glass jar, but any jar will serve so long as it's kept in a dark location in your home.It's important to wait until the oil has cooled before pouring, so the glass doesn't crack from the sudden heat.
Use clean, glass jars with tight fitting lids. Make sure they are dry as well. Any water or moisture in the jars can cause mold.

, You can be as creative as you like in designing labels for your homemade essential oils, but you'll definitely want to identify it by type (Eucalyptus Oil) and by the date it was completed.


The oil will be good for approximately 6 months from the time you make it.If you've included other herbs to your eucalyptus oil, include this on the label. Some popular additions are: Sage, Lavender, Spearmint, or Rosemary.
To store oil for a longer time, keep in the refrigerator.

Combine distilled water and olive oil.Combine 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil with 1.5 qt (1.5 L) of distilled water in a small saucepan.,
Warm the solution.,
Administer and retain for several minutes.",How to Make an Enema1,"


Olive oil is a gentle way to soften stools. It can also lubricate the rectum, which allows stools to pass through more readily.
For a slight variation, consider combining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil with 1 qt (1 L) of whole milk and 1/2 qt (1/2 L) of distilled water.

As the colon metabolizes the milk, the bacteria living there creates gas, which pushes the enema further into the colon and makes it more effective.

;
, Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it gently over medium heat. It should reach a temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).


For an oil enema that includes milk, watch the contents of the saucepan closely to prevent the milk from curdling. If the milk does curdle, do not use the solution; discard it and start over.

, Administer the enema and try to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before evacuating your bowels.


In some individuals, the milk may cause a violent reaction rather quickly. You should at least try to administer the entire enema before evacuating the bowels, but beyond that, there is no strict time limit on a milk-based oil enema.

Choose a fabric to make your microwaveable wrap from.,
Measure your neck with a fabric tape measure, and add 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) to account for seams.,
Choose your filling.,
Add an aromatherapy scent.,
Cut the fabric to the measurements you just took, making sure to leave room for seams.,
Fold the fabric lengthwise with the inside fabric facing out.,
Sew the length and 1 end with either a sewing machine or needle and thread.,
Sew the remaining end, leaving approximately a 1 inch (2.54 cm) opening at the end of this remaining side.,
Turn the fabric right side out through the 1 inch (2.54 cm) opening on the side.

,
Pour the aromatic grain or beans into the sack or inner sack with a funnel or a measuring cup with a spout.,
Sew up the remaining seam tightly with a needle and thread or a zipper foot on your sewing machine.,
Heat your bag, or inner bag, in the microwave for 90 seconds.,
Wash the fabric and replace the filler on your neck warmer every 3 to 6 months, depending upon the heaviness of use.",How to Make a Microwaveable Neck Wrap1," You can go to the fabric store to find a comfortable flannel, fleece, muslin, denim or cotton print; however, you can also use socks, old shirts, washcloth or towels. Whatever you choose to use, be sure that it contains no sparkly or metallic threads, wires, bead, etc, as these will catch fire when microwaved later on.


A large, thick sock is the easiest cloth to use, since it is already round and you do not need to sew all the sides. You can also use an old hand towel and fold it in half lengthwise, for another easy option.
If you choose a loose weave on your fabric, also find or buy a flannel or muslin cloth to use as your inner lining, so your filling does not leak out.;
, If you do not want to measure, a length of about 20 inches (51 cm) width of 5 inches (13 cm) will work for most necks.


If you want to use the wrap for other parts of your body, like your back, be sure to extend the wrap a few extra inches or cm to make the wrap more versatile.

, People use long grained white rice, flax seed, buckwheat, barley, oatmeal, feed corn, cherry pits, beans or millet seed. If you are making a rice neck wrap, make sure you do not use instant rice, which may cook when heated.

, Although this is not necessary, a relaxing scent can help to relax and remove tension from your body. Choose an essential oil or spice and mix it with your filling of choice in a large bowl. Let the filling sit with the scent for a day or so and stir often to make sure the scent is distributed throughout the grain.


For example, you can use approximately 5 drops of an essential oil like lavender, peppermint or rose. You can also use 5 pinches of spices like cinnamon, cloves or rosemary. You can also mix with rose or other flower petals.

, If you are using a towel or a sock, this will not be necessary. If you plan to have an inner and outer fabric, cut rectangles out of both the lining and cover material, making the lining slightly smaller - about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm).

, Pin it in place across the open length and both ends so the seams stay together while you sew.

, Make sure your stitches are very close together so small grains of rice do not poke out of the seams.

,


If you are sewing an inner and outer bag, leave 1 end all the way open on the outer bag. You will need to open the outer bag regularly while you heat the inner bag.

,, Experiment with the amount. Most neck wraps are 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not fill it all the way, as the less full it is, the more it will conform to your body.

, Although this 1 inch (2.54 cm) of the seam will face out, it is important to be able to rip this seam out and replace the grain if the bag loses its scent or gets wet.


If you are making an outer bag, hem the 2 sides of the outer bag in and adhere Velcro to each side so that you can open and close it easily.

, If you do not feel it is warm enough, heat in 30 second intervals. Place around your neck and over your shoulders until the neck wrap cools, approximately 20 minutes.

, If you really want to get fancy, make the pillow, and then make a cover for it that can be easily washed, yet removed during the microwaving process. Just remember to make the cover measurements slightly larger in order to accommodate the inner pillow. This makes an excellent gift. Good Luck!

Gather two mason jars.,
Gather eucalyptus leaves, as in preceding steps.,
Pour the oil over the smashed eucalyptus leaves and salt mix.,
Strain leaves from oil by pouring through a tea strainer or cheesecloth.Hold the strainer or cloth over the open mouth of the jar, and pour the oil into your storage jar.,
Label the eucalyptus oil.",How to Make Eucalyptus Oil2," One jar will be used for making the eucalyptus oil in, and the other for storing it. You can use pint jars, quart jars, or larger jars, depending on how much eucalyptus oil you intend to make.Make sure your jars are clean and dry, as any water or moisture can result in mold.
The jar you use for making the oil can be clear or dark glass. A dark glass jar is best for storing the eucalyptus oil.

, You will use the same proportion of leaves to oil as you did in the crock pot method - about 4 parts oil to 1 part eucalyptus leaves. Use 1/4 cup of eucalyptus leaves for every cup of oil.


Place the eucalyptus leaves in the jar, followed by a thin layer of sea salt.The salt will help to extract the oil from the leaves.
With the handle part of a long spoon, smash the eucalyptus leaves into the bottom of the jar, releasing their natural oils.

, Allow to steep for at least 2 weeks in the warm sunshine. The longer you allow the mixture to steep, the stronger it will be.


Make sure your jar is tightly sealed, and give it a good shake to stir the leaves together with the oil. Continue to shake the jar every 12 hours or so until the steeping is finished.
The spot where you keep your mixture while it's steeping should receive 8-12 hours of direct sunshine per day for maximum benefit. Keep it in an area that's not hidden from site, so that you don't forget to shake it.

,


The strainer will catch the leaves, which you can discard.
Wipe down any excess oil from your storage jar with a damp cloth.

, You can be as creative as you like in designing labels for your homemade essential oils, but you'll definitely want to identify it by type (Eucalyptus Oil) and by the date it was completed.


The oil will be good for approximately 6 months from the time you make it.If you've included other herbs to your eucalyptus oil, include this on the label. Some popular additions are: Sage, Lavender, Spearmint, or Rosemary.

Warm the distilled water.,
Combine powdered acidophilus with the warm water.Stir 1 tsp (5 ml) of powdered acidophilus into the warm water until it dissolves.,
Administer and retain the enema for 10 minutes.",How to Make an Enema2," Use a small saucepan or kettle to heat 2 qt (2 L) of distilled water to 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).


Gently heat the water on the stove over a medium heat setting.
The water can be as hot as 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). Avoid any temperature higher than that, however, since extremely hot water can be bad for your body.

,


Alternatively, you can break open four to five capsules of dry acidophilus or use 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of probiotic yogurt.
Acidophilus is a live culture and type of beneficial bacteria. When it is applied directly to the colon in the form of an enema, the bacteria can propagate more effectively and help the colon cleanse itself.
This type of enema can be especially helpful for those suffering with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, hemorrhoids, or colon cancer.

, Administer the enema as usual and retain it for at least 10 minutes before evacuating.


If you do not retain the enema for at least 10 minutes, the beneficial bacteria it provides may not be able to get deep enough into the colon to be effective.
Retaining it for more than 10 minutes will increase the effectiveness of the enema, but you should usually evacuate within 20 minutes.

"

Heat distilled water to a comfortable temperature.,
Dissolve sea salt into the water.,
Administer and retain for as long as possible.",How to Make an Enema3," Heat 2 qt (2 L) of distilled water to a temperature between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).


Pour the water into a small saucepan or kettle. Place it on the stove and heat it over medium until it reaches the desired temperature.

, Add 2 tsp (10 ml) of pure sea salt to the warm water. Stir until the salt dissolves.


An enema prepared with pure sea salt is one of the gentlest types you can use, making it a good option for someone who has never used an enema before. The salt reduces the amount of water absorbed into the bloodstream but does not draw water in or out of the colon, which means that this enema will feel more tolerable than most others.
For a much stronger enema, use 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of Epsom salts, instead. Epsom salts contain a high dose of magnesium. They increase water in the intestines, thereby flushing the colon out more rapidly. Do not use Epsom salts if you are experiencing stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting, however.

, Administer the enema as you would any other. Retain it for as long as possible to maximize its effectiveness.


Note that a salt water enema prepared with sea salt should only be retained for up to 40 minutes.
Salt water enemas prepared with Epsom salt work more rapidly and may need to be evacuated after 5 to 10 minutes, but should not be retained for more than 20 minutes.

Heat the distilled water.,
Combine the water with fresh lemon juice.,
Administer and retain for several minutes.",How to Make an Enema4," Using a kettle or small saucepan, heat 2 qt (2 L) of distilled water over a medium heat setting on the stove.


The water should be heated to a temperature range that is natural to the human body. Ideally, the temperature should fall somewhere between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).

, Add 2/3 cup (158 ml) of fresh lemon juice to the water. Stir well to combine.


Three average-sized lemons should produce an adequate amount of juice. Make sure that the juice is filtered before adding it to the water for your enema.
Lemon juice can cleanse the colon of excess feces while balancing the pH of the organ.
When used once a week, a lemon juice enema can soothe discomfort caused by colitis and chronic constipation.
Note that the acidity in the lemon juice can irritate the lining of your intestines, so it may cause some cramping. As such, this type of enema is not recommended for individuals with abnormally sensitive digestive tracts.

, Administer the entire enema and retain it for 10 to 15 minutes, or for as long as you can without causing cramping and other intense pain.


Since lemon juice is so acidic, it may not be comfortable to hold for extended periods of time. You should try to retain it for at least 5 minutes before evacuating to receive an adequate amount of benefit.

Heat whole milk.,
Mix molasses into the milk.,
Cool slightly.,
Administer and retain as possible.",How to Make an Enema5," Pour 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of whole milk into a small saucepan. Heat it on the stove over medium to medium-high, bringing it to a slight boil.


Stir the milk and heat it carefully to prevent it from curdling. Do not use curdled milk in an enema.
This type of enema can be a highly effective way to clear the colon of excess feces. In fact, it can cause an extremely volatile reaction in the colon, so it is best to use it with caution and as a last resort.

, Remove the saucepan from the stove and stir in 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of blackstrap molasses. Continue stirring until the two ingredients are thoroughly combined.


The amount of molasses used should match the amount of milk used.
The combined sugars in the milk and molasses feed bacteria in the colon, causing gas to develop and push the enema further up the digestive tract. These sugars also draw moisture into the colon, making it easier to pass fecal matter.
Note that this type of enema is known to cause severe cramping.

, Allow the enema solution to sit at room temperature until it drops to a temperature that is safe to use inside the body.


The ideal temperature range is between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).

, When the enema is cool enough, administer it and retain for as long as possible before evacuation.


At the very least, you should try to administer the entire solution before evacuating. Apply the enema quickly to improve your odds of getting the entire amount into the colon.
Note that this is one of the messiest homemade enema solutions available. You may want to use a disposable bag or replacement tubing. Keep thick towels nearby in the event of a leak or premature bowel movement.

Ask your doctor for an anti-nausea medication.",How to Get Rid of Nausea Fast," Nausea can be triggered or worsened by moving around. Try resting while sitting in a quiet space or room on a bed or a mat. If you still feel nauseous, gently ease yourself down to a lying position but prop your head up with anything but most preferably with a pillow (it is easier to get to sleep and much more comfortable).If you can relax well enough, a quick nap can also get rid of your nausea. You might feel better by the time you wake up.;
, A breath of fresh air can clear your lungs, reduce anxiety, and make your stomach feel a bit better.Sit in a quiet space and close your eyes, try to think about anything else other than your nausea(to get your mind of the feeling).
Get off all electronics, a headache can be obtained by too much time on electronics and you don't need to add a headache to your nausea.
Take a deep breath through your nose and hold it. Then, slowly breath out your mouth. Repeat this several times.

, Nausea can be caused by a fever, but even if it isn't, your temperature can rise as a result of moderate to severe nausea. Cool temperatures can help stabilize your body temperature.Take a clean washcloth and dip it in cold water. Press the compress under your neck if lying on your back. If you are sitting upright, wear it around the back of your neck.

, Watch a movie, call up a friend, or do any other mild, light activity that prevents you from fixating on your nausea.Some nausea can be triggered or worsened by anxiety. Getting your mind off any other worries you may have can help the nausea to go away.
Avoid activities that require intense focus. For instance, reading or writing that requires your eyes to focus on a block of text for a lengthy amount of time can cause eye strain. Under normal conditions, this strain may not affect you, but while you feel nauseous, any extra strain or stress can worsen your symptoms.
Hold off on any high-intensity physical activities. While gentle movement can help your nausea, odds are, most physical activity will cause undue stress to your stomach, which can worsen your nausea.

, Your sense of smell is connected to your digestive system, so a strong scent can send your stomach reeling and worsen your nausea(avoid paint at all costs).Do not cook, smoke, or put on perfume. In fact, if at all possible, you should remove yourself from an area in which anyone is cooking, smoking, or wearing strong perfume.

, Acupressure is an ancient Chinese method that involves placing pressure on an area of your body, using your fingers. Acupressure, like acupuncture, works by changing the pain messages that nerves send to your brain.Take your middle and index fingers and form a “C” shape. Use this shape to press firmly down on the groove between the two large tendons on the inside of your wrist that start at the base of your palm.
Hold them there for 30 seconds to a minute. Then, release your fingers from your wrist. You should feel your nausea lift or subside., If you need to have your hands free, you can still try acupressure by purchasing an acupressure or motion sickness bracelet. These bands have a button that applies pressure to points on your wrist continually, providing you with relief throughout the day., Sometimes, nausea is caused by discomfort in your back and neck. Gentle stretches can relieve your back and neck pain and help to relieve your nausea.To stretch your upper back, do a downward facing cross legged pose. Sit cross-legged on the floor and bend your body forward. Stop bending forward when your body is at a 45 degree angle with your legs. Rest your arms on a chair in front of you. If you are more flexible, you can also bend your body until your forehead touches the ground in front of you and your hands are stretched outward.
To stretch your neck, sit down in a chair. Relax your shoulders and place your hands on your thighs. Tilt your head toward your shoulder and hold for 15 to 30 seconds. Keep your opposite shoulder down. Take a deep breath and bring your head back to the center. Repeat this 2 to 4 times for each side.Another great anti-nausea yoga pose is putting your legs up against a wall. Lie on a yoga mat or carpet against a wall. Place your tailbone and buttocks against the wall and swing your legs up the wall. Remain in this position for at least 5 minutes, or 40-50 breaths. This pose should help to calm your nausea and reduce any stress or tension in your body.

, When your stomach is upset due to nausea, you need to eat small amounts of food and slowly drink small amounts of fluids to avoid overwhelming your stomach.It is important to eat and drink even when you feel nauseous. Hunger and dehydration can actually cause nausea or make your nausea worse.

, While eating might be the last thing you want to do, an empty stomach will only make your nausea worse. To avoid upsetting your stomach further, try eating easy-to-digest foods.Good examples of bland foods include crackers, toast, potatoes, noodles, rice, and English muffins. If your nausea is only mild, you could also try baked or boiled chicken or fish.
Good examples of hydrating foods include popsicles, clear broth-based soups, and Jello.
Avoid foods that are greasy, salty, or spicy. For example, sausage, fast food, fried foods, and potato chips are your enemy while you suffer from nausea. These foods are all too heavy for your stomach to handle when it is feeling sensitive., The difference in temperature can send your stomach for a whirl, which is the last thing you want while fighting off nausea.


As a general guideline, cold food is usually gentler on the stomach and proves more effective at calming nausea than hot food does. Hot food can have strong smells, which can make your nausea worse., Hydration is vital during fits of nausea. Drinking water and fruit juices in small amounts throughout the day will help relieve your nausea. Use a straw to help you sip, rather than gulp, fluids.Water is your best option, but fruit juices like apple juice can work, as well. Flat soda, especially flat ginger ale, can help settle a nauseous stomach.
If you have vomited, drink a sports drink that contains glucose, salt, and potassium to replace any of the minerals you could have lost.
Avoid beverages that contain caffeine and alcohol.

, This can slow down your digestion and lead to a stomachache, on top of your nausea. Wait at least half an hour to an hour before you lie down after you've had a meal to give your stomach time to digest., Ginger tea, raw ginger, and candied ginger can all be used to help reduce a bout of nausea. Ginger root promotes the secretion of various digestive juices and enzymes that help neutralize stomach acid. The phenols in ginger also relax the muscles in your stomach, thereby reducing the amount of activity in your stomach while helping your intestines push toxins through your system faster.Make ginger tea with about 2 inches of ginger root. Wash the ginger root and peel it. Slice it into small pieces, or crush it by covering it with wax paper and using a spoon to smash it.
Boil 2-3 cups of water over medium high heat. Then, add the ginger and let it boil for 3-5 minutes.
Remove the tea from heat and strain it if you don’t want little bits of ginger in your tea. Then, pour it in a mug and add honey if you’d like. Sip it slowly.

, Peppermint tea and hard peppermint candy have nausea-relieving properties similar to those of ginger.


The scent of peppermint is also very effective at reducing nausea. Place a few drops of food-safe peppermint oil directly on the insides of your wrists or your gums.

, Bland food can help to tame your tummy, including milk and bread. Bread absorbs excess acid, while milk coats your stomach and helps to settle it. You do not want to drink milk straight though, as dairy alone can upset your stomach, so make milk toast for a happy medium.If you have the stomach flu (or gastroenteritis), do not try this remedy, as the stomach flu reacts poorly to dairy.
Heat 1 cup of milk until it’s hot, but not boiling. Pour the milk into a bowl.
Toast a piece of bread and spread a small amount of unsalted butter on it.
Crumble the toast into the milk and stir it. Eat it slowly.

, A cold or frozen lemon works best. The sharp smell and taste of citrus can help reduce your nausea.Cut a lemon in half and place it close enough to smell without it becoming overwhelming.
If smelling the lemon does not work, cut it into wedges and place them in the freezer for 30 minutes or so. Once they are chilled or frozen, suck on the slice of lemon to relieve your nausea quickly.

, If you can make a quick trip to your local convenience store or supermarket, pick up a non-prescription treatment labeled for use against nausea.


Bismuth subsalicylate is a popular over-the-counter drug used to treat many forms of digestive upset, including nausea. Relief should be almost instantaneous after you take it.Generic ""anti-nausea liquid"" can be found at many drug stores and supermarkets. These medications are usually little more than a combination of dextrose, fructose, and phosphoric acid.

, Many pain medications, for example, can trigger and worsen nausea.A quick, simple way to determine if a medication could worsen your nausea would be to check its common side effects. If “nausea” is listed as a possible side effect, that medication could be a possible cause of your nausea.
Examples of nausea inducing over the counter medication include Tylenol, Advil, Aleve, and Motrin., You should also get medical attention if you cannot keep any food or water down, or are nauseous for more than 48 hours.You should also seek medical attention if you feel weak, have a fever, have stomach pain, or cannot urinate for 8 hours or more.
If there is blood in your vomit, bright red or coffee grounds in appearance and if you have a severe headache or a stiff neck or severe abdominal pain, go see a doctor.

, You should also take your child to a doctor if she hasn’t urinated in 4-6 hours, she has signs of dehydration, and she is experiencing diarrhea., There are several prescription medications that work to reduce nausea. Most begin working within 30 to 60 minutes.Promethazine hydrochloride is available as a tablet, syrup, injection, or suppository.Chlorpromazine is only available as a suppository.
Prochlorperazine comes as both tablets and suppositories.
Trimetho-benzamide hydrochloride is available as a capsule, injection, syrup, or suppository.
Metoclopramide hydrochloride comes as a syrup, tablet, or injection.
For relief from nausea connected to motion sickness, ask your doctor about scopolamine or Dramamine patches."

Consider silver sulfadiazine cream.",How to Get Rid of a Sunburn," Your skin may start to look a little pink or inflamed while at the beach or park, but you'll likely see it and feel it to a much greater extent by the time your get home a few hours later. As such, as soon as you feel and see sunburned skin, apply a cool compress or take a cool bath or shower if much of your skin is inflamed.The cool temperature of the water will help combat inflammation and soothe the pain a little. Your skin will also absorb some water, which is important for sunburned skin due to its dehydration.


Soak for 15–20 minutes, making sure that the water is cool yet not too cold — adding ice to the bath may feel pretty good, but it can cause your system to go into shock.
Immediately post-sunburn, do not use soap or scrub your skin — it can irritate the skin and/or further dry it out.;
, Aloe vera gel is likely the most popular herbal remedy for sunburn and other causes of inflamed skin. Aloe vera has a tremendous ability to soothe sunburn and reduce the pain. Applying aloe vera multiple times per day for the first few days after a sunburn can make a significant impact on your skin and prevent much discomfort.


If you have an actual aloe plant in your garden, break off a leaf and apply the thick inner gel / juice directly to sunburned skin. Make sure you test a small area of your skin first, however — aloe allergies are fairly common.
Alternatively, buy a bottle of pure aloe gel from a pharmacy. For best effects, place the gel in the refrigerator and apply it after it becomes cool.
There is conflicting evidence as to whether aloe speeds up the healing process. In at least one study, it was actually shown to slow healing., Oatmeal is another natural remedy for soothing sunburns. It works quickly to reduce inflammation and itchiness. In fact, oat extract has been shown in studies to have anti-inflammatory properties, which is helpful to soothe sunburned skin.As such, make a runny batch of oatmeal, cool it down for an hour or two in the fridge and then apply it directly to sunburned skin and let it dry. Rinse it off with cool water, but do so gently because oatmeal is also a mild exfoliant and you don't want to further irritate the skin.


Alternatively, buy some finely ground oatmeal (sold as colloidal oatmeal in drug stores) and mix it in liberally with cool water in the tub before taking a bath.
You can make your own finely ground oatmeal by pulverizing a cup of instant or slow-cooking oatmeal in a blender, food processor or coffee grinder until it has a smooth, fine consistency.
For smaller sunburned areas, place a handful of dry oatmeal in a square of gauze and soak it in cold water for a few minutes. Then apply the home-made compress to the burn for 20 minutes every couple of hours.

, Sunburned skin lacks the moisture of normal skin, so another way to soothe it and stimulate healing is to keep it well moisturized. After a cool shower or bath, lather generous amounts of moisturizing cream or lotion onto sunburned skin, which will help prevent water from evaporating. Repeat applications frequently throughout the day to make the eventual peeling and flaking less noticeable. Consider natural moisturizers that contain vitamins C and E, MSM, aloe vera, cucumber extract and/or calendula — all help to soothe and help repair damaged skin.If the sunburn is particularly painful, consider applying some hydrocortisone cream. A low-dose (less than 1%) hydrocortisone cream is helpful for quickly reducing pain and swelling.
Don't use creams that contain benzocaine or lidocaine — they can cause allergy in some people and make the sunburn worse.
Furthermore, don't use butter, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), or other oil-based products on sunburned skin — they can trap the heat in your body, making your sunburn worse.Sunburn pain tends to be worse between six to 48 hours after sun exposure., Another method of keeping your sunburned skin hydrated is to drink lots of fluids. For the duration of your sunburn (at least the initial few days), drink extra water, natural juice and/or uncaffeinated sports drinks so your body and skin can rehydrate and start to repair itself.Start with at least eight 8-oz beverages (preferably purified water) daily. Keep in mind that caffeine is a diuretic and stimulates more urination, so avoid coffee, black tea, soda pop and energy drinks during the initial stages of sunburn.


Because sunburn draws fluid to the skin's surface and away from the rest of the body, keep on the lookout symptoms of dehydration: dry mouth, excessive thirst, reduced urination, dark-colored urine, headache, dizziness and/or sleepiness.
Small children are especially vulnerable to dehydration (they have a greater surface area of skin compared to their weight), so check with your doctor if they appear ill or are acting strange after getting sunburned.

, Inflammation and swelling is a significant problem with moderate-to-severe sunburn, so taking over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) soon after noticing the sun damage is another good strategy. NSAIDs reduce the swelling and redness that are characteristic of sunburn.Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) and aspirin, but they tend to be hard on stomachs, so take them with food and limit their use to less than two weeks. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and other analgesics can help with the pain of sunburn, but they don't impact the inflammation and swelling.


Look for creams, lotions or gels that contain NSAIDs or pain relievers — this is a potentially quicker way to get relief from the medication.
Keep in mind that aspirin should not be taken by children or teenagers under 18 due to the risk of Reye's Syndrome, a potentially fatal condition.

, Prevention is always your first line of defense against a sunburn. There are many things you can do to protect yourself from sunburn, including: wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher; reapplying sunscreen every two hours; wearing protective clothing made from tightly-woven fabrics, long-sleeved shirts, hats, sunglasses; avoiding extended exposure to the sun during peak hours (usually 10am – 4pm).Sunburn in a very light-skinned person may take less than 15 minutes of midday sun exposure, while a darker skinned person may tolerate the same exposure for hours., Most cases of sunburn are classified as first degree burns, which can be treated at home with the above advice and staying out of the sun for awhile. However, extreme sun exposure can also cause second and third degree burns, which need medical attention and treatment.Second degree sunburn is characterized by blistered and wet looking skin, redness and damage to the entire epidermis and upper layers of the dermis.Third degree sunburn is characterized by flayed and dry looking skin, dark red or ashen color and destruction of the entire epidermis and most of the dermis. Skin sensation is usually diminished with third degree burns.


Second degree sunburns heal within 10–21 days, typically without any scarring. Third degree sunburns often need skin grafts to heal and always leave scarring.Other reasons to see a doctor after a sunburn include symptoms of dehydration (see above) or heat exhaustion (heavy sweating, faintness, fatigue, weak but rapid pulse, low blood pressure and headache).For children, as a general guideline, seek medical attention if a blistering sunburn covers 20% or more of their body (a child's whole back, for example)., Moderate-to-severe sunburn typically involves skin blistering, which is a natural protective reaction of your body. If you notice blisters form on your sunburned skin, don't pick at them or break any. Blisters contain your natural body fluid (serum) and form a protective layer over the burned skin.Breaking blisters also increases the risk of infection. If you have minimal blistering on accessible body parts (like your forearms, for example) then cover them with dry, absorbent bandages. However, if you have lots of blistering and its on your back or other inaccessible areas, then get your doctor to care for them. Your doctor will likely apply some antibiotic cream and dress the blisters properly with sterile bandages to limit the risk of infection, minimize scarring, and promote healing.


Change the bandages one to two times daily (if accessible), but remove them carefully so as to minimize further damage. Also, change the bandage immediately if it gets accidentally wet or dirty.
When the blisters do break open, apply an antibiotic ointment to the area and cover loosely with another clean bandage.
One or more blistering sunburns in childhood or adolescence doubles the risk of developing melanoma (a form of skin cancer) later in life., If your sunburn is particularly severe and involves blistering and flaying of the skin, then your doctor may recommend and prescribe silver sulfadiazine cream (Thermazene 1%). Silver sulfadiazine is a powerful bactericidal that kills bacteria and other potentially infectious agents on burned skin.It's usually applied once or twice a day, but do not use it on the face as it can cause grayish discoloration on skin. When applying the cream, wear gloves and apply a thick layer, but make sure to remove any dead and flaky skin first. Always keep the silver sulfadiazine cream covered with sterile bandages.


Colloidal silver solution, which can be purchased at many health food stores or made at home, is also a powerful antibiotic and much less expensive and problematic than silver sulfadiazine cream.Pour some colloidal silver into a sterile spray bottle and mist it over your burned skin, then let it dry before covering with bandages.
If your doctor thinks widespread infection is a strong possibility due to your severe sunburn, he/she might prescribe a short-course of oral antibiotics to be on the safe side. Be aware that some antibiotics can cause photo sensitivity worsening chances of sunburn again — make sure you are staying out of the sun.



If your sunburn is severe enough, your doctor may recommend oral steroid therapy (pills) for several days in order to combat the inflammation and pain.

Healing wraps.
Detox wraps.
Slimming wraps.;
, After you have decided which kind of wrap you want, its time to gather the ingredients for your wrap. You can purchase a pre-made mixture or collect the following ingredients to create your own basic detoxifying body wrap:1 cup of salts (Mineral, Epsom or Sea)
3 cups of water (Spring or purified)
1/2 cup Aloe Vera
3 tablespoons of oil (Shea, Olive, Sunflower or other oil) or 1/4-1/2 cup of glycerin.
Add 1-2 teaspoons of essential oil or aromatherapy oil
A chamomile or other herbal tea bag to the water while you are heating it.

, If you have any sore muscles, stress, or just generally feeling unwell, you may want to make a healing wrap. The ingredients help to remove the effects of stress and restore a sense of well being. Pick up the following ingredients:


Herbal tea bags (chamomile is best).
Olive Oil (2 tablespoons)
Lavender Essential Oil.
Peppermint Essential Oil.
Geranium Essential Oil.

, If you want to slim down some areas of your body, try making a slimming wrap. These wraps can compress areas of the body, resulting in a slimmer look. They may also remove water weight. Gather the following ingredients.


3oz (85g) of dried, seaweed powder
30z (85g) of Fullers earth powder
8 tablespoons (120ml) of lime juice
1tablespoon (15ml) of Sweet Almond Oil
1/2 teaspoon (2.5) of clear honey
4 drops of Sandalwood essential oil
2 drops of Rosemary essential oil
2 drops of Lavender essential oil

, The bandages will soak up the wrap mixture and hold it to your skin.


The wider and longer the roll the more skin area you will be able to cover.
These can be found in drug stores but may be cheaper online.
Purchase the average of 15 rolls of bandage. Try a dry wrap first to make sure you have enough.

, These pins will be used to secure the bandages. The bandages typically come with clips but safety pins make for faster work and a more secure wrap.

, You will want to make your space clean, protected, and relaxing. Make sure you have plenty of space to move and relax in. Bring in any decorations that help make your space a relaxing one.


Try using candles or relaxing music in your space.
Turn up the heat to keep the space warm and comfortable.
Realize that you will likely drip on the floor or other surfaces, so have plenty of towels.

, To make a wrap, you will need to soak your bandages in your solution. Mix and heat your ingredients and then soak your bandages in them.Heat a pot of water on a stove-top, using medium heat.
When hot, add in your ingredients. Stir to mix ingredients.

Stay hydrated.,
Rely on salt and steam for relief.,
Try Grandma's remedies.",How to Get Rid of a Cold in a Day1," With the common cold, as with most every other illness, proper hydration is key to the body’s fighting abilities. Dehydration will only add further complications for your body to deal with, and lessen its capacity for battling the cold.


Generally speaking, drinking plain old water is the best way to hydrate when you have a cold (or anytime for that matter). The traditional recommendation is eight, 8-ounce glasses of water per day, but it is very difficult to drink too much water.When you have a cold, you may also want to try electrolyte drinks (such as sports drinks). This is more important when you are actively losing fluids due to an illness, but it may also be beneficial in this case as well.;
, We all know the discomfort of the scratchy throat and stuffy nose that usually accompany the common cold. Thankfully, there are simple home remedies that can help provide some relief.


Try gargling and spitting with tepid or warm salted water. This can help soothe the throat irritation caused by inflammation, and the antibacterial properties of the saline solution may aid in your battle against germs.Some people like to use a Neti pot or similar device to irrigate the nasal passages with salted water, but you can also achieve a similar decongestant effect with saline nasal sprays.Try a hot shower, a steam, or some other source of warm, moist air. Humid air helps open breathing passages and can assist in soothing irritation. Even a room humidifier will offer some benefit., Not all ""tried-and-true"" remedies have stood the test of time based on scientific evidence, but others do seem to have legitimate reasons for success in treating cold symptoms.


Prepare chicken soup. This old wives’ tale has some scientific basis to back it up. The combination of broth, vegetables and chicken seems to inhibit part of your immune system response that creates respiratory symptoms. In addition, the hot broth reduces mucus and improves your hydration.Substitute green, echinacea and herbal teas for coffee. You should drink plenty of water while you are ill, and these teas don’t have high diuretic effects like coffee. They will also thin mucus, helping it to leave the body faster.Eat a spicy meal for lunch or dinner. Try chili peppers in a chili, curry or stir fry, which contain high-levels of capsaicin. It is an antioxidant that can also clear out mucus from your nasal passages. This could cause further throat irritation, however.

Pineapple juice -- it’s full of bromelain, which has been used as an anti-inflammatory.6 fresh lemons
1 bulb of fresh garlic
Ginger powder
Honey
Cayenne pepper;
, Mince up the garlic before you begin. Juice all 6 lemons and remove any seeds from the juice. The recipe:


The juice of 6 fresh lemons
1 clove of garlic, minced
2 tsp. ginger powder
2 tbsp. honey
3 cups pineapple juice
¼ tsp. cayenne pepper.

, Use a martini shaker or electric blender to get the best results. You can just combine the ingredients in a tall glass if you don’t have a shaker or blender.

, Determine if you’ve been tired lately due to lack of sleep or whether it might be a cold or the flu. Evaluate where it hurts. Typical signs of the flu include:Cough
Fever (often accompanied by chills)
Sore throat
Headache
Neck and back pains
Runny nose, sinus pressure

, Sometimes low grade fevers go unnoticed because they can sometimes start before the rest of your flu symptoms (such as aches and pains). And if you feel certain you have a fever, it’s good to monitor it to make sure you don’t let it get too high., Depending on your symptoms, you will probably want to get some over the counter cold and flu remedies. Early intervention is key to reducing symptoms and feeling better. Some useful remedies might be:Cough syrup (it can be especially helpful if you’re having trouble sleeping)
Pain relievers (this would be for fevers, headaches, and any body pain). Either acetaminophen (Tylenol, store brands) or ibuprofen (Advil, store brands) are good choices.
Sinus spray (good for helping to keep your nose clear of mucus)

, For some people, having the flu can severely tax an already-compromised immune system. An antiviral can help you avoid the worst of the flu symptoms, and shorten the time you are ill. If you have various other health concerns, are pregnant, or over 65 you might be a good candidate for an antiviral prescription, which needs to be taken during the early stages of the flu., Drink approximately 1 cup of the mixture four times daily until symptoms ease. Make more as necessary. Even if its ingredients are not actively helping you get better, the potion helps you stay hydrated.

, Getting enough fluids in your body while you’re sick is important -- it can help you recover more quickly. If you’re congested, try hot beverages like herbal infusions, or the classic chicken noodle soup. If you feel you still aren’t getting enough fluids, sometimes a sports drink can help restore more electrolytes and help you feel better., Rest for as long as you need. Sleeping helps your body heal and recover from the symptoms of whatever flu strain you might be suffering from. Stay away from others so that you don’t get them infected, and wash your hands often and well."

Like fat, the insoluble fiber is a gastrointestinal stimulant. Insoluble fiber in fruits, veggies and grains can’t be easily broken down during digestion.
When this happens, gas is produced along with other IBS symptoms like bloating and cramping.;
, Foods rich in lecithin are egg yolks, soybeans, cow milk butter and animal brains. You can also buy soy lecithin granules in most supermarkets or health food stores. The recommended dosage of lecithin granules is 10 gm., twice a day for a year. Lecithin helps restore the endothelium which is often damaged in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)., Fructose is a type of sugar that isn’t easily metabolized. It also ferments rapidly, causing gastrointestinal discomfort and, in some cases, intolerance.


Natural sweeteners like honey, fruit juice from apples, peaches, prunes, cherries and corn syrup all contain fructose.
Malabsorption of fructose is a complex condition. It has recently been associated with depression and bacterial overgrowth, in addition to aggravating IBS., The carbon content of sodas and soft drinks can easily soak the gastrointestinal tract. This causes gas accumulation from carbon discharge, triggering inflammation.


Meanwhile, caffeinated beverages increase the intensity of the acid production that causes IBS, while alcohol contains toxic substances that can be irritating on the bowel.

, While it is important to note which kinds of foods should be avoided, the frequency and amount of food eaten are equally important. Gastroenterologists recommend small, frequent meals for IBS patients, rather than fewer large meals.


Eating large meals may cause symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, abdominal spasm and bloating in IBS patients.

When used for mouth sores, this solution should not be swallowed.Similarly, gargling a solution made with 1/4 cup (60 ml) warm water and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) mulethi extract can help reduce or eliminate bad breath.

, Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of crushed mulethi root with 2 cups (500 ml) of water in a small saucepan. Simmer the mixture on your stove over low heat for 15-20 minutes.Filter before drinking.


Drink the tea while still warm to help treat a cold, cough, or upper respiratory infection.
Consume the tea once a day for a month to help heal acid reflux and peptic ulcers.
To maximize the benefits of mulethi tea during menstruation, take it once a day starting three days before menstruation.

, Mulethi is believed to help increase the effectiveness of many other herbs when consumed simultaneously. You can blend mulethi with certain other herbal teas, and the conditions those teas may treat can become even more beneficial.


Combine a ¼ cup of mulethi root with a 1-inch (2.5-cm) piece of ginger (sliced) and 2 quarts (2000 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain and drink while still warm. This particular blend can be used to treat colds, sore throat, and indigestion.Combine equal parts mulethi, chamomile, and peppermint.

Licorice both numbs the throat and acts as a demulcent, coating your throat in a thin layer of mucus that soothes it.Licorice contains anti-bacterial compounds that fight the bacteria that cause cavities and bad breath., While teas and rinses are preferred for sore throats, mouth ailments, and indigestion due to their soothing effects, other conditions are best addressed by taking supplements in pill or extract form. Licorice supplements have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral effects that make them effective at treating low blood pressure, Addison's disease, infertility due to polycystic ovary syndrome, ulcers, indigestion, cancer (as a supplement), and immune disorders.


Use DGL (Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice) if possible. It lacks the chemical glycyrrhizin, which can cause high blood pressure and muscle weakness.The correct dose of non-DGL licorice is 2mg per kg of weight per day.
WARNING: If your licorice is not DGL, do not take more than 100mg/day – approximately 1 ml of extract. Licorice overdose results in an excess of the hormone aldosterone, which can lead to muscle weakness, headaches, and high blood pressure.

, In the U.S., it is common to use anise oil instead of licorice in many ""licorice"" products.

Use eye drops.,
Use a warm compress.,
Use your palm as a compress.,
Use herbal tea bag compresses.,
Roll your eyes.,
Take frequent “eye breaks.” Give your eyes a break several times a day by following the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, take a break and look at something at least 20 feet away from you for at least 20 seconds.Focusing on your computer screen for long periods of time without taking breaks can cause sore eyes, headaches, and even muscle pain.,
Relax.",How to Soothe Sore Eyes1," Using eye drops or artificial tears can help moisturize dry eyes, which may relieve eye soreness. You can use plain saline (salt water that matches the salt in tears) or medicated eye drops. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.


Don’t become dependent on eye drops. If you use eye drops frequently, make sure they do not have medication or preservatives in them. Overusing medicated eye drops can actually aggravate eye problems.;
, Using a warm compress can help relax the muscles around your eye, which may relieve eye strain and that twitchy feeling tired eyes get. You can use dry or moist warmth, depending on what feels best for you. If you wear glasses or contacts, remove them before using any compress.For a dry compress, fill a clean sock with uncooked rice or beans and knot the sock to keep it closed. Microwave the sock for about 30 seconds, or until it’s warm but not too hot. Apply the compress to your eye.
For a moist compress, wet a clean washcloth or several paper towels with warm (almost, but not quite, hot) water. Lay the cloth across your eyes. You can apply gentle pressure with your palm if you want, but don’t press too hard. Leave the compress on until it cools.

, Using your palms to apply gentle pressure to your eye area can help reduce eye strain and relieve pain. If you wear them, remove your glasses or contacts before using your palms as a compress.


Cross your hands with your palms facing you.
Gently press the palms of your hands against your eyes.
Continue for 30 seconds, then relax. Repeat as often as necessary to reduce soreness.

, Some herbs, such as chamomile, goldenseal, eyebright, calendula, and Oregon grape/barberry, have anti-inflammatory properties that may help soothe your eyes.While there is no scientific evidence to suggest that a tea bag is more effective than another warm compress, you may find the herbal aroma relaxing.Place two tea bags in a mug and pour boiling water over them. Allow the tea to steep for about five minutes, or until the water is still warm but not hot.
Squeeze excess liquid from the tea bags and place one over each eye. Lean your head back and relax. Once the tea bags have cooled, remove them. You can repeat this as often as you want.
If you can’t find tea bags, you can cut the toes off a nylon knee-high stocking, pour the dried herb into the toe, tie it off, and use it as a tea bag.

, It’s every teenager’s favorite weapon, but the eye-roll can also help relieve eye strain. Close your eyes and focus on breathing deeply while you perform the following motions:


Roll your eyes clockwise. Then roll them counter-clockwise. This full movement is one complete eye-roll.
Repeat the eye-roll 20 times. Start off slowly and get a bit faster each time.
Do this 2-4 times a day to help relieve and prevent eye strain.

,


Try to stand up, move around, and shake yourself out every hour or so. This will help refresh you and keep your eyes from getting strained in the first place.

, Anxiety, stress, and muscle tension can cause eye strain and soreness. Take a few deep breaths, shake out your limbs, and roll your head around. Get up and take a quick walk. Do some stretches. You can also use progressive muscle relaxation on your eyes to help relieve soreness and strain.Find a quiet, comfortable place away from distractions, if possible. Breathe deeply and evenly.
Clench your eyelids as tightly as possible. Hold this tension for ten seconds, then relax. Open your eyes.
Raise your eyebrows as far as you can. You should feel like you’re opening your eyes as wide as they’ll go. Hold this position for ten seconds, then relax.
Repeat these two exercises throughout the day as needed.

Address your pain.,
Combat your cough and congestion.,
Consider vitamin C. Research into the cold-taming effectiveness of vitamin C is confusing and often contradictory.,
Look into zinc.,
Try other herbal or natural remedies.",How to Get Rid of a Cold in a Day2," People often reach for multi-symptom cold medications even when pain (like from a sore throat) is the primary complaint. If pain is your main symptom, then a dedicated pain reliever is probably your best option.Pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be quite effective in dealing with a sore throat and other pain associated with a cold. Always follow the recommended dosing instructions. Take special care if you are also taking a cold medication with a pain reliever, as it can be easy to exceed the recommended daily dose that way.
Aspirin may also be effective, but it can lead to bleeding problems, so talk to your doctor particularly if you are taking blood thinners or have bleeding issues. Children under age 19 should never take aspirin because of the risk of developing Reye's syndrome.

, Find an over-the-counter (OTC) cough suppressant or nasal decongestant (or combination), especially if your cough or stuffy nose is keeping you awake at night. Take it according to package directions until the symptoms go away.Some people contend that honey (by the spoonful or in tea) is just as effective a cough suppressant as any OTC variety. It can’t hurt to try it.
Don't use cough suppressants or decongestants for more than three days, or your symptoms may return in a more severe form.Children under five should not use any OTC cold remedies without a doctor’s supervision.
Remember, antibiotics treat infections, and therefore are useless against viruses like the common cold.

, Some people swear by it, while others think its use is worthless. By and large, however, taking vitamin C to combat a cold is at worst unlikely to do harm.


There is some limited evidence that vitamin C may help reduce the length of the average cold by up to one day, if it is taken regularly for a long period of time (not just when you are sick). Some claim that high doses of vitamin C can cut short an existing cold, but the evidence is lacking; however, you are very unlikely to cause any harm by taking large doses of vitamin C.Those who espouse high-dose vitamin C will tell you to choose a full fruit juice or supplement with at least 200 mg., Like vitamin C, there is a great deal of conflicting information on the benefits or using zinc supplements to fight a cold. Unlike vitamin C, however, there is a danger in taking too much zinc. When taken within recommended limits, it is generally safe and possibly effective in curtailing a cold.


Taking more than 50 mg of zinc daily for any extended period of time can be harmful to your health, and there have been reports that zinc nasal sprays can cause permanent damage to one's sense of smell.With those concerns in mind, using zinc syrup or zinc acetate lozenges every three to four hours during the first 24 hours of your cold (adding up to 50 mg per day), may possibly reduce the time you are sick by a day.Some medical experts see these claims as wildly overblown, however., The benefits of other traditional remedies, such as echinacea, ginseng, and selenium are unclear, but may be worth a try in moderation. Selenium in particular should be taken according to recommended guidelines, because it can be detrimental in high doses.Taking 300 mg of echinacea three times per day may help you to ward off colds, according to some studies; however, if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have a ragweed allergy, or have an autoimmune disease, you should consult a doctor first.Taking up to 400 mg of ginseng daily, or a daily garlic supplement, may also give you an immune system boost to help ward off colds. Both these options, however, may interfere with a wide range of prescription medications, so check with your doctor first or ask your pharmacist to run an interaction check with your current medications.
Eating probiotic foods may also improve your immune system response, although again the research is unclear.While yogurt and cheese may not the best sources while you have mucus, consider trying sauerkraut, miso soup, sourdough bread, kombucha, and tempeh. Healthy bacteria in your gut may possibly reduce the time of infection."
"
Eat a balanced diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Rest and relax.,
Be proactive with prevention.",How to Get Rid of a Cold in a Day3," While we’d all like to believe there is a “superfood” or two out there that can cure a cold, the legitimate medical evidence to back up such claims is slim at best. Eating a balanced, healthy diet can only improve your odds of having a strong immune system, which gives you the best chance of fending off a cold before it strikes.Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Try onions, blueberries, bell peppers, carrots, garlic, citrus fruits, mushrooms, fennel, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes, among others. They contain high levels of Vitamin C, Vitamin A, antioxidants, beta-carotene and B vitamins, which may improve how your immune system functions.
Eat lean proteins, such as fish, poultry, pork and eggs. Vitamin E, zinc, selenium and iron are found in these foods. They may help boost immune system response.This list of so-called cold-fighting superfoods may or may not help you curtail a cold, but it does offer a group of many healthy food options that can only benefit your immune system when eaten in proper amounts.

, Like a proper diet, regular exercise promotes a healthy body, which is more likely to have a strong immune system that can better combat the cold virus, perhaps even stopping it before it starts.If you already have a cold, one or two 30-minute walks per day may be of benefit by improving circulation and lowering stress. While the relationship is unclear, low to moderate exercise may also play an important role in the immune system response.Low to moderate exercise is recommended when you have a cold, because over-exertion can take energy away from your body while it is trying to fight off the virus.

, Too much stress and too little sleep are bad for your body whether you are fighting a cold or are otherwise feeling great. A rested and refreshed body is more likely to fight off a cold before it starts or possibly limit the amount of time you have to suffer having one.


Get eight or more hours of sleep. Your body recharges during periods of uninterrupted sleep, allowing your immune system the opportunity to strengthen. And when you have a cold, sleeping lets your body focus even more of its energy on fighting the virus.Use OTC medications or recommended home remedies to ease cold symptoms so that you can get a more restful night’s sleep.

Reduce stress levels. If work is the reason you are stressed out and have a poor immune system response, try taking the first day of the cold off to focus on treatments and getting better. You could possibly reduce the time you have the cold by one or more days., The only sure way not to suffer from a lingering cold is to avoid ever catching it in the first place. Of course, even the person with the best immune system and most immaculate hygiene will get sick from time to time, but you can improve the odds with some simple steps.


The best way to avoid the common cold is to wash your hands regularly after contact with people or dirty surfaces. Reducing your contact with people who have colds will also reduce your risk of contracting a virus.Have regular medical screenings with your doctor. This is the best way to assess your overall health and address conditions or lifestyle choices that may make you more susceptible to colds and other illnesses."

Also, look for the sun anywhere you can! Sit in front of a window or bundle up and head out onto your porch for a few minutes. If you live in a region with very little natural sunlight, consider investing in a sunlamp., Lack of sunlight can cause us to crave high-sugar foods. Give yourself a sweet sugar boost in a healthy way to help keep cabin fever away. Try dark chocolate covered cherries, dried mangoes, or carrots roasted with a little honey to satisfy your sugar cravings and boost your mood., Watching a movie or a few episodes of a TV show can be a great way to pass the time indoors. But spending the whole day (or night) binge watching, is likely to contribute to feelings of listlessness and depression, inviting cabin fever in to stay. Limit yourself to an hour or two of TV time each day, or less., When there is nothing much to do, people have a tendency to stuff themselves full of high-carb, high-calorie foods. While snacking can be fun and uplifting, overdoing it will make you feel heavy, and put you in a bad mood. Exercise some portion control when snacking. Endlessly eating in front of the TV actually encourages feelings of cabin fever., Doing anything that stimulates your cognitive capacities is wonderful for banishing cabin fever.

Introduce probiotics to your diet.,
Drink ginger root tea.,
Eat some fennel seeds.,
Use peppermint.",How to Ease Symptoms of IBS Naturally2," Probiotics have a significant positive impact on chronic gastrointestinal conditions such as IBS. Probiotics are living microorganisms which offer vast health benefits. These friendly microorganisms aid the production of organic acids and reduce the pH level of the stomach.


Probiotics alleviate intestinal symptoms which are caused by the disruption of gastrointestinal flora and poor eating habits. Also, lactobacillus (the healthy bacteria found in probiotics) aids in the breakdown of food and easy absorption of nutrients.
Some yogurt products contain probiotics and are readily available at the grocery store. Alternatively, you can take a probiotic capsule. The strength of probiotics is indicated according to the number of live organisms in a single capsule.
The recommended dose ranges from one to ten billion living organisms given in 3 to 4 divided doses.

, Fresh ginger root has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for more than two centuries. The ginger root tea treats various digestive disorders, nausea, vomiting and respiratory symptoms like colds and coughing.


The serotonin antagonist property of ginger enhances gastric mobility and also provides antispasmodic effects which relieve the intestinal muscles during an IBS attack.
Drinking a cup of fresh ginger root tea can relieve gas, bloating, diarrhea and improve overall stomach function.

, The anti-spasmodic and carminative (gas preventing) properties of fennel hinder gas accumulation in the GI tract. Likewise, they help stimulate the production of gastric juices.


Other beneficial effects of fennel include the regulation of small intestine contraction, indigestion, colic and heartburn. To make fennel tea, dd a half teaspoon of fennel seeds to a cup of boiling water.
Otherwise, you may sprinkle the seeds over salads and meals. Also, fennel seeds make a great snack when roasted.

, Peppermint contains menthol and methyl salicylate which both have anti-spasmodic properties, which helps to relax the stomach muscles and the intestinal tract.


Peppermint also has analgesic properties which help to relieve pain by activating the kappa-opiod receptors which blocks the nerve signals responsible for pain perception in the brain.
Add a heaping teaspoon of dried peppermint to a saucepan of water and bring to the boil. Strain the leaves, then enjoy a cup of peppermint tea.

Check for foreign bodies in your eye.,
Determine whether you have an eye emergency.,
Determine whether you have glaucoma symptoms.,
Determine whether you have pink eye.,
Know when to seek help.,
Talk with your doctor.",How to Soothe Sore Eyes3," If your eye is sore because you have dirt, metal, grit, or other foreign stuff in your eye, you may need to see a doctor. If you have an object embedded in your eye, see a doctor immediately. You can take the following steps to try to get rid of small particles, but if you don’t feel better immediately, get medical help.Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water.
Remove any contact lenses.
Use clean (preferably distilled) warm water or eyewash to flush your eye. You can use a special eye cup (bought at a drugstore or pharmacy) or a small drinking glass. A medicine dropper filled with clean, warm water may also help flush out small particles.
If you still have pain, redness, or irritation in your eye after you remove the foreign object, seek immediate medical attention.

, In addition to having foreign bodies lodged in your eye, there are also other symptoms that should prompt you to get immediate medical attention. These symptoms may be the signs of serious diseases or medical issues:Temporary blindness or blind spots that appear suddenly
Double vision or “halos” (bright circles that surround an object)
Blacking out
Sudden blurred vision with eye pain
Redness and swelling near the eyes

, Glaucoma is actually a group of eye diseases that can damage your optic nerves. Regular checkups with an eye doctor are the best way to prevent and detect glaucoma. However, if you have eye soreness with the following symptoms you should schedule a visit with your eye doctor as soon as possible:Trouble adjusting to changes in lighting, especially dark rooms
Trouble focusing on objects
Light sensitivity (squinting, blinking, irritation)
Red, crusty, or swollen eyes
Double, blurred, or distorted vision
Watery eyes that don't stop watering
Itchy, burning, or excessively dry eyes
Seeing “ghosts”, spots, or lines in your vision

, Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, can be highly contagious if it’s caused by a virus. While you can treat many cases of pink eye at home, if you develop certain symptoms, you should see an eye doctor or visit the emergency room immediately:Green or yellowish discharge or “crust”
High fever (over 102F), chills, shaking, pain, or loss of vision
Severe eye pain
Blurred or double vision or “halos”
If your pink eye symptoms don’t improve within two weeks, you should see a doctor even if the symptoms are mild.

, Even if you don’t have an eye emergency, you should definitely still see a doctor if your at-home eye care doesn’t relieve your pain. If your eye soreness is due to pink eye, you may need to let it run its course, but you should see a doctor if it’s not better after two weeks. If you have other symptoms and don’t feel better after a day or two of any at-home eye treatment, make an appointment with your physician or eye care specialist as soon as possible., Keep track of your symptoms, if you can, so that you can give your doctor as much information as possible. Thinking about the following questions can help your doctor give you the care you need:Have you had any problems with your vision, such as blurring, halos, blind spots, or trouble adjusting to light?
Are you experiencing pain? If so, when is it worst?
Do you get dizzy?
When did your symptoms start? Did they happen suddenly or gradually?
How often do you experience these symptoms? Is it all the time, or do they come and go?
When is the pain worse? Does anything make it better?

Determine whether you have hemorrhoids.,
Take warm baths.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Shrink the hemorrhoids with an astringent.,
Clean yourself thoroughly.,
Apply an ice pack to your hemorrhoids.An ice pack may help reduce your hemorrhoidal swelling but it should not be left on for too long; limit the ice pack use to 5-10 minutes at most each time.

,
Sit on a cushion.",How to Get Rid of Hemorrhoids Naturally1," You may actually feel an external hemorrhoid when cleaning yourself: it will be a tender swelling around the anal opening. You won’t usually feel internal hemorrhoids, but they can bulge through the anal opening.;
, If you don’t want to take a full bath, you can take a Sitz bath,where you sit in a few inches of water. Add about 1 cup of Epsom salts to a full bathtub and 2-3 tablespoons of Epsom salts for a few inches of water in the tub. Keep the water warm, but not too hot. Repeat 2-3 times a day. This may seem like a bit of a “chore”, but so are hemorrhoids!

, Get a clean, cotton wash towel and soak it in warm (not hot) water. Apply the compress directly to the hemorrhoids for about 10-15 minutes. Repeat 4-5 times a day. This should offer some soothing comfort.

, You can use a cotton pad soaked in witch hazel after a bowel movement. Witch hazel acts as an astringent and may help reduce swelling. Repeat as often as needed--at least 4-5 times a day., After having a bowel movement, be sure that you clean yourself completely to avoid irritation. You might want to use baby wipes or a pre-moistened toilet paper product rather than dry toilet paper to clean yourself.,, Find a foam cushion or a doughnut cushion to sit on--this can help relieve some of the pressure associated with hemorrhoids. While this will not aid in ""curing"" your hemorrhoids, it may help ease your discomfort and make them easier to live with.

Know when to see a doctor.,
Continue your wellness practice.",How to Heal Your Thyroid Naturally," The thyroid depends on good nutrition to get the iodine, selenium and vitamins it needs to function properly. Without the proper nutritive balance, the thyroid cannot do its job properly.


Make time for nutrition. While it is not always the simplest thing to do, you will be doing you and your family a great service by making your own food and encouraging everyone in your family to follow a healthier diet.;
, Processing in general adds sugar to foods. This can worsen any thyroid problems. It takes a bit of practice and planning, but the closer you can get to cooking from scratch, the better. Using whole foods that have not been processed keeps most of their original vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.


One general rule of thumb is that if the food is too white, such as white bread, white rice, white pasta, it has been overly processed. Eat whole grain bread, brown rice and whole grain pasta instead.

, Whenever possible, choose to eat local, seasonal, organic produce, the fresher the better. Don't worry too much about sourcing the vegetables. Any produce is better than no produce, even frozen fruits and vegetables can benefit your health.

, Try to eat less meat, particularly red meat.If you do eat meats, make sure any beef is lean (preferably grass-fed, since this has a more natural ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats), and any poultry is skinless.


All meat you consume should be raised without hormones or antibiotics. Most meat will specify on the packaging that it is hormone-free. If it doesn’t specify that it's hormone-free, it’s probably not. Check the organic section for hormone-free meat options.

, Fish is good quality protein and often has high amounts of the healthy omega-3 fats.Fish is usually lean and can be fairly easy to prepare.


Use caution when selecting fish. Fish that is high in mercury may be bad for your thyroid function., Legumes include foods like lentils and contain many of the vitamins and minerals needed by the thyroid to make thyroid hormone. They are also a good source of protein for individuals who have limited or given up meat consumption.

, To keep your sugar levels low, choose complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains. Avoid sugar and sugar substitutes. Simple sugar, either as granulated table sugar or as high fructose corn syrup, is much like an addictive drug.Try using the herb stevia as a sugar substitute if you have a hard time giving up sweets.


Diabetic patients need to have their thyroid checked. Thyroid patients need to have their blood sugar monitored because comorbidities (people who have both diabetes and thyroid problems) are very common.

, If you eat a diet that includes moderate amounts of salt and some red meat, you probably get plenty of iodine. But, if you have given up salt in order to try to control your blood pressure, make sure you have an alternate source of iodine. The thyroid needs iodine for proper function. If needed, get a high quality supplement that contains at least 50% of the iodine daily requirement. You can also supplement your diet with some of the following sources of iodine:Brownish Sea vegetables (kelp, wakame, dulse)
Seafood and fish
Yogurt
Milk
Eggs

, Speak with your healthcare provider about the advantages of supplementing with zinc and selenium, minerals necessary for proper thyroid function. Also, ask about supplementing with Vitamin D3 (2000 IU every day).Autoimmune disease is correlated with low Vitamin D levels.

, Always be sure to stay hydrated with water. It helps your body function properly and will keep you feeling healthy in general.

, Exercise for 30 minutes every day. Your exercise doesn't have to be rigorous or take place at a gym to be effective. 30 minutes of brisk walking a day can be enough to make a difference to your health. You can increase either the speed or the length of your walking if you feel that you need to intensify your exercise regimen.

, If you have trouble motivating yourself to exercise, try engaging in group fitness. There are some approaches to wellness, such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong, that are excellent choices to be active and also protect the thyroid gland.


Exercise keeps the blood flowing. This lets the thyroid hormone reach every cell., Identify areas of stress in your life and work to reduce their effect on you. You may have to make some tough choices about obligations that you’ve agreed to in the past for the sake of your health. Learn meditation techniques like breathing, visualization, or counting breaths.

, Sit quietly and visualize a blue light entering your body at the site of the thyroid. Every time you breath in, the light gets brighter and more blue. As you breath out, it dims a bit. Keep this visualization in mind for as long as you can, but try it for at least 5 minutes every day.


In the ancient chakra energy system, the thyroid gland is at the 5th chakra (Vishuddha) and is characterized by a blue color., Make sure you get enough sleep at night and enough down time during the day. The thyroid is very sensitive to stress because it is one of the glands that responds to stress. Because of this, your thyroid needs time to “re-boot.” Rest and relaxation gives the thyroid the time it needs.

, Hypothyroidism can be caused by viral infections, radiation damage, some medications, pregnancy and other rarer causes. Most often, too little iodine in the body can cause hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by symptoms and lab tests (eg High TSH). Symptoms of an under-active thyroid include:


Fatigue
Changes in the menstrual cycle
Constipation
Depression
Dry, coarse hair
Hair loss
Dry skin
Disturbed sleep cycle, usually sleeps a lot more
Intolerance to cold
Decreased heart rate
Swelling of the thyroid gland (goiter)
Unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight

, Hyperthyroidism is most commonly seen as Grave’s disease. It can also be caused by thyroid nodules, which are small growths in the thyroid. Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed by symptoms and lab tests (Eg. Low TSH). Untreated or poorly treated hyperthyroidism can lead to heart problems, bone problems and a very serious condition called a thyroid storm. Symptoms of an overactive thyroid include:


Rapid heart rate
Increased respiratory rate
Frequent and loose bowel movements
Fine hair that may be falling out
Unexplained weight loss
Nervousness, irritability, a feeling of high energy
Moodiness
Intolerance to heat
Sweatiness
Reddish skin which may be itchy

, If your thyroid symptoms seem to be worsening, or you're still having symptoms after 4 to 6 weeks of trying to heal your thyroid naturally, seek medical assistance. See your general practitioner first. Then, you may need to go to a thyroid specialist.


If you are hypothyroid, your doctor will most likely prescribe thyroid replacement hormone (levothyroxine).If you have hyperthyroidism or Grave’s Disease, there are a number of options including radiation therapy, medicines which act to inhibit the thyroid, drugs to treat any irregular heartbeats (beta-blockers) or surgery., If you need medical treatment, you should still follow the diet, exercise, and rest recommendations given here to support healthy thyroid function. Be certain to discuss these steps with your doctor.

Use a relaxation technique.,
Target the visuals you want to use.,
Choose how you want these visuals expressed.,
Talk your subject through the process.,
Use multiple sessions.",How to Play Tricks Using Hypnosis Techniques1," There are a number of ways to start off a session of analytical therapy (also known as imagination therapy), but getting the subject into a receptive state is essential.Try having them lay on a comfortable couch/sofa and close their eyes. They are not to go to sleep at any point.
Use a soft, relaxing tone at all times when speaking to the subject.
You can attempt to have them count down slowly from 100.
For more tense patients, you can have them intentionally and systematically tense, hold, and then release each of their muscles.
Controlled breathing also can work. The subject places their hands on their chest and belly--sometimes the hypnotist can do this part--while the subject breathes slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth.;
, Once your subject is in a receptive state, you need to narrow the sets of imagery you focus on.You can try some interesting experiments as long as you are careful. Select positive images like a holiday party, a graduation, a wedding, or a combination of multiple images in sequence to draw a correspondingly positive response out of the subject.
If they need to relax, you may help them ""construct"" the images out of features the subject associates with positive emotions and memories.
If you are helping a case of trauma, you may have them search for pleasant images to supplant horrific ones.

, There is a great deal of flexibility here, so this needs to be tailored to your subject's needs and perhaps discussed before the session.With so much range, you can make the mode of expression part of the experiment. Maybe having your subject drive their images around in a vehicle, or make a movie of their happiest memories would be something you can attempt. Perhaps having the subject going on an adventure within their own images could be quite an experience to try.
Find a creative way to discard negative images in a symbolic way that allows the positive images to remain in place.
Consider something literal like tossing the bad images in a trash can or projecting them on a screen so there is room in the mind for the pleasant imagery.

, Your subject is in a receptive state, but not asleep. You are guiding them.


Steer the subject's images in a positive direction, but observe their responses carefully in case they are resisting.
Maintain the calm steady tone of voice throughout the session.
Suggest imagery that mixes positively with their existing responses.
Be prepared to bring them out of the hypnotic state in the case of an adverse physical reaction.

, For experimental situations, you may take some time to find what techniques and images work best with the subject. And neither hypnotist nor subject should expect an instant cure, especially in trauma cases or when dealing with prolonged pain suffering.Establish from the outset that the hypnotic technique can take many sessions.
Schedule a regular time/interval for the sessions.
Both parties should bring up issues if they feel the sessions are not working as they expect.

Look for febrile seizures in infants.",How to Reduce a Fever Without Medication," Start off by drawing a warm bath. Have the person suffering from the fever get in and relax while the warm temperature of the water slowly drops. Because the temperature of the water drops slowly, the person cools down slowly as well.


You don't want the water too cool because you don't want to drop the body temperature too fast.;
, This method works best overnight. Take a pair of pure cotton socks long enough to cover the ankles and thoroughly wet the socks in cold running water. Wring out all excess water and put the socks on. Cover these cotton socks with pure wool socks to supply insulation. The person wearing the socks should rest in bed for the rest of the night. They should be covered with a blanket as well.


Most kids will be pretty cooperative because they should begin to feel cooler within a few minutes.
This treatment is a traditional naturopathic approach. The theory is that the cold feet stimulate an increase in circulation and an increased response from the immune system.The result is that the body expends heat and ends up drying the socks and cooling the body. This treatment can relieve chest congestion as well.

, Take one or two hand towels and fold lengthwise. Soak the towels in either very cold or ice water. Wring out the excess water and wrap the towel around the head, around the neck, around the ankles or around the wrists. Don’t use the towels over more than two areas-- that is, use the towel around the head and the ankles or around the neck and wrists. Otherwise, you may cool down TOO much.


The cool or cold towels draw heat out of the body and can lower the body temperature. Repeat when the towel is dry or not cool enough anymore to give relief. This can be repeated as often as needed.

, The old adage, ""feed a cold, starve a fever"" actually has some truth to it, according to recent scientific studies.You don’t want to waste the body’s energy for digestion when that energy should be used to control the infection that's causing the fever.

, Choose fruits such as berries, watermelon, oranges and cantaloupe. These are rich in Vitamin C, which can help fight infections and lower fever.They'll also help keep you hydrated.


Avoid heavy, fatty or oily foods like barbecued or fried foods. Avoid spicy foods like chicken wings, pepperoni, or sausages too.

, While you can have chicken broth on its own, you could also eat chicken soup with rice and some vegetables. Studies have shown that chicken soup may actually have medicinal properties.It will also help keep you hydrated.


Make sure you include a good and easily digested source of protein such as scrambled eggs or chicken (add a few pieces of meat to your chicken broth).

, Fever can lead to dehydration which can make the sufferer feel worse. Avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water or an oral rehydration solution like CeraLyte, Pedialyte. Call your physician before you do and ask your doctor's advice. Be prepared with a list of symptoms and about how much you or your child has been eating, drinking and how high the fever has been. Also keep track of how often you have to change diapers or, for an older children, how often they have to urinate.


If you are breast feeding your baby, keep that going as much as possible. You're adding food, water, and comfort.
Kids (and you) might enjoy frozen popsicles as a way to stay hydrated. Just try to avoid too much sugar. Look for all-natural fruit popsicles, frozen Italian ices, frozen yogurt, or sherbet. Just don't forget to keep drinking water too!

, You can either buy these teas or make them yourself. Simply add a teaspoon of dried herb for every cup of water. Steep the herb in boiled water for 5 minutes and flavor as desired with lemon and honey. Avoid adding milk, since dairy products tend to increase congestion. For small children, reduce the herbs to ½ a teaspoon and make sure the tea has cooled down! Don't use teas with infants, except with the advice of a physician. Try an herbal tea made from the following herbs:Holy Basil (Sweet basil will work-- just not quite so well)
White willow bark
Peppermint or spearmint
Calendula
Hyssop
Raspberry leaf
Ginger
Oregano
Thyme

, Body temperature can vary throughout the day, but a normal temperature is considered 98.6oF or 37oC. The recommendationin infants less than 4 months old is that if they have a rectal temperature of 100.4oF (38oC) or more, immediately call your physician for advice. For children of any age, if their rectal temperature is 104oF(40oC) or more, immediately call your physician for advice. Any child 6 months or older with a fever of 103oF(39.4oC) should also be seen. If your child has any fever along with any of the following symptoms, call your doctor (or emergency services) as soon as possible:


looks sick or has no appetite
fussiness
drowsiness
obvious signs of infection (pus, discharge, streaky rashes)
seizure
sore throat, a rash, a headache, a stiff neck, an earache
other rarer signs to watch and immediately seek medical attention for:

high-pitched cries or sounds like a seal barking
difficulty breathing or has a bluish tinge around the mouth, fingers or toes
swelling on the top of the baby’s head (the soft spot called the fontanelle)
Limpness or lack of movement



, Call your physician for advice even if you are just seeing the signs of mild dehydration, especially in babies. These can become serious dehydration pretty quickly. Symptoms of mild dehydration include:Dry, sticky mouth or crustiness around the lips/eyes in a baby
More sleepiness, fussiness or tiredness than usual
Thirst (Look for a “lip smacking” behavior or pursing of the lips to tell if infants are thirsty.)
Decreased urine output
Dry diapers (They should need to be changed because of wet diapers at least every three hours. If the diaper is dry after 3 hours, that may mean some dehydration. Keep pushing fluids and check after another hour. If the diaper is still dry, call your physician.)
Dark urine
Few or no tears when crying
Dry skin (Gently pinch the back of the baby’s hand, just pinching the loose skin. Well-hydrated babies have skin that bounces right back.)
Constipation
Feeling dizzy or lightheaded

, If you see any of these, call emergency services and your physician right away. Severe dehydration symptoms include:Extreme thirst, fussiness, or sleepiness in infants and children (In adults, this is seen as irritability and confusion)
Very dry mouth, skin, and mucous membranes or crustiness around the mouth and eyes
No tears when crying
Dry skin that doesn't ""bounce back"" when gently pinched into a fold
Decreased urination with darker than normal urine
Sunken eyes (This may appear as darker circles under the eyes.)
In infants, gently check for a sunken fontanel, the soft spot on the top of a baby's head.
Rapid heartbeat and/or rapid breathing
Fever

, A febrile seizure is a convulsion that can happen in babies with a fever. They are scary, but usually over very quickly and do not cause any brain damage or major harm. Febrile seizures usually happen in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. They may re-occur, but are rare after the age of 5. If your child has a febrile seizure:


Make sure there are no sharp edges, steps or anything nearby that could hurt the child.
Do not hold or try to restrain the baby.
Place the child or baby on his side or stomach.
If the seizure lasts longer than 10 minutes, call emergency services and have the child examined (especially if they have a stiff neck, are vomiting or seem listless or lethargic)."

","How to Use Hypnosis or Self Hypnosis to Make a Motion Picture, Stage, or Television Drama Come Alive"," You can either use self-hypnosis or have someone else hypnotize you. Since you want to be as responsive as possible, it may be helpful for you or your hypnotist to use a hyperempiricinduction, based on suggestions of alertness, mind expansion, and enhanced awareness and sensitivity, instead of a more traditional hypnotic induction based on expressed or implied suggestions of drowsiness, lethargy, and sleep (Gibbons, 2000, 2001, 2010).;
, These include: Beliefs, Emotions, Sensations and physical perceptions, Thoughts and images, Motives, and Expectations, which can be summed up by their initials, ""BEST ME,"" as in this illustration.


(B) The presentation you are about to see will be one of the most interesting and thrilling experiences of your life, because you are going to feel like you are part of the action instead of part of the audience. But any time you want to, you can let yourself out the experience just by touching your thumb and index finger together in a circle, to make the letter ""o,"" which will immediately return you to an everyday state of consciousness.
(E) You will be able to feel just as much of the excitement and emotion as you want to, but never more than you want to feel.
(S) The experience will be so real to you that it will involve all five of your senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.
(T) Your mind will be filled with amazement at how real everything around you seems to be.
(M) And you will want to experience more adventures like this again and again.
(E) Now, your anticipation and excitement is going to get stronger and stronger until the performance begins, and when it is over you will always remember it fondly as one of the most enjoyable experiences you have ever had.

, A person who enjoyed the motion picture, Sea Biscuit, for example, might be able to derive a considerable amount of satisfaction in hypnosis or self-hypnosis by riding the horse to victory, with considerable elaboration to capture the full detail and excitement of the race as it progresses, using suggestions such as these:



Belief systems. You are a jockey mounted astride Sea Biscuit, ready to ride him to victory in the race of his life.

Emotions. Feel the excitement in both you and Sea Biscuit rise to a fever pitch in the starting gate as the race is about to begin.

Sensations and physical perceptions. See the assembled throng cheering you on as the race begins, and hear their roars of approval mixing with the sound of hooves all around you, as you feel Sea Biscuit giving his all in just the right manner which will lead you to final victory.

Thoughts and images. You already know are headed for a certain success, which will provide memories and inspiration to last a lifetime.

Motives. As you approach the finish line, your desire for the inevitable triumph rises to an intensity stronger than anything you have ever known before.

Expectations. You cross the finish line, dismount, and walk your steed to the winner’s circle to bask in the glory of your victory. And the triumph you have just experienced will be but echoed in the satisfaction you feel in the future in the fulfillment of a job well done.

Reflect on the challenges in your life.,
Set goals.,
Learn about hypnosis.,
Pair hypnosis with psychotherapy.",How to Use Hypnosis to Overcome Challenges in Your Life1," Before you can really address any problems or challenges, you need to be able to address that they are real. Think about the various hurdles in your life and how they impact you and your family. Do you suffer from a difficult psychological issue? Do you battle with addiction or impulse control? Once you have identified your problems, you can begin working towards managing them.Talk with your friends and family about your challenges and how best to deal with them.
There are also online assessments that you can take that will help you determine if you need therapy.You may also want to consider visiting a therapist.;
, Now that you are determined to make a change, you need to set some realistic goals. Outline what you want to change and your plan for achieving that objective. Create a list and lay out your strategy. If you decide to start therapy or undergo hypnosis, you will want to have clear goals to share with your therapist.Make sure that your goal is something that you will be able to reasonably achieve. For example, you will not immediately lose your fear of public speaking or quit chewing your nails in one day.

, Research hypnosis and decide whether it is the best option for you. Although there is some scientific research supporting hypnosis as a therapeutic treatment, many health professionals are skeptical of its ability to help people.Before you make any arrangements, talk with your doctor or a mental health specialist about hypnosis and its benefits.Ask your doctor whether they think hypnosis will help you deal with your problems.
Some people are more receptive to hypnosis than others, so you may want to test how receptive you are to hypnosis. There are a few different tests that you can take to figure this out., Hypnotherapy is not a “cure-all” for dealing with psychological problems and can be damaging in certain cases. The best and safest method of utilizing hypnosis is to pair it with psychotherapy. This will ensure that you are working through your problems with a licensed professional while undergoing hypnosis.The American Psychological Association has a website to help you find psychologists in your area.Hypnosis is mostly popularly understood as a means of helping quit bad habits like smoking or impulsive eating.
It can also be used to treat mental and emotional disorders like PTSD, social anxiety and insomnia.

Avoid excessive strain during bowel movements.,
Stay hydrated.,
Consume more fiber in your diet.,
Avoid laxatives.,
Exercise regularly.,
Pay attention to nature’s call.,
Put yourself on a regular schedule.",How to Get Rid of Hemorrhoids Naturally2," Allow gravity to help, but let your bowels do most of the work. If nothing happens, put it off for an hour or so, and try again but most importantly, don’t strain and force a bowel movement that isn’t happening naturally.

, Increase your water consumption to at least 8-10 8 oz glasses each day. Stool (feces) contain significant amounts of water—and the more water a stool contains, the softer it will be, which makes it easier to pass.

, Fiber helps keep water in the stool and bulks it up so that it passes through the rectum and anus more easily--and in the case of hemorrhoids, with less pain. Good sources of fiber include:


Seeds -- One hand full of chia seeds will ensure you will get enough fiber.
Whole grains-- include brown rice, barley, corn, rye, bulgur wheat, kasha (buckwheat) and oatmeal
Fruits, especially with the rinds
Vegetables (especially leafy vegetables like Swiss chard, collard greens, spinach, lettuces, beet greens)
Beans and legumes-- be aware that for some, eating beans and legumes can increase intestinal gas

, Laxatives can be habit forming and can also weaken the bowels, potentially leading to chronic constipation. If you do feel as though you need a laxative, try an herbal laxative instead.Senna and Psyllium are herbal laxative options. Senna is a natural and gentle stool softener. You can take senna as tablets (follow manufacturer’s instructions) or as a nightly tea. You can also try psyllium fiber as found in Metamucil. Psylliumis a natural bulking agent.

, The exercise can be aerobic, endurance, cardiovascular, or even just walking. Excercise makes your heart stronger, thus increasing the efficiency of your cardiovascular system. During excercise, you will also have high circulation thus removing your hemorrhoids (as these are basically blood sacks, caused by sedentary lifestyle and weak cardiovascular system)

, Don’t wait once you feel the urge to have a bowel movement; go as soon as you can, but don’t sit and try for too long waiting—sitting is also associated with an increased risk of hemorrhoids., See if you can arrange a regular time to have a bowel movement without interruptions around the same time every day. This tends to make bowel bleeding movements easier, and it turns out that having regular bowel movements is a great predictor of overall good health."

Try baby teething gel.,
Try topical pain and itch-relieving gels or lotions.Gently clean your anal area with warm water and carefully pat dry.,
Take a pain reliever.,
Seek medical intervention for persistent hemorrhoids.",How to Get Rid of Hemorrhoids Naturally3," It may sound a bit odd, but if the hemorrhoids are very painful and uncomfortable, use a tiny bit of baby teething gel on the area. The gel contains a local antiseptic that can decrease the pain and discomfort., Then apply a small amount of aloe vera gel or an ointment such as Preparation H to help with hemorrhoidal pain and/or discomfort. Apply as often as needed.


Hemorrhoid relief ointments such as Preparation H usually contain petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrine, which acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid.
Aloe vera gel contains components that have been shown to inhibit infection and help in healing minor wounds.
Avoid steroid creams as they can damage the delicate tissue around a hemorrhoid.

, If you have persistent discomfort, you may want to consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen.These can help you feel more comfortable and may aid in swelling reduction as well. As always, check with your care provider to ensure that it is safe to take a medication that you do not normally take.

, Most hemorrhoids resolve using natural methods within 3-7 days.If they don’t improve, or if they worsen, call your physician. Occasionally for external hemorrhoids and more often for internal hemorrhoids, you may still need some medical intervention. The most common approaches if the described methods don’t help enough are:Ligation: Tying a rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow
Injection of a chemical solution designed to shrink the hemorrhoid
Cauterization-- burning the hemorrhoid
Hemorrhoid stapling-- blood flow to the hemorrhoid is stopped with a surgical staple.
Hemorrhoidectomy-- surgical removal of the hemorrhoid.

Plant a suggestion in the subject's mind.,
Speak the instruction after hypnotic induction.,
Target a particular behavior and/or sensation.,
Plan regular sessions.,
Consider other techniques.",How to Play Tricks Using Hypnosis Techniques2," This is a more direct approach than the imagery method.This can actually involve a suggestion to use your imagination, but suggestions, if successful, should seem to take less effort.
This method can result in more specific changes to behavior and/or perceptions than other techniques.
More careful instruction on the part of the hypnotist will be required.

, After the subject is in the hypnotic state, they are receptive to suggestions and the hypnotist can pass along the instruction or condition.The instruction needs to be specific, but simple.
Create a cue, such as the opening of eyes or ringing of a bell, to start and end the instruction's effect.
Do not deviate from your calm, steady voice during the conditioning.
Bring the subject out of the period of suggestion with the cue you created.

, If you are experimenting, it's best to try one suggestion at a time. If your subject choose a specific behavior they want elicited or stopped, modify your instructions accordingly.In the experimental setting, the hypnotist can try some practical suggestions as long as they are careful they will do no harm. The hypnotist can try suggesting the subject perform an action like take a drink, eat, write. The hypnotist could try having them respond to a command or stimulus such as doing one action when you play a musical note. The hypnotist can suggest something more complex--perhaps having them respond with a specific phrase when you give a command phrase.
Stopping habits like smoking, nail-biting, and the like is a common use for this technique.
This technique can also create behaviors and images like seeing lost friends, memory effects, and pain displacement.

, While this technique is not as drawn out as the imagery method, multiple sessions can still be useful for testing variations of the experimental version's effectiveness. Extended therapy sessions can also be beneficial.


Maintain communication between hypnotist and subject to determine if the therapy is improving behavior and/or lifestyle.
Make sure there isn't a more serious medical problem if prolonged sessions are not having an effect.

, If suggestion therapy isn't working, then the subject may need encouragement to pursue other methods.


Examine the other hypnotic tricks/approaches like image and cognitive therapy for their potential benefits.
Discuss with the subject if they are willing to try these other methods.
If significantly more pronounced mental illness is presenting itself, then a mental health professional should be consulted for further examination.

Prepare your subject for a deeper relaxation.,
Discuss the sessions goals thoroughly.,
Talk the subject through their memories.,
Know what to use cognitive hypnotherapy for.,
Schedule regular sessions.,
Review results of this technique.",How to Play Tricks Using Hypnosis Techniques3," Because the cognitive therapy trick is usually tasked with exploring the unconscious memory centers of the mind, and potentially removing unwanted memories/thoughts, this tends to require a deeper trance-like state.


In addition to the techniques to put the subject into the relaxed state, eliminating all potential noise pollution may be a good idea.
Take extra precautions that the session will not be disturbed externally.

, For experimental sessions, make sure your subject is okay with you probing around their subconscious. For therapeutic sessions, it is possible the subject may not know specifically what thought or memory they want or need to have removed, but clear up as much as possible.In experimental sessions, it will be up to the hypnotist if they want to go in with foreknowledge of the subject's background or enter in blind--and not risk preconceptions as this is entirely exploratory for both parties.
Whether dealing with a traumatic memory or source of pain, getting context information may help when searching for the memory during the session.
Be as reasonably accommodating as you can to make the subject comfortable in communicating these preliminary details to you.

, During the session, the hypnotist will be having a discussion with the subject's thoughts.The trance-like state bypasses the conscious mind, so the hypnotist is directly talking to the subconscious.
This allows the subject to talk about things they may not normally disclose to another person.
As a person is still aware during a hypnosis session, they will remember they are disclosing this memory to the hypnotist.
In a experimental session, the hypnotist could try a few techniques on the subject's memories. The hypnotist could start with something basic such as childhood or more recent--perhaps at a job and talk the subject through their emotional state during those experience.
During the experimental session, the hypnotist will listen to the subject's associations with these memories and can bridge from memory to memory and form a picture of sorts of how the subject's mind is working at the subconscious level.
Other experimental techniques could include having the subject revisit old memories to discover new things they had not realized themselves about the event.
In a therapeutic session--the hypnotist should lead the discussion to find the source of the unwanted memory, ask questions to drive the patient in that direction, and calmly ascertain the reason the memory is causing the subject trauma and/or pain.
In the therapeutic session, when the hypnotist brings the patient out of the trance, ideally, the patient will be able to now consciously confront and/or overcome the problem memories.

, As this is a deep dive into the psyche of a subject, the benefits of this method are numerous, but should be carefully targeted as with the other techniques.In the experimental trick version of this technique, this can be a very intimate experience with accompanying risks and rewards. The subject may be exploring unknown areas of their own mind with the hypnotist as their guide. Both parties should establish that looking into the subject's unknown memories is acceptable, and in fact a desired outcome.
Among this therapy's uses are to alleviate long standing fears, anxiety, insomnia, depression, stress, grief (from personal loss), weight loss, bad habits, and even some physical ailments like skin conditions.
If you are attempting multiple experiments or addressing multiple traumatic problems, it may be advisable to just take on one or two per session.
If the subject's condition ever worsens significantly and/or becomes dangerous to the point of inflicting injury--seek emergency medical care immediately.

, As this technique can be less precise than the others, it may take several attempts to understand how to access your subject's memories for the cognitive trick and get used to the associations they typically make. For trauma situations, it can take time to first identify the problem memories in a subject and then deal with them.


For experimental situations, as this is exploratory, you and the subject should not feel required to stay on one particular theme or track of memories.
In trauma cases, if the sessions are sorting through particularly unpleasant memories/pain, consider longer intervals between sessions.
Discuss if a journal/record of some sort should be kept about what is covered in each session. This will help keep track of the various paths your experimental tricks might lead your subject. A journal, in trauma situations, will help so unrelated memories are not unnecessarily brought up again. Though keep in mind any memory may associate in unexpected ways.
As this technique requires a deeper trance, make sure the subject has ample time to rest before and after sessions.

, Make sure the subject is responding to this deep dive trick, or should be considering other approaches.


If the cognitive approach isn't working, the analytical or suggestion tricks may be more successful.
The subject's case, if too severe for any of these methods, may need referral to a more specialized psychiatrist or doctor."

Contact local licensing board about your providers.,
Prepare yourself physically.,
Tell the hypnotherapist your goals.,
Enter a relaxed state.,
Focus on the hypnotherapists suggestions.,
Become aware and repeat steps.",How to Use Hypnosis to Overcome Challenges in Your Life2," When you begin looking for a hypnotherapist, you will want to find someone with accreditation from a reputable hypnosis program. A good place to begin looking is with your local licensing board. This will help you find licensed therapists, who also happen to practice hypnosis.


A mental health specialists with accreditation through the American Society of Clinical Hypnotists is a good first choice. The ASCH offers accreditation courses to health care professionals with at least a master’s degree.Ask them things like “are there any licensed professionals in my area” and “how can I contact a hypnotherapist?”

, Before you begin a hypnosis session, be sure that you are as comfortable as possible. Wear loose-fitting clothing and take out your contact lenses. This way your clothes will not distract you from concentrating and your eyes will not get too dry. You should also avoid eating a large meal and be sure to get enough sleep before your session. You will want to avoid being drowsy, which might make your fall asleep instead of entering hypnosis.Consider wearing your glasses to your hypnosis session.
If you are feeling drowsy, drink something with caffeine in it, like pop or coffee. This will give you a little energy and help you concentrate. However, try not to ingest too much caffeine, because then you will be too energized and unable to concentrate.

, Once you have selected a hypnotherapist, meet with them to discuss your goals.Tell them your problems and what you hope to achieve by undergoing hypnosis. The mental health professional will then work with you to develop a hypnosis plan that will treat your problems.If you want to get over your smoking habit, say something like “I want to stop smoking.”
If you suffer from anxiety, say something like “I want to get over my fear other people.”

, When you begin hypnosis therapy, the mental health specialist will have you recline in a comfortable chair. You will then focus on a spot on the ceiling or on a tool in therapist’s hands, such as a swinging watch or pendulum. Take deep breathes and focus on your breathing.


A common myth is that people surrender control during hypnosis. This is not true. The hypnotist is only a guide and you will only do things that you want to do., As you become more relaxed, concentrate on the hypnotherapist’s suggestions. They will gradually countdown, and guide your further into relaxation. Eventually, using one of three methods, the hypnotherapist will work with you to overcome your problems.First, they may use mental imagery or your imagination to bring about change. For example, if you want to overcome a fear of flying, a hypnotherapist may have you imagine yourself in a plane in an effort to confront your fear.
Second, the hypnotherapist may “implant” ideas or suggestions that are compatible with your goals. For example, if you are trying to overcome a fear of public speaking, the therapist may try to associate the act of speaking to large crowds with a fond memory in order to alleviate your fear. Third, hypnosis can be used as a means of unconscious exploration, or a way to examine past events or underlying assumptions that may be causing psychological or physical problems. For example, if you are suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a hypnotherapist may have you imagine yourself in a theater watching a replaying of the event that resulted in your trauma., Once your hypnotherapist has completed their procedure, they will guide you back to full awareness. It may take multiple attempts to achieve the results you are looking for. However, you may also be someone who is incapable of being hypnotized and should continue with psychotherapy.Talk with your mental health professional about the benefits of hypnosis and continuing sessions.
Ask your hypnotherapist how many sessions you will need.

Find a quiet and comfortable place.,
Sit in a comfortable chair.,
Focus on a point on the ceiling.,
Take deep breathes in and out.,
Relax your body.,
State your goals.,
Become aware of your surroundings.,
Repeat the process.",How to Use Hypnosis to Overcome Challenges in Your Life3," If you cannot afford a hypnotherapist or one is not available in your area, you may consider hypnotizing yourself. This can be done by you in your own home. First, find a room or space in your home that is free of other people and relatively quiet. Make sure that it is a comfortable temperature and will not distract you.If you are close to a busy street, try using a fan or a white noise machine to create some ambient sound. This will help you concentrate.

, Find a chair that will allow you to recline comfortably, but not so comfortably that you fall asleep. Ideally, the chair should have some padding and recline to about 130 degrees.Avoid crossing your legs or feet. Keep them straight in front of you or touching the floor.

, Without straining your neck or tilting your head, find a point on the ceiling and concentrate on it. Try to focus your attention on that point and avoid moving your eyes.If you are having difficulties concentrating, try hanging a ball from or placing a paper circle on the ceiling.

, Inhale and exhale slowly from your diaphragm. Concentrate on each breathe. Notice the rising and falling of your chest., Slowly close your eyes and allow your body to relax. Begin counting down from five, telling yourself that you are getting more relaxed with each count. Concentrate on how relaxed you feel. Once you get to zero, stay in this state for a few minutes and continue to focus on your breathing., Once you feel fully relaxed, state your goals to yourself. In your head, say your goals positively and assertively. Imagine yourself defiantly declaring your resolve to change. Repeat your goal multiple times to yourself.Make sure that you have chosen realistic and reasonable goals. For example, hypnotic suggestion will not help you lose 30 pounds in a week or quit smoking overnight. Instead, use hypnosis to encourage yourself to exercise more or gradually cut back on smoking.
Make a positive statement that is in the present tense. For example, if you are overcoming a fear of public speaking, say “I am comfortable speaking in public” instead of “I am not afraid of speaking in public.”
There is also some evidence that self-hypnosis can also help treat physical ailments and promote pain management., Once you have finished stating your goal, tell yourself that you are becoming aware of your surroundings and that you will open your eyes at the count of five. Begin energetically counting and, on the count of five, open your eyes and stretch. Take a few deep breathes and notice how your body feels.

, Complete the process three or four more times, each time noticing how much more relaxed you get. This repetition will also help you better implant the goal that you are trying to achieve.Do not force it if you are not feeling as relaxed as you would like. Hypnotizing yourself takes time and practice.

You can easily guide yourself into a state of deep relaxation and self-hypnosis.,
Breathe in and out through the nose.,
Next step is to steadily gaze at a spot in front of you.,
When you close your eyes allow yourself to completely relax.,
Further deepen your self-hypnosis experience.,
Next.,
Imagine now a special place.,
Next, imagine standing in front of a blackboard once more.,
Now see yourself standing tall, breathing calmly.,
To re-alert: Breathe deeply... then very slowly count yourself up from one (1) to three (3), suggest to yourself that you have enjoyed a wonderful relaxation and at the count of three (3) you will return into a natural level of awareness, feeling calm, re-energised and alert, looking forward to the remainder of your day.

",How to Learn Self Hypnosis for Exam Nerves and Study," Start by finding a comfortable place where you will not be disturbed for a while. Sit in a chair or in a yoga position on the floor.;
, On the in breath count to three (3), on the out breath count to six (6). Keep breathing in this way throughout the self hypnosis relaxation.

, Breathe steadily as mentioned above. Now raise your eyes slightly upwards, without moving your head. Keep your eyes fixed on the spot. Mentally say to yourself: 'As I count from three (3) down to one (1) my eyelids will feel heavier and heavier, when I get to one (1) my eyes will close and I will completely relax.'

, Starting at the top of your head continue to relax your body all the way down to your toes. Release all stress and tension from every muscle, every nerve, as you mentally repeat to yourself: “relax”, “let go”, “deeper and deeper relaxed”.

, Imagine a blackboard in front of you, pick up a piece of chalk. Breathe in deeply and then on the out breath see yourself write number three (3) on the blackboard, erase it and then write 3 again and erase it (repeat this 3 times).

, Write number (2) on the blackboard, erase it three times and then do the same for number (1). By the time you erase number (1) off the board three times, you will find yourself more deeply relaxed and absorbed in the experience of self-hypnosis.

, A place where you feel safe, comfortable and relaxed (the beach, the rainforest or your favourite room, etc). Feel the breeze through your hear, sense the sun on your skin, smell the fresh air. Whenever you picture yourself in your special, safe place.... you will be even more relaxed and ready to experience feeling motivated, focused, happy, content, calm and in control.

, Notice the chalk and the chalk duster in front of the blackboard. Pick up the chalk, feel how light it is in your hand, even smell the chalky smell. Now draw a straight line down the middle of the board, from top to bottom. On the left hand side write down in small letters anything related to your study nerves and anxiety, procrastination, stress about exams, as well as any other fears, worries or concerns. As soon as you write them down, immediately erase them off the blackboard. Let the negative thoughts fade from your awareness.

, This time look at the right side of the blackboard. Write down in big letters all your strengths, accomplishments, future goals and positive achievements. Write down all your resources and solutions such as: you are now calmly focusing and studying; easily recalling information; sitting calmly through exams; answering all questions easily. You remain motivated to study; are clear and focused; are calm and confident. Focus on how good you feel while you spend time writing down as many confident and positive thoughts and goals as you can think of. Take time in enjoying this pleasant experience.

Create a visualization.,
Count down.",How to Perform Stage Hypnotism1," The best position is to sit or lie down comfortably. You want to initiate relaxation, and the best way to facilitate this is by having the person sit or recline. Be sure to have the participant facing you and not the audience, if there are other people watching, as you do not want her to become distracted., The first part of the Elman Induction, named after the hypnotist Dave Elman, requires the participant to fixate on an object in front of her. This is often done while the hypnotist says something soothing, such as the famous line, ""You are getting sleepy.""This forces the participant to focus her attention while also feeling relaxed, which in most people will induce a hypnotic state.Tell the participant not to blink her eyes. The participant must remain focused completely on the induction object.Have the participant looking at the fixed object face a direction that will not catch anyone else's glance. If the participant makes accidental eye contact with anyone in the audience, she may not focus intensely enough to induce a hypnotic state.Many hypnotists use a swinging pendulum to initiate the participant's eye fixation, which may explain the pop culture association of hypnotism with a swinging pocket watch. However, there are other objects used for eye fixation, including spinning disks, a ceiling light, or even a finger held upright in front of the participant., Some people breathe more rapidly than others, especially if they are nervous or excited. The goal is to get the participant to breathe in a slow, steady rhythm. Guide the participant's breath in a consistent rising and falling pattern.The steady breathing should have a calming effect on the participant, which will further help her enter a hypnotic state. Focused breathing is an important part of both stage hypnosis and therapeutic hypnosis.
You may need to guide the participant's breathing to facilitate a calming experience. Say something like, ""Breathe in slowly through the nose, and exhale slowly through the mouth, imagining that you're breathing out of a straw. Let go of all the tension in your body, and allow your mind to rest.""
Breathe with the participant in a very audible way. This may be necessary to help some participants synch up their breathing with your steady rhythm., After some regulated breathing cycles of inhalation and exhalation (some experts recommend approximately three rounds of breathing), you will ""command"" the participant to enter a hypnotic state. You do this by telling her to close her eyes. You should also suggest that her head is heavy, and instruct her to put her head down to her chest., Tell the participant to follow your verbal command, and have her rapidly blink her eyes open and closed. Every moment that the participant's eyes are open, she should be looking at the object used for eye fixation, then immediately close her eyes. This will make her even more sleepy and relaxed, which puts a person in a more impressionable state of mind.Try suggestive vocal cues while the participant is blinking. Say something like, ""Every time you blink your eyes, you will go 20 percent deeper, and become 20 percent closer to sleep.""The rate of blinking changes once a state of hypnosis has actually been induced in the participant.Blinking will become slower during the actual hypnosis, but during induction blinking rapidly simulates the body's response to sleepiness. Frequent blinking is often a physiological sign of excessive fatigue., From this point on, the participant's eyes should remain closed. To drive this point home to the participant, you can say something like, ""Unless I tell you to open them, your eyes will remain firmly shut.""This should register with the participant as a simulation of sleep, even if she does not consciously realize that this pattern mimics sleep.Say something like, ""Your eyes are so heavy and so sleepy, it's almost like your eyelids are completely attached to your cheek. It's almost like they've been glued shut, and in a few moments you will realize that you won't be able to open your eyes. The more you try, the more you will realize that you will not be able to open them."" Then say, ""Try to open your eyes, but you can't."" If it's working, the participant shouldn't be able to open her eyes. Then say, ""Now stop trying, and just relax your eyes completely, keeping them closed."", With the participant's eyes firmly shut, guide her through the process of focused relaxation. Try saying something like, ""Soon you will feel a warm sense of relaxation moving from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. It may feel like a tingling sensation moving down through your neck, your arms and fingertips, down through your abdomen, toward your toes.""The process of hypnotic induction should weigh the participant down. Tell her to feel herself sinking into her chair.At this point, the participant should have reached a cataleptic (medium) depth of hypnosis, often characterized by a side-to-side movement of the eyes.Cataleptic depths of hypnosis are typically associated with the participant's attention shifting away from typical sensory data, instead focusing completely on the hypnotist., Tell the participant that she should be ""stiff and rigid, like a piece of metal,"" or ""loose and limp, like a handful of rubber bands."" Use those exact terms (or something like them) to direct the participant, depending on which body motion you want. Some experts recommend ""loose and limp,"" as it may be easier for some people to let their bodies go limp.If you have the person go loose and limp, say something like, ""I'm going to slightly lift your arm up by the wrist. When I let go, you're going to go loose and limp."" If need be, you can coach the participant by saying, ""Go loose and let yourself relax.""If you have the person go stiff and rigid, say something like, ""On the count of three, I'm going to push down on your arm. But it's not going to move, because your arm will remain stiff and rigid., Instruct the participant to visualize herself in a warm, comfortable place. Some hypnotists may try to give specific instructions on what kind of place to imagine, but other experts warn that this could trigger unpleasant or unsafe memories for the participant. Instead, simply say to her, ""Wherever you feel the safest, warmest, and most comfortable and relaxed, imagine yourself being physically there right now.""Say something like, ""As you imagine yourself there, feel yourself washed over with warmth. You're drifting and dripping like a cloud on a warm summer day.""At this point, the person should be hypnotized.

, Tell the participant to start counting backwards from 100, and with each number, tell her that those numbers will drift away and dissolve. Alternately, you can instruct the participant to visualize that each number is a step, and with each number she counts down she will step down another step lower towards the floor."

Establish a set sleep time.",How to Make Yourself Sleep Using Hypnosis," Before you can begin to fall asleep, you need to be comfortable so your mind will not be on your immediate environment. As you get ready for bed, wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothes. Tight-fitting or constricting articles of clothing may distract you or cause discomfort. Next, find a comfortable spot. If you are not quite ready to go to bed yet, find a comfortable position such as sitting cross-legged on a couch cushion. If you are lying in bed, lie in whatever position you feel most comfortable.


You need to ensure that you find the position that feels most relaxing. It is the first step toward mind and body relaxation.;
, Your body is most prepared to sleep when it is dark. This is because the natural sleep hormone, melatonin, is produced when you are in the dark. As you are getting ready for bed, turn off any bright lights. Try to avoid distractions like TVs, handheld devices, phones, or computer screens.


This not only helps with melatonin production, it also helps relax your eyes and your brain., One of the best ways to clear your mind and get ready to sleep is by doing a relaxing activity before bed. These activities include reading, meditating, or doing word puzzles. These activities help harness your mind and relax your worries about the day. You can focus instead of the characters in your book or the answer to the next crossword clue.


Try to avoid watching too much TV before bed. It can overstimulate you and play around with your melatonin levels.Studies have shown that engaging in relaxing activities before bed, such as concentrated breathing, can help combat those anxious thoughts.

, You can help put yourself to sleep with self-hypnosis. This is a method where you focus on yourself, your breathing, and your internal thought processes in order to lull yourself to sleep. To start, you need to clear your mind. Often the things that come to mind at night seem so much bigger and more worrisome. This phase of sleep is called the thinking phase. It is the point in your sleep cycle where you focus on rehashing everything that happened to you throughout the day or spend too much time thinking about things to come.


Try to skip past this phase, instead clearing your mind of your worries and focusing on breathing and visualizing relaxing places. This can often be easier said then done. If you have a hard time pushing other thoughts out of your head, focus more on relaxing each part of your body. The relaxation will come eventually., Start with your toes, and move your way up to the top of your head. Move or flex each toe so you’re aware of the way they feel when active. Now relax your toes and release any tension you feel. Make your toes and feet go limp without any pressure or energy exerted.


Continue this routine for the rest of your body, tensing then releasing the tension in every muscle throughout your body. Move all the way up your body, focusing on the feet, ankles, lower legs, knees, upper legs, hips, back, front, shoulders, fingers, hands, lower arms, elbows, upper arms, neck, back of the head, jaw, face, mouth, eyes, and ears., Once you body is relaxed, you can start your breathing exercises. Make sure your eyes are closed. Draw in long, deep inhalations. Exhale slowly and feel the air as it leaves your lungs. Concentrate on your chest and the way the breaths feel leaving your body. Let your mind concentrate fully on your breath as the air comes slowly into and out of your body.


Open your mouth and relax your jaw muscles. Don't force your breathing. Just allow your breathing to continue easily, effortlessly, and comfortably.
Feel your body relax into the mattress as the air flows in and out with each breath. The effects of hypnosis should feel similar to deep meditation, which is a sense of removal from the physical body, a distortion of time, and an overwhelming sense of euphoria., Once you have relaxed your body and gotten your breathing under control, you need to start the fantasy phase of sleep. To do this, think about the most relaxing place or scenario you can think of. This can be a beach in the middle of summer, a golf course on a beautiful day, a cozy fire in the mountains, or a hammock on the back porch of your childhood home. Immerse yourself in your relaxing place, focusing all your attention it.


Make yourself remember what it feels, smells, or sounds like. The more elaborate your picture, the more relaxed you will become. Make up scenarios of what you are doing there, filling in other people that might be there, what food you might eat, what sounds you might hear, or any other atmospheric concern with the location.Studies have found that focusing on an image in the brain decreases beta waves and increases alpha and theta waves, resulting in feelings of relaxation and drowsiness., If you find it hard to visualize a certain place, you can instead create an inner mantra to help you fall asleep. Try soothing phrases such as restful, peaceful, sleep or beautiful, restful, deep, sleep. Say the mantra on every exhale, focusing your attention on the meaning of the words.


Relaxation and suggestion have been shown to control activity in highly localized regions of the brain, allowing you to effectively rewire your thought patterns. In this case, you reduce your stressful thoughts while you increase relaxing bedtime thoughts.The human brain is incredibly susceptible to suggestion, and repeating an affirmative phrase can have a lasting impact on your subconscious.

, If neither of these options work, try making a hypnosis tape for yourself. It can be difficult to remember all of these steps if you're just getting started, and pausing to look up what you missed could take you out of your relaxing moment. Record yourself speaking the guided meditation above. Try experimenting with different suggestions and images, making different recordings for different scenarios and mantras. Include your positive or affirmative phrases so you can hear them and remember to say them as you drift off.


Listen to your tape while you try to sleep. Research suggests that listening to a recording that urges the listener to ""sleep deeper"" may improve restfulness and deep sleep., These activities, though they sound easy, will not work overnight. The relaxation techniques can take time getting used to, so don't worry if they don't work right away. You will get better at it over time. The more you think about your relaxing place, the more realistic it will become.


After a while, you will likely find that you can fall asleep easier and sleep better every night.
You can try the same techniques if you have problems with waking up in the middle of the night. They can help you fall back asleep just as easily as they can help you fall asleep at the beginning of the night., Caffeine is a stimulant that lingers in your body long after the food or drink has been enjoyed. Avoid drinks such as coffee, soda, and caffeinated tea if it is late in the afternoon or evening. Avoid eating chocolate or anything with caffeinated ingredients as well


Keep in mind that even decaffeinated drinks can still contain a small amount of caffeine., When your evening meal is filled with heavy foods, your digestive system will be working hard to process everything. Avoid eating large, protein-heavy foods late in the day. This will cause your body to need to digest things longer, since there is so much food.


For best results, try not to eat anything within 1-2 hours of your bedtime.If you're one who frequently needs to go to the bathroom, you should also decrease the amount of liquid you drink close to your bedtime.

, Exercising before bed is generally considered harmless on the sleep cycle. However, unless you know for certain how exercise affects your ability to sleep, it’s best to perform your workouts a few hours before going to bed. Avoid running, high intensity cardio, and other major exercises in the hours leading up to your bedtime.If you plan to do evening exercises, make them more low impact, such as yoga or walking.

, Your body works on schedules and rhythms. If you find it hard to sleep at night, you should try to go to bed every night at the same or similar time. Having an established evening routine and going to bed around the same time each night can help your body and mind recognize that it’s time to get ready for sleep.


This will be even more useful if you do a similar activity, such as reading or crossword puzzle, at the same time as well. It will act as a signal that you are getting ready to sleep."

Be aware of how hypnotism works.,
Sit in a comfortable position in a quiet, dim room.,
Choose an object in the room to focus on.,
Inhale and exhale deeply.,
Store information in your memory as you go into a deeper trance.,
Count backwards from five to one to come out of the trance.",How to Improve Your Memory With Hypnosis1," Contrary to popular belief, hypnosis does not put you to sleep, render you unconscious, put you under someone’s spell, or cause you to do anything you do not want to do. In fact, hypnosis is a state of mind where you are very focused on suggestions being made to you and you are more receptive to these suggestions. In order for hypnosis to be effective, you will need to have an open and uncritical attitude towards hypnosis. Avoid being resistant to the process, as the more skeptical you are, the less effective hypnosis will be on you.To use hypnosis to improve your memory, you will need to store information in your brain and be able to retrieve it while under hypnosis. This is similar to the memory palace method, which is a type of mnemonic, a learning device that can help you recall difficult information. You can picture your memory palace when you’re in hypnosis and use it to store information you may need to retain later.;
, This will help you to relax and focus. You can also take off your shoes, put on loose clothing, and put a blanket on your legs.

, Use an object that you have a strain a bit to focus on, about five to seven feet away from you. This could be the corner of a picture frame on the wall, a smudge on the wall, a tree out the window, etc.As you look at the spot, repeat these words silently to yourself: “My eyelids are becoming heavier and heavier. My eyelids feel as if they are being pulled down by a heavy weight. Soon they will so heavy they will close.”
Repeat these words every 30 seconds and focus on your eyelids. You should feel them start to get heavy and close. Allow them to feel heavy and let the sensation of heaviness happen. Let your eyes close when they are ready to close on their own. As your eyes start to close, say: “Relax, and let go.”

, Once your eyes have closed, take a deep inhale through your nose and hold the breath for 10 seconds. Then, exhale through slightly parted lips, making an ocean like sound or a “whooshing” sound.As you inhale and exhale, let your head fall towards your chest and allow a wave of warmth and heaviness spread from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. Breathe slowly and consistently. Say the word “calm” every time you exhale.
After several breaths, say the word “deeper” as you exhale. This will allow you to go deeper into hypnosis. Imagine you are on a descending escalator that will take you into a deeper state of relaxation. Think to yourself, “I am slowly sinking into a deeper state of relaxation.”
As you descend on the escalator, count backwards from 10 to 1. Once you reach the bottom of the escalator, picture yourself stepping off the escalator and stepping onto a second descending escalator. Continue to breathe deeply in and out, counting backwards again from 10 to 1.

, As you fall into a deeper trance, you can start to store information in your memory. If you are familiar with a memory palace, you can imagine yourself going into your memory palace. You can then picture an icon or symbol that represents the subject or content you are studying or trying to remember in a main room of your memory palace. For example, if you are studying for a high school chemistry exam, you may want to picture a key chemistry equation when you are in a deep trance. If you are studying for a law exam, you may picture a legal symbol that is essential to the content you are trying to remember.Continue to picture your visual cue as you are in this trance so your brain can retain the visual cue. You can then call on this visual cue as you are studying for the exam or test to help you remember the information.
You should practice going into a trance like state before you begin studying for a test and after you have finished a study session. This will give your brain an opportunity to retain more information at the end of every study session.

, Once you feel you have reached a deep hypnotic state, you feel totally relaxed, and you have noted your visual cues, you can bring yourself out of the trance by counting backwards from five.Before you do the count, you can say to yourself, “When I get to one, my eyes will open and I will be awake.” As you do the count, your eyes should start to flutter open and then be fully open and alert once you reach one.

Find a trustworthy therapist.,
Take care of your needs and comfort.,
Avoid stimulants or other sources of discomfort.,
Find a quiet, comfortable position.,
Take deep breaths.,
Practice mindful meditation.,
Listen to the pre-talk.,
Focus on the therapist's words.",How to Prepare Yourself for Hypnosis," The therapist should be licensed in hypnotherapy, and understand why you are seeking it. If you are afraid of the hypnotist, or certain that she cannot hypnotize you, the hypnosis will likely not work. This process requires trust.


In some regions, the license may read ""neuro-linguistic programming"" rather than ""hypnosis."";
, Wear sweats or other comfortable clothes, and take off your shoes. Make sure you aren't hungry or thirsty, and use the bathroom before the hypnosis session begins. Remove all sources of distraction, including your ring tone.


If you have a bad taste in your mouth, take a mint.

, In the hours leading up to your hypnosis session, stay away from caffeinated drinks, cigarettes, and over-exciting activities. Show up to your hypnosis session sober. Some hypnotherapists ask their clients not to eat or drink an hour beforehand, or at least to avoid large meals.

, Lie down on a couch or bed. If you prefer, sit in a reclining chair, or any chair you can't fall out of. If you like, cover yourself with a light blanket for warmth and comfort. Adjust lighting to a dim, relaxing setting.

, Slow, deep, steady breaths will settle your nervous system and prepare you for deep relaxation. It may help to count as you breathe, counting to four on the inhale and six on the exhale.


Some therapists have the patient take three or four ""Buddha Breaths:"" inhale slowly, then exhale rapidly as if blowing out a candle.

, You do not need any meditation experience to undergo hypnosis, but some lessons from practicing mindfulness may help. Stay in the moment, allowing your thoughts to pass by without holding onto them. Observe your own mind without making judgments about what you're thinking. The longer you can do this, the easier you will find it to keep a calm and relaxed mind.

, The therapist should give you a ""pre-talk"" before the session begins, at least the first time you visit. The goal of the pre-talk is to reassure you, clarify any misconceptions, and put you in a relaxed frame of mind. Feel free to ask questions of the therapist or to voice your concerns.

, When the induction into hypnosis begins, focus your attention on the therapist's words as much as possible. You will have other thoughts, but keep practicing that mindfulness, allowing them to come and go without focusing on them or judging them. Between this technique and your therapist guiding you, you will soon slip into hypnosis.

Don’t confuse hypnosis with being asleep or unconscious.,
Be aware of the benefits of hypnosis.,
Keep in mind hypnosis is a trained skill like any other.",How to Hypnotize Someone with Your Eyes," Look at yourself in a mirror and time how long you can maintain eye contact without blinking.


You can also have a staring contest with someone else to test your ability.
Having full command over your eye movements will help you maintain steady eye contact with the other person during the hypnosis.;
, Do this by looking at a close object, like a pen or pencil and then a distant object in the room.


Hold the pencil close to your face. Focus on the pencil.
Move from focusing on the pencil to an object that is further away, like a picture on the wall or a doorknob.
Return to focusing on the pencil. Then focus on the distant object. Continue practicing this to improve your focus flexibility.

, This is your ability to see objects and movements on either side of you without having to turn your head. To improve this ability:Sit in a busy scene outside on a sidewalk. Or sit in front of a TV or computer screen that is playing a busy scene.
Try to look at the busy scene with your head turned to one side. Then, look at the scene with your head turned to other other side. Try to see as much of the scene as possible on either side.
Make sure you practice from the left and from the right.

, Do this by asking them: “Can I hypnotize you?” Make sure they say “yes”.


It’s best to practice hypnotizing with your eyes on a friend or loved one who trusts you, as they will be more willing to be hypnotized.It’s essential that the person be a willing participant. If they resist or don’t want to be hypnotized, the hypnosis likely will not work.

, Don’t have them stand, as they will likely become so relaxed during the hypnosis they will fall over if they are standing.

, Instruct them not to look away as you speak to them.

, Start counting from five to one in a soothing, low voice. As you count, tell them:“Your eyelids are becoming heavier and heavier.”
“Your eyelids are growing heavy, as if heavy weights are pulling them down.”
“Soon, your eyelids will be so heavy they will close.”
“The more you try to open your eyes, the more heavy, loose, limp they become and the more stuck shut they will be.”
Repeat these phrases several times as you count from five to one.

, It’s important to tell the person what is going to happen before you touch them. This will set their mind up to understand you are going to give them a command and they are going to respond by doing what you tell them to do.Tell the person: “When I touch your shoulder, you are going to become loose, limp, and heavy. Ready?”

, Don’t be alarmed if the person slumps over or leans back in the chair. This is a sign they are completely relaxed and they are now under hypnosis.

, It’s important that the person realizes the relaxing state they are experiencing is due to hypnosis or being in a hypnotic state.


Its also important to assure the person they are safe and they are in good hands. Reassure them so they continue to trust you and to listen to your commands.

, Inform them it should feel limp and relaxed. Then, touch their arm to trigger a response from them.Lift up their arm to confirm it is now limp and relaxed. Place their arm back down.
This confirms the person is now in a trance like state. It also shows they are willing to listen to your voice and your commands.

, Count down from five to one. Tell them that when you reach “one”, they will only listen to the sound of your voice.Snap your fingers at “one” to focus them on your voice. Tell them to let your voice relax them even deeper. Then, instruct them to hear every word you say and only hear every word you say.
Instruct them to follow only your words exactly, and no other sounds around them.

, Now that you have hypnotic control over the person, you can test out your ability by having the person touch their nose or their ear. You can also tell them to move their arms or legs on command.


Keep in mind hypnotic control must be used responsibly and carefully. The person has put their trust in you, so do not abuse it by embarrassing them or hurting them while they are under hypnosis.

, Hypnosis is actually a deeply focused state of mind that makes you more aware of suggestion and more receptive to those suggestions.It’s important to remember a person under hypnosis will not lose control or be under the hypnotist's spell. Instead, the person will be more open to suggestion and guidance.
Often, we are under some form of hypnosis or trance. Think of when you zoned out during class, or got lost in a daydream. Or when you got so wrapped up in a movie or TV show, you lose your awareness of the people around you. These are all instances of being in a trance-like state.

, Hypnosis isn’t just a fun party trick or a way to get your best friend to do the chicken dance. In fact, hypnosis has been shown to help individuals overcome insomnia, smoking, overeating, and other disorders., There is currently no state regulation of hypnosis. But hypnotherapists can become certified in basic or advanced coursework in hypnosis and hypnotherapy. However, it is a self-regulating profession.


The certification course covers issues like professional ethics and basic hypnosis skills.

Have the participant relax.,
Give her two simultaneous tasks.,
Remove your hand suddenly.,
Deliver the command to sleep.,
Have the participant count down.",How to Perform Stage Hypnotism2," Just like in the Elman Induction method, it's best to have the participant sitting or reclining. This helps facilitate relaxation and makes it easier to perform the induction technique., The most common tasks to focus the participant's attention are closing her eyes and pushing down with her hand. Hold out your hand towards the participant while sitting next to or in front of her. Tell her to push down on your hand while simultaneously closing her eyes., While the participant is pushing down on your hand with her eyes closed, you will need to abruptly pull your hand away. Her hand should keep pushing down for an instant, which creates what is called a ""startle response."" In that instant, the participant should become highly susceptible to suggestion.Because this technique involves a physical action which can startle the participant, you should not use the Hand Drop Induction method on anyone with shoulder, neck, or back problems, or any kind of heart problems., In that brief moment of being open to suggestion, you should say the word ""Sleep"" in a firm and authoritative tone to your participant. This should be followed by immediate suggestions for deepening her state of sleep and relaxation.Suggestions for deeper sleep should be short and easy to deliver. Try something like, ""Relax and go limp. Continue to relax deeper and deeper with each and every breath."", Much like the Elman Induction method, the Hand Drop Induction is often accompanied by a process of counting down. Tell the participant to begin counting down from 100, and that with each number she counts down, that number will dissolve and disappear.At this point the participant should be in a hypnotic state and highly open to suggestion or instruction."

Seek out a professional hypnotist that specializes in memory recall.,
Get a referral for a trained therapist who does hypnosis from your doctor.,
Watch online videos of hypnosis.",How to Improve Your Memory With Hypnosis2," Many people use professional hypnotists to help them remember important details of an event, work through a trauma, or remember where they placed important information. You can look for hypnotists who specialize in memory recall through an online search.In a typical session with a professional hypnotist, you will be put under a light trance and the hypnotist will use oral cues to guide you. You can ask the hypnotist to help you remember where you put an important document or password, or you can ask for help to better retain information and improve your memory.

, Your doctor may be able to suggest a medical professional who practices hypnosis. When hypnosis is performed by a trained therapist or a healthcare professional, hypnosis is considered a safe alternative medicine by the medical community.Keep in mind hypnosis is often used by medical professionals to help with medical conditions like controlling pain due to disease or illness, hot flashes, behavioral changes such as phobias and smoking, and fatigue or exhaustion.While there have been some studies done in the medical community on the effectiveness of hypnosis to retain information and improve memory recall, it is not considered a primary function of hypnosis as an alternative medical option.

, There are several online videos that can guide you through hypnosis specifically for memory retention and better information recall. Often, doing self-hypnosis with the aid of an audio guide from a professional hypnotist in an online video can help you to get into a trance like state and deepen your trance.

Get them into the right position.,
Do not perform hypnosis as a form of therapy unless you have specific training.,
Begin with a pep talk while directing the participant's hands.,

Instruct the participant to close his or her eyes.,
Push their palms together for the second time.,
Tell the participant to feel the power of the magnets.,
Bring the participant into a state of relaxation.,
Allow them to come out of hypnosis.",How to Hypnotize Someone With the Magnetic Hands Technique," Before you attempt the magnetic hands technique, find someone willing to work with you. Seek out a friend or family member who will allow you to practice hypnosis on them. You should always select someone you're close to initially before attempting hypnosis on strangers or acquaintances. It can take quite awhile to get the technique right.;
, Once you've found a participant, get them in the proper position. Instruct them on how to place their hands.


Have them sit upright on a chair or sofa.
Then, instruct them to hold their hands in their lap with the palms facing the ceiling.

, The magnetic hands technique should be something you engage in for lighthearted fun. Hypnotherapy to treat issues like depression and anxiety should only be administered by a licensed mental health professional with experience in hypnosis. You should never attempt to hypnotize someone as a form of therapy if you are not a trained professional with an advanced understanding of mental illness and psychiatry., You should start of by easing the participant into trusting you. Have him or her place his or her hands forward, roughly 12 inches apart, with palms facing one another. If the participant does not understand, demonstrate yourself.


Give a brief pep talk, over-viewing your hypnosis technique. Scripting here varies based on what feels comfortable for you. The essential message you're conveying is that the participant is to follow your leads as you place a powerful magnet in their hand.An example of an opening pep talk would be something like, ""I want you to clear your thoughts now and focus on me. I'm going to serve as your guide. Relying on the power of your imagination, in just a moment here I am going to place a very powerful magnet in your hand."", Once the pep talk is over, touch the palm of their left hand with your finger. Then, touch the palm of their right hand with your fingertip. As you do so say something like, ""I am placing the magnet here and here."" Then, gently push their hands together., As you push the participant's hands together, instruct him or her to close his or her eyes. Tell the participant he or she should find his or herself falling into a deep trance. This should get the participant to begin to fall into a preliminary state of hypnosis., Once the participant has closed his or her eyes, instruct him or her to once again push his or her palms together. Say something like, ""You can feel the magnets pulling our palms together."" You may have to assist but hopefully the participant should do some of the work this time., Try to lull the participant into a state of calm. Instruct him or her to feel the power of the magnets. Say something like, ""There are two powerful magnets that have guided your hands together. Feel the power of the magnets. Feel your palms pulling towards one another."", Once the participant seems entranced by your words, bring him or her into a state of relaxation. Instruct him or her to focus on his or her body, breaths, and heartbeat.


Scripting once again varies. Go with what feels right and natural to you. If you feel comfortable and in control, the participant is more likely to trust you and follow your lead.An example of good scripting would be something like, ""Ignore everything but my voice. All other noises are unnecessary distractions. Pay attention to your breathing, your body, your heartbeat. Every breath you take takes you further down into a state of calm and relaxation.""You can also try some counting. Try to count backwards from 10 and instruct the participant to pay attention to each breath his or she takes as you count., The magnetic hands technique should take about 20 minutes. Once the participant has been relaxing for this duration, instruct them to awaken from the state of hypnosis. Saying something like, ""Now, wake up and everything will have returned to normal."""

Help your subject get ready.,
Begin the induction.,
Deepen the trance.,
Provide the consensual suggestions.,
Wake your subject.",How to Perform Hypnosis," The first thing you need to do before you even begin hypnosis is to make sure your subject is relaxed and comfortable. It is also important to know what you plan to do, and to discuss with your subject what they'd like to experience. Almost anyone can be hypnotized, but it requires the right frame of mind, a willingness to try it, and the right environment.  


Have your subject lie down on a bed or couch, or sit in a comfortable chair.  Make sure, if they are sitting up, that whatever they're sitting in will be able to prevent them from falling over if they slump or lean.  For the most part, the body will keep itself upright enough to prevent falling, but it's a good precaution to take. Make sure your subject is not thirsty or hungry and does not have to go to the bathroom.  
Eliminate distracting noises; you may want to play some quiet, soothing music.  Also try to lower the chance of distractions; if there are other people around, ask them not to disturb you, and don't forget to make sure pets cannot come in the room and interrupt your session.  Finally, to help your subject relax, encourage them to begin breathing slowly and deeply.;
, Induction is a term used to describe the process of bringing someone down into a hypnotic trance. There are many types of induction, and it may take a little trial and error to figure out which one works best for you and your subject.  Each subject may have a different preferred induction or one that works better for them, so it's best to learn a few different techniques to try out. You can look up many sample hypnosis scripts online by searching for ""sample hypnosis induction scripts"".  Some classic techniques include:


Progressive relaxation. This is where you talk your subject through relaxing every part of their body, either by outright instructing them to do so with each body part, or by describing a flowing warmth creeping up or down their body, or by having them squeeze and relax each body part in turn. It is customary to start at the head or feet and move up or down the body slowly, part by part. Difficult subjects may require the body to be broken up into smaller parts such as toes, feet, heels, ankles and so on, whereas more easily relaxed subjects may be able to settle down with larger parts like feet, legs, etc. Progressive relaxation is often used as the first part of a longer induction.
Counting. The more difficult your subject, the longer you will need to count for. Slowly count up from 1, pausing between each number. You can inject calming phrases between each number such as ""1, you are becoming more relaxed.  2, you feel calmer and safer.  3, you are growing pleasantly warm."" You can also have your subject repeat each number back to you; this can be a good way to gauge how relaxed or entranced your subject is becoming as their voice grows quieter and quieter or they respond more slowly - or not at all.
Ericksonian patter. This is a technique that focuses more on a conversational tone. You discuss in a calm, smooth voice with your subject what they are going to experience, how they are feeling, what they are noticing, and so on. You can include suggestions in this, such as ""And are you noticing that your body is growing more still and beginning to feel warmer?"" Leading questions such as this can be very useful. Ericksonian hypnosis is almost a thing all its own, so if you are going to use Ericksonian techniques it is a good idea to research them first.
Soft suggestions, such as ""I see that you are becoming more relaxed"" or ""You can begin to notice that your eyes are tending to close"" can work well on difficult subjects who have a hard time relaxing on their own.
Hard suggestions, such as ""You are feeling sleepy"" or ""Your body is relaxed and your eyelids are heavy"" can work on more easily hypnotized subjects, but can also cause the mind to want to rebel and fight against the suggestions, so use them with caution.
For experienced subjects who have been entranced a few times before (or more!), you can try doing an induction by reminding them that they've done this before, and suggesting that becoming entranced is easier and easier every time they do it.  In some cases, you can basically cause your experienced subject to induct themselves, simply by guiding them to think about what being in trance feels like.
As a final note on induction, it is common to suggest or lead the subject into closing their eyes to increase the depth of the trance. It is possible to enter a deep trance with the eyes open, but most people tend towards closing their eyes as they relax anyway, so calling attention to it can help them feel that they are becoming more entranced.

, Once you have completed your induction, your subject may not yet be fully entranced, or they may only be in a light trance. Using a second induction technique to help them go deeper can be very useful. Slowing and deepening your voice can help impress upon them that things are slowing down and it is time to settle further into trance. At this point, it is best not to use any induction techniques that would require them to answer questions or give any complex responses. Some people can remain in a deep trance while still speaking normally, but many people have a harder time speaking clearly or at length when in trance, so asking them a question that requires a thoughtful or lengthy response can cause them to 'wake up' a little in order to be able to answer.  


You can try other techniques to deepen their trance, such as asking them to lift a hand or finger and calling attention to how heavy their body is and how difficult the task is (or, if they have no problem lifting it, you can call attention to how their body feels light and floaty, so it's easy for them to lift a hand or finger, and suggest that perhaps it seems to lift itself without them having to think much about it).  
You can also just keep repeating phrases such as ""the deeper you go the deeper you go"" or ""down, down, down we go"".  If you want a very, very deep trance, you can ask them to become so entranced or sleepy that they enter a place in their mind where they will not remember what you have talked about, or where they feel they are almost about to fall completely asleep. (These are only recommended for experienced subjects.)

, At this point, you are ready to begin giving suggestions and doing whatever it was you wanted to hypnotize your subject for. Please note that hypnosis is entirely a consensual act; subjects simply will not act on suggestions that they don't feel comfortable acting on. You cannot force your subject to do anything they aren't comfortable doing.  Attempting to do so may cause them to wake up abruptly, which can be upsetting. If you are unsure if your subject would be willing to respond to your ideas, try framing them as light suggestions, using phrases such as ""Would you like to...?"" or ""Do you think you could...?""  or ""If it would feel good, ....""  Some subjects respond better to firm instructions, but nearly all subjects will be able to respond at least somewhat to light suggestions. Some examples of suggestions or ideas for your subject:


Implanting post-hypnotic triggers. These can be as simple as a quick induction trigger (""Whenever I snap my fingers, if it is safe for you to do so, you will fall into a light trance."") or more complex, such as a 'happy button' (""Whenever you see a red light, you will instantly feel happy, warm and good."") or even lifestyle-altering suggestions if that is what your subject wants (""Whenever you start to smoke a cigarette, you will feel disgusted by the taste of the cigarette and immediately want to put it out."").
In-trance emotional effects. Simply telling or suggesting to your subject that they will feel happy, warm, de-stressed, amused, loved, safe, or some other positive emotion can induce that feeling in them, sometimes very strongly.  A good hypnotist never elicits negative emotions from their subject unless their subject has explicitly asked for that (and even then, only experienced hypnotists should attempt this).
Therapeutic venting. If your subject is someone who can speak normally or audibly during trance, you can encourage them to talk about how they are feeling, things they are planning or dreaming about, what's going on in their life or any other helpful topic you'd like to hear about.  Subjects who can speak in trance will often have lowered inhibitions and be willing to discuss things they would normally keep private, so make sure you respect their privacy and do not share what they have said unless they tell you - while awake and not in trance - that it is okay for you to do so. This technique can be very cathartic for your subject, but be prepared to deal with upset feelings if they talk about something that is hard for them.
Guided imagery.  A pleasant experience for a subject can include the hypnotist taking them on a fantastic, spiritual or otherwise meaningful adventure in their minds - or even just a pleasant scenario to try out.  Make up a story and describe all the senses being experienced in great detail - how things look, how they sound, what they smell like, how they feel.  You can also make room for your subject to fill in details themselves, such as by saying ""You come to a beautiful clearing, and someone or something wonderful is there to greet you.  Picture in your mind what they look like, how they sound, how they smell.  If you were to touch them, what would they feel like?  You don't need to answer me out loud unless you want to, just simply experience this meeting and allow it to happen however it wants to happen.""  Make sure you keep your imagery positive and pleasant, as your subject's mind will be much more willing to fully experience the guided journey than it would be while they were awake, and introducing frightening, sad, or upsetting ideas can be devastating for the subject's hypnotic experience, and may even cause them to suddenly awaken, which can also be harmful to their emotions and experience.

, Once you have finished with all the work you want to do while your subject is in trance, or when you notice them starting to awaken of their own accord, you can begin to help them wake up back to a normal state of awareness.  There are a multitude of methods for achieving wakefulness after the bulk of the session is done with, but the most common is the counting method.  Simply count down from 10 to 1 (or 20 to 1, or however long you think your subject will need), saying soothing, encouraging words between each number as you speak them slowly, explaining to your subject that they are becoming more and more awake and alert, that they can begin to move their body again, that they can begin to open their eyes, and so on.  


You can also use guided imagery here, such as by describing swimming up from the bottom of the ocean, with each number drawing them closer to the surface, then finally breaking through into the air and sunlight at the end of the countdown.  It can also be helpful to have your subject repeat each number back to you, as with the counting induction.  It is common to finish the counting with a 'Wake up!' spoken firmly but not aggressively, to help the subject really come up all the way.  A finger snap is sometimes also used at the same time.
Be sure to bring your subject up slowly and comfortably - it is a good idea to suggest that they will continue to feel warm, relaxed and good when they wake up, but simply more alert and aware of the world around them. You want every aspect of the experience to be pleasant for them.

The person may feel a bit 'dazed' even after hypnosis.",How to Hypnotize Someone Using The Dave Elman Technique," Hold your fingers 1 foot (0.3 m) above the person's forehead and ask them to look up, focusing on your two index fingers without moving their head upwards. This should result in their eyes having to look up. Ensure your fingers are in a position so it is possible for the person to see.;
, They should naturally breathe in as your hand moves up; and breathe out as your hand moves down. You may say ""breathe in, and out,"" during the process of moving your hands, repeating at least 5 times before moving on to step 3.

, Repeat the request, continuing step 2 for another two or three times, although ideally they should not know how many times.

, Relax every muscle around the eyes, so much, that even if they wanted to, their eyes would be so tired, they would not work. Within 30 seconds of telling them how relaxed their eyes are, ask them to try to open their eyes. They will find that they can't. After about 5 -10 seconds of trying. Tell them, ""OK, stop trying now and just keep relaxing.""

, Once their eyes are closed inform that they're going to ""send a wave of relaxation right across your body, so that it is as relaxed as your eyes already are, relaxing twice as much as you already are.""

, Say, ""one, two, three, open your eyes; and shut them."" Repeat the process three times, increasing the relaxation each time(suggest that they relax ten times as much the second time, and twenty times as much the third time).

, Say to them, ""At this point, if you have followed what I have asked you to do, it should be really limp, loosed and relaxed, like a rag,"" (or something to that effect), ""and when I drop it in your lap, you will feel a wave of relaxation throughout your body.""

,,, Encourage them to concentrate on physical relaxation. Instruct them to, at your command, start counting down from 100, following the pattern: ""100, deeper relaxed; 99, deeper relaxed; 98, deeper relaxed,"" advising that after a few numbers, they will forget what the next number is. They will find that the numbers have disappeared from their mind, because it has become so relaxed.

, As they count, suggest to them that the numbers are disappearing. Once they've stopped talking, ask them if all the numbers have gone. They may just make a little nod, that is enough.

, Let them know that just as it is possible to tense up and reach the height of tension, it is possible to relax and reach the opposite. Say to them ""it is now necessary for 'us'"" (note the 'us'; this assumes you're not making them do something)""to go to the basement of relaxation"".

, Inform them that when you click your fingers, the lift is going to start going down to floor A, and that to get there they are going to relax completely, twice as much as they are already. When you click your fingers a second time, they are going to be completely relaxed, twice as much, down to floor B; and when you click your fingers a third time, down to floor C. Tell them to let you know when they are at the basement by saying the letter.

, Wait for them to say A; repeat with B, and with C. It is worth noting that usually at floor C the letter C sometimes does not seem to come out of the mouth. If this is the case, your attempt at hypnosis is successful(this doesn't mean that if they're able to say C, your attempt is unsuccessful).

, Say to the person, ""If I click my fingers and say sleep, any time today, you will find that you'll instantly return to this lovely deep level of relaxation and concentration. In fact, for every time I click my fingers today and say sleep, you'll go deeper into hypnosis than you were the time before"".

, A good one would be asking the person to imagine they're at the top of a staircase with 100 stairs, which they can see and feel. On the side of each stair is a number. Each step they take they'll see and feel themselves relaxing twice as much. At the bottom is a large mattress, and when they get there they'll relax completely into the mattress.

, You can determine how far they are by asking them what number is on the stair.

, Keep suggesting that they're ""going deeper and nearer to the mattress; and more relaxed with each breath"" as they go down the stairs.

,, Tell them there are balloons filled with helium attached to their wrist, and that they can feel the balloons lifting their wrist into the air. You should see their hands, and arms, visibly rising into the air.

,, Count to three. Once they're awake start talking about something different for a few minutes, before asking them what they remember. Try the re-induction and if they return to hypnosis, then carry on. If they don't, unfortunately it hasn't worked.

, Suggest they're feeling hot (they could perhaps imagine they're at the beach), and now they're cold; ask them again to imagine they're watching a film, and that it's really really funny, and then scary. Now ask them to open their eyes and remain under hypnosis. You should notice they're able to walk and talk while still in hypnosis. If they wake up and open their eyes, they'll likely inform you that ""it didn't work"". Try the re-induction and suggest that they will wake up whenever you say the word. If they don't, they may appear to have a blank stare. Continue to make suggestions after suggestions without needing to put them to 'sleep' again.

, Tell them, ""on the count of three you will wake up, fully awake and alert, feeling great, and all suggestions will be removed"". You could also suggest ""you will remember everything you did"", or ""you won't remember what you did under hypnosis"". Then count to three.

, This does not mean they're still under hypnosis, however they may be slightly more suggestible for a little while.

Become a hypnotherapist.",How to Hypnotize Anyone to Do Fun Stuff With Them," Learning to hypnotize someone is a fairly simple process, but you need to make sure to do each step correctly. Your first step to success is to make sure to do your research. Although it is not technically a science, hypnosis has some very strong proponents. Look for books by professional hypnotists to help give you a greater understanding of the process.Make sure the author is reputable. Many times, people are simply trying to sell products, such as DVDs, that will teach you how to hypnotize someone. Look for an author who is approaching hypnosis from a serious, professional viewpoint. The information will likely be more reliable. In the about the author section, you should be able to tell whether the author has an M.A., a PhD, or is an M.D. These criteria indicate that if nothing else, the person is well-educated. Look for a website that offers information without asking for any form of payment--this is a good way to tell if it is credible or not.
Ask the reference librarian at your local library to help you find some good reference books on the subject. They generally have a good process for locating helpful materials.
Ask for advice. Speaking to someone knowledgeable about hypnosis is a great way to learn some tips. If you know of any entertainment-based hypnotists in your area, you should reach out to them. Simply explain that you are interested in learning more about what they do. Most people are happy to talk about their jobs!
You could also consult a mental health specialist. Many psychologists and psychiatrists use hypnotherapy in their practice. Contact one in your area and ask to set up an informational meeting. You'll likely learn a lot this way.;
, Your next step is to find someone to practice on. You'll want to try your skills out on someone, so start by asking your friends or family members if they would be willing to help you. Explain that your intent is to have fun, and that you would love to practice your new hobby with them.It's a good idea to choose someone that you know well when you are practicing hypnosis. The more comfortable you are around one another, the easier it will be for the person to relax and become susceptible to hypnosis.
Try to recruit more than one person. Some people are more open to hypnosis than others, so you'll want to try your techniques on people with different personalities. That way, you can see which methods work and which need some improvement.

, Even though this experiment should be fun, it's still a good idea to keep basic safety in mind. For example, make sure that you are practicing hypnosis in a private, safe space. Maybe your apartment would be a good choice. It's not a good idea to practice in a public place. You don't want your volunteer to accidentally wander into a busy street or into a crowd of people.


Plan ahead. Think about what activities you want the person being hypnotized to do. Make sure that everything you have planned is within the realm of their physical capability.

, Use your words carefully. Your words are one of your most powerful tools when you are practicing hypnosis. The key is to repeatedly make statements that suggest that people should feel or behave in a certain way. Eventually, he should start responding to the words you are repeating. Hypnosis is a process--you will not see instantaneous results. It may take several minutes.For example, you might try frequently mentioning, ""Wow, it is getting late."" Try variations such as, ""Aren't you getting sleepy? It is getting very late."" The key word is ""late"", and this should signal to your subject that he is getting very tired.
You could also try repeating something such as ""It is very warm in here."" Then, ""Aren't you hot in that jacket? It is warm in here."" The subject's brain will eventually tell them that they are hot, and you can suggest he take of his shoes, or go get some ice cubes.

, Along with your words, your tone of voice is a very important part of hypnosis. You want to make sure that your voice sounds confident. Volume has a lot to do with how your subject responds. Don't speak too loudly, or he might become startled. Do not speak too quietly, or you will sound unsure of yourself.


Try to sound very pleasant as you offer your ""suggestions"". As you repeat things like, ""It is getting very late"", make your tone consistent in volume and speed.
If you are concerned that your voice does not sound the way you want it to, try recording yourself. You can listen to the recording and make notes of your thoughts. For example, if you sound timid, try raising the volume a bit and act as though you know exactly what you are talking about.

, Having good eye contact is extremely important when you are attempting to hypnotize someone. This is true whether you are practicing covert or general hypnosis. Focus on one subject at a time, and make sure that you are maintaining steady, consistent eye contact.As you maintain eye contact, make sure that you are also observing your subjects facial cues. Do they look like they are responding to your cues? If not, try changing the tone of your voice, or trying a new suggestion.

, Once your subject is hypnotized, you can begin to have fun. You will be able to tell when he is easily responding to your voice, eye contact, and suggestions. There are many fun things you can do with someone who is hypnotized. Once you see that your subject is effectively under hypnosis (you can tell because they are obeying your suggestions), you can try different activities with him.

, One fun thing to try is to make your subject to some silly dance moves. Turn some music on and tell your friend to dance. Try telling him that no one is watching. Or suggest he is in a contest! Encourage him as he dances, maybe by clapping along. This is certain to be entertaining.


Try playing a current popular song that people like to dance to. Try choosing one that your friend knows. That will help his subconscious feel more comfortable.

, For example, you could convince him to behave like a cat. Your other friends will definitely laugh if your subject starts purring, meowing, and trying to groom himself.


Continue to give suggestions while your friend is hypnotized. For example, ""Oh, you're a cat. Wouldn't you like to purr?"" The power of suggestion is very important in hypnosis.

, Maybe your friend is typically shy. This will make it all the more amusing when he bursts into song. Again, use suggestion. Try saying, ""Don't you love that new song on the radio? I bet you'd sound great singing it!"" Then enjoy as your friend gives you a free concert.

, Hypnosis can be lots of fun, but it's important to remember that hypnosis can actually be used to treat people's ailments. What's even better is that you can learn to self-hypnotize. Once you have mastered the basics of hypnosis, you can try it on yourself. Of course, you won't be able to maintain eye contact, but you will be amazed at how the power of suggestion can help you make positive changes.For example, maybe you are scared of heights. You can use self-hypnosis to make yourself more confident and less fearful. Choose a mantra to repeat. The next time you need to climb a high ladder, put yourself in a relaxed state. You can hypnotize yourself into safely making the climb.

, As you learn about hypnosis, you should be aware that many people consider it a very powerful tool. It is especially useful in helping people who suffer from insomnia. Once you have mastered the basics, you can help a friend or family member who has trouble falling asleep.Try making a recording that will help someone fall asleep. Using the power of suggestion and your well-modulated tone of voice, convince your subject that they need to fall into a deep sleep.

, After you've discovered how fun hypnotizing someone can be, you will probably realize that it also has other benefits. If you find that you are really good at hypnotizing your friends, you might decide that you want to try a new career. Becoming a hypnotherapist can be a profitable and fulfilling career.Contact local hypnotherapists to ask them to tell you about their training and their particular career path.

Come back slowly.",How to Meditate on Chakras," Chakras are compared to discs that lie horizontally in your body and spin. They correspond with different glands and their hormones, so some traditions say that there are actually more than seven Chakras according to the number of glands in the human body. Each Chakra bears so many attributes that they can't be listed here, so here's just a short overview:


Crown Chakra (pituitary gland): on top of the head, purple. Consciousness, spirituality.
Third-Eye Chakra (pineal gland): forehead, indigo blue. Perception, intuition, willpower.
Throat Chakra (thyroid gland): throat, blue. Communication, inspiration.
Heart Chakra (thymus gland): heart region, green. Love, compassion, healing.
Solar plexus Chakra (Langerhans-islets, adrenal glands): navel, yellow. Personality, power, wisdom.
Sacral Chakra (ovaries, testes): genitalia, orange. Sexuality, creativity.
Root Chakra (gonads, adrenal medulla): anus, red. Survival, instinct, stability.;
, Make yourself comfy in a room or a place outside where you are alone and where it is silent (aside from natural sounds). Switch off your phone and your door bell so you won't get disturbed. Make sure your clothes aren't too tight or scratchy. Close your eyes so you can concentrate on your body.

, Some experts recommend to stand up during this meditation, but you may as well lie down on a blanket or sit on a cushion. Take deep slow breaths and relax your muscles.

, This is necessary to determine which chakra is blocked or otherwise not alright. Sometimes it's obvious beforehand, but some issues can be related to different chakras. Always start with the root chakra and end with the crown chakra as this means going from the most ""primitive"" part of the body (survival) to the highest developed one (consciousness).

, Imagine the chakra as discs or lotus flowers. Breathe in and visualize light flowing into the chakra, making it glow with energy. Breathe out and imagine all your stress flowing out of the chakra. Repeat if necessary, then move on to the next chakra.

, In the simplest terms, aligning chakras means getting them all to rotate clockwise. A chakra that stops spinning or spins the wrong way could be associated with physical ailments, or with telling lies. One way to re-align a chakra like this is to meditate and visualize it turning clockwise, correcting the flow through your body.

, After energizing the crown chakra, continue taking deep breaths. Open your eyes slowly and calmly return to your everyday life.

Warning Signals: Fatigue, disagreements with family members, disorientation due to lack of grounding.

To Strengthen the Energy of this Chakra: Visualize a molten lava flow beneath you, or the image of your feet and body growing tree roots that extend deep into the earth.

,



Warning Signals: Sexual dysfunction, hormonal imbalance, lack of creativity.

To Strengthen the Energy of this Chakra: The second chakra relates to a person’s sexuality and creativity and is connected with the womb. Any creative or sexual outlet has the potential to engage this chakra - but only if such an activity aligns with a person’s genuine self.

,

Improve your physical health.",How to Open Your Third Eye," Chakras are the energy centers in your body. Essentially, that are wheels of energy that align along your spine. There are seven chakras, and each corresponds to a different part of your physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Your third eye chakra is the sixth chakra.The third eye chakra is located at the forefront of your brain, between your two eyes. It is right above the bridge of your nose.
When you meditate, try to focus your mind on this chakra. It is responsible for helping you to see the world more clearly.;
, Meditation is one of the most effective tools for helping you to open your third eye. By bringing more awareness to your thoughts, you will be able to better access the mental clarity that is associated with the third eye. The core goal of meditation is to bring the mind to rest on one thought or object. It is important to choose surroundings where you feel comfortable when you are beginning to meditate.Some people feel more peaceful and open-minded when they are out in nature. If this sounds like you, you might consider meditating outdoors. Find a space that is the right temperature and where you can sit without being disturbed by others.
Indoor meditation is also perfectly fine. Many people have a designated meditation space in their home. This generally includes a cushion that makes it more comfortable to sit on the floor, and perhaps some candles and soothing music.
Remember that meditation is a very personal process. You should choose the surroundings that are right for you.

, The mind-body connection is very important in meditation. The more comfortable you are physically, the easier it will be to focus on you meditation object or thought. The most effective meditation posture is generally thought to be some variation of sitting cross-legged on the ground.If you are used to sitting in a chair, take some time each day to get used to sitting on the floor. In time, it will feel more natural it will be easier to focus on your meditation.
Most people choose to use at least one cushion to make sitting on the ground more comfortable. Feel free to use two or three sturdy cushions if you find this works better for you.
If you simply cannot be comfortable sitting, don't worry. You can try what is known as walking meditation. For some people, the rhythmic sounds of their footfalls can be very soothing. Walk slowly, and have a clear path so that you don't have to think too much about where you are going.

, A meditation object can be a thought or a physical object. The point of choosing one is to make it easier for your brain to focus. This will keep your thoughts from wandering and will make your meditation more effective.Candles are a popular meditation object. The flickering flame is easy to look at and are comforting to many people.
Your meditation object does not have to be nearby physically. Feel free to picture the ocean or a beautiful tree that you once saw. Just make sure you can clearly see the object in your mind's eye.

, A mantra is a word or phrase that you will repeat during your meditation practice. You might say the mantra internally or out loud--that is a personal preference. Your mantra should be something that is personal and meaningful to you.Your mantra should be something that you want to integrate into your mind, or your awareness. For example, you might choose to repeat, ""I choose happiness"". This will help reinforce the idea that you are going to focus on feeling joy throughout the day.
Another mantra idea is to choose just one word. For example, you could repeat the word ""peace"".

, Meditation is a practice. That means that the first time to sit down to meditate, it might not be a big success. Your mind might wander, or you might even fall asleep. Learning to successfully meditate is a process and it takes time.Make meditation a part of your every day life. Begin with very small increments, maybe five minutes or even just two. Soon you will feel more comfortable with the process and be able to devote more time to meditation each day.

, Being mindful means that you are more actively aware of what is going on around you. You are consciously paying attention to your emotions and physical sensations. Being more mindful will help you to get in tune with yourself and the world around you.As you are becoming more observant, avoid being judgemental. Just observe and acknowledge without forming an opinion about whether something is ""right"" or ""wrong"".
For example, if you are feeling stressed out, do not judge yourself for feeling that way. Simply observe and acknowledge your emotions.

, Spending some time outside can be very helpful in becoming more mindful. Being more mindful can help you to open your third eye because you will be more aware of it. Therefore, it's a good idea to try to take a short walk each day, in an effort to spend more time in nature.In today's culture, we are ""plugged in"" for much of our day. This means that we are almost always looking at some sort of electronic or communication device. Going outside reminds us to actively take a break from all of the stimuli.

, Being mindful can allow you to get more in touch with your creative side. Research suggests that mindful meditation is a great cure for writer's blocks and for blocks that artists and other creative types experience. Being more mindful can allow you to open up your creative pathways.Try experimenting with your creative side. Take up painting, sketching, or learning a new musical instrument. Letting your creativity flow will help you to feel more in-tune with yourself, and help you to open your third eye.

, Day to day life can feel very hectic and overwhelming. Being more mindful can help you to feel calmer and better able to utilize your third eye. Pay attention to each aspect of your surroundings and your routine.For example, when you are taking a shower, consciously observe the physical sensations. Take note of how the warm water feels on your shoulders. Appreciate the refreshing scent of your shampoo.

, Once you learn to open your third eye, you will be able to experience the benefits that go along with it. Many people report feeling more at peace after opening their third eye. Part of this is due to achieving a greater sense of self-compassion. Being more aware of yourself generally causes you to practice more self-kindness.Being kinder to yourself offers many benefits. You will feel more self-confident and less anxious.

, One of the reasons many people want to open their third eye is because it is thought to make you more knowledgeable. Since it increases your perception of the world around you, it makes sense that you will be able to learn more about the world around you. People who have opened their third eye report that they feel like they have more wisdom.You will also become more knowledgeable about yourself. Meditation and mindfulness are great ways to get in touch with yourself. When you better understand your emotions, you will feel more capable of dealing with them.

, Opening your third eye is very likely to reduce your stress levels. You will feel more peaceful and self-aware. There are many physical benefits from reduced levels of stress. People with less stress are less likely to have high blood pressure and symptoms of depression.Experiencing less stress can also mean a reduction in things such as headaches and upset stomachs. It can even help you have younger looking skin.

Experience a blocked second chakra in daily life.",How to Balance a Deficient Second Chakra1," Your second chakra, when balanced, will allow your emotional energy to flow through your body and help you feel deep personal, creative, and sexual pleasure.Like the other six chakras, a deficient sacral chakra can be either excessive (overly expressed) or blocked (inadequately expressed). An unhealthy or deficient second chakra can have the following effects on an individual:


Inflexible in mind and body
Strong feelings of guilt, shame, or fear
Overwhelmed by anxiety and worry;

Lack of emotional pleasure; emotional rigidity
Lack of sexual desire or sexual frigidity
Pessimism, depression, and a lack of creativity

, The consequences of your deficient chakra will show up in day-to-day life. If you know what you’re looking for, chakra-related deficiencies are easy to notice.Look for daily symptoms like:


Inhibited sexuality. A deficient sacral chakra is likely to blame if you are less sexually active than normal, are receiving less enjoyment from sexual acts than you normally would, or are experiencing guilt or shame related to your sexuality,.
Chronic dissatisfaction. Your sacral chakra is tied to pleasure and enjoyment; if the chakra is blocked, you will find yourself dissatisfied, frustrated, or fed up with people and activities that usually bring you pleasure. This dissatisfaction can diminish your participation in activities with friends and family, and reduce your satisfaction when performing work, recreational activities, or exercising.
Lack of energy and ambition. A functioning sacral chakra will fuel you with energy and help you stay focused on personal ambitions. If your chakra is blocked, you may feel listless, uninspired, or unmotivated to pursue things that are important to you.

Rinse your crystals.,
Relax and prepare to balance your chakras.,
Place the crystal on your chakra.,
Allow the crystals to work.,
Remove the crystals.",How to Balance Your Chakras with Crystals2," Before you begin to balance, rinse your crystals under cold running water. This removes any contaminants. You can also take notes and write down how you are feeling prior to the balancing process.


These crystals should only be used for balancing. It may help to just have a set of 7 crystals that you use to balance yourself.

, Go to a quiet place and lay on your back (or your stomach if applying crystals to your root chakra, as lying on your back can make this difficult and uncomfortable). Take a few deep breaths and exhale slowly to relax. You can also set the mood with anything else you find relaxing such as music, nature sounds, or the sound of running water.As you inhale, imagine that you are breathing in a healing white light. As you exhale, imagine that you are breathing out all of your stress and negative emotions.
Your energy is connected to your thoughts. It is important that you have positive thoughts when you are trying to balance your chakras.

, Take the crystal that corresponds to your chakra and place it on that chakra. The energy of the crystal will vibrate and restore balance. Imagine that the crystal is glowing and spreading throughout your chakra.Place quartz crystals around your colored crystal to intensify the effect. Quartz crystals activate the energy centers of your body and have the power to modify existing energy.
Your symptoms may be worse after you place the crystals on your body. This is all the bad energy working its way out and is the beginning of your healing process.You can place the crystals directly on your skin or on top of your clothes.
Start at the root and work your way up. Place the crown chakra crystal right above your head instead of directly on your head., The crystals work on their own. You do not have to do anything extra. Leave them in place between five and 10 minutes, and then evaluate how you feel. Make mental or handwritten notes about your symptoms. If you feel more balanced, remove the crystals.If you do not feel better, leave the crystals on for another five to 10 minutes.


If you have a long-term blockage (e.g. chronic pain or long-term depression), it may take more than one session to balance your chakra. Focus on making small improvements instead of achieving complete balance in one session.

, Once you are finished with your session, remove each of the crystals. Start at the crown and work your way down. You do not have to deactivate your crystals.Drink a lot of water after your session to continue the balancing process."
"
Sleep with a chakra bag.,
Carry your crystals.,
Wear crystal jewelry.",How to Balance Your Chakras with Crystals3," Clean your crystals and place them in a small bag. This bag should only be used to hold your crystals. Place the bag under your pillow when you go to sleep at night.Before you go to sleep, ask the stones to balance you as you are sleeping.

, You can carry your crystals with you as you go about your day. You can carry all seven of your crystals with you, or you can just carry a few that you would like to focus on. Place the crystals as close to your body as you can.For example, if you are having problems in a relationship, you may carry a rose quartz or green fluorite crystal around with you to balance your heart chakra.
You can carry your crystals with you all day or for a specific situation. For example, if you are dealing with anxiety about a presentation you have to do, you may keep a garnet (root chakra) and turquoise (throat chakra) crystal in your pocket during your presentation. The garnet will help you with your confidence and the turquoise can help you with your communication.

, Purchase a necklace or bracelet made from crystals that you need for balance. As you wear the crystals, the crystals will transmit the energy that you need. Again, you can wear the jewelry all day or just for a specific amount of time.


Before you wear your jewelry, place them on a bed of salt to remove any past contaminants.

Express creativity.,
Try new yoga postures.,
Treat yourself.,
Let money flow in and out of your life.",How to Balance a Deficient Second Chakra2," Your sacral chakra is the seat of creativity in your body; when properly balanced, this creativity will be a source of pleasure and expression. By getting rid of feelings of self-consciousness and developing a child-like sense of creativity and play, you can maximize the energy of your sacral chakra.Decorate your home.
Buy a new piece of clothing or change your style for a day.
Try writing a poem, a song, or a story.
Cook a new dish you’ve never had before.

, Even if you already regularly practice yoga, it will benefit your sacral chakra to focus on positions that open your hips and lower abdomen.These positions will release emotional tension in your hips.


Be sure to include poses that move your hips in a variety of directions. Don’t just do positions that stretch your hips open widely; make use of your hips’ full range of motion.

, Do something that is rewarding to you, just because it’s rewarding to you, not as a means to some other end. Focus on your emotional enjoyment of whatever task you’re performing. The pleasure and creative enjoyment that you can experience from doing something nice for yourself will engage your sacral chakra, which is a focal point of pleasure in the body. For example:


Get a massage.
Eat something delectable at a new restaurant.
Avoid thinking about work for a day, or a weekend.

, You should have an emergency fund and savings, but you shouldn’t hoard away every penny. Financial self-expression can engage and balance your second chakra through giving a sense of pleasure and self-esteem.


Use your income and financial resources to make yourself and others happy. While it is important to be financially responsible, focus on the emotional connections that can be created and fostered by financial means. For instance, treat a good friend to dinner.
Out of all the chakras, your second chakra is most closely tied to enjoyment of money and prosperity."
"
Let go of your negative emotions.,
Forge emotional connections with other creative people.,
Engage in healthy sexuality.",How to Balance a Deficient Second Chakra3," Part of balancing your sacral chakra is intentionally removing any negative emotions, thoughts, or people from your life, and removing any regrets that you’re holding on to.Holding on obsessively to negative memories and to negative people in your life will only weigh you down emotionally.Avoid this harmful baggage by practicing letting go of unhealthy emotions.

, Through a mutual respect and appreciation of creativity, you can foster deep and emotionally significant relationships in your personal life. Invest in people in your life who have healthy emotional commitments and enjoy creative expression.


Interpersonal and social connections are key to having a balanced sacral chakra.

, The sacral chakra is tied to sexuality and your sex drives, and promotes sexual expression and enjoyment. Affirm your own sexual nature and desires, and try new types of sexual activity that you (and your partner, if applicable) enjoy.When balancing your second chakra, try not to focus on having sexual encounters with a specific frequency. You can be open with yourself and embrace your sexuality even if you are temporarily (or permanently) chaste."

Meditate on the color orange.,
Use healing stones or crystals.,
Seek out water.",How to Balance a Deficient Second Chakra4," Your second chakra is tied to the color orange, and focusing your mind on the color will help balance, heal, and maintain your sacral chakra. While meditating, focus on “sending” the color orange to the area of your lower abdomen (where the second chakra is located).Wear small pieces of orange-colored gemstone jewelry. This will keep the color near your body, and help balance your chakra. Look for gems such as: citrine, fire opal, and tangerine quartz., These are powerful objects to influence and help balance your sacral chakra. It’s important to have these near you if your sacral chakra is blocked; you can also place the crystals or stones on your body.


Use orange-colored healing stones, as these will have the greatest effect on your sacral chakra. These stones include carnelian and orange calcite.Moonstone is also associated with the sacral chakra, due to its affiliation with water. Healing moonstones will help balance this chakra., The element associated with the second chakra is water, so spending time in or around water will calm and balance your sacral chakra. Water will relax you, calm your mind, and help you meditate.Visit a lake, stream, river, or even the ocean. This will be most effective if you can spend time alone, in meditation, near a body of water. If you can, dangle your feet into the water or wade out into it.
If you’re not around large bodies of water, taking a long shower or bath will have a similar effect.

"
"
Meditate.,
Use a healing stone.,
Maintain a healthy sex life.,
Eat sweet fruits.,
Engage in creative activities.",How to Clear Your Second Chakra1," Find a comfortable seat. Sit with your back straight. As you close your eyes, visualize the sacral chakra. This will appear like an orange lotus that is spinning in your pelvic area with light rippling out of it. Let the light spread throughout your body. Maintain this visualization for twenty to thirty minutes.As you meditate, you can use the mantra “ohm” to help you focus and clear your chakra.Make sure to breathe deeply during your meditation.;
, The healing stones for your second chakra include orange stones such as citrine, carnelian, and orange calcite. Lay down. Place the healing stone on top of your sacral chakra just below your navel.You may want to clear all of your chakras at once, starting with your crown chakra and moving down through your body. Leave the stones on your body until you feel your chakras clearing.
You can also swing a pendulum made from the healing stone. Hold the pendulum about six inches away from your pelvic area, and let it spin. Once it stops spinning, you may want to wait five minutes to let your energy settle., Some believe that the sacral chakra operates your pleasure center and helps you have a healthy sex life. A healthy sex life is one in which both you and your partner are mutually receiving pleasure, affirmation, and intimacy from the encounter.Whether you are abstaining from sex or are sexually active, make sure that you are happy with your situation. If you are unhappy with your sex life, consider what you can do to change it.
Try to release any attachments, grudges, bitterness, or sadness about past relationships so that you can effectively focus on your present relationships.
Becoming comfortable with your body is important to a healthy sex life. Learn to love your body and all of its assets. Try not to hide or be ashamed of it in front of your partner.

, Sweet and juicy fruits, particularly those of an orange color, may be helpful to keep your second chakra open. Try eating fruits such as oranges, cantaloupes, or coconuts. Make sure to drink plenty of water as well during this time., The second chakra is thought to operate your creative powers. To help awaken it, try to engage in creative or artistic activities. If you feel as though you do not have any creative ability, remind yourself that skill is not important. Rather, focus on the expression of your inner being. You might try to:


Paint or draw
Write a poem
Sing a song
Play an instrument

Decide what your affirmation will be.,
Break your script into four parts.,
Create an Induction Script.,
Make a Deepening Script.,
Craft your Subject Script.,
Finish with an Awakening Script.,
Consider downloading a prepared script.,
Prepare a quiet space.,
Check all the equipment is working.,
Consider your voice and tone.,
Record your script.,
Listen through it.,
Consider adding music.,
Prepare a calm environment.,
Choose a good time of day.,
Listen to the recording.",How to Create a Self Hypnosis Recording," If you’re trying self-hypnosis, you will need to know what affirmation your hypnosis script will include. In hypnosis, affirmations are the suggestions made to you while you are under. The point of an affirmation is that you making suggestions to yourself to change certain behaviours or ways of thinking. Some examples of affirmations suitable for self-hypnosis include:


I will not overreact when I get angry or frustrated.
I will eat more healthily.
I will be kinder to people.;
, Once you have decided on the key affirmations you want to build your recording around, you need to think about the larger structure of the script. Generally, you should try to build a self-hypnosis recording around the four key sections of hypnosis. These are the Induction Script, the Deepening Script, the Subject Script, and the Awakening Script.


A complete hypnosis recording will move through these elements in the above order.
The Subject Script is the part in which you will have your affirmations., This is the part of the hypnosis which helps relax you, and prepares for the deeper parts of hypnosis that follow. This script should be quite straightforward and uncomplicated. You can start by just saying something like “slowly close your eyes, and relax your scalp muscles.”


If you start the muscle relaxation at the scalp, you can progress on to the muscles at the back of your head, and then relax the muscles in your face.
Continue to work your way right down your body, all the way to your toes.Progressively relaxing muscles and breathing deeply will help you relax your body., The next step is the part of the hypnosis that will ease you into a deeper relaxation. In this section you should concentrate on progressively relaxing over time. You can use instructions that refer to time passing, such as “as each minute passes you feel more relaxed,” or “each breath brings you into a deeper state of relaxation.” You can also use visualisations to help your relaxation deepen.


One popular visualisation used in a deepening script is walking down a staircase.
You could say “imagine you are walking downstairs, with each step you take you are more relaxed.”You can use any visualisation that works for you, such as a descending elevator.

, Now you are at the central element of your hypnosis. The Subject Script is where you will introduce the affirmations and positive suggestions aimed at helping your change your behaviour and thinking. Always try to use positive suggestions, rather than ones that prohibit you from doing something.


If, for example, you wanted to cut down on your alcohol consumption, you could create a positive picture of yourself drinking less.
You might say something like “drinking makes you ill,” and then progress to something like “you are healthy and happy when you are sober.”, The next part of the script is designed to bring you back to full awareness. This normally includes a numerical count from one to five. The idea is that you progressively increase the energy in your body as you got through the count. To help achieve this, you can increase the energy in your voice as you say the numbers one, two, three, four and five.


If you are using hypnosis to help you go to sleep you will want to replace the awakening script with one that helps you go to sleep., These are the basic building-blocks for a self-hypnosis recording, which you can experiment with and customise to find what works best for you. If you are uncertain about how to start writing your own script, there are many examples that you can download online and use yourself.You can use these examples for inspiration, or you can record them word-for-word.
If you do use an example from the internet, be sure it comes from a reputable source and read through it carefully before you record it.

, You need to find a nice quiet and calm place to make your recording. If you are recording it on your computer, your bedroom could be ideal. Make sure you do it at a time of day when you will not be distracted and there is not noise coming from outside your room. To make a good recording you will need to be relaxed and in the right frame of mind.


Put aside plenty of time so you can relax before you turn the recording device on.
You have to be relaxed when you make the recording, if you want it to be relaxing when you listen back to it., One way to guarantee you will not be relaxed when you are trying to make the recording, is having faulty or unreliable equipment. Spend some time getting to grips with whatever recording device you are using before you get started. Do some practice runs where you record yourself talking normally until you are completely confident.

, Before you begin recording, read through the script from start to finish and think about your voice and delivery. It’s not just what you say that’s important, but how you say it. You will find it hard to relax if you are listening to a voice shouting at you to do so. Equally, your voice must be engaging enough that the images you create have an impact on you, and help you visualise the scenes.


Try using different dynamics in your voice, including slow quiet parts, and faster louder parts.
Experiment and try different things. There is no single way to make a good recording, it’s all about what works for you.
Try to engage with the content of the script as you say it. If you are describing a calm sea, try to picture that in your mind as you read it., When you are fully relaxed and prepared, start your recording. Try and get all the way through in one take on your first go. Concentrate on the words and the images you are creating. Try to be in the moment and really engage with the script you have prepared. Monitor the tone and speed of your voice, but let yourself be carried on the words as much as possible.

, Once you have made a complete recording listen back through it. You might want to listen through it a couple of times before you try to use it for hypnosis. It will probably take you a few attempts to get it sounding how you like, so expect to make multiple recordings. Try to learn something from each recording you make and you will get better and better.


Pay attention to how your voice sounds, and the tempo of you delivery.
Maybe you will need to speak a bit more animatedly, or perhaps more slowly.

, Once you have got the hang of the recording you might want to try and add some extra elements to complement your words. If you have some editing software on your computer, you could add some relaxing music to go along with the text. Feel free to experiment with different ideas and keep an open mind about what might work for you., Once you have made your recording and you are happy with it, it’s time to put it into use. Before you get started, make sure you are in a calm environment where you will not be disturbed. Your bedroom will typically be the best place, but you may choose another room if it is quieter.


Make sure you switch of all electronic devices that might interrupt your hypnosis, such as your phone or tablet.
You don’t need to sit in darkness, but you may find dimmer lights will help you to relax.
If you don’t want to fall asleep while you are listening to the recording, sit in a chair or sofa, rather than your bed.

, You should consider when to listen to your recording, as well as where to listen to it. The evening is generally a good time. Lots of people like to listen to a recording shortly before going to bed. This can help you relax before going to sleep.


It is perfectly fine to listen to your recording in the morning or afternoon, but it is generally harder to find a quiet and peaceful time during the day.
Feel free to experiment and try a few different times to see what works best for you., Once you have a safe, secure and relaxing environment you can listen to the tape and practice your self-hypnosis. Get into a comfortable position, perhaps leaning backwards in a reclining chair with your head well-supported. Put on your headphones, close your eyes, and just concentrate on listening to your recording.


Don’t try to force yourself into hypnosis.
Remember, there is no right or wrong way to enter hypnosis. Just try to relax and let yourself go."

Know what you desire: It is the first thing you should be aware of.,
Have a Clarity of Vision: Write down all the things you desire.,
Read aloud everyday at least twice (When you wake up and when you retire).,
Show Gratitude.,
Take the first step.,
Anchor the things into your life.,
Getting what you want is not just about stuff, its about new behaviours, breaking old behaviours, changing your lifestyle.. You must vividly attach it to other things that make yourself want to .. not just wish too.

,
Celebrate.",How to Get Rich Using the Power of Your Mind," Listen to your desires and there must be purpose in your desire. No matter how impossible it looks at the beginning, dream big.Your feelings should be attached with whatever you desire.;
, This steps is necessary because, if you do not write things down, your mind might change on the way to achieving the results, and that is a dangerous thing. If you are confident about the clarity of your desires and think that you will not change your mind, you may skip this step.

, When you read, make sure to visualize. Create clear mental pictures of what life would be like when you have achieved the things you want. Let your mind marinate into your dreams. Feel the joy and happiness of already having the things that you desire.

, Be thankful of all the things you already have right now, and all the things that you will have once you have achieved them. This stage is the most important step of all. Once you have started feeling grateful for the things you already have, your mind will recognize the potential of those things and find a way to use them as tools to create your future. Gratitude creates the bridge between your current reality and your future reality.

, At this point, your mind will start kicking out ideas on how to get to your future desires. When that happens, act on faith. Believe in yourself. Do not hesitate. Obstacles might show up on the way, but you must believe that you have the ability to go through or around those obstacles when they show up. Do not waste your time thinking about future obstacles now. This is the stage where most people fail. They have magnificent ideas, but they fail to act on those.

, Whatever the thing is you want in your life, you will look at yourself and tie that thing to your personality, your likes . Set goals. Act on them now, not tomorrow. The stronger you associate to other positive energies in your life, the more important the new thing becomes in your life.

,, When you are acting on your desires in this way, you will be rewarded with smaller success too. Do not forget to celebrate on your smaller successes also. Reward yourself and be more grateful that you are well on the way to achieving your goals.

Not all health professionals will be aware of or supportive of hypnotherapy as an alternative treatment. However, if your doctor is interested in the clinical effects of hypnosis, they may be able to help you obtain treatment.Your doctor may be able to refer you to a reputable therapist in your area that uses hypnotherapy.
Say to your doctor, ""I read about how many medical professionals are using hypnotherapy to treat IBS. What do you think about that?"" or ""Doctors are using hypnotherapy to treat addictive disorders. I thought that might be a good fit for me. What are your thoughts?"";
, There is no regulation for hypnosis. This means that not every person who is “certified” or offers hypnosis therapy can be trusted. The best way to ensure that you are getting proper treatment from a professional is to look for a licensed psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other mental health professional who has training from reputable institution. Search for one who is interested in hypnotherapy.


Experts who use hypnotherapy may not be available in your area. You may need to search the internet or professional therapist associations to locate one near you.
Make sure the therapist has training in medicine or psychology. Ask if they are licensed in your state, and where they got their degrees, training, and licenses. Find out if they are members of professional organizations.
Discuss their experience with hypnotherapy and how long they have been performing it.Ask your doctor, hospital, or clinic for a referral to a hypnotherapist. Talk to any friends and family to see if they know about any hypnotherapists in your area. Search online to find therapists who specialize in hypnosis, and read any reviews about the therapist from others.

, If you are having trouble finding hypnotherapists in your area, you may want to contact a professional organization. There are organizations dedicated to hypnotherapy where you can find information, studies, benefits, and practicing professionals.The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis and The International Medical & Dental Hypnotherapy Association have websites where you can find information about hypnotherapy. The American Psychological Association lists addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers for various hypnosis organizations.

, Only seek hypnotherapy if you are open to the idea or believe in its effectiveness. If you think hypnosis is stupid and won’t work, you will more than likely receive no benefits from it. To get to the hypnotic state, you have to allow yourself to sink into the deep state of relaxation.Some people are more susceptible than others. Those who are the least susceptible are people who are overly skeptical or resistant.

, The therapist will start the session by helping you get to a relaxed, calm state where your mind is focused and open. They may talk to you in a calm, soothing voice as they vocally lead you to a place of relaxation. They may have you think of certain images to help promote relaxation.Part of getting into a total state of relaxation is feeling secure where you are. This is why it is very important for you to trust your therapist.
For example, your therapist may ask you to close your eyes while listening to calm music. They will count back from ten, asking you to relax your muscles more and more with each number. You will let the tension release from your body. Then, you may be asked to think of a serene lake and let your mind mirror that calm state.

, One of the keys to hypnotherapy is using imagery in your mind. During hypnosis, you may be put into a relaxed, calm state where your mind is focused. You will visualize something, often a concrete image of your condition, and then work on changing that image in your mind from something negative to something positive.For example, if you suffer from chronic pain, you may be asked to visualize your pain. You may imagine that your pain is a large throbbing red ball. In a hypnotic state, you will be asked to think about your pain as something different, such as a less imposing, threatening thing. Your mind may reimagine the pain as a small pool of water or a small blue ball rolling slowly across the floor.

, Another part of hypnosis is opening your mind in that focused, relaxed state to suggestions. These suggestions are given to you by a licensed professional. Before the hypnosis, you and your therapist will discuss your goals and what you want to be suggested while in your hypnotic state.You are always in control of what is being suggested to you. Hypnosis is not a form of mind control. This is one reason it’s important to find a hypnotherapist who is qualified and that you trust.
For example, while in a hypnotic state, your therapist may say, “You are not interested in cigarettes. You don’t want to pick up a cigarette. You do not have the urge to smoke.”

, Hypnosis may also provide the opportunity for you to figure out some of the underlying problems that may be stopping you from doing things or holding you back. In a hypnotic state, you may be able to revisit past events and experiences to understand yourself and habits better.Hypnosis can help you stop censoring yourself and instead open yourself to things you may usually ignore or push deeper into yourself.
For example, your therapist may ask you to go through your mind and find any memories that you may find uncomfortable in your normal state. You can calmly reflect on those memories and observe them in a safe way. When you get out of your hypnotic state, you and your therapist can discuss the memory and the impact it may have had on you.

Get into comfortable clothing.,
Go to a quiet room and sit in any comfortable chair, couch, or bed.,

Feel a floating sensation.,

Use it to better yourself.",How to Perform Self Hypnosis," It's pretty hard entering any kind of deep, relaxed state when all you can think about is the waistband of your jeans cutting off your circulation. So take this as an excuse to throw on some sweats. You want absolutely nothing distracting you.


Make sure the temperature is good, too. Have a blanket or a sweater ready if you run on the chilly side. Sometimes feeling warm can be very comforting, too.;
, Although some people prefer to lie down, you are more susceptible to sleep than when sitting up. Whether you sit or lie, ensure that you do not cross your legs or any part of your body. You may be in this position for a while and this could end up being uncomfortable.

, No self-hypnosis is effective if it gets interrupted by a phone call, a pet, or a kid. Turn off your phone (and the alerts), lock the door, and sequester yourself. This is you time.


The amount of time you want to dedicate to this is up to you. Most prefer to be in a trance (we try to avoid that phrase as it has certain...err...negative connotations) for about 15 or 20 minutes, but you have to a lot of time to get in and out of it, too.

, Are you doing it just to relax? For self-improvement? To train your brain? If you're doing it to achieve a greater end (weight loss, quitting smoking, etc.), prepare a list of affirmations. Self-hypnosis can be used just for relaxation, sure, but it can be for a number of life-enhancing things, too. Many use it to achieve their goals, change their thinking, or just as general positive reinforcement or motivation. Here are some examples of affirmations you could try:


If you want to quit a bad habit, something to the point is the most effective. Think along the lines of, ""I choose no longer to smoke. Cigarettes have no appeal to me.""
If you want to think more positively, aim for something like, ""I am capable of whatever I set my mind to. I am in control and I am valuable.""
If you want to reach a specific goal, like weight loss, say it in the present tense: ""I am eating healthy. I am losing my excess weight. My clothes feel better and I feel better.""

These are statements you will be reciting to yourself when you're under. Again, it's up to you, but many find them life-affirming and effective.



, When you begin, you might find it difficult not to think. You may find that thoughts keep intruding. When this happens, don't try to force the thoughts out. Observe them impartially, and then let them slip away. See How to Meditate for more help with this step.


Alternatively, some like to pick a point on the wall and focus on it. It could be the corner, it could be a smudge, it could be wherever you want it to be. Focus on the point, concentrating on your eyelids. Repeat to yourself that they're getting heavier and heavier and let them close when you cannot keep them open anymore.

, Beginning with your toes, imagine the tension slowly falling away from your body and vanishing. Imagine it freeing each body part one at a time starting with your toes and working its way up your body. Visualize each part of your body becoming lighter and lighter as the tension is removed.



Relax your toes, then your feet. Continue with your calves, thighs, hips, stomach and so on, until you've relaxed each portion, including your face and head. Using imagery techniques of something you find comforting or soothing, such as water (feel the water rushing over your feet and ankles, cleansing them of tension) can be effective as well.

, When you exhale, see the tension and negativity leaving in a dark cloud. As you inhale, see the air returning as a bright force filled with life and energy.


At this point, you can use visualization as you so choose. Think of a lemon and cut it in half in your mind. Imagine the juices oozing out and getting over your fingers. Place it in your mouth. What's your reaction? How does it feel, taste, and smell? Then, move onto more meaningful visions. Imagine your bills blowing away in the breeze. Imagine you running off those pounds. Get as detailed as possible. Always think of your five senses.

, Imagine you are at the top of a flight of 10 stairs which at the fifth step start to submerge into water. Picture every detail of this scene from the top to the bottom. Tell yourself that you are going to descend the stairs, counting each step down, starting at 10. Picture each number in your mind. Imagine that each number you count is further down and one step closer to the bottom. After each number, you will feel yourself drifting further and further into deep relaxation.


As you take each step, imagine the feel of the step under your feet. Once you are at the fifth step imagine and truly feel the refreshing coolness of the water and tell yourself that you are stepping into an oasis of purity and cleanliness. As you begin to descend the last five steps, start to feel the water getting higher and higher up your body. You should now start to feel somewhat numb and your heart will start to race a bit, but notice it and let any qualms about the situation just drift away into the water.

, At this point at the bottom of the water you shouldn't really feel anything, just the sensation of floating freely. You may even feel like you're spinning. If you do not feel as stated above, try again, slower with a will to grasp what is happening. Once you have achieved this state you should proceed to address your problems and decide upon what it is you want from where you are.


Now start to narrate what you are doing; speak in the present and future tense quietly to yourself, or as if you are reading it from a page.
Start to picture three boxes under the water that you have to swim to get to. Once you have found the boxes, open them slowly, one at a time, and narrate to yourself what is happening when you open the box. For example, ""As I open the box I feel a radiant light engulf me, I feel it becoming a part of me. This light is my new found confidence that I can never lose as it is now a part of me"" and then proceed on to the next box.
You should avoid using statements with a negative connotation, such as ""I don't want to be tired and irritable."" Instead, say, ""I am becoming calm and relaxed."" Examples of positive statements include: ""I am strong and slender,"" ""I am successful and positive,"" and, if you have pain, ""My back is beginning to feel wonderful."" (See warning on pain.)

, Feel free to wander about the water, visualizing yourself emptying boxes, finding treasure (in the form of self-confidence, money, etc.), or simply letting all your tensions disappear. Find areas where the water is cold, hot, or full of wildlife. Let your imagination go.

, With each step you take, feel the water becoming lower and lower until you have once again reached that fifth step. Once you are out of the water and are on the sixth step you may start to feel heavy or as if there is a weight on your chest. Merely wait on the step until this passes, constantly repeating your aforementioned statements.


Once it passes, continue up the stairs, visualizing each step by its number, feeling the steps underneath you. Will yourself to carry on up the stairs.

For the record, this water visualization isn't 100% hard and true. If you come up with another scenario that you prefer, use it! It's just as good, if not better, since it works for you.



, You may want to visualize yourself opening a door to the outside world. Do this slowly and imagine the light that pours in through the doorway; this should make your eyes open naturally. If you need to, count down from ten, telling yourself that once you finish, your eyes will open.


Take your time getting up. Then tell yourself, ""Wide awake, wide awake,"" or something you're used to, in order to wake up. This will put your mind back in the conscious state, bringing you back to reality.

, No self-hypnosis or mantra will manifest itself in real life if you don't actually mean it. In order for this to be effective, you have to believe in yourself and your actions. And why not? If you do mean it, it could work.


If the first time doesn't seem effective, don't write it off automatically. Some things take time to get used to and to get good at. Come back to it in a few days and revisit the experiences. You may be surprised.
Open your mind. You have to believe there is a possibility of this working in order for it to work. Any skepticism on your part will impede your progress.

, If you need proof you're in a trance, there are exercises you can do! Anything that can be seen or felt in your body can work. Try these ideas on for size:


Entwine your fingers together. Keep them together throughout your trance, telling yourself that they are stuck together -- almost as if they're covered in glue. Then, try to take them apart. If you find you can't...proof!
Think of one arm getting heavier and heavier. You don't need to consciously pick one; your brain will do this for you. Imagine a book on top of it, holding it down. Then, try to lift it up. Can you?

, Whatever it is you're working toward -- be it confidence, weight loss, positive thinking, whatever -- visualize yourself in the situation acting as you'd like to react or being as you'd like to be. If you want to be thinner, imagine yourself sliding into your skinny jeans with ease, modeling in the mirror, smiling at your beautiful body. The endorphin rush alone will be worth it!


Many use hypnosis to get over certain issues like shyness. You don't have to attack the shyness head on; something related will do. Simply imagining yourself going about the world with your head high, smiling, and making eye contact can be the first step toward a more extroverted you.

, In other words, some people like music to help them enter hypnosis. There are a bunch of hypnosis tracks available online that are just for this purpose. If a certain scene -- water, the rainforest, etc. -- would help, you have it at your fingertips!


Timers can be helpful, too. Some find that getting out of the trance is difficult and they lose track of time. If you don't want to accidentally spend hours hypnotized, you can use a timer. Just make sure it has a soothing tone to get you out of it.

, Find a goal of yours you'd like to achieve and concentrate on it during your relaxed state. Think of the person you'd like to be and be that person. Hypnosis is great for a deep, deep meditation, but it's better in that it can be used for a bigger, better purpose. Many people find that they emerge more positive and with a sense of purpose afterward. Take advantage of that possibility!


There is no wrong way to go about this. Whether it's kicking a bad habit, having focus in your work life, or just changing your thinking, hypnosis can help. Getting rid of the stressors in your life is an integral part of being the person you want to become and this will help. And the more you do it, the better and more natural it'll feel.

However, if you do have a reason, it might help you attain what you’re looking for. For example, you might want to de-stress,clear your mind, or improve your focus.


Self-hypnosis is also understood as a viable treatment for what is known as “state anxiety,” anxiety prior to tests, surgery, or other medical procedures, for example.Hypnosis can be useful if you have depression or even less severe, depression-related conditions such as insomnia and excessive rumination.;
, You might not even think of hypnosis as a physical therapy, but it is known to help with a number of ailments. Additionally, it can reduce anxiety before a medical procedure.


According to research in the Expert Review of Neuropathics, self-hypnosis can relieve stress associated with medical and dental procedures.These include migraines, tension headaches, and irritable bowel syndrome.
Hypnosis can also help lower blood pressure, control asthma attacks, and minimize the side effects of chemotherapy., This might depend on your schedule, of course. So, you may need to set an alarm. Hypnosis sessions with a therapist can last an hour or longer. You should self-hypnotize for a shorter period: 10, 20, or 30 minutes at a time.

, This might involve loosening your clothes, removing glasses or contacts, and taking off your shoes.Make sure the temperature in the room is comfortable as well and that there aren’t any distracting noises.

, If you sit back in a recliner or lie down, you may fall asleep, which is okay but something to be aware of. Technically, hypnosis is a wakeful trance state, but falling asleep could simply mean that your relaxation is working.

, Make sure you’re in a location where you feel comfortable closing your eyes. When you’re eyes are closed, you’ll have fewer visual distractions and can self-hypnotize better.

, Breathe deeply from your diaphragm. When you exhale, imagine exhaling all your tension. Staying conscious of your breathing can help you avoid other distracting thoughts, while being a comfort and a release in itself.

, Let all thoughts be pushed away for a minute or so. If you find thoughts coming back, don’t panic. Just re-center yourself and continue trying to rid your mind of thoughts. Soon you’ll be replacing your thoughts with numbers and affirmations.

, If it helps you relax, you can listen to instrumental music. Try other soothing sounds as well, such as white noise or forest, jungle, or ocean sounds. Just try to avoid music with words since you are trying to clear your mind of thoughts. Alternatively, you might consider using any one of a number of the albums devoted specifically to self-hypnosis., Use your inner voice to begin counting. Open your eyes on each count and close them back again. With each count, imagine that it’s almost a chore for you to open your eyes. Your eyelids should become heavier and lazier each time you open them. You may continue counting anywhere from 1 to 10, 1 to 20, or more.

, By this time you will be feeling pleasantly relaxed. Soothing relaxation will be floating all around your body. Just focus on it and enjoy it for few seconds.

, Imagine numbers in front of you from 200, going backwards: 200, 199, 198, and so on. After each number say the words ""deeper relaxed."" Continue doing so until you forget about the number and slip into an even deeper relaxed state.

, Following counting, or as an alternative to counting, you can use affirmations. These are positive words or phrases you repeat as a way of reprogramming your subconscious.Focus closely on the affirmations along with your breathing. Though you’re consciously focusing on the affirmation, your autohypnotic state is meant to affirm your affirmation on a subconscious level.


Use a specific affirmation that will resonate with your life and goals. Affirmations might be “I am healthy and powerful” or “I am enjoying my life.”They could also be specific to a certain area you’re trying to improve. For example, you might affirm: “My body is my ideal shape and size” or “I feel energetic and healthy.”

, You should repeat your chosen affirmation at least 10-20 times. Repetition allows the affirmation to sink in and work on your subconscious.

, The duration of self-hypnosis varies and tends to depend on the person. It’s different from guided hypnosis, wherein your therapist might have more of a concrete time limit. That said, you should ordinarily stay in self-hypnosis about 25 minutes.In guided hypnosis with a therapist, you might stay in hypnosis for an hour or more, but self-hypnosis is usually shorter. If you can remain in self-hypnosis longer than 25 minutes, that’s great, but you probably don’t want to exceed an hour.
For practical purposes, many people prefer to budget smaller amounts of time more frequently for autohypnosis, rather than longer periods sporadically., To some, an alarm can be too jarring of a way to emerge from a trance state. If this is a possibility, you might consider a quiet alarm, one that gradually rises in volume, or an alarm of that plays music you like.

, Even if your initial release from hypnosis is sudden (i.e. from an alarm clock), give yourself time to gradually emerge from your hypnotic state. Stay seated or lying for a couple extra minutes. Stretch lightly, and move your limbs around to boost circulation.

, Try to avoid strenuous activity immediately after coming out of self-hypnosis. This will help your body and mind gradually come out of the trance state, instead of abruptly jolting out of it.

Find a willing partner who wants to be hypnotized and is willing to be patient and relaxed for the best results.Do not hypnotize someone with a history of mental or psychotic disorders, as this can lead to unintended and dangerous consequences.;
, You want your participant to feel safe and free from distraction. There should only be dim lights and the room needs to be clean. Have them sit in a comfy chair and remove any potential distractions, like TVs or other people.


Turn off all cell phones and music.
Close the windows if there is noise outside.
Let other people you live with know that they shouldn't bother you until you both come out.

, Most people have wildly inaccurate ideas of hypnosis from movies and TV. In reality, it is mostly a relaxation technique that helps people gain clarity on problems or issues in their subconscious. We actually enter states hypnosis all the time -- in daydreams, when absorbed in music or movies, or when ""spacing out."" With real hypnosis:


You are not asleep or unconscious, ever.
You are not under a spell or someone's control.
You will not do anything you don't want to do., Hypnosis has been shown to decrease anxious thoughts and even raise your immune system strength.It is a great tool for increasing focus, especially before a test or big event, and can be used for deep relaxation in times of stress. Knowing your subjects goals with hypnosis will help you ease them into a trance state.

, If they have, ask them what they were told to do and how they responded. This will give you an idea of how responsive the partner will be to your own suggestions, and perhaps what things in you should avoid.


People who have been hypnotized before usually have an easier time being hypnotized again.

, Take your time when talking, keeping your voice calm and collected. Draw out your sentences a little longer than usual. Imagine you are trying to calm down a frightened or worrying person, letting your voice be an example. Keep this tone of voice throughout the entire interaction. Some good words to start with include:


""Let my words wash over you, and take the suggestions as you desire them.""
""Everything here is safe, calm, and peaceful. Let yourself sink into the couch/chair as your relax deeply.""
""Your eyes may feel heavy and want to close. Let your body sink naturally down as your muscles relax. Listen to your body and my voice as you begin to feel calm.""
""You are in complete control of this time. You will only accept those suggestions which are for your benefit and that you are willing to accept.""

, Try and get them to take deep, organized breaths in and out. Help them develop regular breathing by lining it up with yours. You should be specific: ""Breathe in deeply now, filling your chest and lungs,"" as you breath in as well, followed by an exhalation and the words ""slowly let the air out of your chest, completely emptying your lungs.


Focused breathing gets oxygen to the brain and gives the person something to think about other than hypnosis, stress, or their environment.

, It can be your forehead if you're right in front of them or a dimly lit object in the room. Tell them to choose an object, any object, and rest their eyes on it. This is where the stereotype of the dangling watch comes from, as this small object is actually not a terrible thing for someone to look it. If they feel relaxed enough to close their eyes, let them.


Pay attention to their eyes from time to time. If they seem like they are darting around, give them some guidance. ""I want you to pay attention to that poster on the wall,"" or ""try and focus on the space right between my eyebrows."" Tell them to ""Let their eyes and eyelids relax, growing heavy.""
If you want them to focus on you, you need to stay relatively still.

, Once you have them relatively calm, breathing regularly, and in-tune with your voice, ask them to relax their toes and feet. Have them focus on just letting go of these muscles, then move up to the calves. Ask them to relax their lower leg, then their upper leg, and so on up to the face muscles. From there you can circle back around to their back, shoulders, arms, and fingers.


Take your time and keep your voice slow and calm. If they seem twitchy or tense, slow down and re-do the process in reverse.
""Relax your feet and ankles. Feel the muscles lighten and loosen in your feet, as if they require no effort to maintain.""

, Direct the attention with suggestions. Let them know they are feeling calm and relaxed. While you have a lot of things you can say, the goal is to encourage them to sink even deeper into themselves, focusing on relaxation with each inhalation and exhalation.


""You can feel your eyelids getting heavy. Let them drift and fall.""
""You are letting yourself slip deeper and deeper into a calm, peaceful trance.
""You can feel yourself relaxing now. You can feel a heavy, relaxed feeling coming over you. And as I continue to talk, that heavy relaxed feeling will get stronger and stronger, until it carries you into a deep, peaceful state of relaxation."", Repeat the suggestions a few times, much as you might repeat the verses and choruses of a song, until your partner appears to be totally relaxed. Look for signs of tension in their eyes (are they darting?), their fingers and toes (are they tapping or wiggling) and their breathing (is it shallow and irregular) and keep working on your relaxation techniques until they seem calm and relaxed.


""Every word that I utter is putting you faster and deeper, and faster and deeper, into a calm, peaceful state of relaxation.""
""Sinking down, and shutting down. Sinking down, and shutting down. Sinking down, and shutting down, shutting down completely.""
""And the deeper you go, the deeper you are able to go. And the deeper you go, the deeper you want to go, and the more enjoyable the experience becomes.""

, This technique is shared by hypnotherapists and self-hypnotists alike to bring about a state of deep trance. Ask your subject to imagine themselves at the top of a long staircase in a warm, quiet room. As they step down, they feel themselves sinking deeper into relaxation. Each step brings them deeper into their own mind. As they walk, let them know there are ten steps, and guide them down each one.


""Take the first step down and feel yourself sinking deeper into relaxation. Each step is a step further into your subconscious. You step down the second step and feel yourself getting calmer and calmer. When you reach the third step, your body feels as if it is floating blissfully away... etc.""
It can help to envision a door at the bottom as well, leading them to a state of pure relaxation.

, In addition, most people will remember what they did under hypnosis, so even if you can get them to pretend they are a chicken, they won't be happy. Hypnosis, however, has many therapeutic benefits outside of a cheesy Las Vegas show. Help your subject relax and let go of their problems or worries instead of trying to play a practical joke.


Even well-intentioned suggestions can have bad results if you don't know what you are doing. This is why licensed hypnotherapists usually help the patient determine the right course of action instead of trying to give it to them as a suggestion.

, Hypnosis reduces anxiety, no matter what your suggestions are, so don't feel like you need to ""fix"" anyone. Simply putting someone in a trance state is a fantastic way to lower stress levels and anxiety. The act of deep relaxation, without trying to ""solve"" anything, is so rare in daily life that it can put problems and worries in perspective all by itself., Instead of telling someone how to fix an issue, have them imagine themselves already succeeding. What does success look and feel like to them? How did they get there?


What is their preferred future? What has changed to get them there?

, While you should seek out the advice of a trained mental health professional, hypnotherapy has been used for addiction, pain relief, phobias, self-esteem issues, and more.While you should never try and ""fix"" someone, hypnosis can be an excellent tool to help someone heal themselves.


Help them envision the world beyond their problems -- imagine them going through a day without smoking, or visualize a moment they are proud of to raise self-esteem.
Healing through hypnosis is always easier if they person wants to work on the issue before they entire the trance state.

, The key benefits of hypnosis are relaxation and time to muse safely on an issue. It is both deep relaxation and focused attention on an issue at the same time. However, hypnosis is not a miracle cure or quick fix, it is simply a way to help people dive deeper into their own mind. This sort of self-reflection is critical to strong mental health, but serious or chronic issues should always be treated by a trained and certified professional., You don't want to jerk them out of their relaxation. Let them know that they are becoming more aware of their surroundings. Tell them that they will come back to full awareness, alert and awake, after you count to five. If you feel like they are deeply in a trance, have them walk back up the ""staircase"" with you, gaining awareness with each step.Begin by saying, ""I'm going to count from one to five, and at the count of five you will be feeling wide awake, fully alert, and completely refreshed.""

, Ask them what felt right to them, what threatened to take them out of hypnosis, and what they felt. This will help you get people under more effectively next time, and help them learn what they enjoyed about the process.


Don't pressure anyone to talk immediately. Simply open a conversation, and wait to talk until later if they seem relaxed and want some time to stay quiet.

, It's good to have a general idea about how to answer questions like these ahead of time, because confidence and trust are so important in determining how a person is going to respond to your induction. Common questions you might get at any point in the process include:What are you going to do? I will ask you to visualize some pleasant scenes, while I talk about how to use your own mental abilities more effectively. You can always refuse to do anything that you don't want to do, and you can always come out of the experience yourself if an emergency should come up.

What does it feel like to be in hypnosis? Most of us experience changes in our conscious awareness several times a day without realizing it. Any time you let your imagination go and just flow along with a piece of music or a verse of poetry, or get so involved in watching a movie or a television drama that you feel like you're part of the action instead of a part of the audience, you are experiencing a form of trance. Hypnosis is just a way of helping you to focus and define these changes in consciousness, in order to use your mental abilities more effectively.

Is it safe? Hypnosis is not an altered state of consciousness (as sleep is, for example), but an altered experience of consciousness. You will never do something you don't want to do or be forced into thoughts against your will.

If it's all just your imagination, then, what good is it? Don’t be confused by the tendency in English and many other languages to use the word ""imaginary"" as opposite in meaning to the word ""real"" -- and neither should it be confused with the term ""image."" The imagination is a very real group of mental abilities, whose potential we are just now beginning to explore, and which extends far beyond our ability to form mental images!

Can you make me do anything I don't want to do? When you're using hypnosis, you still have your own personality, and you're still you -- so you won't say or do anything that you wouldn't do in the very same situation without hypnosis, and you can easily refuse any suggestion that you don't want to accept. (That's why we call them ""suggestions."")

What can I do in order to respond better? Hypnosis is very similar to letting yourself become absorbed in watching a sunset or the embers of a campfire, letting yourself flow with a piece of music or poetry, or feeling like you are part of the action instead of part of the audience when you are watching a movie. It all depends on your ability and willingness to go along with the instructions and suggestions that are provided.

What if I enjoy it so much that I don't want to come back? Hypnotic suggestions are basically an exercise for the mind and the imagination, just like a movie script is. But you still come back to everyday life when the session is over, just like you come back at the end of a movie. However, the hypnotist might need to try a couple times to pull you out. It is enjoyable being completely relaxed, but you can't do much when hypnotized.

What if it doesn't work? Did you ever become so absorbed in your play as a child that you didn’t hear your mother’s voice calling you in for dinner? Or are you one of the many people who are able to wake up at a certain time each morning, just by deciding the night before that you are going to do so? We all have the ability to use our minds in ways we are not usually aware of, and some of us have developed these abilities more than others. If you just allow your thoughts to respond freely and naturally to the words and images as your guide, you'll be able to go wherever your mind can take you

Contact your union representative.,
Check the length of the opt-out window.,
Realize you may still have to pay “agency fees.” Even if you leave a union in some states, you can be forced to pay an “agency fee.” The purpose of the fee is to reimburse the union for continuing to represent you in collective bargaining.,
Fill out required paperwork.,
Become a conscientious or religious objector.",How to Get Out of a Labor Union1," Every union is different. To figure out when and how to leave the union, you will need to talk to your union representative. Call them up or stop by to talk.


If you are not in a “right to work” state, then your ability to leave the union can be restricted.You should ask about those restrictions.;
, In some unions, you might only be able to leave your union during certain times of the year. For example, in Michigan, teachers can only opt out of their union in August.You can often find this window of time by getting a copy of your enrollment form.You might also read your collective bargaining agreement, which could contain this information.

,, There may be forms you have to fill out to leave the union. Alternately, you might need to send a letter to your union.This letter should state where you work and that you resign your membership from the local and all affiliated unions.If you had union dues automatically deducted from your paycheck, then you’ll need to stop those deductions. You can get a form from your union representative or possibly Human Resources.

, As an objector, the full amount of your union dues will be deducted and payed to a tax-exempt charitable fund. You will no longer be a member of the union, though you will still work under the collective bargaining agreement.You can go to http://choosecharity.org/ and complete an application. Their legal team will then take over the rest.

, It can be hard to focus your mind if you are either hungry or too full. Eat enough to give you energy for meditation, but not so much that you are overfull., You want to find a space where no interruptions or sudden noises will pull you back to the world around you. A small, uncluttered space in your home is ideal., Turn off your cell phone or pager. If you have a land-line, turn off the ringer. Ask your family not to interrupt you during your session.

, Sitting is best, as lying down may cause you to fall asleep. To best enter a state of hypnosis:Choose a comfortable position for your legs. A classic meditative position is to cross your legs, but you may prefer to kneel, lay your legs out straight, or sit in a chair. Just be sure it is a position you can hold comfortably.
Keep your back straight. A straight back will help you to breathe deeply. Sit in a chair if you find it difficult to keep your back straight without one.
Place your hands where they will not distract you. You can place your hands on your legs or put them together in a praying position, whichever works best for you.

, As you prepare to employ the Best Me technique, close your eyes and take a moment to simply breathe slowly in and out. Focus on your breathing and nothing else. This will help to clear you mind and prepare you to effectively enter a state of heightened concentration."

Vote to decertify.,
Dig in for a long haul.",How to Get Out of a Labor Union2," When you decertify your union, it no longer operates in your workplace. It can’t collectively bargain on your behalf, and you no longer will be bound by prior collective bargaining agreements. You should find people who can help you handle the decertification process. Only the National Labor Relations Board can decertify your union, and they have made the process lengthy and difficult.If you no longer want any union in your workplace, then you should talk to a lawyer. Your employer is prohibited by law from helping you.You can find a labor lawyer by contacting your nearest bar association and asking for a referral.
You might want a new union. The process is similar to the one described in this article. However, it is often easier to try to reform your current union than switch. You should contact the National Labor Relations Board with questions., You can only move to decertify a union at certain points in time. For example, you can’t vote to decertify within the first year of the union’s certification. However, you could seek decertification at other points:In the first three years, you have a 30-day window in which you can seek decertification. This window begins 90 days before the bargaining agreement expires and ends 60 days before the agreement expires. If your union agrees to a new collective bargaining agreement before the window arrives, then you can’t seek decertification.
After the first three years of a contract, you can seek to decertify at any time.
If your collective bargaining agreement has expired, then you can seek decertification so long as a new agreement hasn’t been signed.

, You can’t request a decertification election from the NLRB unless you get signatures from at least 30% of bargaining unit members who agree to hold a decertification election. There are many petitions available online. Remember to work to decertify the union only during non-work time and only in non-work spaces.A petition might read: “We, the undersigned employees of Acme Company, no longer wish to be represented by National Union Federation, our current union. We request that the National Labor Relations Board hold an election since we believe a majority of unit employees no longer wish to be represented by National Union Federation.”Include lines for each signatory to put their printed name, signature, department, and date.

, You need to get at least 30% of all members covered by the union to trigger a decertification election. Remember that the 30% threshold applies to all people covered by the union—not simply members.


It’s possible that people choose not to join the union but nevertheless are covered by the collective bargaining contract. These people can vote to decertify the union.

, You must notify your employer and other interested parties (such as your current union) that you are seeking decertification. Don’t show them your petition with signatures. Instead, you will need to provide them with completed copies of the following forms.You can serve them by certified mail or hand delivery.Form NLRB 502-RD
Form NLRB-505
Form NLRB 4812

, You should make several copies of the petition. You need to submit it to your nearest NLRB regional office, along with NLRB Form 502.You can find your nearest NLRB regional office here: https://www.nlrb.gov/who-we-are/regional-offices.
Also send a Certificate of Service, NLRB Form 5544., It is an unfair labor practice for anyone to try and intimidate you into staying in the union. Once you begin your decertification drive, you can expect the union to find out and not be happy. Be sure to thoroughly document any intimidation, such as threats or harassment.


Save threatening emails and notes, as well as voicemail messages.
If someone personally confronts you, then write down their name and what they did or said.

, The NLRB should run the decertification vote. After receiving your request, they will need to validate signatures. The election should be held within 60 days. At the election, a majority of people who vote will need to vote to keep the union, otherwise it will be decertified.Once decertified, you can negotiate terms of employment directly with your employer—and without union involvement.

, Decertifying a union is not easy. It can take years to decertify a union, and you may need more than one petition or election before you succeed.

Go through the steps of the Best Me technique.,
Choose your safe place (your ""belief system"").,
Imagine yourself in your safe place.,
Let the peacefulness of your safe place drive out negative emotions.,
Allow the calm of the space to drive away all thought.,
Enjoy the peacefulness.,
Expect to sink deeply into your safe space.,
Repeat these steps as many times as necessary.,
Associate your safe place with a word.,
Conclude your session or move on to pre-experiencing or re-experiencing.",How to Hypnotize Yourself Using the Best Me Technique2," Each letter in ""Best Me"" corresponds to a step. It does not matter what order you do the steps in (the order below is BESTME), or what words you use. It is important however, that you include all the steps to ensure that you immerse every aspect of yourself in the imagined experience.B - Belief system
E - Emotions
S - Sensations and physical experiences
T - Thoughts and images
M - Motives
E - Expectations

, Think of a real or imagined place where you feel safe, calm, and happy. You can choose any place you like; there is no ""wrong"" place. It is, however, best to stick with a place once you choose it, as this makes reaching a relaxed state easier.Common safe places include:


A beach
A sunny park
A spot you visited on vacation
Your favorite room in your house, past or present
A place you've seen in a picture

, This is the sensation and physical experiences part of the process. Use all of your senses, not just sight. As you imagine each detail of this safe place, let its calmness relax you. For example, if your safe place were a beach at sunset, you would concentrate on:The colors – the red and golds of the sunset, the blue of the water
The sounds – the crash of the surf and call of the gulls
The sensations – the wind on your skin and the warm sand beneath you
Smells – the pure sea air with a hint of saltiness

, Absorb the peace around you. Feel yourself becoming calm, relaxed. Tell yourself: ""I am calm. At peace.""

, Thoughts will inevitably flit through your mind at first. Don't fight them. Rather, gently return your focus to your safe space. You are sinking into it and shutting down. Sinking down and shutting down. Sinking down and shutting down.If you have difficulty pushing away a negative thought, imagine putting the image on a TV screen, then use a remote control to put it on mute, to make it black and white, and to turn it off.You can also imagine putting the image in a drawer and closing the drawer.

, You have no other motives, no desire to be anywhere else, to do anything else. All you want is to exist free in this place. To dream, to drift on an on, until you are completely in your own personal paradise., Don't worry about whether you will achieve hypnosis. Expect to. Hypnosis is nothing but focus. Focus on your safe space. Be there. As you enter it completely, you are in hypnosis. As the technique's creator writes, ""The deeper you go, the deeper you're able to go, and the deeper you go, the deeper you want to go, and the more enjoyable the experience becomes."", Return to the sensations of your safe space. Feel the peacefulness. Let thoughts fade. Enjoy the space as you sink deeper and deeper, until you are completely in your safe space., Once you have created and immersed yourself in your safe place, consider giving it a name. You can then use this name, even when not in hypnosis, to bring feelings of calm and relaxation., If you are still mastering self-hypnosis, or if your goal was simply to relax and calm yourself, you can now emerge from your session. Or, you can move on to pre-experiencing a goal in order to increase confidence and incentive, or to re-experiencing past emotions in order to build confidence and reduce anxiety.

Choose a goal.,
Recreate the successful accomplishment of your goal using the Best Me steps.,
Imagine yourself having accomplished your goal.,
Feel the satisfaction and pride of achieving your goal.,

Academics
Singing
Dancing
Athletics / getting in shape
Creative writing
Getting in shape
Starting your business / achieving a work goal
Losing weight or quitting smoking

, From within your safe place, you will now imagine in detail the accomplishment of your goal. The more detailed your scenario, and the more steps it involves, the better.Increase the incentive value of your recreation by imagining further rewards associated with your goal, like the vacation you will take afterwards.
Consider pre-experiencing the rewards of sub-goals as well. For instance, if quitting smoking, you might imagine the dinner you will treat yourself to after one week, or a conversation where you proudly tell a friend you have not smoked for a month.

, Think of yourself receiving a raise or your diploma, or the rewards for whatever you goal is. Recreate the moment as fully as possible, just as you did in creating your safe place. See it, hear, it, smell it, feel it. Think of precisely what you will do and say; of what people around you will do and say., Think of the admiring looks from friends and relatives. Think of what they will say to you. Imagine how proud and happy you will feel. Allow yourself to fully experience these emotions., If other thoughts intrude, gently push your attention back to the scene you are acting out. Experience the accomplishment of your goals so intensely that it feels as if you are willing it into existence., Experiencing the accomplishment of your goal and the attendant emotions, even if only in your mind, will create powerful memories that help you believe you are headed towards certain success. This will allow you to act confidently, expecting to succeed., Think to yourself that you will gradually come back to the world around you by the time you reach five.


One – Begin returning.
Two – You are happy, confident.
Three – Coming back more and more. Focus on yourself – your breathing and the feel of the floor or chair beneath you.
Four – Almost back. Become aware of the sounds and sensations in the room where you are.
Five – Open your eyes. You are back, feeling wonderful.

, Start by imagining yourself in the past. What do you see? What do you hear, feel, smell? What were you doing? Saying? Visualize the moment so clearly that it feels as if you are willing it into existence.

, As you allow yourself to sink into the scene you have created, you will re-experience the emotion. Let yourself feel it again as you relive the moment., When other thoughts intrude, gently push them away and return to your scenario. If they persist, imagine putting them on a TV screen and clicking off the TV, or putting them in a drawer and shutting it., Memories connected to strong feelings are very powerful. Reliving this memory with its attendant emotions of confidence and happiness will make you feel as if you are inevitably heading for success. Embrace this feeling. Expect to succeed. Act, think, and feel as if you cannot fail.

, Once you have recreated this experience, think of a word that describes it. Focus on that word while you recall the scene and the feelings it creates. In the future, you will be able to use this word to bring those feelings back when you need them., You will gradually return to your normal state of consciousness by the time you reach five.


One – Begin returning.
Two – Focus on your emotions: happy, confident.

Volunteer in a position related to your desired field.,
Apply to on an internship.,
Develop your expertise.,
Get a part time job.",How to Get a Job With No Experience1," If you are struggling to get a job in your desired field because you don’t have enough work experience, you should volunteer in your field. This will help you get some real-life work experience and you will begin to develop some of the skills that will be important to future employers.For instance, if you would like to be a social worker, you could volunteer at a homeless shelter or become a Big Brother or Big Sister.;
, Unpaid or even paid internships are an excellent way for entry-level job seekers to gain concrete experience working in the field. Search through online job boards and company websites for internship opportunities.


For example, some companies will hire a summer intern to take on general office duties such as filing, data entry, and answering phones. This can give you experience working in an office and will allow you to meet people in your field.

, If you are trying to break into fields like writing, film editing, or interior design, create sample products to show to potential employers. For example, if you want to be a writer, you could start a blog. This will demonstrate that you have experience creating written material on a regular basis.This will also help you build your personal portfolio.

, Even if you can’t land a job in your desired field, take on a part time job. Employers will often put some weight onto any form of work experience, even your first part-time job. This early work experience could be leveraged to demonstrate that you have developed communication, customer service, and problem solving skills.For example, apply to part time jobs in retail, fast food, or even serving and bartending. This experience can be invaluable.

List all of your skills.,
Relate your skills to your experiences.,
Explain how these skills are transferable to the job or industry.,
Identify any awards you have won.",How to Get a Job With No Experience2," The reason that employers place so much emphasis on work experience is because they want to ensure that you have developed the skills necessary to complete the job. As a result, it is very important that you clearly list and highlight all relevant skills. Some skills to consider include:Computer skills: This can include working with Windows and Mac operating systems, typing over 60 words per minute, proficiency with PowerPoint or other Microsoft Office programs, web programming, blogging, content management systems, databases, graphic design and more.
Communication skills: Includes anything from public speaking, writing, training, and listening to facilitating teamwork.
Problem solving and research skills: Students and bloggers have finely honed research skills that can be an asset to a company. People with organizational or office management skills can also boast exceptional problem solving skills.
Managerial or leadership skills: If you have ever led a project at your job, through a charity, or amongst friends, then you have experience developing leadership skills.

, Although it is essential to know and understand all of the skills that you have developed over the years, it is even more important that you can relate those skills to past work or volunteer experience. This will demonstrate to a potential employer that you have actually put your skills into practice.It is one thing to say “I have excellent written communication skills,” but is even more impressive to say “I have 2,500 followers on my blog, which focuses on creative writing.”

, You have likely developed numerous skills through extra-curricular activities and the connection between these activities and your dream job, may not be obvious. For example, perhaps your hobby is soccer. This does not immediately transfer to a position in IT, but if you coached a soccer team or organized a league, you can demonstrate that you have concrete leadership abilities., Awards and recognition can help to give weight to some of the standard statements that are common on a resume. For example, you may state that you are a hard worker. You can back this up by demonstrating that you won an employee of the month award in your previous part-time work. Include on your resume any awards or recognition, from employee of the month, to a top retail associate, to a dean's list commendation. Awards and honours should be listed on your resume to show your dedication and exceptional work ethic.You should also include any awards or recognition you gained through volunteer work.

For example, you could list communication skills and then provide examples or when and how you have developed those skills through different work, intern, and volunteer positions.


Always tweak your resume and cover letter to fit the job you are applying for. This will demonstrate to a potential employer that you have taken the time to research and consider the posting.

, Use social media sites, such as LinkedIn to reach out to and meet with people in the industry. You can also network at local community events or job fairs. This network may be able to recommend jobs, help you develop skills, and answer any questions you may have about the industry., Use job sites like Monster.com, CareerBuilder.ca, Indeed.com, or SimplyHired.com to begin looking for entry-level job titles. These sites will allow you to search for specific jobs or more generally at career fields, such as teaching or advertising.


Define your search by choosing 0 to 2 years of experience. This will remove jobs that require more experience.

, Most job search engines will allow you to apply for jobs directly through their site. You should apply to as many jobs as possible, even if you do not have all of the required experience that was listed on the job post. For example, the post may say two to three years of experience is preferred. This likely means that they will consider candidates that do not have exactly two years of experience.

, In order to be successful in an interview, you should thoroughly research the company. This way you will appear knowledgeable about both the job and company goals and objectives. You should also practice some interview questions with a friend or family member.

Internships offered through the program are paid positions.
The program is open to college students and usually hosts roughly 50 interns. You'll end up working at the company's headquarters in Seattle, Washington, for approximately 10 to 12 weeks during the summer.You'll need to attend a local recruitment event to apply for an internship. Talk to the Career Services office of your university for assistance or ask your local Starbucks staff for information about upcoming events.

, There are six basic types of retail positions you can get at Starbucks: baristas, shift supervisors, assistant store managers, store managers, district managers, and regional directors.Additionally, there are numerous corporate positions to consider, as well. Each position has its own specific requirements, and you'll need to meet those requirements to get the job.


Note that for all positions, you must be at least 16 years old and legally allowed to work within the country.
Lower-level positions, like baristas, are easier to break into without experience or education. In fact, you can start in a retail position without a degree and train on the job to acquire greater skill sets. Starbucks also has its own ""College Achievement Plan"" to help employees finish their degrees.
While the company still accepts applicants with varied, diverse backgrounds when filling corporate positions, your odds of being hired will improve greatly if you have the right education and experience backing you. These requirements are usually similar within the field the job belongs in. For instance, if you want a corporate financial position, you'll probably need a college degree in accounting, business finance, or a similar subject.

, After receiving your application, the hiring manager will review all of the candidates and select those who seem most eligible. If yours is among the chosen applications, you should receive a phone call within several days to one week.The exact amount of time can vary depending on how many candidates applied to the position, so try to be patient.
When you hear from the hiring manager, be prepared to set up a date and time for your interview.

, Before going to the interview, you need to familiarize yourself with the Starbucks corporation, the specific Starbucks location you applied with, and the overall culture promoted by Starbucks.


Spend time inside of the Starbucks location to gain some understanding of the ambiance there. You don't need to love coffee, but you should know plenty about it and about the other drinks Starbucks serves.
Review the company's mission statement: ""To inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.""Analyze the statement and develop your own ideas about what it means.
Read about the latest news concerning Starbucks and its competitors, both locally and nationally.
Try to research the specific team you'll meet with. At the very least, you should know the names of the teammates. Consider checking LinkedIn for information about their background and experience, too.

, During the interview, you should usually wear business casual clothes. This is true even if you're only applying to a low-level retail position and even if you know that you won't need to wear such clothes if you actually get the job.


Your clothes don't need to be bland, but they do need to be relatively conservative and formal for the interview to demonstrate your seriousness about the position.
You need to be well-groomed, too. Take a shower, brush your teeth, and comb your hair.

, Even though the hiring manager may already have a copy of your resume, you should bring another copy with you to the interview. Use it to cite specific experiences and qualifications.You may need to hand over your copy immediately, or you may be able to keep it throughout the interview. Either way, you should avoid reading directly off the resume as much as possible.

, Body language is the best way to demonstrate your focus. Make eye contact, smile when it's appropriate, and shake hands when you greet and depart from the hiring manager.


Even if you have a phone interview, you also need to give the hiring manager your full attention. Do not text, surf the Internet, or distract yourself in any other way during the interview.

, The person in charge of your interview will ask you a series of behavioral-based questions. Answer each question as thoroughly and accurately as possible.


You'll likely be asked about how you've handled past situations and may need to talk about past mistakes. Provide real-life examples in your answers instead of offering generalities, and explain how you've learned and improved yourself through each experience.
Listen carefully to each question and make sure that your answer addresses that question completely. Relax, but stay on topic and avoid rambling about unrelated matters.

, Typically, the company looks for people who are passionate about their culture and their company, so express plenty of enthusiasm about the possibility of working there.


You need to describe why you want to work at Starbucks. This answer should also have some connection to your values and your overall career goals.
You don't need to love coffee, but you need to have some appreciation for the place coffee has within society and your local community.
Additionally, you should also show passion for your community itself. Company policy dictates that each branch should be interested in becoming part of the community its in, so if you live in the area and know the culture there, you'll improve your odds of getting hired.

, Coming to the interview with your own questions demonstrates more interest in the position. The questions you ask should be specific to the team and location you'll be involved with.


For example, you might want to ask about the qualities your hiring manager values most or the opportunities you'll have to contribute to the team. You can also ask specific about specific job requirements or responsibilities.

, This isn't strictly necessary, but it can leave a good impression if you do it the right way. Consider sending a ""thank you"" note immediately after the interview that elaborates on something previously discussed. The note should make the hiring manager think about you specifically.


On the other hand, you should avoid sending a form-letter note. Doing so may not hurt your chances of being hired, but it won't leave a lasting impression and may make you appear dispassionate about the job.

, If the hiring manager chooses you for the position, you should receive a phone call shortly after completing the interview. For many retail positions, the call will come within a week. For most corporate positions, it should come within two weeks to one month.


For management positions and corporate positions, you might be called back for one or two more interviews before you hear back on the final decision. Go through each interview process in the same general manner as the one before it.

, Starbucks hires new employees on a daily basis, but the company also receives countless applications. Even if you have the right experience and handle the interview appropriately, there is no way to guarantee that you'll get the job.


Retail positions are more prevalent than corporate positions, and lower-level positions are easier to break into than upper-level ones. Approximately 70 percent of the company's employees are promoted within the company, including shifts from retail to corporate careers.

, If you get hired—congratulations! Find out when your new job starts and what your new supervisor expects of you. If you don't get hired, you'll need to determine what to do from that point on.


You should discuss your pay and benefits package once you're offered the position and before you accept it. Nearly any employee working 20 or more hours a week is eligible for a benefits package with Starbucks.When applying for barista and shift supervisor positions, your application is considered active for 60 days. For all other retail and corporate positions, your application remains active for 12 months. During this time, a member of the appropriate team will contact you if a new position opens within the area, so you don't need to immediately reapply if you don't get the job you originally applied for.

Talk to your co-workers about unionizing.,
Find out if you can join a pre-existing union.,
Contact a union organizer.,
Form an organizing committee.,
Gather information about the employees and workplace.,
Formulate an issues program.An issues program is like the organizing committee's mission statement, and should include the improvements that the committee hopes to achieve through unionization, such as higher wages, better benefits, and/or improved working conditions.,
Prepare for anti-union tactics from your employer.,
Collect signatures.,
File an election petition.,
Vote in the election.,
Negotiate your first contract.",How to Form a Union," Ultimately, a majority of your co-workers will need to vote to establish a union. By talking to your co-workers, you can gauge whether your fellow employees are likely to support a union election. Talking is also the best way to find out what changes your co-workers would like to see, and for you to share your ideas about how unionization can effectuate those changes.


Keep your discussions quiet and private.Although the National Labor Relations Act guarantees the right to discuss union membership during non- work time in non work areas (like an employee lounge), keeping these discussions discreet helps avoid conflict between the management and pro-union employees.
Your co-workers must find you to be trustworthy and competent, so study up on union issues, like federal and state labor law, the benefits of unions, and common employer tactics used to discourage organization.When a co-worker has a question or challenges your position, you should ready to answer quickly and confidently. To successfully organize, you must inspire and persuade you peers to follow your leadership.;
, There may already be a union you can join that represents your industry. These organizations can guide you through the process of organizing a union at your workplace. Most U.S. labor organizations are organized under the American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations or the Change to Win Federation. There are also independent unions that are not affiliated with either umbrella organization, such as the International Longshore & Warehouse Union, United Electrical Workers, and Industrial Workers of the World.


You can also locate local unions by searching online or in the phone book under ""Labor Organizations."" Keep in mind that the name of the union doesn't matter; meat packers commonly belong to the United Steel Workers. Contact your local unions to find out what industries they represent., If you and your co-workers decide that you would like to organize under an existing union, contact a union organizer at a pre-existing union to help organize a union at your workplace.

Alternatively, if you can form a new independent union that is recognized by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) without working with an existing union. Be aware that the cost of running a union and the complexities of labor law may make forming a new union impractical., Whether you are working with the assistance of a union organizer from a pre-existing union or trying to start an independent union, start by assembling an organizing committee. Committee members should be prepared to do research the benefits of unionization and to educate and persuade their co-workers to support the union. Find like-minded co-workers who are interested in helping organizing your unionization campaign. Try to find a selection of members who represent a good cross-section of the company, including people who represent different:


Departments within the company;
Shifts;
Racial and ethnic backgrounds; and
Genders., You will need to gather information about the workplace, which may be useful to the union or the NLRB in the future. In gathering information, research your company online and speak to co-workers who may have the information you are missing.


Describe the workplace structure, including the different departments, work areas, jobs, and shifts.
Collect information from each employee on a spreadsheet with each person's name, address, phone number, shift, job title, and department.
Assemble information about your employer, including other locations, parent companies and subsidiaries, products, major customers, and union history., Be sure to highlight your desired improvements when discussing your campaign to unionize with your co-workers.


Research the wages and benefits that people in your industry receive in your state and elsewhere in the country when they are unionized versus when they are not represented by a union. Have these statistic handy during discussions.

, Because unions give more power to workers to negotiate for better pay and working conditions, they take some power away from employers. For this reason, employers often try to discourage union organization. Common discouragement tactics include:


'Scare tactics'. Employers might announce that they will refuse to negotiate with the union. However, under federal law, employers are required to negotiate with the union. Employers might threaten the jobs or benefits of pro-union employees, or pressure supervisors to manipulate or harass others. These tactics are abusive and illegal under federal law. Employers might also try to discourage participation by making a big deal about how much unions cost. You can share the counterargument that union dues are a minor expense compared to the positive impact a union can have. If your employer engages in illegal tactics, contact a union representative or the NLRB and ask what actions you should take.
'Love tactics'. Some employers try to convince their employees that a union isn't necessary. Common love tactics include apologizing for past wrongs and promising better treatment in the future; and making sudden changes in working conditions, employee benefits, and relationships between employees and managers. Employers hope that by making some small changes, their employees will become complacent and lose their motivation to unionize.

, If you are working with an established union, you will want to distribute and collect authorization cards, also called ""A cards."" The union should provide you with pre-printed A cards, which look like this sample. If you are working without independently, you will need to circulate a petition. Get signatures from your co-workers who are not supervisors or managers, since supervisors and managers are not eligible for union representation.


If you collect signatures or cards from at least 30% of the employees, the NLRB will organize a union election.If you collect signatures or cards from more than 50% of the employees, you can ask your employer to waive an election and begin acknowledging the union leadership immediately.
If at least 50% of the employees sign, and the employer will not waive the election, the NLRB can step in and mandate the creation of a union if it investigates and determines that the employer is engaging in actions to prevent a fair election.

, You will need to fill out and file this Petition with the NLRB. You must also fill out and file this Certificate of Service stating that you gave notice of the petition to your employer.


The NLRB will also need to your authorization cards or petition signatures from at least 30% of your co-workers. The NLRB will ask your employer for a list of its employees, and compare the names on the list to the signatures you have submitted.

, It will take the NLRB at least several weeks to determine who is eligible to vote and to schedule an election.The NLRB will then set up a polling area, usually on the employer's property, and supervise the election. Employees vote by casting paper ballots, which are counted on the spot at the end of the voting period. Voting is done by ""secret"" ballot, so your employer will not know which employees voted to unionize.If at least 50% of the employees vote to form a union, a union is formed.


In some cases, the NLRB may elect to have employees vote by mail., Your first goal after the election is to negotiate a union contract between the employer and the union, which covers everything from wages to how disputes will be handled in the future.If a bargain does not come easily, the union will need to put pressure on the employer to meet the union's demands by mobilizing the employees.


Mobilization techniques might include writing letters or filing grievances, filing an unfair business practices lawsuit, organizing attendance at public meetings, holding a publicity campaign to get support from the community, and even going on strike."

Think about what you will do after retirement.,
Talk to your spouse or partner.",How to Find Good Reasons to Quit Your Job," Think about the jobs you have held, the job you have now, and your plans are for the future. Is your current job a step in the right direction? Is it where you need to be to achieve your goals?


If your job doesn’t make sense for you – if, for example, you are sorting mail but have an accounting degree and want to become an auditor – then you have a good reason to move on.
If your job does seem like a good fit for you career path, you need to evaluate further. Why do you want to leave? Are you ready for increased responsibilities? Do you need a new challenge?;
, If you have lost interest in your current job and feel strongly that you are ready for a change, it may be time to switch careers. Perhaps you started out as a sales representative but realized you have a strong passion for technology – you can consider pursuing a new career in IT.

, Does your current job provide you with opportunities to increase your knowledge through skills training or management training? Does it offer the opportunity for career advancement through promotions and additional responsibilities? If you have the desire to grow and advance but cannot do so at your current job, it may be time to look for a new employer.

, Do you feel underappreciated at your current job? Are you underpaid? It you believe that your efforts and contributions to your company are not fairly recognized or compensated, it may be time to move to a new position.


If you are unsure about what kind of salary you should be making, consult career databases and websites to figure out the average salary for someone in your position.

, If the future of your current company seems uncertain, you may feel uncomfortable and insecure. It makes sense, in this situation, to consider seeking employment elsewhere – that way, your career trajectory will not be affected by your company’s issues. Factors that can contribute to instability include:


the possibility that the company will be sold, acquired, or merged with another organization. When a company undergoes these kinds of changes, layoffs are a real possibility; your employer may need to reduce staff and increase efficiency.
a shaky or declining financial situation. A company in financial trouble will look to reduce costs in every way possible. This can include eliminating jobs, decreasing pay, or reducing benefits.
a pattern of recent layoffs. Whenever a company begins laying off large numbers of employees, the future seems uncertain. Everyone wonders who is next.

, If your job has caused you so much stress that you are physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted, it may be time to change jobs. Your health is truly at stake. Signs of burn out include:


lack of energy
reduced productivity
increased frustration and cynicism
a lack of patience
trouble getting motivated to start your work day
feelings of disillusionment about your job
changes in appetite or sleep habits
aching in the head, back, or neck

, Many employees are highly stressed but not yet burnt out completely. Is this your situation? It is normal and acceptable to feel very stressed out occasionally, but prolonged periods of severe stress can definitely take a toll on your body and lead to burnout. Ask yourself what’s causing your stress and whether that situation is likely to improve. If your work stressors cannot be reduced or are related to things outside your control, it might be time to make a change. These factors might include:


a clash of management styles. If your boss is a micromanager, but you feel anxious and unhappy with someone constantly looking over your shoulder, it might be time to look for a new job.
a very fast-paced environment. If you are happier in a less demanding environment, a company that expects constant, fast-paced work is likely to cause you major stress.
an increased workload with no relief. If your workload never seems to stop growing, and your manager cannot provide some kind of relief, your stress levels will continue to increase.

, If you are bored at your current job, you will not be motivated to succeed. Ask yourself whether you are ready for a new challenge. If you are, and your employer cannot provide you with new opportunities, it may be time to seek employment elsewhere.

, Many jobs present serious health risks. Whether you handle hazardous chemicals or climb tall buildings, it’s understandable to evaluate these risks and decide that you’d like to do something less dangerous. If you are no longer comfortable with the risks associated with your current job, look for a new one.

, Pursuing higher education to advance your career prospects in the long term can be a valid reason to quit your current job. Going back to school takes time and effort; it can be too demanding in addition to a full-time job.

, Both men and women should consider staying home to raise a family. It is a valid life choice to choose to stay with your children during the day rather than placing them in childcare. Do you want to be a full-time parent? If so, talk to your spouse or partner and decide if quitting your job is financially feasible.

, If you plan to relocate and will be too far away to commute to your present job, ask about your options – you may be able to telecommute. If not, then it’s time to look for a job in your new location.

, In most cases, you do not have to retire just because you have reached an appropriate age. Delaying your retirement may make good financial sense, and you may feel more comfortable if you continue to be productive. If you don’t feel ready, don’t quit your job.

, If you are considering retirement, you should talk to a professional who can help you evaluate your finances. Look at your retirement savings plan, and consider whether you will be able to get by on a set monthly income.

, Many people feel uncomfortable and unproductive just sitting at home. Consider the possibility that you will feel bored or lonely if you are not working every day. Don’t quit until you feel sure that you’d prefer not to be at work.

, Retirement is a major decision, and ideally, you and your spouse or partner should come to an agreement about when the best time for retirement might be. If you want to retire, feel financially prepared, and have discussed your plans with your partner, go ahead and quit your job.

Unsubscribe from newsletters and other communications that are not necessary for your work.
Raise the screening level of your email spam filter to keep more email out.
Send less and reply less to receive less email. It is not always necessary to reply to all emails you receive. Sometimes simply replying with a ""Thank You"" keeps the email conversation going and wastes time, long after business is concluded.

Alternatively, you can change the interval at which new emails appear in your inbox. Increasing it from every 5 minutes to every 30 minutes could save you up to 80 work interruptions each day.

Some sports centers may not be equipped to offer this care. Determine your needs before investigating centers so you clearly know what to look for. Furthermore:


Note all the consistent problem areas in your form or posture, like hunching, under/over extensions, or slouching. These issues can sometimes be cured through proper recovery techniques.
Note reoccurring pain, weakness, or lack of range of motion in any parts of your body (like the arms, legs, and neck). This information will be useful while searching for a suitable center, and will come in handy when choosing a recovery plan.;
, You can do this simply on the Internet with a general keyword search for ""sports recovery centers near me."" However, sports and health facilities and providers, like hospitals, gyms, physical therapists, and trainers, will likely also have connections to recovery centers. Ask about potential centers at these locations or with similar health and wellness providers.


You might find advertisements for potential centers in your local newspaper or in media related to your sport, like a magazine for runners, for example.
You may want to keep a list of potential centers to help keep them straight while deciding which is best for you.

, Certain recovery centers may focus on a certain activity or sport. You should prioritize centers that focus on your the area you are training, or a similar area. For example:You wouldn't likely want to join a center that focuses on tennis if you're a football player. However, a tennis recovery center might be suitable for racquetball players.

, Now that you have a list of potential centers, you should be able to easily look these up online. Find and read customer reviews for each center. Prioritize highly rated and regarded centers over low or unrated ones.


You should always take customer reviews with a grain of salt. Some companies may pay people to give a good review.Generally, you can expect national, international, and hospital affiliated recovery centers to provide reliable service.

, A face-to-face meeting will give you a chance to read the atmosphere of the center and take stock of its staff. Give preference to centers with a comfortable atmosphere and a staff that puts you at ease.


While waiting for your consultation, you may have a chance to interact with other center goers. This is a perfect chance for you to ask what they like or dislike about the center.

Remove plans with more cons than pros, and give higher priority to the list(s) with the most pros.
Some cons may be weightier than others. For example, a price difference of $10 might not be a big deal to you, but a center that is only open while you work, even if it has great plans, may be impossible.

, With your list of pros and cons this should be relatively easy. However, if you're still struggling to choose one center over another, you may want to factor atmosphere, cleanliness, equipment, and so on into your evaluation.

, Depending on your training plan, your center may recommend certain days that are best for you to come into your recovery center. Other centers may be looser with scheduling. but in any case, you should try to keep a consistent schedule for best results., Once you've decided on a recovery center and a suitable plan to facilitate your recovery, you're ready to pay. Some centers may require a membership up front, but others allow walk-in appointments as well.


Recovery centers can frequently be expensive. This is because of the specialized equipment and care provided. In some cases, you may be able to set up a payment plan with your particular center., While you might be tempted to only consider the one or two most convenient recovery centers, by shopping around to others in the area you stand a better chance of finding the best deal. Even slightly out of the way or inconvenient centers can be worth it if you save enough money.


You may want to keep a list of prices offered at potential locations on a sheet of paper or in your phone.

, Some centers may offer group rates or specials that are more affordable than a one-on-one appointment. Additionally, there may be referral bonuses, so if you train with friends or a team, you may be earn back some of the expense of enrollment by referring them., Proper health maintenance and injury prevention is covered by many types of insurance. In some cases, this may mean that some or all of your recovery center expense is covered by your insurer. Ask with your center if your insurance is accepted before choosing one.

, Coupons for sports related facilities, including recovery centers, may be offered at some gyms, hospitals, and physical therapy offices. Many centers also offer coupons online, so you should do a general online keyword search for ""coupons for "".

Know what burnout feels like.,
Know the secondary signs.,
Evaluate your job responsibilities.,
Keep a stress diary.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Fight Burnout at Work1," In a nutshell, burnout comes from working to exhaustion. It’s different from being tired: it tends to manifest as a feeling of pointlessness or despair that lasts for weeks or months. If you’re feeling no motivation for a job you used to be passionate about, that’s a reliable sign of burnout.Burnout is especially a problem for perfectionists, overachievers, and anyone else who holds themselves to really high standards.
It’s also common in high-stress or emotional fields, like counseling and some types of nonprofit work.;
, Burnout starts as emotional exhaustion, but it can very quickly affect your mental and emotional health as well. If you’re concerned about feeling burned-out, keep an eye out for signs of stress. The signs may vary depending on how your mind and body react to difficult situations, but may include some of the following.Exhaustion or insomnia.
Impaired concentration.
Anxiety and depression.
Loss of appetite.
Constant fidgeting.
Increased susceptibility to illness.

, If you’re feeling burnt-out and assign the blame to your job, look a little deeper. Are you equally exhausted by all your work duties, or does the stress come from a particular area? In some cases, you can relate your burnout to one or two tasks instead of the whole job.


Are you able to delegate some of the more stressful tasks to spread them around your team? If you only have to perform a particular duty once a week, it may bother you less.You may not be able to eliminate every stressful situation that arises at work, but you should still figure out what your stressors and priorities are.

, If you're interested in the patterns that lead to your burnout, keep record of them. Every time you feel especially stressed or exhausted at work, write down the date, cause, and effects of your feelings in a specially designated notebook. After you've been doing this for a few weeks, you can look over old entries to see if you recognize any consistencies., Stress and depression can have profoundly serious effects on your health; they aren’t just “in your head,” and you don’t have to deal with them alone. Check in with your GP about your situation at work. They may be able to help you identify your stress responses and manage them, or they may refer you to a therapist or specialist.Therapy can be helpful in managing stress and burnout, whether or not you have an official mental health diagnosis.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, helps you develop workable strategies to respond to stress and anxiety. It is often recommended to those experiencing burnout.If therapy doesn't help on its own, you may be prescribed antidepressants."

If you do not have the confirmation page, your visa may not be processed., United States embassy employees have the discretion to interview any visa applicant they want. In general, if you are 13 and younger, or if you are 80 and older, you will not have to take part in an interview. If you are between the ages of 14 and 79, you are generally required to take part in an interview.


Regardless of your age, contact the United States Embassy or Consulate in your country to determine what you will need to do.
When you contact your local Embassy or Consulate, you will schedule an interview. Wait times for these interviews vary depending on your location, the time of year, and what type of visa you are applying for.

However, a visa does not guarantee you entry into the United States. Once you travel to a port-of-entry, you will need to request permission to enter., When you reach the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) checkpoint at your port-of-entry, you will need to present your passport and visa for inspection. The officials working at these checkpoints have the ultimate authority to permit or deny your entrance.

Test your speed.,
Try ball drills.,
Try agility drills.,
Perform eye exercises.",How to Improve Reaction Speed1," You can get a timer and test your speed on a variety of tasks. How long does it take you to catch a falling object? How long does it take you to make a decision given certain information? Or, more intangibly, how many balls do you drop or miss in a certain sport? Try to keep the variables as similar as possible in order to get the best results., If you are practicing for a sport, get the ball for that sport and play a game of catch, kick, or another sport-related drill. You could also get creative and use the ball for a different sport. Try to add additional partners, if needed, to make it more challenging. For example, if you are a baseball catcher, have your partner throw the ball behind you and then see how fast you can turn around and retrieve it.You could even try out juggling. As the balls fly through the air this forces you to act quickly in order to catch them. Practicing regularly can decrease your response time and increase your speed.You can also use a reaction ball. This is a small ball with six sides that will move in unpredictable ways when bounced or thrown., Place some cones at a distance apart and run between them as fast as you can. Switch up the position of the cones or run in a different way to mix things up. If you are playing a sport, ask your coach to suggest some specific agility drills that you can do., Your eyes can also lag behind the rest of your body when it comes to reaction speed. To get them up to speed, choose two similar objects and place one nearby and another at a distance. Rotate between the two, trying to read each of them. You can also ask your eye doctor for other exercises.You can also discuss eye agility training with a sports vision specialist. To find a doctor near you, go to the American Optometric Association’s website and do a doctor search."

Talk to your boss.,
Go to Human Resources.,
Manage relationships with peers and employees.,
Seek other opportunities within your job.,
Vary your work routine.,
Focus on your own responsibilities.,
Consider taking an extended leave of absence.,
Look for a new job.",How to Fight Burnout at Work2," If your boss is sympathetic, they will want to know that you need support. (Especially if you work in a high-stress field, you will probably not be the first person they have met to suffer burnout.) Depending on your relationship with your boss, you can bring up burnout in a standing meeting, or set up another meeting to discuss it. Focus on creating solutions together, not complaining, and remember that everyone needs support at work at one point or another.You may say something like ""I've been finding it hard to focus on counseling others, because I continue to think about our students' problems when I go home. Do you have advice about maintaining a good work-life balance?""
If you're having trouble managing expectations, you may also say ""I feel like I'm having trouble managing expectations and accomplishing everything that's expected of me in the time I have. Can we review my job description again and prioritize my duties?

, If your burnout is due to an external problem--or if your boss is a contributing factor--you may want to skip talking to your boss and shoot an email to HR instead. Again, it’s important to focus on the problem at hand and at finding ways to cope, instead of just dumping your frustrations., Of course, it isn't only entry-level workers who can struggle with burnout: it can happen to those who are managing or working alongside others, as well. The good news is that when you're in a position of power, it can be easier to set boundaries. Express your needs as clearly as possible, and make it a priority to help the folks you manage learn to manage themselves independently.


If a particular coworker is cramping your style by visiting your cubicle when you are working, bring up your problem when they do it.Say politely but firmly, ""I'm working to meet a deadline right now, but I'd be happy to chat with you about that this afternoon.""
If you're struggling with inefficiency in your employees, meet with them and try to work out a time-management plan. This will help them work better without you having to micromanage.

, Ask your boss if you can shake things up by focusing on different projects for a while. You can even put in for a transfer or a promotion, or simply a move from one department to another.


Those facing nonprofit burnout can look into volunteering in a different department. For instance, if you work in development at a refugee resettlement agency, you might find clarity and focus by volunteering to mentor a newly-arrived refugee for an hour a week.
If you’re looking to apply for a job within the same company, make sure to give your boss a heads-up., If your hands are tied and you have to keep working on the same projects, you can still shake your day up. Check in with your boss about different ways in which you can complete old projects in new ways. A new routine can be a refreshing jolt to your creativity.Work from home or a coffee shop if you’re focused on writing or other flexible pursuits.
If you have to stay in the office, see if you can work in a different room, cubicle, or conference room.
Do tasks in a different order than you might otherwise.

, Your job might be stressful enough on its own; if you feel responsible for other peoples’ workloads, too, that makes your day even harder. If you’re a manager, do your best to strike the balance of making sure your employees get their work done without you doing it for them.


Don’t feel like you have to say yes constantly. If someone asks you for a favor and you really don’t have time, it’s perfectly fine to tell them that you can’t help at the moment.If you have an enormous workload that seems insurmountable, it often really helps to write down all your duties and prioritize them (on paper).Limit this list to your tasks--no one else’s!

, Some jobs may offer non-paid time off or leaves of absence, which are a wonderful way to get out of the rat race if you’re feeling desperate. If a leave of absence sounds like a relief, check your employee handbook to learn about your organization’s policies.In many cases, leaves of absence are unpaid. Make sure you can survive a certain period of time without a steady income.

, Sometimes different responsibilities in a new setting is what it takes to fight work burnout. If you really can’t bear the idea of continuing to work at your organization, consider trying to lock down a different job.


Be careful if you’re still employed. Depending on your relationship with your boss, you may want to give them a gentle heads-up that you’re seeking new employment.When looking for a new job, it’s important to keep in mind what bothered you about your last job, whether that’s long hours or abrasive clients. This way, you know what to avoid.

Take short mental breaks.,
Eat right.,
Get some rest.,
Work out to relieve stress.,
Plan some time off.,
Socialize outside of work.",How to Fight Burnout at Work3," Just as your body would get exhausted if you walked for eight hours without a break, your brain will get tired if you stare at a computer screen all day. Step away from your desk and do something that doesn’t have to do with work. If you’re able to, some experts recommend taking a five-minute power break for every hour and a half of desk work.Bring a book or a craft project, like cross-stitch, to refresh your mind.
Walk around the office or outside.
If it’s cold or rainy, grab a coffee and head to the break room for a quick respite.

, A proper diet will keep you physically fit and help you cope with the stress of work burnout. Protein, carbs and fat will keep you energized and awake. Food is also a psychological tool, and looking forward to your lunch might be enough to buoy you through a tough morning. Never underestimate the power of a delicious sandwich to brighten your day.


Packing lunch gives you control over your diet, and saves money. For best results, assemble your meal the night before work, and bring it to the office with you in the morning.Find a healthy deli or diner near your work. It may become a new social hub for you and your coworkers.
Snack on healthy proteins and fats. Try nuts, string cheese, or even beef jerky.Coffee can help, but don’t over-caffeinate. Too much caffeine can give you the jitters, and even exacerbate anxiety.If you’re burnt out, that’s just what you don’t need.

, Different people need different amounts of sleep, but many adults have one thing in common: they simply don’t get enough. If you want your mind and body to work as well as they can for you, make time in your schedule to recharge.Eight hours of sleep is the stereotypical golden standard for adults; you may need more or less, but set a sleep schedule and stick to it.

, Many people who are feeling anxious, depressed, or burnt out find that adding exercise to their schedule helps them blow off steam.There are all kinds of sports and workout plans out there--even if you don’t think of yourself as athletic, there’s probably some physical activity (like biking or hiking) that you like.


Yoga is one of the most well-known exercises for managing mental turmoil. You can start practicing at a gym or studio, but there are plenty of internet resources that will help you do yoga in your own home. Many of them are even based around managing stress., If all else fails, get out of the office for a little while. Use your vacation or personal days, and instead of spending them in bed, get out and see the world. Make sure to check in with your boss or HR department to confirm that you’re taking time off correctly.


Take a weekend trip to a new place.
Do a staycation with friends and treat your city the way a tourist might., Despite the way you may feel when you’re in the depths of burnt-out despair, there is life outside your job. Spending time with the people you care about outside of work will remind you of that. If you avoid taking work home with you (when possible), you may find that your home and social life recharge you enough to focus more on work when you’re actually at the office.


Hang out with your relatives as much as possible. Whether you’re blowing bubbles with your kids or your grandmother, your family’s love can do a lot to ground you.Meet a friend you haven’t seen in a while for coffee.
If you’re having trouble making friends outside the office--maybe you just moved to a new city and don’t know anyone--don’t feel bad. Try joining a meetup group that relates to one of your interests."

Keep it fun.",How to Help Your Child to Start Being Active," Suggest that you and children walk to school instead of driving each day if this is an option for you. This will help get them off to an active start every morning. Not only is this great for the environment and for alleviating traffic congestion during the rush to and from school, it is also a great wake-up exercise and an opportunity for children to make friends.You could also encourage your children to ride their bikes to school.;
, There is no reason why you cannot develop an activity that is based on your child's television or computer game interests. For example, if your child loves Disney Princesses why not work together to write a little play to act out about that very subject? There are many other ways to do this, you just need to apply a little imagination to get them away from the television.If your child loves playing video games, encourage them to play games that involve movement – like dancing video games, bowling video games, tennis video games, or other types of video games that promote movement and activity.
Alternatively, if you allow your child to watch television, you could tell them to do something active during the commercial breaks (like jumping jacks or running in place).

, If you have a dog, talk to your child about what dogs love to do and what makes them happy. This includes things like going for walks and chasing balls. This could be a very simple and rewarding way to get your child into the open air as well as the opportunity for some quality family time.It doesn't even need to be a dog. Cleaning out the fish tank can easily be re-defined from a routine chore to something that your child is doing to make the fish happy.

, Aerobic exercises are important for an active lifestyle because they make your heart and lungs work harder than they normally do when you are being less active. This will help your child build endurance and it helps your child’s body deliver oxygen to its cells more efficiently.Kids should get around 60 minutes of aerobic activity per day. Some examples of aerobic exercises include:


Swimming
Running
Skating or skateboarding
Dancing
Riding bikes

, Building up muscle is crucial for children because their bodies are developing and they need muscles to perform everyday activities. Having strong muscles will help them live longer, healthier lives. This type of exercise should be done at least three times per week. Some examples of muscle-strengthening activities include:Push-ups, sit-ups, or pull-ups
Gymnastics
Climbing

, Strong bones are necessary for the general health and well-being of your child. Strong bones allow children to grow and get taller. This type of exercise should be done at least three times per week. Some examples of bone-strengthening activities include:

Running
Jumping rope
Playing basketball, volleyball, or tennis
Skipping

, There might be real underlying psychological reasons that may explain why your child is not active rather than just “laziness.” Talk to your child about why it’s important to be active in life and try to find out if there is a reason they have been avoiding active behaviors.


Make sure your child is physically healthy enough for exercise. Check with your child's doctor if you have concerns about your child's health that may affect his or her ability to be active.
It could also be that your child does not feel they can participate in sports or other pursuits because of a perceived lack of skill, embarrassment, or they are being bullied. That needs to be addressed before you can begin to encourage your child to be more active.

, If exercise is a regular part of your weekly routine, your child will learn to incorporate it into their life as well. Your child will accept that active exercise will be expected of them on a regular basis.For example, if your child knows that every Saturday morning the family takes a trip to the park and several evenings a week you will go on walks together, they will be less likely to protest.

, If you are active yourself, your message is more likely to have an impact on your child. It doesn't need to be anything high energy. It could be going for a walk, doing some DIY, any pursuit that sees you spend less time on the couch., If you are wanting your child to become more active, telling them this with the television constantly blaring is going to dilute any attempt you might try to make., Make the decision to be active about your child and their desires, not about what you want. You should try not force your child to do something they will actively hate just because you think they should do it. This will only have a negative effect on them and in some cases make them more determined to play their computer games.


Encouragement through understanding your child's interests has to be central to what you are trying to achieve. Only that way will your child begin to understand that they want to do a given activity for themselves and not to please you.

, Perceived “laziness” could, in some cases, be explained by your child simply not knowing what activities are available for them to do. They may need some guidance or suggestions as to what active events they can participate in. Let your child know what activities are available to them so that they can make a decision about what activity they would like to participate in.


Of course, not all families have the same financial situation, which could limit opportunities for recreation. If you can’t afford to pay for sports classes for your child, try to take advantage of programs in your community. Your local city council or local authority will usually have a program of free events that you can show your child.
However, having too many opportunities to participate in may cause confusion and lead to inactivity in your child. In these cases you may need to talk to your child to help them tease out what it is they would most like to do.

, Children are more likely to be active if they enjoy the activity. Try to incorporate fun into your active lifestyle by introducing games and other exciting elements to keep them engaged and interested in the activities.Playing sports, going on walks, going to the park, and engaging in active games with your children (instead of leaving them to play on their own) are great ways to keep the activities fun.Make sure that you are encouraging your child to have some play time outside whenever the weather is nice enough for it.

Buy or find a stationary bike.,
Adjust the seat to the proper level before beginning.,
Start by cycling at a low resistance for 20 to 30 minutes for the first few weeks.,
Increase your resistance every week, as long as your body is comfortable with this increase and it does not produce prolonged muscle soreness.,
Rotate your workouts.,
Try to do programmed workouts of either endurance or intervals, if you have a computerized stationary bike.,
Set weekly or monthly goals.",How to Improve Fitness by Biking1," You should have daily access to the bike in order to improve your fitness, and if you live in a snowy climate this may be the best option. There are a number of models that you should choose to use based on your overall health.


You should choose a recumbent bike if you have any back problems. Stationary bikes are usually very easy on the joints and they are considered a low-impact workout, unless you have severe knee problems. A recumbent bike allows you to sit up straight while pedaling and holding on to handles by the seat or by the computer monitor.
You can choose an upright bike if you don't have any back problems. You will lean over and put your hands on handles near the computer monitor. An upright bike can also help to strengthen your core muscles as long as you use it properly, by flexing your core as you bike.
Look for a gym with spinning classes, if you like to use upright bikes and you are very serious about cycling or losing weight. During these 30 to 90 minute classes, an instructor tells you when to speed up and slow down, hoping to optimize the calories you burn.;
, You should be able to almost reach full extension as you pedal. Become accustomed to the controls, such as the resistance or incline on the machine.

, Many people do this by listening to a podcast or watching their favorite sitcom. You can get used to sitting properly in the bike by starting slowly.


Studies show that books, television and some other distractions will lower the intensity of your workout. However, it may extend the time you spend on the machine as long as you make a goal to stay on the bike for the duration of the show.

, Aim to cycle every other day at the beginning and walk for 30 minutes on your days off.

, Aim to work on speed 1 day, by sprinting and resting frequently. In the next workout, aim to increase your endurance by pedaling for 30 or more minutes, or increasing your time even further.


Workout rotation will improve 2 types of fitness, aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic is often called cardiovascular fitness, and it is of a low-enough intensity that your lungs can provide your blood and muscles with enough oxygen to complete the workout. It improves your heart and your lungs. Anaerobic exercise, most often used in sprinting, also uses stores in your muscles and increases the strength and condition of your muscle tone and mass.
Even if you are cycling at a low resistance, increase your resistance by a level and sprint for 20 seconds. Do that 8 times during your workout. This will increase your overall fitness level over time.

, Wait until you feel that you have been cycling for at least a month, improving your resistance, so that you can keep the proper postures while you do the workout.

, You may want to be able to cycle for 30 minutes at the highest resistance or cycle for 60 minutes at a time. Whatever your goals are, they will help to improve your overall fitness by improving your heart, lungs and muscle tone.

Build something or make a craft.",How to Improve Eye Hand Coordination," Grab some coloring books and crayons and color away. While this may bring you back to childhood, it will also improve hand-eye coordination. It is a creative way to control your hands and fingers to do what your eyes coordinate them to do within the confines of the page.


Use markers or colored pencils. Instead of a coloring book, grab a sketch pad and draw your own pictures to color.;
, Video games require hand skills to execute the desired task to play the game, using motor skills with visual perception. Play a game that requires precision timing, a sensitive touch and detail and you will find your hand-eye skill increases (for example: Tomb Raider 2013 because of its timing parts). Playing video games may even help surgeons perfect their skill in the operating room.

, This requires picking up specific pieces to analyze which ones fit together, using and improving both hand-eye coordination and reasoning skills. An even more challenging jigsaw puzzle that will improve hand eye coordination is the 3D jigsaw puzzle.

, It requires hand-eye skill to hit a ball with a bat. Playing catch has the same effect. If you know how to improve eye hand coordination, you can become better at your chosen sport.

, The concept of hitting a ball with the racquet is the same as hitting a ball with a bat except you also have to factor in your opponent's moves as well.

, If you are afraid of getting hit by your opponent, while this is good motivation to learn hand-eye skill, use boxing bags that move instead. Trying to hit a moving bag will improve hand-eye coordination.

, Use sticks, blocks or toothpicks to build a model. Try crafts such as crocheting, needlepoint or any craft kit you can find at the store. Mold clay or try your hand at pottery.

Practice making quick decisions.,
Learn to speed read.,
Play brain games.,
Play video games.,
Chew something.,
Recognize the importance of speed.,
Minimize distractions.",How to Improve Reaction Speed2," In your everyday life, try to consciously speed up your decision making. If you feel yourself delaying or taking too much time, tell yourself, “faster, faster,” until you make a final move. Repeating this process will also help you to get used to the stress associated with quick decisions. You will learn how to keep your cool., Time yourself reading single pages to see how long it takes to make it through. Then, see if you can cut down the seconds while still comprehending the material. Do this with a variety of types of reading to keep your mind flexible. You can also take a speed reading course online or at a local college.Another way to practice speed reading is to glance through a page and mark out a single letter at a time. So, take a pencil and cross out every “a” on a single page. Do the same with other letters until you feel your speed increasing.

, There are a number of sites online that offer brain training. However, be careful that you don’t simply train the same way over and over again, or your mind will adapt and you’ll lose your edge. Instead, try old fashioned brain training methods, such as playing cards or a computer game.You can also look at a sequence of numbers and try to memorize them. Then, see how long you can remember the numbers and write them back down correctly.

, Get a game console and some action video games and play for 30 minutes a day. The fast placed nature of the gaming can increase your brain’s ability to process information. The gaming environment may also force you to get used to making quick decisions based on limited information.People who play action video games show an up to 25 percent speed increase in decision making when compared to people who do not play.

, Get a pack of gum and chew it when you know you need to be quick. Or, grab a handful of sunflower seeds. It has been suggested that chewing stimulates the muscles in your mouth and jaw, which then send additional blood and activity up to your brain. You only need to chew for 10 seconds for an initial effect to occur and you’ll get a boost for at least 15 minutes.The benefits of this step are often not viewable to the naked eye and are measured in milliseconds of difference. However, for athletes in particular, shaving down even small amounts of time can have a positive effect.

, This is essentially the process of getting your head in the game. Sit and think about how you need to be fast and accurate in your upcoming task. Mentally go through all of the preparations that you have done. Approaching a task in a calm, precise manner can help you to harness your stress nerves and put them to good use.Reminding yourself that you are in control can also lower the possibility of mistakes born out of nervousness, such as jumping the starting line.

, If you are working on something that requires concentration and speed, try to eliminate all other things that might grab your attention. If you are driving in bad conditions and need to react quickly, then you might turn off the radio and talk less with the car’s passengers."

Exercise.,
Eat right.,
Get enough sleep.,
Drink caffeine.,
Monitor your medications.",How to Improve Reaction Speed3," To stay mentally and physically quick, you must take care of yourself. Exercise at least three times a week, more if possible. Exercise increases blood flow to your entire body, including your brain. , Eat healthy, balanced, and consistent meals. Eating right gives your body the fuel needed to perform at its best. Eggs and spinach, for example, are super foods for the brain. They both contain the amino acid tyrosine, which has been shown to increase reaction speeds.Conversely, drinking alcohol or using illegal substances can slow your reaction speeds down.

, If you are tired, you will probably respond to any external stimuli in a sluggish way. Make sure to get at least eight hours of good, solid, undisturbed sleep a night. This will allow you to stay alert for longer periods., It is very tempting to down a cup of coffee whenever you need speed and focus on a task. However, this can backfire. Caffeine can help to boost your response times, but it must be used in a controlled way. Stick to one cup prior to working on a task requiring quick responses. Otherwise, you might get jittery and less focused., Some medications can slow down your response time and reflexes. Or, you may even experience dizziness or blurred vision. If you need a high reaction speed, make sure to talk to your pharmacist or your doctor about how your medications might impact your abilities.This is an especially important step to follow if you are about to drive a motor vehicle. Even in good conditions, you’ll want to have sharp reflexes.

Make sure to bike for at least 30 minutes 2 to 3 times per week to improve fitness performance.,
Time yourself as you cycle.",How to Improve Fitness by Biking2," It is important that the seat, the handle bars and the pedals are all at the right length and levels for your body. You are more likely to lose your balance and hurt yourself if the bike does not fit you properly.

, Biking comes with rules and regulations related to turning and biking on paths. You should learn the proper etiquette before cycling around a town or in the country.

You will have a number of bikes to choose from, including mountain, cruising, road and recumbent bikes. Explain your current level and the ways you plan to use the bike to the people in the shop to make sure you are buying the right model.







, Riding a bike is dangerous if you do not have the proper confidence and balance. Before attempting to ride fast or around curves and hills, you must be comfortable with gear changes and braking.


One of the main fitness benefits of road cycling is that it improves your coordination.

, This is a great way to get into condition with a low-level aerobic workout without noticing it is a workout. Cycling to and from work will also help reduce stress and help you sleep better at night having worked your body harder during the day.

, Cycling 20 to 30 miles (32 to 48 km) or more can help to build your endurance. These rides often include hills, which work your body in a similar way as sprinting because you must increase your pace to overcome the obstacle.

, Cycling is best when combined with other workouts that involve your upper body. Although biking improves the core, it concentrates the workout on your gluteal, quadriceps, hamstring and calf muscles.

, You should get faster as you cycle more often. Aim to get to your destination just a few minutes faster every week to improve lung capacity and heart health.

Be realistic about your kid.,
Give your child a say.,
Consider coaches and commitment.,
Watch for signs of stress.,
Look into other options.,
Make sure it’s fun.,
Talk about the benefits of sports.,
Be a positive influence.,
Coach, don’t criticize.,
Accept quitting with conditions.",How to Help Your Child Enjoy Sports," Many a parent wants to believe that they have the next tennis champion or basketball star for a child, but the odds of a child growing up to achieve athletic fame and fortune is remote at best. There is no reason to crush their dreams of eventual sports glory at a young age, but you should also realistically assess their physical and emotional gifts as you help guide them into trying certain sports.For instance, a short, stocky kid may not be ideally suited to basketball, while a tall, lanky kid may not have the easiest time with gymnastics. Children who are overweight or not at an ideal fitness level may find more enjoyment (at least initially) in sports with less running demands — baseball as opposed to soccer, for instance. That said, plenty of short kids love playing basketball, so don’t go overboard with your assumptions.;
, Maybe you love hockey, and have longed to see your kid out on the ice, doing the things you never got the chance to do. Don’t let your vicarious athletic dreams get in the way of actually asking your child what sports he or she wants to play, however. A child who has a say in the process is more likely to enjoy and stick with a sport.It is often around age thirteen or so that some kids get “burnout” from the sports they’ve played, leading them to want to quit one or more sports and perhaps try others. No matter the age of your kid, prepare for ups and downs in regards to interest in particular sports, and accept his or her desire to try something new every so often., Once you’ve worked with your child to determine which sport or sports he or she will play, you can do some additional homework regarding the best situation for your child. Look into the skill level and time commitment expected in one league compared to another, and even consider the personalities of particular coaches.For instance, if your kid is just starting to “dip his toes” into basketball, he or she may find the extensive commitment required to be on a travel team that ventures widely each weekend to be too much. Perhaps a recreational league at your local YMCA or another such option may be a better choice.
Likewise, if you know your child is unlikely to enjoy playing for a hard-nosed coach who criticizes regularly, you may want to look into other options. Of course, one of the benefits of sports is learning to deal with adversity, so don’t go too far in trying to shield them from every possible discomfort.

, Stress can be a positive thing, spurring us to achieve things we didn’t know we could do, whether in academics, athletics, or otherwise. However, excessive stress will impede enjoyment and success in a sport, and can easily bleed into other areas beyond the athletic field as well. Preventing and dealing with negative stress will make it much more likely for your child to enjoy sports.If your kid keeps making up excuses why he or she can’t go to practice, never seems able to crack a smile during a game, performs below capabilities when the pressure is on, or begins having seemingly-unrelated difficulties with academics, social interactions, etc., stress may be overwhelming him or her.
If you believe stress is a problem, talk to your child about keeping things in perspective. Look into stress management exercises like deep breathing, muscle relaxation, and visualization. Consider whether your child is involved in too many sports, or needs to consider switching sports.

, In the end, some kids simply don’t enjoy sports, or team sports in particular. Despite the benefits of experiencing a team dynamic, the problems may simply outweigh them. In such cases, you may need to seek out other options for your child, at least for the benefit of his or her health and fitness.If team sports are simply not in the cards for your child, look into sports with more of an individual focus, like tennis or golf. If the competitive aspect is more of a problem, emphasize aerobic exercises like swimming, running, or biking for the health benefits.

, Most kids who enjoy sports want to be with their friends, get a nice uniform to wear, and have lots of fun. A kid who isn’t having fun isn’t likely to enjoy playing a sport, and is more likely to quit or resist. If you have one of the rare sports prodigies out there, your priorities may be a bit different, but for the most part your primary goal should be to help make sports fun for your child.Let your child know that it is good to want to win, and to try your best to win, but that you should be able to have fun win or lose. Don’t talk about the results of the game as much as the fun your child had during it.

, Talk to a reluctant child about why you are encouraging him or her to play sports. Don’t make it seem like you’re just forcing them to try something without a good explanation. Let your kid know about your own positive experiences playing sports, but place the primary focus on the good things being active in sports can offer him or her.


You probably already know that sports can help teach important qualities like motivation, discipline, commitment, cooperation, perseverance, and resiliency. Talk to your kid about how developing these skills can help with schoolwork, making friends, dealing with good and bad days, and other day-to-day experiences. Don’t forget to mention the health benefits as well — things like increased energy, for instance., Some parents seem like they can’t help but try to relive their athletic lives through their children. Perhaps they see an opportunity to achieve the success they could not quite reach. This can lead to pushing a kid to start or keep playing a certain sport, shouting negative comments during games, and harsh criticism afterward. Allow your child to play the sport for him or herself, and be vigilant about remaining a positive, supporting influence.After a bad game, don’t let the first thing out of your mouth be “How could you drop that fly ball?” Instead, take a positive, instructive track: “I like how you hustled after the ball when things went wrong and kept your head in the game.” Offer a little one-on-one practice time. Let your kid know that effort is more important than results. “Winning is everything” is for the pros.

, Coaches for kids’ teams should be instructors and cheerleaders, not drill sergeants. If you are coaching your kid’s team, or are evaluating potential coaches for your kid, look for a ratio of at least three positive comments (“Way to go!” “Great effort!”) for every one constructive criticism (“Let’s work together on that free-throw motion some more.”)Don’t be afraid to talk to your kid’s coach if he or she is being too negative or is sapping the fun from the game. Some youth coaches can get caught up in the “tough guy” image they think coaches are supposed to have, and can lose sight of themselves. Sometimes, it may just be best to remove your child from the team and find a better situation. If so, explain why this is necessary and is not the same as “quitting.”

, Sometimes, despite your best efforts and those of your child, you’ll find that a certain sport is simply a bad fit. If your child really wants to quit, first talk about the importance of sticking things out for the rest of the season, as a way to honor the commitment he or she made to his or her teammates. Immediate quitting should be saved whenever possible for times when your child’s physical or emotional health is being affected.Be clear with your child that if he or she does quit, that time needs to be replaced with a beneficial activity — not sitting on the couch. Consider other sports, or some other type of physical activity — a dance class, ice skating lessons, etc.

Hydrate properly.",How to Get Rid Of Man Breasts Through Exercise," Do some strength training exercises that can help boost your chest muscles. Adding muscle also speeds up your metabolism and helps you burn more fat, which may reduce the amount of tissue in your chest area.You can choose to do weight lifting exercises such as pec flyes or use your own body weight with moves such as pushups to sculpt your chest muscles and burn excess calories and fat.


Perform one set of eight to 12 reps of each exercise to start. Gradually build up to three sets as you get stronger.Keep in mind it is impossible to ""spot treat"" weight loss — that is, you can't lose fat in just one specific area. Doing a ton of chest exercises may give you really great pecs, but may not affect the fat that covers the muscle. That's why it is important to combine strength training with cardio, too.;
, One of the most effective ways to sculpt your chest muscles is by doing push-ups and variations of them. Push-ups target your chest muscles and the smaller muscles around your chest area. In addition, they can help build back and abdominal muscles, which can help you slim down overall.Get into a plank pose. Keep your arms straight and your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Bend at your elbows and lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor. Remember to keep your abs and leg muscles engaged.
Try half-plank, or knee, push-ups if you are unable to do push-ups in a plank position. To do this, start on your hands and knees instead of the plank position, then adjust so that your head, torso, and knees are all in a straight line.Aim to get your groin, chest, and chin to touch the ground at approximately the same time. Your hips should not bend.
Consider adding push-up variations such as military push-ups, chest squeeze push-ups, and archer push-ups after three to four weeks to give your chest a new challenge.

, Pressing any amount of weight up from your chest can also help to strengthen your chest muscles. From chest presses to bench presses, doing a variety of these exercises can help you define chest muscles.Lie on your back on a bench with a weighted bar or dumbbells to do chest presses. Hold the weight at your lower ribs, bend your elbows, and press up until your arms are straight. Stay at the top for one second and then slowly lower your arms back to your original position. Start with 5 lbs. (2.3 5kg) and work up to more weight once your form is good and you can safely finish three sets of 10 repetitions at the current weight. This allows not just the muscles but also the connective tissues in your shoulders, elbows and wrists to strengthen and support more weight.
Try different presses every three to four weeks to challenge your muscles. You can choose from a variety of options such as incline or decline presses, neck bench presses, dumbbell around the world, close grip bench presses, and squeeze presses.

, Pulling your arms together, which is called a flye (or fly), is another great way to sculpt your chest muscles.Lie on your back or stand at a slight incline. Use two 5 lb. (2.3 kg) weights and hold one in each hand, arms extended straight above your chest with your palms facing each other. Slowly open your arms wide, as though spreading your wings. Then slowly bring your arms back up.
You can perform flyes using a resistance band, too. Stand and anchor the band at about hip-height (try wrapping it around a column or door handle), holding one end in each hand. Start with your arms open, then bring your hands together in front of your chest, then slowly open again.
Vary your flye routine every three to four weeks to challenge your chest muscles. Try incline or decline flyes, cable flyes, and even single arm variations.

, Although weight training can build muscle mass — which consumes more calories and therefore increases your metabolism and improves your physique — this cannot be viewed as getting rid of excess tissue in a specific spot. You’ll need to be more active throughout the day and do some type of cardiovascular exercise. Simple changes like walking instead of driving or taking the stairs instead of the elevator can help you burn calories and fat. Consider wearing a pedometer to count how far you walk in a day.

, Combining weight training with cardiovascular exercise and a healthy diet can help you get rid of excess body fat, including in the chest area. Sensible weight loss is one to two pounds per week. Doing some type of exercise or activity five to six days a week can help you meet overall weight loss goals and get rid of excess breast tissue more quickly.Do least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity every week. Aim for at least 30 minutes of daily cardio to reduce breast tissue. Break up your workouts up into manageable sections if you’re just starting. For example, try two 15-minute workouts.
Choose activities that challenge your body and that you enjoy. It may take a little trial and error to find what works and what you like. Consider activities such as walking, jogging or running, rowing, swimming, or biking. You can also use machines such as an elliptical, stair trainer, or rowing machine. Keep in mind that team sports, running outside with your kids, or even activities like jumping rope or on a trampoline count towards your weekly exercise.

, Boot camps, spin, aerobics, and cardio burn classes that use free weights and other equipment are a great way to start building muscle and reducing fat in all areas of the body. They can also motivate you if you have a hard time doing workouts alone. Sign up for a class that you do three to four times per week, with a day of rest in between. These classes often have the added benefit of teaching you proper form, which you can apply when you work out at home or on the go.

, Make sure to see your doctor before you start any weight lifting or weight loss program. This is especially important if you’re doing so to get rid of man breasts. Your doctor will check to see if you have a condition known as gynecomastia, which causes male breast tissue to grow and is the result of a hormonal imbalance. Gynecomastia can also indicate a more serious disease such as male breast cancer.Let your doctor know why you scheduled the appointment. Give her information about when you first noticed the excess breast tissues, if you’ve had any pain, and if you’ve put on weight. Depending on the examination and any tests you may have, your doctor could diagnose you with gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia, which happens as a result of fat deposits without an underlying hormonal imbalance.Listen to your doctor’s advice on treatment for either condition. In most cases, men with mild gynecomastia and pseudogynecomastia can use diet and exercise to reduce fat deposits in their chests. Your doctor may ask to see you every three to six months to ensure that you don’t have any underlying conditions., Just as getting exercise is important to ridding yourself of excess tissue on your chest, so is rest. In fact, getting insufficient rest can cause you to gain weight. Giving yourself a rest day or two every week and getting at least seven hours of sleep per night can help you lose weight and unwanted fat on your chest.Take at least one rest day every week. This promotes muscle building and recovery. A rest day doesn't mean you just sit on the couch, however. Try something gentle and restorative, like yoga or a leisurely walk, on these days.
Aim for eight to nine hours of sleep every night and get no less than seven hours. Grab a 30 minute nap if you’re tired during the day., Calories play an important part of how much weight you lose, which is why it’s important to eat three balanced and healthy meals every day. Choosing whole, nutrient-rich foods can help you lose weight and gradually excess tissue on your chest.Eat 500 – 1,000 calories less than your current caloric intake. This is a good rule of thumb to follow when cutting calories and losing weight sensibly. Do not eat fewer than 1,500 calories a day because this can be harmful to your health and slow your metabolism, which will make you feel miserable and impede weight loss., As a part of your daily diet, get food from the five food groups of fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy. Vary your selections to get the widest range of nutrients. Healthy foods generally have a lot of fiber, which can keep food cravings at bay.Try whole fruits and vegetables including strawberries, apples, blackberries, spinach, and sweet potatoes. Eat whole grains including whole wheat pasta or bread, brown rice, cereal, or oatmeal. Eat lean cuts of meat like chicken, fish, and pork as well as cooked beans, nut butters and eggs for protein. Eat low-fat cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, and drink cow and nut milks for your dairy.

, Junk food often tastes great and comforts people, but if you’re trying to lose weight and get rid of fatty tissue on your chest, it is your worst enemy. Junk and unhealthy foods have high fat and calorie content, which hinder weight loss, and offer very little nutritional value.


Stay away from starchy foods made out of refined carbohydrates like white bread, pasta, rice, and baked goods. Avoiding these foods altogether or replacing them with healthy, whole grain alternatives can help you lose weight.Look for hidden sugar in your food by reading product labels. Sugar can also contribute to weight gain. If you see terms including corn syrup, sucrose, dextrose, fructose, or maltose, try and avoid the product.

, Eating healthy to lose and maintain weight is something you should do for your lifetime. If you’re trying to lose weight, you might be excited to completely overhaul your diet; however, this might cause you to revert to bad eating habits later. Gradually changing can help good habits stick for life and may keep you from developing excess tissue on your chest again.


Start by swapping unhealthy choices for whole foods. For example, eat brown rice instead of white rice. Add more vegetables to your plate than meat or carbs. Try air-popped popcorn instead of eating potato chips. If you’re looking for crunch, try carrots or cut veggies.
Allow yourself one cheat day every week to keep cravings at bay and minimize the risk of overindulgence.But remember that a cheat day doesn't mean making up the extra calories you cut out during the week. A cheat day means allowing yourself a moderate to small sized portion of a food you have cut out of your diet. For example, on your cheat day you might allow yourself one piece of fried chicken and a tablespoonful of potato salad with your green leaf salad and veggies.

, One way to track calories and make sure you’re getting enough nutrients is to write a meal plan. This can also help you from falling back into bad eating habits.Write a plan that includes three meals and two snacks daily. Have different foods at each meal. For example, have cup of non-fat Greek yogurt with fresh berries, one slice of whole wheat toast with sugar-free jam, and black coffee for breakfast. Build a salad with different vegetables, grilled chicken, and a homemade vinaigrette for lunch. Have cut veggies for a snack. For dinner, try salmon with a small salad and a side of steamed mixed vegetables. If you want dessert, have apple slices sprinkled with cinnamon.
Make sure to anticipate any meals you may have at restaurants. Consult online menus or call ahead to a restaurant see what healthy choices they offer. Choose a couple of different healthy options and write these on your plan. Avoid caloric pitfalls like buffets, bread baskets, dishes with heavy sauces, and fried foods., If you’re eating healthy and doing exercise, it’s important to get enough water every day. This can promote weight loss and your overall wellbeing. Aim to get about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of liquids every day if you are a woman and 13 cups (3 liters) of liquids if you are a man, or even more if you are active.Avoid high-calorie beverages like soda, juice cocktails, specialty coffees, and alcohol. Instead, choose non-calorie beverages like tea, plain coffee, and sparkling water.

, Put the ball in the net on the end of your stick. Place your dominant hand at the neck of the stick and your other hand at the bottom of the lacrosse stick. Now you need to rotate your dominant hand up and down. Once you have mastered this process, do so with your non-dominant hand. As you practice this, switch back and forth from hand to hand. Now you can then go to a one handed cradling.

, This is done just as you would throw a ball. Raise your non-throwing arm up to point where you throw. Raise your throwing arm up. Reach back and throw. To catch the ball, you need to do so with soft fingers. Imagine you are a coil and let the net absorb the ball's energy. Do not reach for the ball. Finally, finish with a cradle and pass.

, This will provide you greater experience and interaction with other girls you may play with or against in high school.

, They can teach you new things that you haven't learned before. They also give expose you to the college recruitment process. When you come back home, you can share your new skills with girls who didn't have the same opportunity to attend those camps. This is always a benefit to your team and will help you become more valuable as a team member.

, Tell him you want to play at the college level and that you would like him to start helping you get to the next level. Ask him/her to critique your current level of play. Learn from the suggestions that the coach can provide.

, This will be handy for college coaches looking for film footage. It is important to highlight your technique, effort, and good characteristics.

, Once you have gotten an offer, you should look at the school. You should visit and see what they have to offer and whether you like the campus. If you do not like it, then do not accept.

, Once you have accepted your offer, then it is important to understand what you are committing to. Your hard work and dedication has finally paid off, but your hard work has only just begun. Once you get to the collegiate level, playing lacrosse becomes more of a job than a hobby. You are expected to train vigorously all the time while keeping up with your academics. If you don't do well in school, you'll end up not having a school to play for. Therefore, it is important to keep it fun. If you do not keep it fun, then you will quit because it is a job.

For example, if the inactive child displays an interest in archery, trampolining, golf, rollerskating, canoeing, dry slope or snow skiing, these are all great possibilities for keeping active but may not be considered the ""standard"" sport a school offers.

, These games can get the child out of the house, running around. Even though this isn't a sport, this activity is just as good as a child playing sports. If the child doesn't want to go outside and play tag, there are video game consoles that promote fitness (Wii, Xbox Kinect, etc.). Some of these are very active and can get the child moving around a lot without even realizing it's exercise.

, Foundations like 'Play 60', which is a youth organized program, that get a group of kids together to do agility drills or obstacle courses with kids just like them, could be an option.

, Hula hoops and skipping ropes might be old fashioned, but they work because children enjoy them and can do them on the spot. Teach your child to skip or use a hula hoop. Get the whole family involved, who can skip rope the most times in one minute, who can keep the hoop spinning longest? Good, active, family fun.

,


Time how long it takes your child to find eight blue items bigger than a cracker in your home and garden.
See how long it takes for you child to go to their room, undress and put on as many clothes of their favourite color as possible and report back to you.
Throw in some added impetus. If your children can compete with each other, even better! If not, encourage your kid to improve their time.
Stand-up-sit-down-turn-around and clap!
Just do it. It doesn't matter if you feel silly––you'll have a healthier child.

, If your child is keen to do so, dance lessons are a great way to be active for boys and girls. Jumping around to music at home is great too. Play them the tunes from your youth and show them how you danced, get gran and grandad in on it too. Family activities can be inclusive of everyone and a learning experience too. Imagine gran showing the children the waltz and then being shown how to Cha-Cha-Slide!

, Mowing the lawn, making the beds, putting out the washing on the line, vacuuming all the floors are all great activities.

, If your child walks for 30 minutes to school every week day, that's fantastic. You can let them get a ride home if it's not safe for them to walk after dark.

, Go to visit friends or to the shops on foot if possible. Take a walk around the neighbourhood, take the dog! Go to the park, your nearest reserve or anywhere else that is good for a stroll.

, This is something they can do all year round if you plan well. Digging, weeding and just playing in the dirt all get children outdoors and active. Encourage growing vegetables, herbs or fruit for the family dinner table, or flowers.

, Fruit picking, geocaching, sightseeing, bird watching, even walking around museums. All of these activities are better than sitting on the couch. Younger children may enjoy play parks and ball-pits, older kids might enjoy an adventure playground.

, Climb trees, build dens, play hide and seek, hunt for bugs, or fairies, doesn't matter. Engage your child's imagination as well as their body.


Visiting green spaces is especially important if you live in a highly urbanized area where nature is in short supply; use the walk as both exercise and a way of teaching your child about animals and plants. Many children will be so fascinated by discovering nature that they'll be keen to do more walks to keep learning about what the animals are doing and discovering new plants.

Sell once and never sell again.,
Sell the big package first.,
Don’t chase your dreams, chase your goals.,
Learn different on and offline marketing techniques.,
Develop a foolproof sales system that overcomes common objections.,
Don't lower your prices to make a sale.,
Give your clients results.",How to Get More Fitness Boot Camp Clients," If you are not using EFT (electronic fund transfer) or auto debit in your fitness boot camp then you are going to hate life when you have to go, resign, and resell the same people repeatedly every 4-6 weeks.;
, It is just as easy to sell a 12-month commitment, as it is to sell a month-to-month program if you know how to form an offer the right way.


You get the peace of mind of knowing that you have reliable income and your client gets to commit to a program that gets them results and teaches them to make it a lifestyle. In addition, clients who commit to 12-month programs are three times more likely to say with you for multiple years.

, Start your business off right by setting goals. How many new members do you want within the first 30, 60, 90, and 120 days? Set goals and work towards meeting and exceeding them.

, Having multiple marketing outlets will help you to bring in prospect and leads. Once you find a couple of different methods that work, stick to them.

, Instead of just winging it when trying to close a client, create a script to help you squash any predictable objections like not having enough money or enough time to join.


If you do not have a selling script and system that is predictable and proven to sell, then you are going to struggle no matter how many leads you can get in front of you.

, Lowering your prices is not an effective way to sell, instead try to teach the value that your fitness boot camp business can bring to the lives of its members. Show them that you are worth every penny because you are the only fitness boot camp expert in your area, and by signing with you, they can get the results they are after.

, It does not matter how much they like you, and how they think of you. They signed up for one reason and that has to lose weight and keep it off. If you do not deliver measurable and quantifiable results, then they are out!

Pick a sport.,
Look for noncompetitive leagues.,
Encourage your child to join a sports club instead.",How to Get Your Kids Involved in Noncompetitive Sports1," If your kid is very young, you can try them out in whatever sport you feel comfortable with to see if it's a good fit. It's also a good idea to think about what would be a good fit for your child; if they don't seem to like playing catch, maybe t-ball isn't for them. If your kid is a bit older, you might ask them or let them try a few different sports to see what they enjoy the most., Many cities have leagues that aren't competitive, especially for younger kids. Look at the parks and recreation department, for instance, or contact your local YMCA. You'll likely be able to find a noncompetitive league in your area that places the emphasis on fun and fitness rather than competition., Many schools have sports clubs for kids who don't want to play on the school team. These clubs offer a way for kids to be involved in a sport without competition being as much of an emphasis."

Plan.,
Practice.,
Exercise.,
Don't overwork.,
Relax.,
Eat Healthy.,
Get rest.,
Prepare all your sports equipment that you'll need and don't forget to bring a water bottle!,
If you have a tryout form, don't forget to include that too.

,
Rest that day.",How to Get Ready for Any Sports Tryouts," The day you find out about the tryouts check to see how much time you have before the tryouts and prepare. Make a list of stuff you'll need (if you need anything) and check your schedule to see when you'll have time to practice.

, You know that practice makes perfect so practice! Practice your weak points but don't forget to practice your strong aspects either! Remember there is always room for improvement!

, Exercise before practicing and before the tryouts. Remember you don't want to get hurt.

, Overworking yourself is counterproductive. Remember everyone gets tired. Take breaks.

, After a nice long practice. Relax, it's good for your body and your soul. Stuff like taking a shower, listening to music you like or just unwinding and watching T.V are all ways you can relax. Do whatever relaxes you.

, You need to eat healthy. Your body will be working so it will need a lot of healthy nutrients. Avoid any Junk food. Here are the stuff you should eat on the day of the tryouts:


Breakfast: Egg Sammy, a Sandwich made up of some eggs, a slice of cheese and a little ham. This sandwich will give you all the protein you need for the tryout.
Lunch: If your tryouts are after lunch here's what to eat, if not ignore this step. A Turkey sub with a side of Fruits and Pretzels. Stay away from greasy foods but don't skimp on calories you'll need them for the tryout.
Pregame snack: A low fat blueberry muffin and some milk will give you all the boost you need.

, Remember to rest, you will need a lot of energy for the game so go to bed early.

,;
,, Practicing the day before the tryouts won't help you so just Relax instead.

Stay active.,
Give yourself pep talks.,
Pump up the jams.,
Don't go overboard.",How to Get Pumped Before a Big Sports Game1," Build your mental excitement by keeping your body excited. Stay on your feet and move around. Or, if you have to remain seated (like on a bus ride), find other ways to stay physically active. Stave off passivity by:Walking at a brisk pace
Going for a warm-up jog
Doing jumping jacks
Tapping drumbeats
Pumping your fists to music;
, Boost your excitement with positive speeches during practice and warm-ups. Run them silently in your head, or say them out loud to increase your physical activity and kill two birds with one stone. Don’t worry about making them long. Focus on positive phrases or even keywords with verbs that emphasize action, like:“Keep it moving!”
“Shut them out!”
“Charge!”
“Attack!”

, Listen to music. Create a playlist full of songs with lyrics that inspire you (like the classic “Eye of the Tiger”) or infectious upbeat tunes (like “Lust for Life”). Avoid slow music, though. Instead, pump yourself up with songs full of energy, like fast rock, punk, hip-hop, or dance music.For an added boost, favor songs with strong bass lines. Studies have shown that listening to songs heavy with bass inspires a stronger desire to dominate than songs with little or light bass. ""Another One Bites the Dust"" by Queen is a classic example., Remember: as much as you may want to pump yourself up, you still have a game to play. Be sensible about how much you exert yourself beforehand. Avoid overstimulating yourself by:Refraining from drinking too much caffeine or energy drinks.
Warming up as directed by your coach.
Getting plenty of sleep the night before.
Avoiding strenuous activity.

Find a sports class.,
Try rock climbing.,
Offer yoga.,
Sign your kid up for swimming lessons.,
Get the equipment for sports like skating and biking.",How to Get Your Kids Involved in Noncompetitive Sports2," Another option for a noncompetitive is to choose a sport that is noncompetitive by nature and find a local class. For instance, your child could take recreational gymnastics or dancing. You can find classes through your parks and recreation department or through local studios and gyms.Keep in mind that the competitiveness of many sports depends on how you play them. For instance, dancing can be competitive, but your child can also just take a class for fun.
Golf is another sport your kid could try.

, Rock climbing may strike a bit of fear in your heart as a parent, but it can help kids build confidence. Plus, they are only in competition with themselves. Each climb is a chance to learn something new and to gain new skills. Check your area for rock climbing walls that offer classes to kids., Yoga is another great athletic activity that your child can get involved in. It increases flexibility, and it is completely noncompetitive. It can also help with focus and balance. Many studios offer classes for kids, so check in your area to see what's being offered.Your kid might not like the idea of going to a new class by themselves, so why not take a class together? Many studios offer kid and parent yoga classes, for instance. You'll both have fun and increase your activity level at the same time.

, Another option for an individual sport is swimming. While of course swimming can be competitive, it can also just be something fun your kid learns to do. Start with swimming lessons, and then check to see if there is a noncompetitive league in your area. Plus, learning to swim gives your kid a necessary life skill., If you want your kid to try other sports, such as skating and biking, you'll need to get them the necessary equipment. Your kid can rent skates if they only skate at a rink, but if they're going to skate elsewhere, they'll need the skates to do it. Similarly, biking can be a good sport for kids, but they need the bikes to do it. Also, check if your area has any clubs for kids that focus on these sports.

"
"
Emphasize having a good time.,
Stay fit as a family.,
Buy active games.,
Send your kids outside.",How to Get Your Kids Involved in Noncompetitive Sports3," No matter what sport your child is playing, the key is to emphasize having fun. Let them know how proud you are of them for trying and sticking to a sport, and encourage them to have fun while doing it.For instance, you could say, ""It's great that you're trying yoga! You're doing a great job, and it's so good that you're having fun doing it!""

, If you're trying to encourage more exercise, you need to model it to your child. Go on nightly walks together, or check out local hiking trails. You can also take bike rides together or go swimming. In the house, you can have dance parties, where kids likely won't even realize they're getting exercise in., If your kid loves being inside gaming, start buying games that encourage them to get up and move. Many video games encourage things like dancing, for instance, which engages your child in exercising without them even realizing it.For non-screen games, go old-school with games like Twister.

, One way to encourage fitness is to limit screen time and send kids outside to play with siblings and other neighborhood kids. It helps to provide outdoor activities, such as a swing set, jump ropes, hula hoops, and water guns."
"
Get together outside of practice.,
Watch old games together.,
Sing as a group.,
Give your team a pep talk.",How to Get Pumped Before a Big Sports Game2," Set the big game apart from all the rest by making the day or night before a special occasion. Do something new as a group to reinforce your bond. Host a dinner, go on a road trip, or go to the movies to see an inspiring film together.It doesn’t necessarily have to be the day or night before the match. Schedules might conflict, or your coach may want everyone well rested for the game. Just make it sometime soon before the big game.
You can make the upcoming game the focus of your evening if talking about it boosts everyone’s excitement. But you can also leave that for practice and focus on having fun instead. The point is to strengthen your bond and build team spirit, regardless of what you do.

, If possible, have someone film your games throughout the season. Then, before the big game, have a screening with your team to watch your greatest moments. Either watch your best game where everyone was on point, or create a highlight reel of individual plays and triumphs.You can do this at any time in the days leading up to the game. Have a late practice and watch it after your workout, make it part of your special get-together outside of practice, or even watch it on the day of, on the bus ride there or in the locker room.

, Remember: listening to music is a great way to pump yourself up. So is staying active. So combine the two strategies and build unity and excitement at the same time.Sing whatever songs come to you as a group on the bus ride there for fun to boost your camaraderie.
Then decide on an anthem or anthem(s) to be your battle-song for warm-ups to stoke yourselves up as starting time draws near.

, Focus everyone’s attention on the upcoming game with a quick speech. Do this during the practice beforehand, your get-together, on the day of, or all three. Keep it short, no more than a couple minutes, because you want your teammates to stay active to stoke themselves up, too. Also:Focus on positive statements. Avoid calling attention to anything negative. For instance, if you haven’t won a game in a while, leave your record unmentioned. Instead, emphasize how well everyone has performed in recent practices.
Keep it simple. Leave strategizing and specific instructions to individual teammates out of it. Stick to general statements, like “We got this in the bag,” and “I know we can do this.”
Emphasize the team, not individuals. Avoid singling out star players and putting too much burden on them, which might psych them out instead of psyching them up. At the same time, boost other teammates’ confidence by always using the inclusive “we.”

"
"
Think of the big game as just another game.,
Confront your fears ASAP.,
Concentrate on your progress.,
Prevent other sources of stress.,
Know when to dial back.",How to Get Pumped Before a Big Sports Game3," Whether it’s a match against your rivals or a qualifying game, remember: it isn’t played any differently than less important games. So strike the “big” out of “the big game.” Focus only on the nuts and bolts of what you have to do in order to win, not what’s riding on your performance.Keep this in mind when giving your teammates a pep talk, too. Avoid preoccupying them with what a win or loss might mean in this instance. Leave the special circumstances unmentioned and simply talk about the game as if it was any other.

, Think of all the things that make you nervous when performing. Now recognize that they don’t have any magical powers over you, and that your nervousness is a response that comes solely from you, not from some spell cast over you. So start challenging yourself well before the big game by meeting your fears head-on. Give yourself the added boost on game-day by looking back at these as challenges met and overcome. For example:If you doubt your abilities over a certain aspect of the sport (like sinking a 3-point shot in basketball or conquering hills in cross country), tailor your workouts or devote extra practice to address it.
If the presence of a certain family member, friend, or special someone in the crowd makes you self-conscious, invite them to practices or less important games beforehand, or even just to watch you shoot hoops in the driveway (or something similar).

, Whether you’re thinking about yourself or your team, boost your confidence by tracking how your performance progresses from the start of your season throughout. Focus on your performance, rather than your record. Don’t get yourself down by confusing the two if you’re having a less than stellar season. Always emphasize how much you’ve improved, both individually and overall, regardless of how many wins you tally up along the way.Almost everyone experiences setbacks at one point or another during a season. Focus less on the setbacks themselves and more on how fast you recouped from them. Stoke yourself up by reminding yourself how quickly you can bounce back.
Remember: a loss doesn’t necessarily mean you performed poorly. You could just as easily play your best game ever during a defeat. So honor that performance by recognizing it as such.

, Whatever diet your sport demands, be sure to eat right in the days leading up to the big game and on the day of. Get plenty of rest in the preceding week, as well. Plan well ahead of game-day to eliminate any distractions that might steal your focus from your performance, such as:


Setting a double alarm, confirming all travel arrangements, and laying out and/or packing your uniform, warm-up gear, and equipment to reduce the chances of running late on game-day.
Completing any unrelated tasks, like homework or paying bills, beforehand so you’re not tempted to worry about them during the game.

, Remember: pumping yourself up for the big game doesn’t mean going berserk. You don’t, for example, want to psych yourself up for a race so much that you burst from the starting line at a pace you can’t maintain. So pay close attention to your ability to focus on what you actually need to do during the game. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed by the stakes involved, try:Meditating to refocus your mind on the here and now instead of what the future may hold.
Distracting yourself with books, movies, slower music, homework, or hanging out with friends outside your team.Making two lists regarding the game, one of things that are within your control, and another of what is beyond it, so you can refocus on what you can actually control.

Do wide stance weighted squats.,
Do weighted lunges.,
Do weighted hip lifts.,
Try deadlifts.,
Do not do lots of aerobic or cardiovascular exercise.,
Have a protein shake after you workout.",How to Get Bigger Buttocks Fast1," Stand with your feet 1 and half times that of your shoulder width apart. Keeping your back straight, slowly bend your knees and slowly lower your body down as if you were going to sit down on a chair. Make sure that you do not allow your knees to extend over your toes while squatting. Hold the position for a moment, and then slowly return to the original position. Repeat this 10 times to make up one set, and do 3-4 sets with 1-2 minutes rest.









You should add resistance to this exercise by having a (weighted) bar across and behind your shoulders or holding a dumbbell in each hand. Bar is preferable as it transfers the weight to your legs while wit h dumbbells the amount of weight is limited by how much you can hold with your arms.
You should have a wide stance because this emphasizes the focus on the glutes and hips.
Using a leg press is easier, but it is not as effective in focusing on the glutes as squats are.;
, Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and have your arms hang loosely at your sides. Take a big step forward with your right foot, and then slowly lower your hips until both knees are bent at about a 90-degree angle. Make sure that your right knee does not extend past your right foot. Slowly return to standing position, and then do the exercise again, this time stepping forward with your left foot. Take 20 steps, or lunges, to make one set, and do 3-4 sets with 1-2 minutes rest in between.









Be sure to keep your back straight and shoulders back.

, Lay down on your back with your legs bent at a 90-degree angle with your feet flat on the floor and your hands at your sides. Place a weight plate over your lower abdominal area. Slowly lift your hips into the air so that your torso is now aligned with your legs. Slowly lower your hips back to starting position, and then repeat. Repeat this exercise 8 times for one set, and do 3-4 sets with 1-2 minutes rest in between.









Alternatively, you can do a hip extension if you have a platform or bed by lying facedown with your hips on the edge of platform. Your legs should be held straight in the air with your toes resting lightly on the floor. Lift one leg high above your head. Then, squeeze your butt and hamstrings while you straighten your leg and let it down slowly back to the floor. Do the same with the other leg.

, Deadlifts are great for your hamstrings, butt, and lower back. However, you need to be careful to lift with the correct form or you risk seriously injuring yourself. Your feet should always be hip-width apart, and your bar in front of your shins before lifting, and you should always start with the weight on the floor. Your back should be kept flat, your abs in, and your shoulder blades back as you lift your back up, thrust with your legs and squeeze your butt to pull the weight up, pausing at the top for a moment, then bend forward from your hips and push your butt out keeping your back straight a shoulder blades back and lower your torso until your weights reaches the ground.









Your weights should always be close to your legs throughout the entire range of motion. Do this 8 times to form one set, and do 3-4 sets with 1 and a half to 2 minutes rest in between.

, You will maximize muscle gain in the glutes if you stick to resistance training. A lot of your buttocks are fat, so if you are too skinny you won't have as big of a butt.

Squeeze your leg and butt muscles as you work to keep your butt firm and round.
If you are using exercise equipment in a gym, then turn up the resistance in order to build more muscle, even if that means moving slower.

, Eat a full diet to ensure your muscles repair and build."

Understand how 10-minute routines work.,
Exercise the maximum number of muscles at a time.,
Go for high intensity exercises.,
Keep any necessary portable equipment with you.,
Take the stairs.,
Make other lifestyle changes.,
Don't let travel ruin your routine.,
Don't forget to relax and recover after exercise.",How to Get Fit in 10 Minutes a Day1," It's important to know that this exercise style isn't ideal, but it's better than not exercising at all.If you only have 10 minutes to spare, you'll need to make sure that your workout is as efficient as possible.


While aerobic exercises are important for heart health, they are generally less efficient at burning calories than exercises that focus on building strength.
Keep in mind that it's still better for fitness and weight loss to exercise more often. The recommended amount of exercise for cardiovascular health is 30 minutes a day, five days a week.Be creative. An important aspect of finding a few minutes to exercise is to seize all opportunities that come your way.;
, Minimize the number of exercises that work out only one or two muscle groups at a time. For maximum efficiency, focus on techniques that use as much of your body as possible.


You can also combine two simple single-target exercises and do them simultaneously. For example, never do leg or arm lifts on their own. Combining them into one efficient, fluid motion will let you cut your workout time in half.

, For short workout routines to be effective, they must manage to fit in the same amount of effort as a longer workout in a shorter period of time. The most effective way to do this is through high intensity interval training where exercise is done in brief, intense bursts.


For example, instead of a long strength-training session devoted to triceps, do a quick set of close-grip diamond pushups. Diamond pushups are a quick, high intensity workoutthat activate the triceps and pectorals to a much greater degree compared to traditional wide-grip pushups.In addition to burning fat, high intensity interval training when done consistently can improve cardiovascular fitness.High intensity interval training has also been shown to reduce blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes and to improve liver function., When you don't have time to hit the gym, make wherever you are into an exercise center. Be ready to catch those 10 minutes of exercise whenever you can.


Keep a light-weight yoga mat in your work bag or car. That way, you will be able to do floor exercises anywhere.
Keep a set of hand weights both at home and at the office. If you don't happen to have a set of weights handy, you can turn any heavy object with a handle into an improvised hand weight.
Resistance bands are compact enough to fit inside even the smallest purses. Use these tools to train anywhere when you're on the go.

, While going about your day, whenever you have the choice between taking the stairs and an elevator or escalator, get in a few minutes of high intensity exercise by choosing the stairs.Additionally, while not everyone can afford a stair climbing machine at home, most have access to a few flights of stairs. Try incorporating a few minutes of running up and down stairs into your daily planned workout.
You can also use stairs as an improvised aerobic step. Use the bottom few stairs to do side-step ups, incline pushups, and toe taps. , You are likely not going to get fit with exercise alone, especially with just 10 minutes a day. Make sure all other aspects of your life are conducive to staying in shape.



Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Control portion sizes, and, if you're trying to lose weight, make sure you're taking in less calories than you're using up. Eat plenty of all types of vegetables, especially green leafy ones. When eating fruit, go for fresh produce rather than preserved versions which often contain added sugar. At least half of the grains you consume should be whole grains. Get plenty of protein from low-fat dairy and lean meat like chicken and fish. Limit added sugar to 10 percent or less of your daily caloric intake.Stay hydrated. Contrary to popular belief, there is no set-in-stone amount of water you should drink each day. This will vary by your activity level, climate, and the presence of certain health conditions. You are generally getting enough water if you rarely feel thirsty and your urine is colorless or a light yellow. If not, drink more water to reach proper hydration levels and try to drink this amount every day. Also, you should drink water before, during, and immediately after exercise.Limit alcohol consumption. If you drink, drink in moderation. To avoid the ill effects of alcohol, men should limit their daily intake to two drinks per day, while women should have only one.Quit smoking. Or, if you don't smoke, don't start. Regular tobacco smoking damages your heart and lungs, making it more difficult to exercise., For these quick workouts to achieve results, you must commit to doing them every day. However, it's not always practical to pack a set of hand weights in your luggage. If you don't go to the gym regularly because you frequently travel for work, keep yourself from getting out of shape by finding a routine you can do on the go. Pack a resistance band in your suitcase so you can exercise even when staying at hotels without fitness centers., With the short duration of a 10-minute workout you may forget to give your body what it needs. This can lead to sore muscles and discourage you from achieving your fitness goals. Always be sure to take in enough protein when doing these routines. Try to time your workout so that you can relax with a hot shower not long after."

Ask them what they are interested in.,
Watch how they play.,
Consider their developmental stage.,
Choose non-team activities.,
Try out a few different options.",How to Get a Toddler Involved in Sports1," Toddlers may be young, but they do have a good idea of what types of things they are interested in. Ask your toddler if they would like to try a sport, and consider their answers seriously.You can say, “If you could play any sport, what would you choose?”
You can also give the toddler options. For example, you might say, “Do you want to take karate or would you rather learn soccer?”;
, If your toddler does not have an opinion on what sport they like, observe how they play on the playground. Take note of what type of play they enjoy, and find an activity that suits it.


If they like running, they may want to join some kind of running sport like tag or racing.
If they like tumbling, they may enjoy gymnastics.
If they throw things often, you might want to put them in a sport like t-ball.

, Toddlers are still growing, and they may not be ready for certain sports. Introducing a child too young to rough sports can cause lifelong injuries. Contact sports, such as football and hockey, should not be introduced until the child is in middle school.Some good sports and activities for toddlers include:


Relay Racing
T-ball
Tag
Frisbee
Skiing

, The structure of a team sport may be overwhelming for a toddler. These sports, such as basketball or soccer, may not be appropriate for a child until they are six or seven years old. Instead, find sports that offer more free play and that can be taught to your toddler individually.These include:


Gymnastics
Swimming
Golf
Tennis

, You might find that your child acts differently during a sports lesson than they would while playing at home in the park. It may take a few tries to find the right sport for your child. Don’t be afraid to try some different options.After each lesson, ask your toddler, “How was it? Did you have fun? What did you do?”
Do not invest in equipment until you are positive that your child enjoys the sport. This will prevent you from buying equipment that will later be unused.

This can help you focus your training and give you something for which to work.Your goals don’t need to be anything lofty and they shouldn’t be unattainable, which could make you quit.
For example, if you are currently running a 10-minute mile, you could set a goal of getting down to 8 minute miles in six months. It can be easy to formulate a plan for training once you have a concrete goal.;
, It’s easy to stick to any goals you have to get better at a sport if you formulate a reasonable plan. Your plan should include everything from training sessions times to specific drills or goals you have for each session. Remember to keep it reasonable, though. Gradual improvement will keep you motivated and not fatigue you to the point that you quit.You can formulate plans with the help of sports magazines, coaches, trainers, or even friends.
There are plans to help people attain their goals available in the media and on the web. Consider sticking with sources such as fitness sites or the sites of fitness magazines.
Make sure to schedule at least one full day of complete and two if you need it.
For example, if you want to get better at breaststroke in swimming, you might formulate a plan that includes swimming four days a week and incorporates drills that will specifically develop the leg and arm muscles you use for this stroke.

, You cannot get better at sports if you do not train on a regular basis. Aim to train anywhere from 3-6 times per week, depending on your overall goals.


You don’t have to train for hours on end to get better at a sport. Even twenty minutes of target exercise can improve your skills as long as you do this regularly.
Most people can improve with at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity.If you are generally more active, you can do more than the recommended amount of exercise per day. In addition, if you are training for endurance events such as a marathon, you may also exceed this suggestion.Remember to pace yourself and increase your training schedule gradually. This can help minimize your risk for burnout.You may want to check with your doctor before undertaking any significant increase in your fitness program., Since most sports require developing and improving even the most basic skills, focus your training by incorporating drills. These can help you improve dramatically at the sport of your choice.Drills are every bit as important as strength and speed because they make your movements much more accurate.Drills can also improve skills in other sports you may play.You may want to identify drills specific to your sport of choice by asking coaches or even competitive athletes for their suggestions.For example, if you play basketball, you might want to do wind sprints to improve your pivoting ability and increase your endurance. Swimmers can use kickboards and pull buoys.
Even practicing repetitive movements like serving or shooting baskets from different angles can really help you get better at sports., Doing the same sport daily can get a little boring. Consider cross-training, which can not only help you get better at your sport of choice, but also boosts your endurance and may also prevent injury.Try and train at the sport at which you want to get better 3-4 days a week and cross train the other days.Cross training can strengthen the muscles that you don’t use in your sport of choice.Cross training can rejuvenate and motivate you to do your sport of choice. It also helps refresh your brain.You can use any sports to supplement your sport of choice, but you may want to choose something complementary to what you’re doing. For example, if you are a runner, you may want to do some strength training, swimming, or even yoga to strengthen your arm muscles while stretching out your leg muscles.Rock climbers may want to run, hike, or jog to use their leg muscles that don’t get used as often., Although there are mixed opinions about the benefits of stretching, it can improve your range of motion. In turn, this may help your athletic performance and help minimize your risk of injury.Stretching has additional benefits including: improved flexibility and increased blood flow to your muscles, both of which can also help you get better at sports.You can do either specific stretching exercises or try more gentle forms of yoga such as hatha, restorative or yin yoga, all of which can help improve your athletic performance.

, Knowing about how the human body moves is something that can help you get better at your sport. By learning about the principles of kinesiology, or the study of movement, you may be able to improve significantly at your sport.


Many colleges offer courses in kinesiology and though you can also find online courses.
You can also learn about the principles of kinesiology by reading books or watching instructional videos.

, You may want to watch how professionals at your sport move. This visualization may give you some ideas for new methods to do your sport or drills you could do that may also help you get better.Watch videos, visit matches or even read books and blogs to see how professionals do their sport.
If you are near your opposing team or cannot get a video of them playing, visit one of their games.

, Having confidence in your skills and ability to improve them can also provide a foundation from improvement. By meeting realistic goals you have set, you can continue to maintain and build the confidence in your skills as an athlete.Learning to de-emphasize outcomes can help you build your confidence, which in turn may help you improve. Instead, focus on performance improvements and excellence.Accept that you will have drawbacks. Move on and continue to work towards your goal., Don't just ""go through the motions"". Strive to get better in each drill that you do. Work as hard as you do when the coach is looking as when they're not. Be a good role model for others on the team.

, They know what they're talking about and can really help you work on your game if you let them. Most coaches are willing to work with you on specific skills or tell you in which areas you need to improve in. Don't be afraid to ask!

, Eating a diet rich in vitamins and nutrients can help fuel your training sessions and in turn help you get better at your sport. Foods that have moderate amounts of fat and are high in complex and simple carbohydrates are good choices to fuel your workouts.Stick to a diet of about 1,500-2,000 nutrient-rich calories a day, depending on how active you are., You’ll want to eat a healthy mixture of carbohydrates and proteins for optimal performance.These can help fuel your workout and build your bones and muscles, which may help you get better at sports.You want to eat both complex and simple carbohydrate, which your body can burn for fuel.Some examples of complex carbohydrates are: whole grain pastas, bagels, breads, and rice.Soft drinks, jams, jellies and candies are examples of simple carbohydrates.You need to eat some carbohydrates if you are exercising for more than an hour. Eat something small like an English muffin with jelly or a cup of yogurt. You can also have one cup of 100% fruit juice.You’ll also need to replenish carbs after a workout with similar foods.Protein helps muscles grow and tissues repair, which may help you get better at a sport. You can get protein through lean meats and dairy., A key part of boosting your training is getting enough vitamins and nutrients to maintain your health. If you eat foods from the five food groups daily, you should be able to get enough nutrients. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy.Eat 1-1.5 cups of fruit per day, including examples like raspberries, blueberries, or strawberries.Eat 2.5-3 cups of vegetables per day, including examples such as broccoli, asparagus, or peppers.Make sure to vary the vegetables you choose so that you get a range of nutrients.
Eat around 5-8 ounces of grains per day, of which ½ should be whole grains. Foods like brown rice, whole wheat pasta or bread, and oatmeal contain complex carbohydrates to fuel your training.Take in 5-6.5 ounces of protein per day.Lean meats like beef, pork, or poultry; cooked beans; eggs; peanut butter; or nuts and seeds all contain protein.Protein helps build and repair muscle.Drink or eat 2-3 cups of dairy daily.Dairy products including yogurt, milk, cheese, or even ice cream can help you build and maintain strong bones as muscles., Maintaining proper hydration can help your body function optimally, which in turn can improve your athletic performance. Make sure you get sufficient liquids every day to boost your regular training.Women should drink at least nine cups of water a day and men should aim for 13 cups. If you are very active, however, you may need up to 16 cups of water per day to maintain your hydration.You can stay hydrated with different liquids such as tea, juice, soda, or even broth.

, If you’re trying to get better at a sport, considering reducing your intake of caffeine and alcohol consumption. You should also avoid drugs, including performance-enhancing substances. All three can affect your athletic performance.


Most adults can drink about 400mg, or four cups of coffee, daily.Women should no more than two to three alcohol units per day and men only three to four alcohol units.A bottle of wine, for example, has nine to ten units of alcohol., If you want to get better at a sport, rest is a key component.It allows your body and brain time to recharge and rebuild muscles and tissues.Rest also helps your body relax and handle stress.Get 7-9 hours of sleep every night.Insufficient sleep can decrease your ability to perform athletically, which can undermine efforts to improve.Short naps of 20-30 minutes can help overcome fatigue related to sports.Make sure to build in at least one full rest day per week and two if necessary.If you like, you can have one day of “active recovery” where you do some light activity like bike riding or walking.

, Although there is little scientific evidence that massage can help you get better at a sport, you may still want to get an occasional massage.Massage has other benefits that may help you get better. These include decreasing your heart rate, and relaxing and stretching out tight muscles.


There are many different styles of massage and you should choose one that you enjoy. You may find that myofascial release, deep tissue and Swedish massage help your performance the most.
You can seek out a massage therapist online or ask your doctor, trainer, or a friend for a recommendation."

Embrace your beauty!",How to Look Good with Pale Skin," Whether you have brown, blue, green or gray eyes, it is essential that you choose the right colors for your eye-shadow. Being pale is like being a blank canvas: colors will show up much brighter on you because you have a lighter tone. Someone with very dark skin can easily pull off more vibrant makeup while a lighter skinned person can not. Instead of choosing a wild color, try a more muted tone. Neutrals, such as light browns and purples, can never do wrong.


Remember, less makeup is more for a light-skinned woman. Makeup tends to show up easier on someone with lighter skin, so just a little bit of light eye-shadow can look stunning.
Avoid bright blues, yellows, or bright browns, or your face will look drained of its natural color.;
, Brown and gray eyeliner looks stunning on the perpetually pale. Brown especially is a color that brings out the eyes but doesn't look as harsh as black, which can create too stark of a contrast between your pale skin and your makeup.Black eyeliner can, however, be beautiful on a pale person, but in moderation. Instead of circling your eye with the liner, try instead only lining the top or the outer corners. As a general rule of thumb for any skin tone, circling your entire eye in black liner can make your eyes look smaller. You can go for the Taylor Swift-esque cat eyes to make your eyes even bigger.
You can even use a makeup brush to smudge your eyeliner a bit, so it blends in with your skin a bit and creates less of a contrast.

, Dark mascara, or even black mascara, can make your eyes stand out the most if you have pale skin. Avoid light brown, plum, or blue mascara and go for the darkest black you can find. This can help those lashes, and the rest of your eyes, pop against your fair skin. You can also get thickening mascara to make the most of your lashes and to really make your eyes pop.

If you wear a lighter color of mascara, then your eyes won’t stand out as much.

, For any skin tone, a foundation that does not match your skin tone is never flattering. This is especially true with paler skin. Any color that is slightly askew from your natural tone will look off, if not like an orange disaster. Don't be ashamed to choose ""porcelain"" or ""angel"" shades. They look better than a darker shade and enhance your natural glow.


Don’t try to fake it. Trying to look darker by choosing a darker foundation makes you look a bit silly.

, Bronzer must be used sparingly if you want to use it at all. A little bit of very light bronzer below the cheekbones and under your chin makes your face look thinner. Too much and you risk looking like you have some dirt on your face. Blush on the cheek bones, nose and the tip of your chin enhances your cheeks and makes your nose and chin look sharp. A very light pink gets the job done nicely.


Whether you use bronzer or blush, just make sure that you blend it in smoothly.

, Cover up is a life saver when those bags under your eyes and pimples (which look a bit more pronounced on white skin) will not go away! Cover up can also cover any sun damage or pimples. Don't worry about covering your freckles, though. They look cute! Embrace them!


That said, if you really don’t have any blemishes or pimples to hide, then you can skip out on concealer.

, Wearing dark colors can make you look like a vampire. A sweet light pink, or even an apricot shade, looks great for either formal or casual occasions. Red lipstick is the one exception. Red lipstick looks best against pale skin and is great for important events — think of how stunning the paler-skinned Taylor Swift looks with bright red lipstick.You can also use some lip liner to accentuate your lips as well.

, If you have decided you don't like the hue of your skin, spray tanning can look very bad against very pale skin. The spray looks more orange than tan. It's always better to naturally tan. Naturally tanning has setbacks farther down the road that many don't consider. Extended time in the sun can lead to skin cancer (which shows up more often in fair skinned folks), leathery skin, wrinkles, more freckles and sun damage/sun spots.


If you must be darker or cannot physically tan, the best option would be a natural glow moisturizer, or any product that slowly darkens your skin naturally.

, Don't dye your hair the wrong color! Hair color can mean the difference between looking like a glowing goddess and looking sickly. Deep reds, chestnut and dark browns are dramatic and gorgeous colors for the light skinned. For a lighter look, honey blonde is very attractive. It's best to avoid light red hair, especially if you are prone to being pink-skinned. However, if you don’t want to dye your hair, don’t feel pressured to do it just because you want it to look great against your skin.


Very dark, or even black hair against pale skin can make for a very flattering and classic look.

, Wearing neutrals is currently a prominent style. Nude and ivory colored clothing is being torn off the rack. Unfortunately, wearing white and light pink can be very unflattering on someone who has white and/or pinkish skin. Instead, be bold with your color choices. Dare to wear blue, black, brown, and green. If you do like a neutral look, a light brown or tan is very flattering against porcelain skin. If you have very dark hair and light skin, wearing a lot of black can wash you out.


Be sure to add some color to your look. If you are a redhead, stay away from colors similar to your hair on the color wheel (i.e. red, pink, orange).
Instead, look for colors opposite of your hair, such as green, blue and purple. Pastels look gorgeous against light skin.
Beware of certain shades of yellow; they can make you look sick.

, If you have white skin, then you may be self-conscious about showing off those white legs. Pantyhose can help even out the tone of your legs while maintaining your gorgeous look. You can still pick a light-colored tone of pantyhose so that they look natural.


Of course, you should only wear them if the occasion is more formal and calls for it. You don’t want to stick out for being the only person wearing pantyhose.

, Make sure you take care of any body hair, especially if you have naturally dark body hair. Hair shows up very easily against light skin, so it's best to take care of hair regularly, especially if you have a bit of a unibrow or a mustache. You can consider waxing this hair, or you can just work on plucking your eyebrows or any stray hairs on your face or body.


If you have naturally blonde body hair, then you don’t need to worry as much. Blonde hair blends well with pale skin and doesn't need to be taken care of nearly as often.

, Everyone thinks tan is terrific, but pale is just as beautiful. Realizing that being different from the norm is the first step to embracing your unique beauty and gaining a healthy self-confidence! Being pale makes you look classic, timeless, and gorgeous. Instead of trying to look tan or to be something you’re not, just work on making the most of the beauty that you have to share with the world.


Be proud of your look and make the most of it. Don’t let people get you down about your pale skin and learn to love your unique and gorgeous look.

Choose fitted pants.,
Invest in high-waisted skirts, shorts, and pants.,
Wear thongs or underwear with butt padding.,
Slip on some leggings or yoga pants.",How to Get Bigger Buttocks Fast2," Baggy jeans can swallow up even the biggest butt. Try to find pants that are comfortably snug without being too tight or you’ll risk showing unflattering lines and rolls.


Pants that are too tight will butch together in the groin area, which is unsightly and uncomfortable to wear.
Never wear pants that are tight enough to cut off circulation in your legs. This is dangerous and can cause you serious harm.

, Clothing that accentuates your waist will naturally make your butt and hips look bigger and also give you that sought-after hourglass silhouette.


Cinch your waist using a belt or wearing a peplum shirt or dress. The flair created by the belt or peplum will accentuate the size your behind.

, Regular underwear can flatten your butt and give you unsightly panty lines that show through your clothing. Thongs allow both of your butt cheeks to hang loose while underwear with butt padding provide an extra push and volume to your behind.Butt pads are also called butt enhancers or butt shapewear. Butt pads enhance your butt by compressing it and lifting it. The extra padding also adds more butt to your behind.

, You don't have to reserve your stretchy pants for exercise only. These types of pants hug your curves, making your legs and butt look toned and voluptuous.


If you don’t like the leggings or yoga pants look, try wearing jeggings or jeans that have a fair amount of spandex in them.

Return to your starting position before repeating the same exercise with the sides in reverse to complete one repetition. Repeat for a total of 20 repetitions and rest for 30 seconds before moving on to the next exercise.


Use hand weights that are two to five pounds for all of these exercises. If you're a beginner, start with two-pound weights and work your way up to five as you build strength.If you don't have a set of hand weights, you can use any two objects of equal weight that you are able to grip firmly.

, Start in a partial squatting position with your knees bent and feet splayed to the side. Hold a weight in each hand and leave your arms hanging in front of you. From this position, slowly stand up, simultaneously raising your arms up and in line with your shoulders. Continue upwards, standing on your toes with your heels about two inches off the ground. To complete one repetition, return to your starting position with these motions in reverse. Do a total of 25 repetitions and then rest for 30 seconds.Time how long it takes you to do 25 repetitions at the beginning. As your strength improves, keep this exercise at the same time, but try increasing your repetitions.
If you have trouble gripping hand weights for this exercise, you can try using velcro wrist weights instead.

, Stand with your legs apart, heels slightly raised off the ground. While holding your hand weights, throw a jab with your right hand towards your left side.

Look for local pee wee teams.,
Enroll them in a sports day camp.,
Play with them one-on-one.,
Invest in active toys.",How to Get a Toddler Involved in Sports2," If you do want to start your toddler on a group sport, look for teams in your community that are aimed for toddlers and young children. This team may still offer unstructured play while teaching your toddler specific skills. These may be called “pee wee” or “munchkin” teams.


A good pee wee team will not be focused towards competing with other teams. Rather, it will start to instruct your child in a more toddler-friendly version of the sport.Check your local YMCA or recreation center to see if they offer toddler sports programs.

, In the summer time, you may be able to find a variety of sports programs tailored to toddlers. These will often be unstructured sports that encourage your child to run, race, and play with other kids. This type of play can help the child develop social and physical skills that help them become athletic when they are older.


These programs may be sport-specific, such as gymnastics, or they may be advertised as just a ""sports"" program, which will offer general athletic activity.
Schools, parks, community centers, and recreation centers often offer youth summer programs.

, You do not have to enroll your child in sports to foster a lifelong love of them. Invest in a child’s basketball hoop or a t-ball pole. Play the sport in the backyard with your child, encouraging them to run, throw, and catch.Some games you can play with your child include:


Tag
Hide and go seek
Race
Red Light, Green Light
Duck, Duck, Goose

, Your child can also be active playing alone. Buy toys that will encourage motor skills and physical activity.These are toys they can play with outside. Always supervise them when they play. Some good toys include:


A large bouncing ball
Bubbles
Inflatable pool
Small hula hoop
Small trampoline

Focus on basic exercise skills.,
Allow them time for unstructured play.,
Give them some time off.,
Avoid pressuring them.",How to Get a Toddler Involved in Sports3," Toddlers may not do well in organized team sports yet. If you want to encourage a love of athletics early in life, try to engage them in basic exercise activities. These will help your toddler remain active while preparing them for sports later in life. These skills include:


Swimming
Running
Tumbling
Climbing
Throwing
Catching, Before the age of six, children may not be ready for organized group sports. Unstructured play is best for children this age as it allows them to develop essential creative skills. Even if you do join a toddler sports team, make sure that your child still has plenty of time to have unstructured play.Toddlers should not have multiple practices a week or participate in competitive leagues.
Some toddler sports programs do allow them to have unstructured play. Instead of competitive sports, toddlers are encouraged to race and interact with each other.

, If your toddler is involved with a sport, you should make sure that you do not overload them. Do not make them play more than one season of sport a year. This will prevent early overuse injuries, and it will keep your toddler interested in sports in the long term.

, Too much pressure can make your child uninterested in sports, and it may cause injury by the time that they are teenagers. Above all else, encourage the toddler to have fun at this age.Try to avoid yelling at your toddler while they are playing. Even saying something like ""Hurry up and get the ballǃ"" can stress a toddler out while they are trying to develop motor skills."

Consider the standard movements used for the sport in question.,
Set up a workout routine matching with your specific sport(s).,
Know whether there is a deadline in terms of a date for your sports.,
Get in shape with friends.,
Remember why you are training.",How to Get in Shape for a Sport," If you know your sport, start by examining what other people's movements are like when they are engaged in the activity. A swimmer, golfer, football player, soccer player, bowler, ultimate Frisbee player (whatever your sport!) all have different required movements to compete/play. By examining these different movements, you can begin to see what may be required and what areas you may personally need to work on.


For example, take the ultimate Frisbee player and see some of the needed movements to participate. Clearly, you will want to be able to run. If you have low cardiovascular endurance and that is a requirement for your chosen sport, this author recommends starting to walk and/or run to build up your training. You can work on technical skills to improve your game later as you continue to build endurance, but the important thing is to start - and to have fun. Many athletes will agree that the more prepared you are, the more fun you can have while playing your game.
Not into Frisbee and your sport doesn't require running (like golf for example)?. Then, no problem. Break down the movements again and see that there is some flexibility required in order to get a good rotation to strike the ball well.


While these are two overly simplified examples, the point is to get an idea of what ""shape"" means for your sport.;
, You may want to hire a specialist in the chosen area to help you with certain sport-specific movements. For example, a swimmers training can be very intense with multiple workouts per day - and with swimming, form is critical to be good. Don't push yourself too hard, otherwise you might get injured. You can change up your workouts each day to make it interesting so that you won't get bored with them., An example might be a triathlete or adventure race, or the next Olympics. Whatever the sport may be, if there are parameters your are working within, your training routine may be altered. If you are not sure where to find a training routine or how to develop one, do an online search for ""(your sport) training routine"" of ""training routine for (your sport)"" to find examples of others already playing that game you are shaping up for!

, Get together with some like-minded people (or some like minded friends) and make a club. This could include group workouts, motivation and trips to the gym - make it relaxing and not too overly obsessive. Don't stress it, either. If you stress yourself out, it's likely going to be much harder for you., If you enjoy what you are doing, you will have more motivation to go and do it!

Make the room more comfortable.,
Laugh.,
Let your partner touch you.",How to Look and Feel Good Naked (for Guys)," That means take off everything. The only way you are going to be truly comfortable facing down your doubts and concerns about being naked is to face them head on.It shouldn’t be with other people, as the first step is making sure that you are comfortable being naked.
Make sure you are somewhere with a mirror that will let you examine your whole body, especially those parts you can’t see directly.
Gradually increase the amount of time you spend naked as well. You don’t need to turn into a nudist right away, just slowly spend more time without your clothes on. You’ll probably find that you get more comfortable.;
, To feel good naked, you need to highlight the areas you feel good about. Focusing on the areas you like can help you build self-confidence, and give you the motivation to improve the rest.There are a lot of parts to your body, which means plenty of options to find something positive. Maybe you have nice strong legs, a chiseled back, or you're particularly proud of your “package.” Whatever you decide on, that’s a great start to remembering that there are parts of you worth loving.
If you are having trouble, don’t think about a list of items. Start with one part of you that you think looks good, even if you can see it when you aren’t naked. Maybe you have a good smile or strong hands.

, Certain forms of negative thinking can damage your self-esteem. This will prevent you from accepting your body the way it is, and can even prevent you from doing things to improve it. Recognize if you are thinking this way, and challenge yourself to think differently. There are several common types of negative thinking that can affect the way you look at yourself.All-or-nothing. You probably don’t see chiseled abs and perfectly toned muscles when naked. These are all things you can change and improve. Not having them doesn’t mean you can’t get them.
Filtering. Dwelling on negative parts of your body while ignoring those parts you like can make you more insecure about having your clothes off. This is why it is important to find something you like about your body. And there is always something to praise.
Negative self-talk. Don’t turn your criticism of your negative aspects into a reflection of your self-worth. There is a substantive difference between telling yourself “My gut is too big, I should try to lose some weight,” and “I’m fat because I can’t make myself exercise enough.” When you criticize yourself, look for things you can do to improve them as well., It’s important to feel confident in your own skin (and nothing but your skin), but that doesn’t mean things are perfect. Give yourself some goals to work on, to help keep you focused not just on looking and feeling good, but making sure you stay that way.


Set small, simple goals that you can easily track, which will let you clearly see your progress and success.This is especially important for physical goals, like improving your physique or changing the style of your hair, as these are easy to track visually.
You should also consider mental goals, like resolving to focus more on the positive aspects of your body. Something simple like giving one positive comment about your body every morning can improve your mood and confidence while naked.

, Regular maintenance is one of the easiest ways to improve your overall appearance. It may take some effort to get into a regular schedule of good habits, but it will pay off big overall.


Bathe regularly. Take a bath or shower regularly to make sure you are getting your hair and body free of dirt, oil, and perspiration. Use soap and warm water, rinse all the lather off before finishing, then pat yourself dry for a clean finish.Get rid of body odor. In addition to keeping clean, especially those areas that get sweaty and dirty like armpits, use deodorant or cologne. Subtle, mild, or no-fragrance deodorants are good for masking your body’s less flattering odors.Complement this by using a cologne that subtly enhances your natural scents. You’ll only need to dab on small amounts, so no need for sprays that coat you in a cloud of scent.

, Some parts of you will need more specific care. Your nails and teeth require a little extra work, but can give you a nice boost to looking and feeling good.



Trim fingernails and toenails regularly. Trimming them once every week or so should be enough to keep them from getting too long. File after cutting for a smoother finish that looks nicer, and avoids sharp edges that can catch on clothing, or other people.

Practice good oral hygiene. Brush teeth twice daily and floss once a day. Consider rinsing with mouthwash as well to improve your breath. If you want further improvements to the appearance of your teeth, discuss whitening or straightening with a dentist.

, Clear, healthy looking skin is a very attractive quality. Make sure you know what kind of skin you have to find the best products to take care of any issues that arise.


Regular bathing will help remove the dirt and grease that cause blemishes and other imperfections on your skin. Make sure you get into those sweaty areas too.
Protect yourself from the sun. The sun can easily damage your skin if you aren’t careful, and even if you don’t get skin cancer, sunburn is painful and embarrassing to see. Avoid being outside during peak hours (10 am to 2 pm), wear clothing that covers your body, and lather up with sunscreen.For clearer skin, look for a variety of colors in fruits and vegetables. This includes carrots, apricots, spinach, tomatoes, and blueberries. Fatty fish like salmon and mackerel are good, and you can’t go wrong adding nuts and seeds to your diet., Fight the presence of dirt and pimples across your body, not just your face. Regular bathing to clean your body off is good prevention, as is making sure you do so after working out to clean the sweat off your body.If you already have body acne, use gentle cleansers rather than the tougher astringents used on your face.Change and clean your bed sheets regularly. When you roll around in the sheets, you wind up leaving your own dirt and dead skin. Regular cleaning of your sheets will help prevent you from sleeping in your own filth, which keeps it off of your skin., Every person’s body is a little different, and your ideal weight will be in a range determined by your height, health, and activity level. Talk to your doctor about an appropriate weight for your circumstances.Related to your weight is the presence of fat or flab in certain parts of your body. Pinpoint those specific areas that make you uncomfortable. Create a fitness plan that will target those areas.
To help control your weight, you will need to keep an eye on your calorie intake. If you are trying to lose weight, don’t reduce calories too much. You do need energy to exercise and keep up with your life. If you are trying to lose weight, look for plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These options will help provide fewer calories, and are healthier options that will give you the energy to stay active., Having muscle tone and definition aren’t the only ways to look good, but they certainly can improve the look of your body. If you want to build muscle, exercise and diet will get you there.


Choose the areas you want to improve. Specific exercises can be done to tone any part of the body. For abs, try crunches or other core-intensive workouts. To tone arms, try push-ups, pull-ups and weightlifting. Just like a weight-loss plan, you'll want to choose a work-out routine that meets your goals. Just remember to stretch before any exercise.
You’ll want your diet to include proteins, which help build muscle. Meats like ground beef, chicken, and eggs all pack a good protein punch. If you aren’t a big meat-eater, other foods like almonds and cottage cheese are also high in proteins., You’ll want about 13 cups worth every day. Water helps keep your skin clear, will keep you from eating heavily at meals, and keep you hydrated for workouts., Without clothes to distract, or send a particular message, the way you carry yourself is vitally important to being comfortable and confident in your own skin. Even if you aren’t feeling confident, faking it can help trick yourself into feeling more confident.


Have good posture. Stand or sit up straight to make yourself appear taller. Keep your chin up and shoulders relaxed for a confident pose. These are good tips when dressed, too, but even more important when it is harder to hide yourself with clothing.Smile. A friendly face can project confidence in yourself, which is always more attractive to the other person.Look forward and maintain eye contact. This can create a strong connection with your partner. Additionally, it will subconsciously force them to look at your eyes rather than other parts of your body.If you’re still a bit nervous about being naked around another person, this can help keep their eyes from wandering too much.

, You may be comfortable letting your body hair grow wild, but your partner may disagree. Long, unkempt body hair can be unpleasant to look at, and another person will probably like touching it even less. Besides, if you want your partner to touch you, it should be skin, not hair, that gets grabbed.Armpit hair. This is a common part of your body for sweat, and trimming it can reduce sweating. It’s better not to shave it all off, but keep it trim and don’t allow it to grow too wild.
Chest hair. If you are an athlete, this can be a reasonable part of your body to keep clean of hair. Shave slowly, and use an electric razor to get rid of any remaining stubble. You may also consider waxing. Otherwise, an electric trimmer can help you maintain a masculine look (if that’s what you are going for).
Back hair is generally considered less attractive. If you don’t like having it, this is a good part of your body to have waxed, as it can hurt less. Plus, it’s hard to shave a part of your body you can’t easily see.
Genital hair. Like your chest and armpits, it is unusual for a man to be perfectly clean down there, unless you are an athlete looking for an aerodynamic edge. Use an electric razor to keep your hair trim and tame. This will cut down on sweat and odors, and can make you look bigger.

, Your comfort isn’t just about confidence. A little effort on the environment will make both of you more comfortable without clothes, and can really help to set the mood.Get the room temperature right. There are a number of factors that go into determining the most comfortable temperature, which is usually matter of personal preference.If you are naked, though, you may want the room temperature to be slightly higher than usual, since you won’t be wearing any clothing. Colder temperatures reduce blood flow, causing parts to retract into your body for warmth, which makes them smaller.Keep the lights dim. If you and your partner still aren’t completely comfortable naked with one another, low lighting can help hide a few things. Plus, it can create a more romantic atmosphere, if that’s what you are going for. If you are really daring, and not worried about setting off the fire alarm, consider candles instead of your lamps.
Deodorize your room. You’ve focused on your body odor, but you don’t want your room to smell too. Keeping the room clean and avoiding clutter is always a good way to reduce odors. A quick spray with some basic fragrance should be enough to cover any unusual smells, especially on short notice.

, There will always be some insecurity when you have your clothes off, which is probably also true for anyone with you. Lighten the mood with a joke, or try to find something humorous in your situation. Laughing will make you both feel more comfortable, and laughing together helps create a greater connection between the two of you., This doesn’t need to be while you are naked. Feeling someone else’s hands touching you can remind you that you aren’t just the image you see in the mirror. Someone else touching you helps you feel attractive, like someone worth touching.If you are in a relationship, let your significant other touch you. It doesn’t need to be erotic. A nice shoulder rub or a hug will let you know your partner finds you attractive.
If you are single, or don’t have anyone that you would let touch you, getting a massage is a great way to find an outside pair of hands. Plus, you’ll probably feel more relaxed afterwards.

Understand Ragdoll.,
Analyze yourself.,
Get Creative.,
Explore Ragdoll Art.,
Play dress-up.,
Make your fashion practical.,
Spread the love.,
Build the network.,
Live, love, and be a ragdoll!",How to Join the Ragdoll Culture," Ragdoll is a culture centered around self expression. The aesthetic mode of self expression is ragdoll-style garb. For example, patches, Zippers, buttons, ect. The Ragdoll style is LOUD and is intended for people LOUD on the inside as well! It has an old yet edgy feel much like steampunk does. The Ragdoll culture is mostly solitary and many Ragdolls don't know that they are Ragdolls. There is little-to-no online culture and in real life running into Ragdolls is rare.;
, The question is not, 'How do I become a Ragdoll?' The true question is, 'Am I a Ragdoll?' As stated above, many Ragdolls are unaware they are Ragdolls. There are many people who enjoy the Ragdoll art style, admire the fashion, or identify with the attitude without even knowing it. Here is a list of things you may want to ask yourself. If you answer yes to most or all of them you may be interested in the culture.


Do you enjoy ragged style?
Do you like stitching, patches, mixed materials?
Are you a quirky person?
Do you enjoy Tim-Burton films?
Do you like to project your emotions outward with the way you dress?
Are you an individual?
Are you highly expressive?
Do you express yourself in what you wear?
Do you like to dress up in costumes/cosplay?
Do you appreciate the avant-garde?

, If you feel like the Ragdoll culture might be for you, express your artistic potential within the Ragdoll style if you already haven't. Try stitching, patching, 'dolling-up' clothes, ect. You don't have to be good at it, you don't even have to peruse Ragdoll art yourself, but exploring your own potential may help you get in touch with your Ragdoll spirit!

, Ragdoll art is pretty neat and it is the style Ragdoll is based around! Tim Burton makes great Ragdoll-style movies. Fashion wise there are many great independent artists/designers you can enjoy. The Same goes for pictorial art. Since ragdoll is a shy, emerging culture you will may struggle to find things overtly identified as ""Ragdoll culture."" So, don't look for what calls itself Rag doll, look for what you think is Ragdoll, this way Ragdoll style art shouldn't be hard to find.

, Don't let the prospect of dressing ragdoll scare you away. Being Ragdoll is like being in any other fashion-expressing subculture/fandom, it is way to express yourselves at different levels. Some only identify on the inside and some wear the full-suit. Though you may not want to go around dressed ragdoll, it is fun to make costumes for parties and even just to wear around the house. You can even do Ragdoll-style cosplays!

, If you want to go full-Ragdoll all the time then more power to you, but chances are you don't. If you want to express your inner passion through fashion without going over the top there are many solutions. You can keep it in the accessories by wearing ragdoll-like knuckle gloves or hand-stitched bracelets. You can ""doll-up"" clothing by cutting and patching old jeans for example. You can even do your hair ragdoll style. Many do this by braiding it if it's longer or just rustling it up if you're shorter.

, Help others to discover their inner Ragdoll, but don't be too pushy. Try to find people who may already be Ragdoll-esque or seem like they would enjoy it.

, As a culture, Ragdolls are solitary and shy. Many Ragdolls do not know others and keep their hobbies private. Spread the word online and in real life to gap the bridges. Since the network online for Ragdolls is basically nonexistent, you have to build it yourself.

, Being a Ragdoll is truly a personal identity. Since it is not a huge community you truly have to be happy with yourself and not worry about feeling alone, though many do sometimes. Realize you are Ragdoll and love being who you are! It's as simple as that!

Bike everywhere you go.,
Take public transportation.,
Buy an environmentally friendly car.,
Walk more.",How to Live Like a European1," In 2013, more Europeans bought and rode bikes than they did cars. The 3.6 million people who bike in Great Britain is almost twice the number of people who travel by car. In Greece, there are over five times more bikers than there are drivers. Instead of relying on your normal routine, buy a bike and take it to work. You will be travelling like millions of Europeans while saving money and improving your health., Most European nations have extensive bus and train systems that are utilized daily by residents. Germany has the Bahn, Italy has the Metropolitan, and Paris has the Métro, which locals take around these cities everyday. Instead of taking your car to work, figure out the bus routes that go between your house and work. You can also take a metro train. This will make you feel more European and save you money in the process.One of the most multi-functional public transit systems is in London, which has Transport for London (TfL), an extensive network of buses, underground and overground trains, ferries, and trams that run all hours of the day. The TfL is also affiliated with an airline and cross country train service. The Brits take these modes of transportation everyday, wherever they go. The red double-decker buses that litter the streets of London are known all over the world., An overwhelming number of Americans drive large, gas-guzzling SUVs, while Europeans lean toward small, compact cars that get a much better fuel consumption rate. In Italy and France, you are much more likely to find a Fiat 500, Mini Cooper, and Smart car than you are a Cadillac Escalade. This is mostly due to how little space there is on the streets, especially in big cities. If you need to drive, or just prefer it, think about buying a Fiat 500 or Mini Cooper. Not only will the cars help you feel like an Italian, they are easier to drive around, are cost efficient, and better for the environment., Whether it is shopping or going out with friends, many Europeans take their time and walk to the shops or restaurants that they need to get to. The design of the city of Paris is made for strolls, with its walkways along the Seine River, sidewalk cafes on every corner, and large, tree-lined avenues. Try walking more in your everyday life. Walk to the store to pick up a few things or walk to a local restaurant for dinner.Europeans also tend to go for evening strolls. There is rarely a night that you don't see people strolling through the streets of Venice or through the parks in France. Add in a nice after dinner walk with your spouse, family, friends, or roommates. It helps you unwind after the day and will give you time to spend with those you care about.If you don't live in a place that is necessarily conducive to walking, try driving near wherever you need to go and then walk to the specific location you need to get to. This allows you to walk more and you can cut out some of the stress of traffic and parking.

Spruce up your usual look.,
Liven up the non-negotiables.,
Make time for things you love.,
Mix it up at meal time.,
Establish daily rituals.",How to Jazz Up Your Everyday Life1," While you might think that clothing choice and hair styles are strictly superficial considerations, studies have shown that these small choices can have a big impact on your emotional state and sense of well-being.Getting a new, sassy haircut or overhauling your wardrobe can make your whole life feel refreshed and renewed, so don't dismiss the importance of personal style when trying to change your life. Even a bright new accessory can make a difference.


Consider dying your hair a fun, non-traditional color if you really want to shake up your look and the way others perceive you. The stigma of punky, bright hair has largely faded, but the bright color can still make you feel bold and unique.Start off with a demi-permanent dye if you're hesitant and you won't have to worry if you don't like it.;
, Some aspects of your daily routine are non-negotiable: just because you’re feeling bored, you can’t stop brushing your teeth, paying bills, or cleaning the house. This doesn’t mean you’re doomed to a life of drudgery, though. You can spice up your life by changing the way you do these daily tasks.


For example, try listening to music while brushing your teeth, getting ready in the morning, and sitting in traffic during your commute. This little change can make a huge difference to your day, energizing you for any challenges you might face as well as de-stressing and distracting you from the daily grind.Get yourself excited for household chores by listening to an audiobook or podcast, or arranging for an incentive like a yummy dessert or shopping trip after you’ve finished.

, You might be feeling blasé about your life because you’re not devoting enough time to recreational activities. All work and no play makes anyone a dull boy, so make sure to incorporate some time each day—even a half hour makes a difference!—to things you love. Not only will it make you feel more satisfied with life, it’s also been shown to have numerous mental and physical health benefits.Enjoyable hobbies don’t have to be expensive or difficult. Little things like reading books, going for a swim, walking around the neighborhood, watching a favorite television show, or chatting with friends can make a big difference in lightening up your day.

, Experimenting with new recipes and trying new cuisines can make you feel like you’re traveling the world and being adventurous without setting foot outside of town.Pick up a world cuisine cookbook and assign yourself a new country to ‘visit’ every week, or make a list of all the international cuisine restaurants in your area and try to check one off each week or month.


If you’re picky about restaurants and rarely find a new one you like, mix up your routine by ordering new things from your favorite place. You’ll be surprised how many things you’ve never tried on even the most familiar menu, so add some tasty variety to your life by simply changing up your order!
If you love to cook at home but don’t have access to some of the more exotic ingredients new recipes require, consider trying a subscription cooking box that sends you original recipes and ingredients every week.

, You do things every day which you enjoy and find relaxing, such as having a cup of coffee or indulging in a post-workday glass of wine, but you can amp up the impact of these routine activities by creating elaborate rituals around them. This will transform a passing pleasure into a celebrated ritual which you look forward to and cherish. Studies have even shown that daily rituals can make someone perform better at work and cope with personal problems more quickly and effectively.For example, if you enjoy your morning cup of joe, buy yourself a French press and a novelty coffee mug and wake up fifteen minutes earlier each day so you can relish the activity even more than usual.
If one of your favorite ways to relax is taking a long bath, pick up some bath time accoutrements like bath bubbles, a waterproof media player, and aromatherapy candles. What was once a simple, largely utilitarian part of your day will become a luxurious appointment devoted to “me-time.”

Change the ingredients.,
Reduce your portions.,
Try different desserts.,
Buy imported foods.",How to Live Like a European2," In Europe, people are much more into locally grown food and local restaurants. It is hard to go through any major city in Europe such as London, Paris, or Florence without seeing people selling local produce on the side of the street. Find the farmer's market in your town and buy as much fresh food as possible. Also start eating at locally owned eateries. , The average portion size in American restaurants is much larger than most in Europe. Even with home cooked meals, in Europe they eat much smaller portions during each meal. Try to change the portions that you eat. You can make less food at home with smaller portions at each meal. If you go out, try splitting your portions with someone else or taking the leftovers home for lunch the next day.


In France, they each much smaller portions than in America. For breakfast, the French simply have a piece of fruit or a croissant with their cafe latte, if they have breakfast at all. They have larger lunches, where they eat pasta, protein, vegetables, and fruit, typically in large groups. For dinner, the French likely have another small meal with their families, full of fruits, vegetables, and protein. Take your time while you eat smaller portions of foods that you truly enjoy., European desserts are known for being decadent and delicious. Look for a bakery that specializes in European treats. Find some recipes for traditional European desserts. You also might be able to find imported options at the grocery store.Search for an Italian bakery near you. Italian bakeries are known for cannoli, which come in flavors such as traditional ricotta, chocolate, strawberry, limoncello, and even caramel pecan and pumpkin. These bakeries also carry ricotta pie, meringues, florentine cookies, and lobster tails, which are multi-layer pastries.
If you can't find a bakery in your area, try making some recipes at home. Try a traditional German streusel or Black Forrest cake. Make sure you look for recipes that detail how to bake them in the same way they are made in Germany. You want your desserts to be just like they are when they are made by locals.
You can sometimes find European dessert options at a grocery store. Many American companies have put out their own line of gelato, which is kind of like a creamy sorbet and ice cream fusion popular all over Europe, especially Italy.

, There are many foods and brands in Europe that aren't available in America. Even brands that are available in America taste different in Europe. Look for a world market or grocery store that sells imported foods. If you can't find a store, look for international stores online that ship to America.


Look for gourmet cheeses such as Italian Asiago, Parmesan, and Mozzarella or French Brie or Cantalet. Pair them with honey, nuts, or grapes. Try to find imported brands like il Giardino or Henri Hutin instead of the brands distributed in America.Some of the best chocolates you can get are from Belgium. Try Valerie's Gaufre Choco Wafel or Ambiente White Praline chocolate bar.
American candies such as Starburst and KitKat offer different flavors in other countries. Starbursts offers the black currant flavor in Ireland. KitKats in Italy are offered in caramel flavor. Try to find a store that sells these imported candies in order to enjoy the variations of flavors.

Go to pubs.,
Watch European television.,
Change your wardrobe.,
Watch ""football"".,
Change how you measure.",How to Live Like a European3," Many European countries, such as Germany, England, and Ireland, have drinking establishments called pubs or taverns. Unlike bars in America, pubs are full services restaurants where people spend time, play a pub quiz, or bring their families. Though some pubs have extensive cocktail menus, the main thing they serve is beer, wine, and cider. You can spend a whole night in a pub, eating with your friends watching a local band play. Pubs are so popular that there are actually quite a few in America. Look for a pub in your neighborhood. On your next outing with your friends, spend a night away from the hustle and bustle of a bar and settle on a pub instead.If you don't like the pub atmosphere, look for a Spanish tavern called a taberna or tapas bar. They are found in many large cities in America such as Boston and San Francisco. These establishments serve regional Spanish cuisine and have a full wine and cocktail menus.If you can't get to one of these establishments, try some imported alcohol instead. France and Italy are known for their wines, so try out a bottle with a French or Italian vintage. Drink imported beer such as Guinness from Ireland, Chimay from Belgium, Carlsberg from Denmark, Nastro Azzurro from Italy, or Heineken from the Netherlands., Although many European countries air shows from America, they have a rich expanse of television all their own. Whether it's a German soap opera such as Verbotene Liebe (Forbidden Love) or a British crime dramas such as Sherlock, try watching shows made in other countries. You can find many of them online from broadcast networks or steaming companies such as Netflix. As another option, try to find European-based television channels streaming live on the internet or on cable/satellite to get the full experience.


There are options all over Europe to choose from. Britain has great shows such as the sci-fi megahit Doctor Who and the thriller Luther, Denmark has political drama Borgen, and France has horror-drama The Returned, just to name a few.If you aren't a TV person, try some foreign films instead. There are many great international films playing in America at art houses or independent movie theaters. You can also look for European or country-based film festivals in your area such as the Boston French Film Festival in Massachusetts or the Nuovo Cinema Italiano Film Festival in Charleston, South Carolina., Although Europeans and Americans dress in similar ways, there are some things you can do to make you look more European by comparison. European style is typically dressier than American style, but younger Europeans are shifting toward a more casual style. Dress classic and simple. Stay away from over the top ensembles or super casual outfits. Look to London and Paris fashion week, both on the runway and off, for tips about how stylish European women and men are dressing. To know more on what it means to dress European, then go to How to Dress European on wikiHow.


Try stores such as H&M, Ben Sherman, Belstaff, Topshop, Hugo Boss, Topman, Lacoste, Mango, Zara, United Colors of Benetton, and Reiss. H&M, Lacoste, and Zara are popular all over Europe.
If you are a guy, make sure your clothes fit nicely. Avoid bright colors and shorts, unless you are on the coast. Try wearing a nice fitting polo shirt with a pair of fitted jeans. For going out at night, try an earth toned button up or sweater with a pair of dark jeans. You can even add a scarf to tie any outfit together.European women, especially the French, are known for their fashion. Whether they are going to the grocery store or are out for a walk with their children, French women are dressed to impress in skirts, dresses, and heels. Keep your fashion simple but elegant. Wear a pair of skinny jeans in black or red, a slightly chunky sweater, a scarf or long necklace, and a handbag. Top the whole outfit off with designer heels or boots, and you'll look just like you stepped off a street in Paris.No matter your gender, avoid wearing athletic shoes and clothes unless you are doing something sporty. Also avoid flip flops unless you are at the beach. Europeans don't typically wear these kinds of shoes or clothes unless they have a reason to. Wearing unwarranted sporty clothing will make you look like a European delinquent, so try to steer clear of them if you can., American football is something very different than football in Europe. Football, also known as footie, is what Americans know as soccer. Find a team to follow. Learn the teams that are in rivalries and the teams that are likely to go to the Champions League, which is the championship of the sport. You can even get your friends involved, watching it with them at your house or at a local pub.If you are ever asked whether you support one team or another team, it's safest to not answer. Chances are, the teams have a huge rivalry.
Britain, Germany, Italy, Greece and many other European countries are known for their football hooligans, who are rowdy fans who typically cause trouble, destroy property, and get arrested. Although the trend has declined in recent years, there are some Europeans who are still serious about their footie.If footie isn't your game, try to watch tennis or cricket instead. These sports are also popular all over Europe., Europeans use a different system of measurements and temperature. Instead of the Imperial/US customary unit measurements that use inches, feet, and pounds, use the Metric system, which is made up of meters, liters, and grams. You should also start expressing the temperature by Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. This will make you sound like a European and do things in the same fashion as they do. Not only will you sound European, but you will be part of the more than 90% of people all around the world that use the same system of measurement! For example, the Austrians would say that the distance between Vienna, Austria and Munich, Germany is 355 kilometres (221 mi) They would also say the temperature in Vienna was 25 °C (77 °F)

Explore new music and movie genres.",How to Jazz Up Your Everyday Life2," Any new hobby, be it something outrageous and sporty like motocross or something modest and home-bound, will add a much-needed dose of variety to your life. Think about things you’ve always wanted to try, or, if nothing comes to mind, try browsing a YMCA catalog or online forum for suggestions. Your hobby could be an organic outgrowth of things you’re already interested in: for example, if you’ve always loved Saturday morning cartoons or anime, consider trying your hand at cartoon artistry.


It can be especially rewarding to pick a creative hobby that yields tangible results, such as knitting, painting, or preserve-making.Not only will you feel interested and engaged in a new, unfamiliar activity, but you will also feel productive. You’ll have a self-made scarf, portrait, or strawberry jam to concretely display your accomplishments. And, as a bonus, you can use these products of your new hobby as personal gifts for family and friends!

, Many times people feel bored in life because they forget how diverse, surprising, and boundlessly interesting the world around them really is. They see the boundaries of the world as the tiny circle of their own job, family, friends, and expertise, rather than recognizing how much information, skills, and ideas exist outside of this limited, personal realm. You can fix this existential myopia by taking a class and learning a new skill or discipline.


Many studies have shown that learning a language is one of the most rewarding educational experiences an adolescent or adult can do.It not only teaches you a new mode of communication, but also a fresh perspective on the world: with every language and linguistic system, you’ll also learn about different cultures and social structures.
Learning the ""language"" of music is another rewarding way to stimulate your brain. Take music lessons for that instrument you've always loved.
Even though there are a wealth of online-based learning materials like YouTube tutorials and online university courses for all kinds of subjects and skills, consider taking an in-person class. This will provide you with interactive, face-to-face instruction, as well as the opportunity to meet new people and expand your social circle.

, Not only will a new physical exercise pump some variety into your life, but you’ll also feel positive effects on your general mood. This is because physical exercise increases your endorphin production and thus has been shown to significantly improve depression and alleviate symptoms.This is true regardless of your personal interests and tastes: whether you prefer to sweat in solo fashion or take up a team sport, chances are that you can find something active that appeals to you. Browse YMCA catalogs or gym class offerings for ideas about what you can do, or sign up for a home fitness mailing list that discusses options for getting active.


If you already go to the gym regularly, consider mixing up your workout routine with a new class, or you could register for a club sport that will make your gym time more social.

, Even if you don’t live in a major theater and live music capital, you’ll be surprised how many concerts, plays, and dance performances are offered in your area. Checking out these local offerings will add variety to your life as well as make you feel more connected with your community. Music even has numerous mental health benefits, including the reduction of stress levels.Live music doesn’t have to be expensive! For more affordable options, check out music calendars for bars and coffee shops that don’t charge a cover.

, Everyone has a favorite radio station and movie genre, which in itself isn’t a bad thing. The problem is that these favorites can sometimes dig us into a rut, making it so that we don’t try out artists and titles outside of our familiar boundaries.You’ll be surprised how stimulating and thought-provoking different genres can be: studies have shown that discovering new music outside of one’s usual stomping ground makes our brain’s chemistry work in different ways and can even deliver an intense, euphoric feeling.If you want to broaden your cinematic or musical horizons and don’t know where to start, use an ‘All-Time Best of…’ list from Rolling Stone or the American Film Institute as an amateur music or film 101 curriculum.

Be thankful for what you’ve got.,
Accept daily responsibilities.,
Practice small acts of kindness.",How to Jazz Up Your Everyday Life3," Often times you can feel bored or discontented simply because you haven't stopped to think about how much you love what you already have. Take some time to think about what and who you appreciate in your daily life, and ask yourself how you would be affected by losing them. Your reflection probably won’t resolve your restlessness entirely, but it will provide some meaningful perspective on your life and the changes you want to make, as well as afford you numerous mental and physical health benefits.It can help to write down your reflection in a journal or blog. Making a list of things you’re grateful for can be a valuable therapeutic exercise in itself, and having this written list can serve as an effective reminder later., Make a list of all the things you have to do each day and which you can’t escape, such as paying bills, buying groceries, and washing your face. Instead of showing you how boring and routinized your life is, you can see it as showing you how much freedom you actually have: sure, you have to do the things on the list, but that’s all! Every moment in your life not taken up by these non-negotiable responsibilities is open to experiment, novelty, and excitement.


If you feel like you only have time for work, ask yourself if you can cut back on your hours or work remotely one day a week. Get serious with your calendar and try to open up a day of each week that you can devote to new activities.

, Studies have shown that doing good for others constitutes one of the most enriching and satisfying things for people from all cultures and ages.You can do this in your daily life with minimal effort—for example, hugging a friend, opening the door for someone, or holding the elevator for a lagging stranger—or take on more official roles and responsibilities. Volunteering for a soup kitchen or animal shelter, picking up litter for highway cleanup task forces, or collecting signatures for a civic petition are all valuable ways you can contribute to your community while spicing up your day-to-day routine.


If you live in a small town where volunteering opportunities are limited or you have mobility issues, you can still contribute meaningfully to your community and make a big difference in other people’s lives. Consider signing up for an online- or phone-based support network, sending emails for a charity organization, or raising money via mail or online campaigns for your favorite philanthropic group.

Go for a well-trusted product.,
Do a small patch test before applying any lightening product on your skin.,
Apply consistently and according to product instructions.,
Avoid areas that are already the “right” complexion.,
Moisturize.,
Use sun block.",How to Lighten Embarrassing Blemishes With Lightening Cream," The first step in getting the best results out of a lightening formula is to choose a well-trusted product. A good product should not contain harmful lightening ingredients like hydroquinone and mercury. It should also treat existing discolorations while preventing melanin production.;
, Apply a bit of the cream under the ear, on the arm or on any other cover-able patch of skin and observe for 48 hours. If no inflammation or irritation occurs, it means the product is probably safe for you.

, Consistency is crucial when using lightening creams. Some blemishes can take longer to even out, so it's important to follow the instructions indicated on the product label or leaflet. You may start seeing results as early as 2 weeks or as long as 6 weeks or more, depending on the degree of discoloration on your skin and the power of your product.

, Avoid applying lightening cream on non-dark areas. The point is to even out the blemishes, not to make the rest of your skin lighter than it already is.

, Lightening parts the skin may cause over drying, especially for people with extra-sensitive or excessively dry skin. This is why moisturizing is recommended once you’re done using the lightening bleaching cream. You may apply an all-natural skin moisturizer or use Vitamin E oil to seal in moisture.

, When spot lightening, avoid the outdoors after applying cream to parts of the body that are usually exposed, especially the face. Many skin blemishes are the result of excessive sun exposure. Use sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor of at least 15 when venturing out, especially after you've just applied lightening formula on your skin.

Slow down.,
Value community over convenience.,
Smile less.",How to Live Like a European4," Americans often rush between one activity and the next, forgetting to take time to enjoy life. Europeans take time in their day to enjoy things. Whether it's long lunches in France, midday respites in Italy, or siestas in Spain, Europeans know how to relax and enjoy the small things. Take half an hour to regroup and destress in the afternoon. Enjoy your lunch hour instead of rushing around and scarfing your food down.One of the best ways to accomplish this is to take longer vacations. On average, Europeans receive and take more vacation days than people in America. Instead of skipping your vacations until you have more money or less to do at work, take your week long vacation and enjoy yourself. Plan a trip that won't break the bank or spend the week relaxing with those you love. Just don't think about work and leave all your stress behind., Europeans know when to sit and enjoy each other's company. In France, people often take long, extended lunches where they congregate in groups to socialize and eat a meal together. Instead of skipping dinner with your family because you are all too busy, sit down and eat together. You can all talk about your day and enjoy each other's company without rushing around.Americans are often overly nice to each other and can become sensitive when someone tells them something they are doing wrong. Europeans tend to be more critical, but in a constructive way. The French are known for their frankness and are typically thought of as too honest. When your friends ask how they are doing on a task, tell them the truth instead of trying to preserve their feelings. They will become a better person for it and you will have a closer, more honest relationship with them., In Europe, people don't typically smile at everyone they pass like they do in America. In Germany and France, you won't see locals walking around, saying ""Guten Morgen"" or ""Bonjour"" and smiling at people. They save their smiles for occasions that warrant smiling, which makes the act more genuine. Instead of smiling at everyone you see or when you really don't mean it, smile only when you are truly pleased or amused by something. This will make your attention more special and make you seem more European."

Get tons of exercise!,
Eat healthy!,
Have good hygiene!,
Wear clothes you feel comfortable in!,
Be beautiful and tell yourself you're beautiful!","How to Live a Happy, Healthy Life (Women)"," One of the problems I dealt with was weight. All you need is a fun activity that helps you burn fat. If you don't like strict workouts or videos, then maybe try finding some fun activities to do with friends and family! For example, a bike ride or hiking. Just make sure you incorporate 30-60 minutes of working out in everyday!;
, This can sound hard to some, but really it's not that hard! All you have to do is portion what you eat. You can still have soda and sweets. But make sure you know how it's going to effect you! Soda is an average of 155 calories! That can really add up in the day if not watched. But with 155 calories you could make low-calorie French toast. Even more food to fill you up for a small amount of calories rather than a small 12 oz. Coca-Cola.


A big step in eating healthy is recognizing the food groups you should be eating daily. Fruits and veggies are great for snacking and you can literally eat as much as you want! Another step is recognizing the foods you should eat small portions of. Flour and grain products. A big no-no in eating healthy. Flour products such as pasta are packed with carbs! Which turn into body fat. Avoid these if you can. (See tips for healthy eating.)







, It's seems very simple, but tons of people in the world will avoid good hygiene habits and don't even know it. An example of good hygiene would be; Taking showers once a day, brushing and flossing teeth 2-3 times a day, wearing fresh clothes, having proper clean nails, and the list goes on. So, the next time you're in the bathroom look around and see what you know is important to do! If your instinct tells you should be brushing your teeth or taking a shower than it's better to do it, than to fall into bad habits.

, Might seem silly but sometimes we all want to fit in with others or celebrities. But ask yourself ""Do I look good in these clothes?"" If you're hesitant and say no then take it off and switch it with something you do like. It's OK to take style tips from people but if it's uncomfortable than don't bother.


Another tip mentioned in step # 3 is having clean clothes. Don't pick up those jeans you wore 5 days in a row and say they're still clean. They're probably not and it's better you throw them in the wash than feel grimy. Last but not least, the most important rule; WEAR CLOTHES THAT FIT. Don't say you want to be an XS and then buy it! There's nothing less flattering than seeing someone with something too big or too small. Just buy something that fits you correctly. Whether you're a XXL or XS.







, Everybody would love to be beautiful like girls in magazines. And you can! To your extent. Ask yourself a question ""What makes me feel beautiful?"" The answer could be so many possibilities. From wearing my hair up or down, to having make-up or no make-up. Do what makes you feel best, not what others look best in. Wearing no-makeup or having your hair up doesn't mean your sloppy or lazy. It means you're you. Just learn to be comfortable with yourself. Last thing; tell yourself your beautiful. Say it out loud by yourself or in your head at work/school. Even if it seems silly just do it. It will raise your confident a ton!

Choose people who know you well and even compare their answers to those of people who are less familiar with you - for example, a co-worker.

, Talk to him or her in person, and try to forgive them. You will then feel very relaxed because in this world, you and only you are most important.

Exercise!,
Dress up without breaking the bank.",How to Improve Your Overall Appearance without Going Broke," Brows can make or break the way your face looks. Put your pointer fingers over your brows in front of the mirror. The best way to get a nice, clean shape is to simply get it waxed or threaded (if you're brave). Get them done at least once to achieve a nice shape. Upkeep the area yourself by tweezing only the hairs that stand out and grow anywhere that aren't within the lines. If you happen to over-tweeze or just don't grow hair where needed, fill them in with eyebrow pencil or eyebrow powder and blend with a brow brush to keep them natural looking.;
, This could include whitening, brushing and flossing more often, or even more extreme solutions such as braces.

, Using natural and organic cleansers and moisturizers is one change that can make a huge difference with your skin. Your skin is a sponge which absorbs anything you put on it. This means it would be a great idea to spend a little more for quality. One thing that works very well is Neem soap. Neem is an Indian plant that does wonders for the skin. Try to look for a soap with no extra additives. if you aren't sure what is good or bad for your skin, Google it! Also Google simple and inexpensive skin product recipes.

, This becomes more fun the older you get. If you have clear skin, don't worry too much about wearing foundation, too much can clog pores and cause acne. If you weren't blessed with great skin, focus on steps 2 & 3 to achieve skin that's fairly easy to control. Neutrogena makes a skin clearing foundation with salicylic acid (this means it will not clog pores).

, Do masks and treatments specifically for your type of hair. Keep it neat with regular trims and try different styles even now and then. Limit dyeing and heat products.

, Try hot yoga. It's simply amazing and free if you learn moves from Youtube. The obvious benefit is to lose weight if necessary but it also greatly improves circulation. After about a week of working out, you will notice that your cheeks become naturally rosier without blush!

, Clothing is very important. Fashion, however, is not. Decide if being constantly trendy (and therefore broke, as you try to keep up) is worth more than be constantly sophisticated and stylish.

, Don't go to any mainstream clothing stores first, like Aeropostale, American Eagle, or Abercrombie. Try going to less mainstream places like Dots and Rainbows. Make sure you actually like the things you're buying. Always ask yourself ""Would I wear this because everyone else wears it, or because it's me?"". If you answer to the first option, put the object back immediately. When you do buy clothes, make sure you have other options to wear them with. Once you find a bunch of things you like, head on over to the dressing room- there's no point in buying something that doesn't fit!

, Here's where you can really express yourself. Don't be afraid to wear that tiara with those light blue skinny jeans, or those jelly bracelets with that little black dress, it's all about YOU!

, Get a few different pairs of shoes. Converses, flip flops, platform boots, heels- there are so many options! Try standing out and maybe buy two pairs of Converses or flip flops, and wear one green one with one blue one! Try different laces, or even use Sharpies.

, Crimp it, curl it, iron it, tease it, braid it- do whatever you want! You could keep your natural color, put a purple strand in it, or go all the way and dye your whole head rainbow; it's up to you.

Whatever your choice, take pride in it!

, You can act however you want, but at the very least you should be kind and not whine.

If you are in grade school or younger, then just don't do the arm workouts! When you start out, do 50 crunches, and go pretty high. Then put your legs to the side, and do 25 side crunches on each side. Then, do 50 bicycle crunches. After doing that, do a set of 30 pushups, 20, and then 10 pushups. Then stretch out, and do that one more time. To work your legs, if you have an exercise ball, use that to work your legs. Otherwise, just jump up and down as high as possible. Do at least 100 of those. Next, for arms, do weights and on each arm, do 50 ups and downs.;
, For breakfast, have an example of toast, with little butter or peanut butter, and to drink have a glass of water, or milk. Also, consider a fruit smoothie, but only have about one small glass of it. Next, for lunch, have some water, a sandwich with meat, or a salad, with carrots and little dressing. If you want something else, get a bag of almonds, or nuts. If you want dessert, then get a very small amount of something like cookies. For a small snack after school, have a lot of water, and a special K bar. They have few calories, and are delicious. For dinner have some meat, veggies, and fruit. Have milk, and water too!! When you go to bed, do not eat much, have a glass of warm milk, and maybe a handful of nuts. Try to avoid having a big snack before bed.

, Try to wash your body everyday, and to get everywhere. Also, get your hair washed very well but do not wash your hair every day as this can be damaging. Use both conditioner and shampoo when washing your hair. Lather the roots of your hair in shampoo and then let water wash the shampoo down your hair. Do not apply shampoo directly to your ends. You can apply conditioner all over the hair though.

,, Be happy, content, positive and friendly. Your inner beauty will make your outer self glow!

Shave your legs with a high-quality razor.,
Use an epilator to prevent regrowth.,
Try a depilatory cream.,
Consider laser hair removal.",How to Have Great Legs Without Waxing1," If you're not waxing and want great legs, you should still consider keeping your body hair in check. The most common way of doing this is by shaving via a razor. Make sure you shave with a good shaving gel or cream, as this will result in a closer shave. Run the razor slowly over the hair to remove it. Be slow and gentle to avoid undue cuts. Once you've finished shaving, treat yourself to a nice warm shower; this will rinse off the excess hair and get your legs moisturized.


Use a conditioner on your legs while you're shaving them. This will help result in a finer cut. A good razor is always preferable. If you're wanting great legs, you can't resort to budget supplies. Gillette's Venus Embrace Sensitive Skin razor is a bit pricey in comparison with other blades, but it's nonetheless recommended for its quality and ease-of-use. ;
, An epilator may be purchased and used to much the same effect as waxing.Much like waxing, it involves tearing out multiple hairs from the root. While a razor is best for getting the hair away at the start, an epilator will give your legs a waxy feeling of smoothness. Purchase one from your local beauty section, and run it slowly over your legs.Because it is pulling your hair out from the roots, epilators are as potentially painful as waxing. This is why it's better to shave your legs and use an epilator as maintenance.

, Depilatory creams dissolve hair on the surface of your skin. Due to the fact that these creams don't target the roots of hair, choosing this option means you will have to use the creams quite often-- every couple of days, or however often it suits you. On the plus side however, the routine itself is easy and painless, so you may find it a favourable alternative to the less frequent, but infinitely more painful process of waxing. , Laser hair removal is one of the most commonplace cosmetic procedures out there. Lasers will destroy the hairs within three to seven sessions, and the effects are usually permanent. Although prices will vary depending on where you are living and the number of sessions, it's a fairly affordable way to do without leg hair, considering all the time it will be saving you in the long run. Possible skin damage caused by the laser therapy is very uncommon, but has been known to occur. You should take this possibility into account when deciding. Bring it up with your doctor if you have any lasting concerns.
Wear sunscreen on your legs while they're recuperating. This will help ease the process of recovery.

Tan your legs.,
Give yourself a leg massage.,
Exfoliate your skin.,
Explore tattoos and other body art.",How to Have Great Legs Without Waxing2," Many people consider tanned legs to be attractive. If you want a tanned glow to your legs, you have a few options. The most natural (and, arguably, the most enjoyable) of these is to tan naturally. If you live somewhere hot enough in Spring or Summer, you can go out and sunbathe yourself a good tan. Otherwise, tanning salons are quite abundant in city centres; find one close to you and attend sessions fairly regularly for a consistent glow.


If you're tanning naturally, take care to use sunscreen. Overexposure to the sun can lead to serious skin problems, which obviously won't help you on your quest for perfect legs.
You can use a fake tan product like bronzer if you lack the time or means to tan naturally. Just make sure not to overdo it, as the effect of using too much can be comedic and cartoonish.

, Using your preferred type of herbal oil, a calm and thorough leg massage can be a pleasant and effective way to encourage blood flow and give your skin a renewed glow. Although the effect won't last more than a day, the routine itself can be a perfect way to wind down in the evening, so you won't feel hard-pressed to make time for it after a day of working.


Getting someone else to do this may prove more stimulating and effective.

, If you're not exfoliating already, you may find exfoliating gives your legs an invigorated glow and radiance. After you shower, take a loofah, scrub or pumice stone and gently rub your legs in a soft, circular motion. The friction will remove dead skin flakes, leaving your legs looking (and feeling) better than before. Because it's recommended you exfoliate after the shower, it's usually easy to work this into your daily hygiene schedule. , Though it depends on your personal taste in aesthetics, some people find tattoos to be a powerful accent on their bodies. A visible tattoo on your leg can make your leg that much more unique and personal. Failing that, certain times of body art, such as henna, may be used as a temporary way to beautify legs. Your body can be your very own living canvas.

Get enough sleep.,
Eat a proper diet.,
Practice Yoga.,
Do leg-focused stretches and exercises.,
Go running.Running is the most recommended exercise if you're looking to tone and improve your legs.",How to Have Great Legs Without Waxing3," You can't expect your body to look anywhere near as good as you'd like if you're not investing enough hours a day towards giving it the proper rest it needs. While you've no doubt heard before you should be sleeping around 8 hours a night, you should try to get at least 6 if your daily schedule won't permit setting aside a third for slumber. It's equally as important that you get to sleep at the same time each evening. This way, your body will get accustomed to falling into REM sleep much more effectively than if you're falling asleep at erratic hours. Exercise some discipline and set a time to sleep at every night. If you stick to a consistent pattern, you should find yourself feeling better rested than before, even if the amount you sleep remains the same.

, Again, you can't expect to look your best if you don't attend to the basics of proper health. If you adhere to a healthy, whole foods-based diet, your body will thank you by looking better than ever before. While a whole foods-based vegan diet is vastly preferable over anything else, you should customize your new diet to suit your life. Even cutting out basic things like soda pop and other 'empty calories' will help reduce excess strain on your body.

, Yoga is a wonderful way to reduce stress and increase health. More specifically, it has a great toning effect on your legs, as much of the exercise will seek to stretch and work your leg muscles. There are lots of yoga clubs around, and you may find it more enjoyable to partake with a group.

, Exercises like the leg lift and lunge are specifically designed to improve the look, function and feel of your legs.If you have already committed to an exercise regimen, try working more of these leg-focused exercises into your routine. If your legs have a pleasant burning sensation afterwards, you know you've done your part for the day towards getting the legs you want. , While this cardio-heavy exercise is primarily meant to trim fat, the workout it will give your legs will manifest itself as lean muscle. Whether by yourself or with a partner, running is a perfect way to start your morning off right.


If you have much excess weight on you, going running will help trim down your legs.

"
"
Consider the importance of clothing.,
Choose your legwear to match your body and the occasion.,
Choose shoes that compliment your legs.",How to Have Great Legs Without Waxing4," Don't underestimate the way clothing can frame or emphasize your natural physical features! Fashion can have an insurmountable impact on the way you (and your legs!) are physically perceived by others. Generally speaking, you want to consider the occasion and your personal body type when picking out clothing. Your legs will be most directly framed by pants or shorts, but shoes and the rest of your outfit will have an effect. The quality of your legs regardless, dressing in short-shorts in below-freezing weather has never been a good look for anyone.

, A great deal could be written about a choice of legwear. If you're looking to emphasize the quality of your legs specifically however, tight-fitting pants (such as yoga pants) are a great choice, as they help tighten the look of your legs. If it's appropriately sunny outside, you might want to wear a fashionable set of shorts.


Try to avoid boxy or baggy clothing in this case. Baggy jeans and pants will do nothing for the look of your legs., Shoes can have a significant effect on the way your legs are perceived. Ankle and knee-high boots have a shortening effect on legs, so while they may look good, they're a better match for longer legs. If your legs are on the shorter side, you'll have the best luck with shorter shoes, slippers, heels and sandals.

Include a free coupon or some discount in the flier and encourage the reader to take advantage of the freebies.,
Include a call to action.",How to Create an Effective Email Flier," An email flier is in other words a beautifully designed advertisement sent out over the email chain. Hence, you must know for sure what you want to convey to your customers - whether you want to inform them about recent launches in your product line or promote a particular product or services or announce a special promotional offer and so on.;
, Prepare a demographic profile of your customer base identifying their age group, location, preferences, gender, education level, etc. Having knowledge of who you are writing for would help you to meet the requirements of your clients.

,, There are email directories such as iStorez.com that show professional email campaigns from the Internet's top retailers.

You will quickly notice there are some common ""best practices"" used throughout the industry.

, Decide where you want to place the images, whether on top of the flier or in the centre.

, Project the main benefit of your product or service in the headline so that the reader instantly knows what he/she stands to gain. Make it attractive and eye-catching. Remember that the headline should act like a magnet to draw the attention of the readers.

, Don’t use long paragraphs and long winding sentences. Keep the content short and crispy so that the readers can understand what you want to say at first go.

, Directly address the reader and tell him/her about the benefits he/she can get from the products or the services.

, Don’t slap in too many different kinds of fonts in the mistaken belief that it looks creative. It doesn’t. The use of different types of fonts in one fliers creates confusion and makes the flier look amateurish.

, For a profound effect, put one large picture instead of a number of smaller pictures.

, Proper usage of white space makes the copy look interesting and attracts the reader.

, It makes the copy look too clumsy.

, Include the link of the appropriate webpage which you want your customers to visit.

Post your flyer.",How to Make a Flyer," You can design a flyer digitally with tools such as Photoshop or Microsoft Publisher. Alternatively, you could design a flyer with pen, pencil, markers, etc., and then photocopy the flier at a copy shop.

, It could be color in the writing, images, even the paper you print on. Color draws the eye and gets attention. Printing in grayscale on color paper can also be a cost-effective alternative to adding color to your flyers.


A color scheme can be very effective.Use a color wheel to come up with basic color harmonies. For example, you could stick to analogous colors (adjacent ones on the color wheel), like different shades of blues and greens. Or, you could use complementary colors, such as red and green.A color matching the image you use in the flyer is even better. For example, if your picture shows a sunrise, you could use oranges and yellows. To make the yellow letters pop, they could be outlined in black.

, Flyer size depends in large part on the function of the flyer and your ability to produce flyers of a certain size. It’s easiest to print digital flyers on printer size paper (8.5 x 11 inches). So, your flyers can be that size, or you might want to cut them in half or quarters if your flyer doesn’t need to be as big (e.g. if it’s a handout). Your fliers can be any size, though, and you can make larger size flyers relatively easily if you’re going to a printer that prints that size.

, Are you planning on hanging your flyer inside on a bulletin board or outside on a telephone pole? Maybe you plan on handing out flyers at an event or in a busy part of town. Maybe you’re even using the flyers for a mailing. If the flyers are to be hung outdoors, consider printing on stronger paper and with waterproof ink.

, Make it big, bold, and simple. In general, the headline should be no more than a few words, fit in one line across the page, and be centered. A headline can be longer, but the briefer it is, the better the chance it has to capture someone’s attention.

, The lettering in the headline should be bigger than any other lettering on the flyer. You want most people to be able to read it quickly from about 10 feet (3 meters) away. You’ll usually want the headline spaced evenly across the entire width of the page. If it doesn’t quite fit or fit nicely, consider centering the text.

, Look at any newspaper's front-page headline; that industry figured this out a long time ago. Don’t get too fancy with this font, as your primary goal here is readability. You can add flair to other parts of the flyer if it adds to your message.

, You are trying to grab attention with your flyer, and convey your message in often fractions of a second. Complicated messages and content will likely not make an impact. More detail can follow in the body of the flyer.


Do not make people have to think deeply about the content your flyer—it should communicate your message at an almost intuitive level. Think catchy and fun.
Which headline jumped out at you? If you're like most people, the ""puppies and ice cream"" caught your attention. That's not because everybody likes puppies and ice cream; it's because it is bright red, a color that naturally draws the eye. (However, obviously many people like puppies and ice cream, and the unexpected and humorous content adds to the effectiveness.)

, This should be about two or three lines. Since the title is brief and short, the subtitle elaborates on the title, providing more detail of what you’re talking about specifically. Read newspaper subtitles or even press releases for examples.

, While your headline captures people’s attention and leaves them wanting to know more, the body of your flyer is the payoff where you drive home your message. Include pertinent information like the 5 Ws: Who, What, When, Where, and Why. These are questions that people will naturally ask about your call to action. Put yourself in your audience’s position. What would you want to know?


Be direct and to-the-point. Make your description text concise but appropriately detailed.

, The body of your flyer is also a good place to include testimonials or endorsements.A good testimonial not only provides more detail, but it legitimizes your efforts through a third-party source. If a reader can read your content from your perspective or from an endorser’s perspective, they’re more likely to follow your call to action.

, To emphasize key words, use capitalization, a slightly bigger or bolder font, italics, and other visual hooks. However, do not use these options all at once; choose one or two special effects. Too much creative formatting may look juvenile at best and a bit insane at worst.


Use words and phrases that might make your offer more enticing: ""FREE"", ""NEW"", ""REWARD,"" etc. These are enticing, but also eye-catching, and they can encourage viewers to follow your call to action. Of course, only include these terms if they actually hold true to your advertisement. You don’t want to mislead your audience.
Use the word “you”. This way, you’ll be appealing directly to the reader., Add bullet points to organize your message. Boxes surrounding your copy or bullet points can also provide organization, while adding visual appeal.These effects might also make your copy look more professional or business-like, which might be important to your overall look and feel.

, The copy in the body of your flyer does not have to be the same as that of your headlines. Your flyer may have to stand out, so using something different than everyone else may be smart. Your word processor should already be loaded with a number of font options, but if they don’t have exactly what you have in mind, consider downloading a new font. Many sites offer free and easy downloads of unusual and unique fonts.

, Include your contact info—preferably at the bottom of your flyer, so that the flyer’s most important information remains at the top. Add your first name and whatever form of contact you prefer: phone number and/or email address are most common.


You can also use the time-honored ""tear-off"" method: create a condensed version of your flyer text in a smaller font, rotate it 90 degrees and repeat it several times across the bottom of the flyer. Make a partial cut between each occurrence so people can tear off the contact information conveniently.
Do not put any information that is private. Do not, for instance, use your last name or give a home address.

, A picture is often as important as any words. The human brain will often notice a picture before words. Now that you have the reader's attention, take advantage of it! Give the reader something to look at—people tend to remember concrete, visual messages even more than words. So an image is an effective element, whether it is a logo, a picture of a lost dog, or a graphic.

, You don’t necessarily need to create an entirely new image. Consider using one of your own photos or using an image in the public domain that you’ve found online. Some computer programs and suites, such as Microsoft Office, also offer a variety of stock images.

, This will make the image more noticeable from a distance once it's printed on the paper. If you don't have an image editor, a free app like Picasa (http://picasa.google.com/), from Google, will work fine.


Try to use only one image if you can. If necessary, you can include two images side by side, but any more than this will make the flyer too cluttered, which makes it less likely to catch someone's eye.

, If you’ve hooked the reader, she’s coming in closer now for the details. A good caption can drive home the message of the image. It can also serve to reinforce or add detail to the compelling stand-alone copy you’ve included on the flyer.

, Framing your picture might help “anchor” it to the flyer, instead of just having it float out there as a stand-alone insert. Consider inserting a border or light shadow around it. For emphasis, you might even include stars or an arrow pointing to your picture.

, Before making a lot of copies of your flyer, test it out by taping it up on a door to review it yourself. Stand back from it about 10 feet (3 meters) and have a look. Do the main points jump out at you? Looking at the sample flyer here, you can see immediately that it is for a lost dog.


Proofread the entire flyer to make sure all the information is accurate and the spelling and grammar are correct.A good way to critique is to ask a friend or family member who has not seen your flyer to take a look at it, and see if they get its message right away.

, Now that you've completed your flyer and tested it, print as many copies as you need.


If it's too many for your printer to handle, or if you're expecting rain (the ink output of most home printers will run if left in the rain), find a local copy or office supply store and use a self-serve copier.
Black-and-white copies are generally cheaper than color, but do not have the same impact as color. If you decide to go with black-and-white, you might try this: instead of printing the headline and any colored words, leave those sections blank and write them in by hand with a colored marker. Even using a highlighter works well.

, Where should you post it? Well, where are the people who you want to reach?


If you lost your kitty in your neighborhood, post your flyer on telephone poles, bus stops, the local convenience store, the coffee shop, laundromat, at local swimming pools, and any other nearby gathering places.
If you lost your purse downtown, post flyers as near as possible to the last place where you know you had your purse. Note that in urban areas there are often restrictions on what you can post, and where––since it's easy to find you, don't flaunt the regulations! Try coffee shops, public bulletin boards, and if you see a pole that's covered with flyers—it's fair game!
If you are trying to reach a college or other school audience for your club, generally there are rules and even traditional places to put postings. It is usually a combination of what works (hallways, the doors to bathrooms, homeroom hand-outs) and rules about where it is acceptable to post these things.

Write down the main purpose of your flyer. For example, one purpose might be: “To get people to come the Joe’s Furniture flash sale on Friday.” This will help you clarify exactly what your flyer needs to convey.
You don’t want any paragraphs or large chunks of text in your flyer.;

, Whilst it's good to let them know, you know what you are talking about, people don't like to be force fed large bodies of text. Especially when it has been pushed through their letter box.

, What is your unique selling point? You need to think about this carefully as it could make or break you.

, Is it a product aimed at the masses or the lucky few? Is your advertising aimed at home owners or businesses? Design appropriately. Don't try to please everyone or your advert will become vague and unspecific.

This will bring your overall average down. When you have multiple classes, your notes and handouts can get kind of mixed up. This can lead to you to miss information, which can cause you to fail a class. Make a folder for the class you are failing. Keep the necessary notes and worksheets together in a color folder so you never lose papers. Put any papers from that class into the folder every day. This way, you won't miss anything and can keep up with the classwork.


If you are more organized, you will be more efficient when you study. Not having to flip through tons of papers scattered throughout your bags will help you streamline the process and have more time to study on the material that is giving you trouble.;
, Missing class often is a major cause of failing grades. You get behind and cannot catch up. If you miss school or class often, you will not know what the teacher wants you to learn. You also won't understand their expectations for assignments and tests. This can cause a failing grade. Even missing one class can hurt you because you will miss a lot of necessary information for upcoming tests. This will not help you bring up your grade. If you have to miss class for an illness or school event, make sure you get notes from a fellow classmate. Try to find someone who takes really extensive notes so you will be sure to get any necessary information that you missed while you weren't there., Getting distracted can cause you to fall behind in class and fail assignments. In order to pull your grade up, you have to pay attention in class. Just because you are in class doesn't mean you are mentally present in class. Make sure your mind is present in class. You need to be ready to learn and retain the information. This will help you do better on future assignments, which will bring up your grade.


Make sure you ask questions in class. Whenever your teacher is going over something that you don't quite understand, ask them, ""Can you go over that again? I didn't understand it."" If you don't, you might get behind and miss a lot of important information that is needed for the next test.
The more engaged you are during the class session, the more focused you will be on the material. This will help you be more prepared for the assignments and make better grades on them, which will help you get a higher grade., You may be failing a class because you don't know the information needed to pass the assignments in the class. When your teacher talks about the material in class, write it down. Try to mark or indicate which concepts are discussed more than others because those are the ones you are likely to be tested on. If your teacher tells you that something is going to be on the test, mark that in your notes so you know to study that area extra hard.


Don't stress about the structure or handwriting of your notes. Just get all the information down so you can refer back to it later. As long as you can understand them when you study, you'll be fine.If you find your mind wanders when you write notes, try writing them in cool colors or changing colors every few sentences. This will keep your mind engaged on the material and also make your notes look more interesting when you review them later.

, If you have any work that you forgot to hand in, submit it as soon as possible. Your teacher may accept any late papers, though you may not get full credit for whatever you handed in late.


Try to get a planner to write down when certain works are due. This may help prevent you from forgetting any work, which would bring down your grade.

, One reason you have been failing may be because you only understand the content in certain situations. You need to be able to apply whatever you are learning to the larger picture. If you only understand the information in one way, you cannot translate it to other situations. This will cause you to miss questions on exams and do poorly on papers because you can't think critically about the information., You might be failing because you don't respond well to a certain teaching method. If you are having trouble with a teacher, let them know that you aren't responding to the way they are teaching something. They may be able to help you understand it in a different way. You should also talk to them if you just don't understand the material overall. Find out when they are available and ask for a meeting with them. Ask them questions such as, ""I am having a hard time understanding the information in this class. Can you help me understand?"" They are the authority on the subject and can help you with the material that is giving you a hard time.


They can also help you come up with ways to study for the next exam or ideas for your next paper. They also may be able to give you more notes or readings that will help you figure it out.Make sure you don't depend on your teacher to provide you with a step by step guide on what is on the exams. You need to show effort and understanding or you could fail other classes in the future., A good way to bring your grade up is to do extra credit assignments. This can give you more points on an assignment that you failed. It can also give you an extra grade that will help bring up your overall average. Ask them your teacher, ""Is there any way to do an extra credit assignment? I have been working hard to bring my grade up and I would like a little help."" If they see you are serious about bringing your grade up, they might be more inclined to give you an extra credit assignment to help bring up your failing grade.You can also ask if there is a way to redo an assignment, especially if you understand the concepts better now. You can ask your teacher, ""I had a hard time on the last assignment we got back. I understand it much better now that I have gotten some help and studied more. Is there a way that I can redo it?""

, Check to see if your school has a peer tutoring program. In these programs, students that are studying the same material are there to help you work through the assignments and learn the materials. The major benefit of this is that they are on the same level as you and are working on the same assignments. This will make it easier for them to help you with the questions you have.If you are intimidated by your teacher, you may be more comfortable asking for help from your peer. Try asking them, ""Can you help me understand this material? I'm failing but trying to bring my grade up."" You can also ask them any questions that you have about your upcoming assignments.

, Some teachers make a test worth more than homework. For instance, say you get a D on an algebra test and a D on an inequality worksheet. Some teachers will put in one D for the worksheet and two D's for the test. Some, on the other hand, will just give you one D on the worksheet and one D on the test.

, You may be failing due to poor time management. In order to change your grade, you need to introduce more effective time management skills into your life. If you want to bring up your grade, you need to work hard to get all your work done and still have time to study. To do this, lay out the assignments in all of your classes for the rest of the semester. Also lay out any other obligations, such as work, after school activities, or social engagements. Mark each event on the calendar starting with the most important. This should be the work for the class you are failing. Then fill in the rest. This way, you will know exactly what you need to do and how long you have to do it.If you have overlap, you may need to sacrifice some obligations. Being over-committed to projects can cause you to fail. You can't skip assignments in other classes, but if it is a school activity or social engagement, you may not be able to do it if you are serious about bringing up your grade.
If your work overlaps too much, try to rearrange your schedule with your boss. Explain what the problem is and see if anyone would be willing to switch shifts with you., Since homework is often graded, you should be doing every bit of homework to ensure that grade is as high as possible. It is also one of the best ways to stay current with the material you are learning in class is to do your homework. Don't let it pile up. If you get backed up, you will miss needed information for tests and other assignments. The more backed up you are, the less new material you will understand. This could be the reason you failed assignments in the past. You also will learn the information as it comes and not have to worry as much about cramming to learn all the information for the test the night before.If you have questions as you do your homework, it helps to jot them down as they come. That way, you can ask your teacher as soon as you see them and figure out what you don't understand.
Try to start your homework soon after you get home from school. Homework is typically a large part of your grade, so you want to make sure you complete it. Plus, the earlier you do it, the more engaged and awake you will be. If you wait to right before you go to sleep to do it, you will likely be more distracted and tired, which will cause you to do sub par work and retain less information.

, The only way to bring up a failing grade is to make better grades on the other assignments. This starts with studying at home. You can't learn the information if you don't study it, so try to commit time each night to studying. Turn off distractions such as phones, laptops, TVs, or music. The more focused you are, the more work you will get done and the more information you will retain.When you read for class, make notes about the readings as you do them. This way, you won't have to redo the readings later when it is time for the exam. This may take a little more time as you go, but you will be ready when exam time comes. This will help you make a better grade.About two weeks before a test, start to review your materials. Read and reread your notes. Make yourself flash cards of the material. If you find that you are having problem spots on certain topics, spend extra time on those sections.

, People sometimes fail because they get stuck on one assignment. Once they get stuck, they put off the work and don't revisit it until it is too late. Procrastination is not an option when you are trying to bring up your grades. When your teacher hands out an assignment, start on it right away. If you wait to the last minute, you are not going to be putting 100% into your work and you will not get a good grade. This will also help you if you get stuck on an assignment. Once you get stuck, you can ask for help from a librarian or teacher.If you have a paper, start your research right away. You will be able to find more in depth research. This will allow you to make much better arguments if you are ready with scholarship on your topic. Also focus on scholarly sources. The better information you have, the better your paper will be.If you have a project, start working on the components of it as soon as possible. The more hard work you put into an assignment, the better your grade will be.

, When a test is coming up, find some people from your class that you can study with. Each of you can help each other study and engage with the material better than you can on your own. Prepare material before you meet and then, when you come together, be prepared to quiz each other, go over problem areas, and review the material most likely to be on the test.Try to include someone who is passing the class you are failing. They are more likely to understand the information. They will also be able to answer questions you have.
You can make games out of the material you need to cover to make it fun and more engaging. Try using a board game and flashcards to mix up how you learn the materials., You may be failing your class because you are too sleepy and drowsy to pay attention in class. You may also do poorly on assignments because you are too tire to devote your full attention to them. Getting enough sleep is necessary for concentration and information retention. If you are sleepy throughout class, you are less likely to take notes or retain the information given in lectures. Try to get 7-8 hours a night so you will be rested for the next day.


This will also help you feel better once you get home the next day as well, which will help you keep up with studying and homework for the class."

Use a real estate flyer template.,
Choose the paper you will use for printing.,
Write an attractive headline.,
Put a lot of pictures on your flyer.,
Keep descriptions and explanations brief and easy to read.,
Use sales-focused language.,
Include contact information.,
Leave viewers with a call to action.",How to Create a Real Estate Flyer," The layout of your flyer can be simplified by using a template that is already in place at your agency or the printer you will use.;
, You will need to know the size and style of your paper in order to create a real estate flyer that fits.


Use standard 8.5 x 11 inch paper or 11 x 17 inches, or make a smaller flyer with a 5.5 x 8.5 paper size.
Select paper that is at least 60# gloss. This is similar to the cover of a magazine in how it looks and feels. You can use 80# or even 100# if you want a flyer that is glossier or heavier, but those paper types are more expensive.

, It should share 1 or 2 special details and grab a potential buyer's attention. For example, a headline could read ""3 Bedroom Town house with Updated Kitchen in Gated Community.""

, This attracts a reader or potential buyer before the text does. Showing instead of telling is more attention grabbing.


Include photos of the inside and outside of the house, as well as pictures of any special details such as a formal dining room, hot tub or updated master bath. Pay attention to staging. For example, place a vase of flowers on the table in a photo, and make sure the pictures show a clean, presentable home.
Make the photos extra appealing by including a nice border around each picture and writing a caption for each one. Potential buyers want to know what they are looking at.

, Instead of long paragraphs, use short descriptive sentences and bullet points.

, Remember that you are selling a dream as well as a home with your real estate flyer.

Help potential buyers imagine themselves living in that house. Instead of saying ""swing set included,"" try ""your kids can safely enjoy the outdoors with a backyard playscape.""

, Make sure your real estate flyer has the agent's name, phone number, email address and website.

,


Invite them to an open house or tell them to schedule a showing today. Share a sense of urgency with potential buyers to drive a quick sale.

Sponsor a local school, sports team, or athlete.,
Use a local or homeowner association (HOA) newsletter.,
Place lawn signs.Start off with a simple sign placed in a freshly mowed lawn to display your great work.,
Try a radio or television advertisement.",How to Advertise Lawn Care1," Creating an eye-catching advertisement is key to success. You want potential clients to be drawn to your business for a variety of reasons. Be thorough and include all pertinent details.


What services you offer is critical. If you are willing to weed-eat, edge, spread mulch, or do something else related to lawn maintenance, you could possibly make a lot more money.
Include all contact information. Your name, company name, email, and phone number are bare minimums.
Pricing will be the focus for most potential customers. Include your pricing information based on the criteria you select. Whether it is one price for all yards, priced by square foot, or based on appraisal, be sure to be very specific.
Cover the most possible area. Ensuring every potential customer sees your advertisement is crucial. Put your flyers in a variety of locations.

Stuff mailboxes.You may encounter a person on the day they feel their weakest, and most unable to juggle all their responsibilities. They might just pay you to lessen the load.
Car windows are a perfect spot for flyers. Pick up the windshield wiper, pop down your flyer so the driver sees it, and put the wiper down. You can cover a diverse audience easily because you don’t know the car owners!
Bulletin boards are a great location. Try laundry mats, libraries, local businesses, grocery stores, the post office, anywhere that will let you put your ad up.
Put them on doorsteps. Better yet, knock on doors and deliver them by hand. Face to face meetings may benefit your efforts since they'll get to see you personally.

;
, This is a cheap but effective way to get your name out there. It does, however, come with a small fee. Most newspaper companies charge by the word, so choose words carefully. Minimize the number of words/letters for price, but don't exclude so much as to make the ad ineffective. At the very least, include the name of your business name, the logo, the type of services offered, contact information, and your website, if applicable.

, School and sport affiliations run deep. Having your sign along the baseline or the outfield fence reaches a new segment of the market, and shows support for the local community. Someone may just want to support a business with similar interests or alma mater.

, Targeting a localized audience may help you reach and cover an entire area more thoroughly. Let the familiarity of a known newsletter be your trusted voice.

, Since the eyes viewing these ads are moving, the lawn signs may need to be more visually appealing than other ads. An expanded, colored logo would be a great modification, but at the very least the company name and contact information needs to be included. As you expand, perhaps you'd be willing to offer a free cut in exchange for ad placement in other yards.

, You will want to focus on ad length, style, and content. Tailor it to the local market you'd like to target. Make it informative and memorable.


Include a catchy slogan or jingle that's simple and positive, Make your lawn look sharp by dawn, trust your business to ""Lawns by John"".

Sell your services as a distinctive solution to a problem. Is your Bermuda grass growing too fast? Does it touch your knees? Call ""Lion Lawns"" to tame your grass.Get a testimonial from a satisfied customer. I used ""A+ Lawn Care"" and my grass has never been better!

Programs to use include the following:Microsoft Power Point
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe Photoshop
Adobe Indesign
Apache OpenOffice Impress
Linux LaTex;
, Your poster design should have one central message or idea that it conveys. This focus should appeal to your audience, so spend some time thinking about who you are trying to reach. All of the elements in your poster should reflect your main idea so that your message doesn’t get lost., Your poster should have a layout that is easy on the eyes and makes sense.There should be a point of focus on your poster which is where the viewer’s eye looks first. This could be a picture or a large font.
Your design should be balanced. Try using a grid when you design to make sure items are centered when you want them to be. If you want your point of focus to be off center, having negative space on the other side will keep it balanced.
Create a path for the viewer to follow. Use lines, color, font weight, and font size to make your poster flow.

, Font choice is one of the most important aspects of creating an effective poster. Your main message needs to be able to be seen from far away, so pick a font that will be clear and easy to read.Different fonts can create different emotions and feelings in viewers, so consider what your focus is to find a font that matches the idea you are trying to convey.
Try using two different fonts that compliment or contrast each other to create a unique design. For example, use two modern fonts, two script fonts, or a serif font with a sans-serif font

, Your poster should be easy to read from at least 5 feet (7.5 meters) away. Make sure your graphics and fonts are large enough to be effective.

, Dpi stands for dots per inch and refers to the amount of spacing between the cyan, magenta, and yellow dots on a printed document. The higher the dpi, the higher the resolution, and the better quality the print will be.The typical dpi for posters is 300 dpi.
Look to your software’s user manual to find out how to change the dpi. Many user manuals are available to read free online.

, The size of your poster is important to effectively be seen by your audience. When choosing the size to print, you should consider where you will be hanging the poster. Posters in a small office can be a bit smaller than posters intended to be hung in a window for an advertisement.


Standard poster sizes in inches are 11x17, 18x24, and 24x36.

, Color can be formatted in RGB or CMYK. It is important to format your document in CMYK for your poster to be printed how you intended it to look. Designing in CMYK will give you a more accurate representation of how your poster will look when it is printed. Changing the settings from RGB to CMYK takes a few simple steps:Click “Color Mode” or “Mode”
Use the drop down menu to set it to CMYK

, The bleed refers to the background color that extends beyond where the artwork will be trimmed. It is important to have some bleed on your document so that you don’t end up with a white border on the edge of your artwork.On some programs, you can set the bleed when you make a new document. There will be a setting that says “document bleed” where you can put in a specific size of the bleed.
You can also set the bleed when you print or export into a pdf. In the marks and bleed section, set the bleed marks to the size you want.
Typical bleed size is 3mm, but it can be larger. Check with your printer to find out what size bleed they would like.

, The trim or crop marks are lines that show the printer where the bleed ends and where the actual edge of the document is. This is also the mark that indicates where the document should be trimmed, so it is important to have.To create crop marks, find the “marks and bleeds” tab when printing to a pdf. Check the “crop marks box” or the “printer’s marks box”.
Some programs automatically create crop marks when printing to a PDF.

, Most printers will want to have your poster in a pdf to print it. There are 3 ways to make a PDF of your poster design.Print to PDF by clicking “file>print” and choosing pdf.
Export to PDF by clicking “file>export” and choosing pdf.
Save as a PDF by clicking “save as” and then choosing pdf.
When you create a PDF of your poster it is also the time to set the bleed size, crop marks, and color format.

, There are a few things to consider when choosing what paper to use for your poster. The weight of the paper and whether or not it is coated (glossy) are the two important things you need to decide.Posters are typically printed on paper with a greater weight like 24# or 28#. The bigger the poster, the thicker the paper should be.
Coated paper works best for posters. Typically a silk or gloss coated paper is used on posters to make them resist dirt and smudges. A thicker coated paper will make brighter and more saturated colors pop.

, Different printers will have different expertise so you need to do some research before sending your poster to print. You want a printer that will work with you and be willing to answer all of the questions you might have.Ask people for recommendations for a good printer to use.
Make sure they will print on the paper you want.
Ask what their turnaround time is to make sure you can get your poster when you need it.

, Find out from the company that will be printing your poster how they would like you to get the pdf to them. If you prefer a certain method, you can ask them if they will let you use it. Most printers can accommodate different delivery methods.


Email the PDF as an attachment.
Upload the PDF to the company’s website.
Save the PDF on a zip drive or CD to bring to the store in person.

, It is extremely important to request a proof from your printer. This will ensure your poster will be printed looking just as you expect it to. You will be able to check the bleed and crop marks to see that they are correct.Most proofs will be a digital file sent to you.
Sometimes you can request a paper proof for an additional charge.
Some printers will let you check the poster as it is being printed. This is known as a “press pass” or a “pass on press”. You can ask if this is allowed, however because of time constraints many printers don’t practice this anymore.

Go guerrilla!Try a variety of methods to create a buzz.,
Draw attention by going viral.,
Try some stealth advertising by putting your ads where they may be not normally exist.",How to Advertise Lawn Care3," You want to cause discussion, to keep people thinking about your business. An added benefit is the frequently lower capital investment needed to get your message to the public. Go direct to your customers with a few different options to maximize your results.


Segway advertising would be an odd way to draw attention. It’s just a matter of putting the ads on segways, and having a blast by driving them around downtown or at a mall. Wave at people, use the novelty of the segways to draw them into a discussion about your lawn care service.
Urinals and bathroom stalls are perfect for captive audiences. Their attention is guaranteed! For urinals, place them on the wall at about eye-level. For stalls just use the back of the door where you’d usually read the graffiti or nothing at all. Finding a way to tie-in the activity to your lawn care could be an unusual way to amuse and be memorable.
Wrap your car!Car billboards are mobile marketing that goes beyond the typical bumper stickers. Supplement the typical car or truck signage with an eye-catching car wrap.

, Many have become famous and successful because of e-popularity, and viral marketing can extend beyond the internet. After something takes off, word of mouth and texts often propagate the message further. A great example of such a phenomenon is the Subservient Chicken campaign.Make a ridiculous video and post it to Youtube or Vine. Shares and forwards will flood the market, making you a brand name.
Create a meme that combines a funny or clever phrase with your company's logo or image.Meme generators are a great way to produce something funny in a minimal amount of time.
Stage a flash mob! The flash mob itself will create a buzz, get recorded and posted online, be talked about. All you have to do is get your advertising in the same area to gain attention.Getting a bunch of people to sing or dance has been successful numerous times.Freeze mobs are pretty clever and attention-getting. Stage one near a large, public area with poorly manicured grass to draw attention.Use a professional organization to book a flash mob for your grand opening.Make a bang and get your company name known.

, Conventional flyer locations reaches a specific market, but being sure to get your advertisements in other hands is difficult. Putting your flyers inside another product is a surprise for the reader, and a possible new set of eyes on your business.


Check out magazines at grocery stores are a great spot to slip in an ad. While waiting in line, grab a handful of flyers and put one each in several magazines.
Doctor and dentist offices are very target-rich environments. They usually have a variety of books, magazines, journals, and assorted periodicals that would be perfect locations to stash your flyers.
Newspapers work perfectly for this technique. Sunday newspapers with their tons of ads works even better. Simply slide the flyers in amongst the coupons and assorted extras.
Library books related to your business are an unconventional target, but they might be a great location. Find books about seeding, watering, mulching, anything related to lawn care, and put in a flyer. The creativity could be appreciated by a potential customer.

Look at your old work.,
Improve your study habits.,
Understand the grading system.,
Start working on big projects early.,
Get help if you need it.",How to Bring Up Your Grade Near the End of the Semester1," If you have a final coming up or a paper that's due soon, it's a good idea to take a look back at the work you've already done for the class. This will help you identify your weaknesses, so you can work on improving them.If you look back at your old exams and you still don't understand why you got the questions wrong, be sure to consult your book or ask your teacher for a more detailed explanation.
Consider asking your teacher what she thinks you should do to get a better grade on your next assignment. She may have more advice for you than what she wrote on your last paper.;
, If you really want a good grade on your next exam, you're going to have to commit yourself to studying. Be sure to set enough time to go over all of your material in detail, and don't procrastinate.Start studying well in advance so you don't have to cram and you have plenty of time to take breaks. You will be much less stressed and much better able to learn if you allow yourself to get up and stretch or take a walk every half hour or so.
Make sure you know what kind of learner you are. Some people learn better from reading and writing (visual learners), while others learn better from listening and speaking (auditory learners). Also, some people benefit from studying with groups, while others do not. If you know which methods work best for you, you will be much more successful.
Having a dedicated space for studying that is well-organized and free of distractions is very helpful. If you don't have anyplace to study at home, consider staying after school or going to your local library.
If you have a study hall, use it for studying and completing homework assignments instead of socializing. This extra hour of work can make a big difference in your grades., In order to have the best chance getting good grades, it is essential that you understand how you will be graded and how much each assignment is worth. If you have any questions about this, be sure to ask your teacher right away.Whenever you are working on a project, be sure to understand the rubric that will be used to grade it. This should outline exactly what the teacher is looking for in your work what it will take to get an A. If your teacher didn't give you a rubric, ask for a detailed explanation of how the assignment will be graded.
It's also important to know what else you can get points for. For example, some teachers offer points for participation, so you may be able to get some extra points simply by raising your hand more in class.

, If you have a large project like a research paper to do, don't wait until the last minute to get started. This project will most likely have a huge impact on your final grade, so take your time and make sure you do your best work.If your teacher has not broken the project up into smaller steps, consider asking for advice on how to do so. This will help make it feel much more manageable and less overwhelming. For example, you can break the large task of writing a research paper into the smaller tasks of choosing a topic, finding supporting sources, creating an outline, writing a rough draft, and writing a final draft.
Consider asking your teacher for help along the way. Even if you are not required to hand in a rough draft, ask your teacher to look it over and give you suggestions for how to improve your work.
If you have trouble managing your time, give yourself due dates for each step. Plan on working on the project for 30-60 minutes each day, depending on how much you have to get done.

, It's important to get extra help as soon as you feel like you're starting to fall behind, rather than waiting until it's too late. Addressing the issue right away will help ensure that you will understand the material when it comes time to take a test.If you have questions about anything that was discussed in class, be sure to ask your teacher right away. If you can't ask during class, try to stay after class, show up early, or visit your teacher during a free period.
If you need more help than your teacher can offer you, get a tutor. Many schools offer free tutoring for their students, so be sure to find out what is available for you. If this is not available or if it doesn't work for you, you can also hire a private tutor to come to your home or visit a tutoring center.

If you don't understand something when your teachers are explaining, do not hesitate to ask, they like seeing that you're both interested in the subject, and want to learn.;
, It can be in between classes, home, library, just do it! If you get stuck don't be afraid to ask for help.

, Don't slack off during the week and then cram before the test. Not only does this not work, it makes you tired and therefore less able to concentrate on the test. It is much better to study a little bit every day than cram and stress yourself out before an exam/quiz/test. If you can discipline yourself into studying half an hour a day it will help you more than you can imagine.


Set up good studying habits now. When you get to college it will be double or even triple the workload of high school and you won't be able to keep up at all.

, Sort it by date, in a notebook, or folder! Some teachers check classwork.

, Even if there's no test the next day. You never know about pop quizzes. If your teacher teaches according to a textbook, in chronological order of the chapters, start reading ahead. This helps you to understand what you will be learning, and how what you are learning now will help you in the near future. Never let an extra credit opportunity pass you by--you probably won't get a 100% on every assignment, and the extra credit will help you raise your grade after that B.

, If you are absent in a class, be sure to get the notes from a trustworthy friend, study the lesson, and ask your teacher for any class work you may have missed. This shows that you care for your grades.

, Get some post-it notes and put a reminder on your door, so that you will not forget. If possible, try handing your assignment in before it is due. Don't rush through your classwork; instead, take your time and answer every prompt to the best of your ability. Being an excellent student doesn't just mean getting all A's--it means doing your work the best you possibly can, in an appropriate amount of time, for all your assignments and extra credit opportunities.

, If you want to be one of the best students in your school, you have to make sure that your assignments are as perfect as possible. Make sure that all your assignments are answered in full with accurate information. While a few points missed here or there will not matter too much, consistently missed points can lower your overall grade point average.

, Your teachers will be more likely to help you if they know that you are a hard worker, and will respect you more if they know that you pay attention and respect them in, and out, of class.

, In addition to working towards good grades, get involved in an extracurricular activity, such as sports, music, art, or debate. Participate in class discussions and respectful debates with other students. Good grades don't mean everything on a scholarship or college entrance application; your extracurricular participation, grade point average, volunteer record, and absences will all be taken into consideration.

, Being a good student goes beyond simply getting high grades. If you get involved in a club or volunteer organization run by other students and staff, you'll have the opportunity to become successful and more popular after school hours. See if there is a club fair coming up, or check in with your registrar to hear about organizations you can join. If you can't find one that interests you, consider starting a new one on your own.


Try joining clubs that benefit your community. You may be able to use the hours for community service credit later.
Encourage your friends to join clubs too.

, Most students are given the opportunity to take extracurricular classes that are outside the normal curriculum. For example, art, foreign language, music, drama, and shop classes are taught at most schools. Take as many of these extracurricular classes as you can, even if it means going over your regular number of class hours. Your teachers will be quite impressed, and you'll make lots of new friends with people you might not normally encounter.


Try taking classes in things you're not very good at. If you're not an artist, taking a painting class might give you a boost of confidence.

, Sports are a healthy and entertaining way to spend more time at school while growing a positive reputation. Playing on your school sports teams will put you in the center of attention, and give you the opportunity to grow your skills. Normally there are three seasons, each with a different sport you can play (football in the fall, basketball in the winter, soccer in the spring). That means you have the opportunity to play on three separate sports teams in one school year.


Aren't a fan of playing sports? You should still show for games to cheer on your classmates.

Even if it's only worth 50% (an F) if you turn it in late, it will increase your grade a little bit. 50% is always better than 0%! Then, turn in your missing assignments right away! This will show your teacher that you are determined to get your grade up.

, Ask your teacher if you can make up these assignments, or redo them. Not all teachers allow this, so don't get your hopes up!

, If your teacher gives you some extra credit to do, do a thorough job, and try your hardest not to make any mistakes, that way you can bring your grade up as much as possible. After this, keep on the lookout for any extra credit your teacher offers to the entire class, and make sure you take advantage of EVERY opportunity so you can your grade sky-high and if you miss an assignment it won't bring down your grade to a grade you don't approve of.

, This can be a LIFESAVER. Make a schedule ranging from Monday-Sunday, and allow yourself at least one rest day, and one day to study for upcoming tests. On each of the days you'll study one to two subjects for at least 20 minutes per subject. For example:


Monday: Vocabulary






Tuesday: Social Studies and Physics






Wednesday: Math






Thursday: Spanish and Chemistry






Friday: English and Science






Saturday: REST






Sunday: Test day







, This is a MUST! Buy a planner, or a small notebook to write down your assignments everyday. We're only human, and unless you're some kind of hybrid-psychic you can't remember everything! When you get home, check off the assignments until you have done them all!

, If you procrastinate, then all the progress you've made so far will be ruined! Something I've discovered is to set goals and rewards. For example, after you finish my math homework, you can play video games, or call your friends. Goals and rewards like this make you feel you need to get things done, but don't rush, it can cost you a few points off your finished product!

Ask a parent or older sibling to look over your notes and create a mini-test for you three days prior to your test.",How to Become an Excellent Student," Take everything you need with you to class. It would be a good idea to take books, folders, pens, pencils, homework, review sheets and anything else you need.;
, Staying organized in school is extremely important. If you are organized, then you are one step ahead in being successful. Keep a folder for each subject, that means that you put your math papers in your math folder, your Language Arts papers in your Language Arts folder, your science papers in your science folder, and so on. To make this easier, use color codes or label your folders.

, When a teacher is giving a lesson, take notes and if you don't understand something, raise your hand and ask questions. The more questions you ask, the smarter you'll get, believe it or not. Taking notes will help you think and help you understand what is being taught more.


The teachers expect you ask questions and form an impression of you from how willing you are to do so.
Concentrate on staying focused. Keep your eyes on the teacher, keep your ears open, and take notes.

, Do not distract others and don't be distracted by them.


If friends are distracting you, don't be mean! Just tell them you are working and say that you really want to focus on the teacher and maybe talk later during recess or lunch. They'll understand, and may even feel the same way themselves.

, Rewriting notes taken in class is helpful if taking exceptionally hard classes, such as legal studies, economics, engineering, etc.

, Just remember, it doesn't hurt to go over what you have learned.

, If you are not already a reader, start at your level and work your way up. You may not know this, but by reading challenging and difficult books, you can expand your vocabulary.

, Use of mind maps can be helpful for understanding hard topics.



A mind map can help with revising before any exam or test.

, Study is one of the key factors at any level of an education. Spending two hours a day studying increases your grades. These two hours however, have to be constructive study. Remove all distractions; this will include mobile phones, television, loud/fast-paced music and talkative friends and family members as to ensure a calm collective environment.

, Make a daily routine for yourself, it really works. Keep all of your electronics such as your phone, iPod and laptop away from you as these cause distraction. When you come home from your day of learning, read through what the teacher or lecturer had taught in class that day and practice a few math problems to be right on top.

, For example: one 15 minute break every 2 hours. Don't lose your cool if you're stuck. Just take a break, then refocus on your work and you'll succeed.

, That way you become familiar with what he/she will be teaching and will be able to target areas that you do not understand so well. Highlight the explanations of difficult concepts and ask questions when you have doubts.

, Attempt extra credit problems and assignments. Even if you are getting a 98% in a class, you can improve your grade and understand the material better.


When you are finished with your work, ask your teacher if you can do extra work.
Look in next year's subject book and try to figure out those problems. This will help your thinking skills and give you an advantage during the next school year. Don't skip ahead so far though that you fail to cover the fundamentals. The fundamentals are always essential for deep learning ability.

, Teachers give you homework for a reason. It is to review what you have learned that day. Take advantage of your free time. Do your homework on the way home from school and in any spare time. Unless you have a kind of school that gives you homework for reasonability and not to review. But most schools have it to review. Do as much at school as you can; you have the teacher there in case you need help. Make sure not to rush on your homework, to check over it, and to be neat. If you really want to be a successful student, you should know right from the beginning when you want to be great at anything, and when you have to put up with things that just don't seem fair. Doing your homework is not a big deal. Remember, homework can also help you develop good habits and attitudes. Always do what is asked of you.

, It is advised to start studying at least a few days before a test. Make a study schedule. If an extracurricular activity gets in the way of your studying, tell the person in charge of that certain event that you will not be able to attend that event, or you will have to leave early. However, there will be certain situations where you will have to attend. In this kind of situation, you will just have to study another day. This is where your study schedule comes in. Write out a schedule of the week of your test and find your free time. Always remember, use your time wisely. Study as if you are motivated for the outcome of your hard work.

, Study before the night of your test.

Spend some extra time on your homework.,
Turn your work in on time.,
Ask about making up missed assignments.,
Ask to re-do old assignments.,
Prioritize.",How to Bring Up Your Grade Near the End of the Semester2," If you have been getting poor grades on homework assignments, it's time to up your game and put a little more effort into them. Even if each assignment is not worth that much, your cumulative grade for homework can be a big chunk of your final grade.Be sure you understand what you are supposed to do before you leave class. If you have any questions about how to complete the homework assignment, ask your teacher for clarification.
Always read the directions (or listen to them) and follow them precisely. Don't be lazy and write fewer words than were asked of you or neglect to show your work.

, Always write down when each assignment is due and hand it in on time. There's nothing worse than getting points off for handing in an assignment late because you forgot that it was due!If keeping track of your assignments in a planner or a digital calendar helps keep you organized, then be sure to record all of your homework assignments there.
Try planning out a specific time to complete each assignment, and be sure to take other obligations into consideration. For example, if you know that you have a basketball game on Thursday and will only have one hour to work on homework, don't put off any assignments until Thursday that can be completed on Wednesday.

, If you missed any assignments because you were absent or because you simply didn't do them, ask your teacher if you can hand them in late. While you may only get partial credit for make-up work, it's definitely better than having a zero for that assignment.


Ask about the possibility of making up in-class assignments that you missed as well as homework. Offer to come to the classroom during lunchtime or a free period to work on them.

, Try asking your teacher to revise an essay, re-take a test, or re-do a project that you got a bad grade on. You could suggest that the teacher could replace the grade or average the two grades together. Your teacher may be willing to let you do this if you seem committed to bringing your grade up.


Try to focus on substantive assignments that have a bigger impact on your overall grade rather than smaller assignments such as homework that may not make as big of a difference.

, While you may want to do whatever you can to improve a specific grade, it's important to be smart about it. Do not bring up one grade at the expense of another, whether it's for the same class or another one.


Focus the majority of your energy on the assignments that will earn you the most points. For example, if your final project is worth 50% of your grade and your homework assignments are worth 10%, spend more time studying for the final than working on your homework. This does not mean you should not do your other work, but simply that you should not spend as much time on it.Never neglect a current assignment in favor of make-up work unless you are sure that you will earn more points for it.
Don't neglect your other classes either. You shouldn't end up with a bad grade in one class because you were focusing all of your energy on trying to improve your grade in another. This will have a negative effect on your overall GPA.

"
"
Don't be afraid to ask.,
See it as a gift.,
Commit yourself to it.",How to Bring Up Your Grade Near the End of the Semester3," Just because your teacher has not announced extra credit opportunities, does not necessarily mean that there are none. If you feel you would benefit from extra credit, always ask your teacher what you can do to improve your grade.If something is going on in your life that has affected your grades, make sure your teacher knows about it. She may be more willing to work with you if you have a legitimate excuse for falling behind in the first place.Be sure to communicate that you are genuinely willing to work to improve your grade. Teachers are not likely to change your grade unless you put in a lot of effort.
Understand ahead of time how much of an effect extra credit can have on your grade. This will vary from class to class, so never expect that you can turn your C into an A by writing one additional essay just because that worked in another class.

, Some teachers offer lots of extra credit opportunities, but some don't offer any at all, so don't expect it. If your teacher does give you the chance to complete extra credit assignments, be thankful for it.Do not complain about the amount of work that is required or the number of points you can earn for it. Your teacher didn't have to give you any extra credit opportunities at all.
Do as much extra credit as you can, as long as it isn't interfering with your other assignments. You should always complete the required assignments for your class before you move on to extra credit.

, If you've been given an extra credit assignment, it's up to you to make the most out of it. In order to show your teacher that you really care and get the best grade possible, you need to put your all into your work.


As with all other assignments, make sure you understand the expectations. Don't be afraid to ask your teacher to explain the requirements if you don't understand them.
If your teacher gives you the option to choose your extra credit assignment, make it something that you are passionate about. For example, if you have to write a research paper about a controversial issue of your choosing, pick a topic that you find interesting. You will have a much easier time completing the assignment (and you will probably do better work) if you enjoy learning about the topic.
Always hand your extra credit in on time. Do not disappoint your teachers again by turning in your work late.

Motivation can come from inside or outside. The best way to start towards your goal is to know exactly what is motivating you.


Studies suggest that intrinsic motivation, or feeling motivated to do something because it aligns with something you believe or value, is more powerful than extrinsic, or external, motivation. Intrinsic motivation is driven by three basic needs: competence (doing something successfully), relatedness (connecting with other people), and autonomy (feeling in charge of your own life).For example, if you're motivated to become an honor student because you love performing well at your studies, or because it makes you feel like you're in charge of your education, this is intrinsic motivation.
If you are motivated to pursue honor status because you want your parents to be proud of you, or to enhance your resume, this is extrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation isn't a bad thing, but it isn't as strong as intrinsic motivation.;
, School can throw a lot at you. Take a systematic approach. Have all your books and assignments ready every day and know what's coming. Organization is a key characteristic of honor students.Do you tend to forget assignments? Try using a daily planner as a way to remember. You can even enter in reminders on your phone or in an online calendar such as Google Calendar or Apple's iCloud Calendar.Keep separate folders for each course or subject. Make sure you keep all your assignments, notes, rubrics, etc. for the course in this folder. When it comes time to study for an exam or write an essay, you'll have all your material in one place.
Set deadlines for yourself. Your teachers likely have deadlines for projects, but setting your own deadlines ahead of these will help you stay on track. Break large projects down into smaller sub-tasks and set a mini-deadline for each task. For example, instead of ""term paper due December 4,"" figure out how much time you will need for each stage of that paper. You'll need time to plan, research, write a draft, revise it, and turn it in (preferably ahead of the due date). Set deadlines for each of those stages., High achievers often keep very regular schedules. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant was so routine that his neighbors set their watches to him!Doing the same tasks regularly, at the same time and place every day, is part of being organized and will put you in a proper mental space.A routine prepares you to work. Set aside a time each day or each week to work on a subject without distractions. Or, give yourself a quota to meet each day -- so many pages pages to read or words to write.
Make appointments with yourself for study time. Fill them in on your calendar just as you would going to class or soccer practice. Keep these appointments faithfully.
Get in the habit of studying for a set amount of time, such as 45 minutes, followed by a 15-minute break. This method is much more effective than trying to study for huge chunks of time., Having a good work-space is important. You need a place that helps you focus on your studies without distractions or interruptions. Figure out what works best for you, and create a study environment that matches those needs.Some people work best in silence. Others prefer to work to music or background noise.
Avoid studying in bed, as this can encourage you to goof off or take a nap instead.Change up your study locations at times. A desk at home, a library carrel, or a table at a quiet cafe are good choices.

, School is filled with distractions, from your friends to sports and parties, and once you get to college no one will call your parents if you skip class. But try to make academics your priority. You won’t be an honors student if you are chronically absent. You cannot excel if you aren't there to learn and discuss the material.Many honors courses have additional requirements, such as class participation or class discussion. If you miss class, you miss out on this part of your grade.
A good circle of friends or study partners can hold you accountable. Consider making a deal with your study-buddies to keep each another in class.

, Schools usually have resources available to help you reach your highest potential. You just have to ask. It should be possible to find a study group, for example, and some schools even have special centers for tutoring in subjects like math. Be aware of what's available.


Talk with your teacher if you're having difficulty, or you'd just like to understand a topic more clearly. As long as it's not an hour before the test, most teachers are happy to answer your questions.
Join a peer tutoring program if you need more intensive one-on-one help. Peer tutors know their stuff -- you have to do well in a subject in order to become one. They can guide you through assignments and major concepts, build up your base of knowledge, or help you prepare for an upcoming exam.
Don't despair if your school doesn't offer these resources. It's always possible to form your own study circle. But be careful if your study circle consists only of close friends. Minimize your distractions and remember to hit those books!

, You forget 47% of the information you encounter within twenty minutes. You forget 68% in a day.Take good notes for every subject in order to remember what you’ve covered in reading and lectures for later review.


Taking notes is an art form. It will take you some time to learn how to listen and read effectively and identify the most important things. Oftentimes school writing centers offer students tips for this.How you take notes – whether by computer or hand – is up to you. Studies suggest that taking notes by hand is better for comprehension and recall, though.Some (but not all) teachers are also fine with students recording them in class. Just make sure to ask for their permission beforehand.
Many honor students like using the Cornell method, which involves taking notes during class and then later returning to them to review and condense. This method is great for courses that cover clearly-defined subjects, such as math, science, and history. It is less useful for more abstract courses that focus less on memorization and recall, such as a discussion-heavy literature course., Whether essays, lab reports, or problem sets, assignments will usually make up a big part of your total grade in a course. Missing just one might mean a reduction in your final mark. It might mean more. It can be the difference between a final B+ and an A.


There are also reasons to do your homework besides just the grades. Studies have shown that completing your homework is linked to higher achievement and to the development of skills like time management, responsibility, and good study habits.Turn in your assignments early when possible. If your paper is due online at midnight, it's practically a guarantee that there will be a dozen students trying to upload it at 11:59, which could cause system crashes. Do your assignments as soon as possible, and definitely turn them in early when you can.A strong history of turning in your assignments on time also makes teachers more likely to be flexible if you have a genuine emergency. If you've only turned in a third of your homework to start with, though, your teacher is unlikely to be impressed by your excellent excuse for not doing it this time.

, While it's usually a good thing to study with classmates, there can be a thin line between cooperating and cheating. Your teachers will expect you to hand in your own work. If you aren't clear on what's acceptable, talk with your teacher beforehand.


Be especially careful when it comes to homework assignments. Unless it's a group project, it may be inappropriate to do an assignment with others.
Never plagiarize. Using another person's answers, or copying words from a book or website into an essay, are forms of plagiarism and academically dishonest. Plagiarism can cause you to fail an assignment or course or even get you expelled., Being an honor student probably means hitting the books more than your peers. Review your lessons and notes at home or before class. Review with friends or alone. Review while on the bus or watching TV. You can also try as much as possible to read ahead, as this will help you to ask reasonable questions and allow you to understand new topics more easily.Try bringing flashcards with you on the bus or public transit. You can review them while you're riding to school, or even while you're standing in line at the store.
By reviewing your material in smaller chunks frequently, you're more likely to commit it to long-term memory.

, Many students seem to believe that they're great multitaskers.However, many studies show that multitasking, or trying to focus on several tasks at the same time, simply doesn't work. You just end up spreading your attention out thinly over several areas, rather than focusing it on one.So put the cell phone away, log off social media, and turn off the TV while you're studying.


This works the other way around, too. Even the most dedicated honor student needs time to decompress and relax, or you'll burn out. Schedule in some dedicated ""me time"" and keep it faithfully. If you're on a half-hour break, try not to think about homework.

, Getting good grades for an entire academic year is a challenge that requires mental focus. At times it will be a slog. Remember your original motivation and keep it in mind.


Motivations change sometimes. Maybe having the perfect resume was really motivating in August but isn't so much in November. Try thinking about your long-term goals and how being an honor student plays into them.
Try to find sources of intrinsic motivation when you can. It can be much harder to stay focused and dedicated if you're doing something to make someone else happy, rather than yourself., Teachers are there to help you – it’s their job and they generally like it when students show interest. If you introduce yourself, they will not only remember you but also appreciate your questions.


Being willing to admit that you need help and ask questions actually reflects well on you as an honor student.It shows that you understand the need for collaboration and growth.
Teachers will often make time before or after class to field students’ questions. It is usually a good idea to approach them then. However, if before or after class doesn't work, talk with your teacher about meeting another time. Often, teachers are happy to accommodate you if you have genuine questions and curiosity.
In college, professors also generally hold weekly office hours. Find out where and when they are and visit a couple of times during the semester. But have a clear reason for going. They will appreciate your visit so long as you do not waste their time.

, A scholastic career is not complete without one or two whiffs – a bad grade, for example, or a poorly received essay. It is important to use these as lessons for the future and not give up.


Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. Making a mistake, or even a failing grade, is not the same as being ""a failure."" Students who hold themselves to unreasonable standards of perfection often suffer increased levels of depression and anxiety, and may not even perform as well as those who have more reasonable standards.
Perfectionism is not the same as the healthy quest for excellence that being an honor student represents. When you have a perfectionist approach, you use all-or-nothing thinking: a single bad grade represents total failure, which is unacceptable. You also tend to internalize mistakes, as though doing poorly on a quiz says something negative about you as a person.Instead, set yourself standards that are high, but that don't demand utter perfection. Remember that learning is a process and not a product.

Channel any frustrations into productive energy. Try to accept criticism and use it to improve in the future. View mistakes not as failures, but as opportunities to grow and learn so you can perform differently next time.

, Beware of too much of a good thing. Classes are important; they are why you are in school in the first place. But too much focus on academics can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression. Give yourself time to enjoy a social life, activities you enjoy, and decompress from the stresses of being an honor student.Do things to keep yourself healthy and in good spirits. Consider joining an extra-curricular activity. Not only will you have fun, extra-curricular activities often look great on a resume or college application.
Have a support network. Friends can help you catch up when you are absent on a particular day, but they are also invaluable for your overall well-being. An active social life can be a great release and give you a much needed break from studying. Family are important, too. There will probably be times when you’ll need to lean on them for moral support.

, It may sound strange, but we now know that there are clear links between diet, exercise, and high cognitive performance in children as well as adults.The right food and regular exercise will prime you for learning.


Eat breakfast every day, preferably one that incorporates sources of quality protein such as eggs, yogurt, and whole grains.Incorporate plenty of fresh, dark-colored fruits and vegetables into your diet. These foods are high in vitamins and antioxidants and are literally ""brain food.""Get enough glucose. Studies have shown that glucose is important for brain function. If you're diabetic, of course, you need to follow instructions from your physician. In general, though, sources of glucose such as potatoes and whole-grain bread, and even the occasional glass of lemonade or chocolate, will help boost your memory and attention.Get enough daily exercise. Even 30 minutes a day of moderate aerobic exercise, such as running, dancing, or kickboxing, will keep you de-stressed and healthy."

In order to be a good student, one of the key areas you'll have to work on is being organized.,
Buy a binder to store your notes, homework, and tests/quizzes in it.,
Buy a pencil case and put all your writing utensils in there.,
Buy a planner or an agenda to make note of the due dates of assignments, tests, and big projects.,
Make sure your locker is clean and organized.",How to Be an All Around Good Student1," Color code your notes, arrange them in sections or folders, whatever you feel is best for you. Without organization, you'll have trouble finding your school supplies and notes!;
, To distinguish the difference between each class, purchase tabs or make some of your own. Another option is to purchase folders to either replace the binder or assist it.

, Be sure you always have an extra pencil in there in case something happens to the pencil you're using. If you prefer mechanical pencils, make sure you have extra lead in the pencil case as well.


In case you have no access to a pencil sharpener in the classroom, bring your own small one. The kind that catches the shavings is recommended, and make sure it doesn't make too much noise! And if you don't have a small one already, ask a nearby student for one!
To be prepared for math, it is recommended you slip a small calculator in the pencil case as well. If your pencil case is big enough, put a ruler in as well.

, That way, when you arrive at home in the evening, you will be able to organize your homework schedule and figure out which assignment is due first, and when you should work on it. Good prioritizing is necessary in this area.

, Keep it free of random papers - keep all papers in your binder or folder(s) - and do not clutter it with unnecessary decorations, as they are pointless and you'll have to take them down at the end of the year.


It is recommended you stack your books in your locker in the order of your classes. That way, you can easily grab your book from the top stack, and later slip it underneath the pile for tomorrow!

, If there are rules and guidelines the teacher shows you, then write them down. Make sure that you know what you have to do for the project, before adding interesting facts or decorations.

, On the same day you receive the project assignment, read through the whole thing and see whether you understand it all. If not, write down the questions and be prepared to ask your teacher these questions the next day. The earlier that you sort out any misunderstandings, the easier the preparation of the project will prove to be.

, This will help you to avoid leaving the whole project until the last minute. In this schedule, put down:


Time for research.
Time for collation.
Time for writing.
Time for editing and reviewing.
The hand-in date.

, The earlier you start, the earlier it'll be completed and you won't have to finish it at the last minute.

, If you have the freedom to choose a topic, select one that is narrowed down. If you try to cover too much, it'll be too general in nature and you might not finish it in a timely way.

, Use the internet, databases, books and other class recommended resources to do research. Check that the websites you're using are okay with your teacher.


Get adequate background knowledge concerning the topic, or a topic you are interested in.

, Is it all text or will there be other elements, such as images, videos, audio and PowerPoint? Map this out before beginning the creation of your project.

, Keep the flow of your project logical, so that the reader can understand what the project is about, what you are testing/theorizing about/summarizing, etc., and how you will go about it. Then have the relevant information and discussion, followed by your summary or conclusion.


Reference your facts and any quotes.

, Add pictures, decorations, or anything else you can to make your project unique. Make your project the one that nobody will forget! Many teachers will add points for creativity, though some not as many points.


Find out whether or not additional elements are allowed in your project before putting the effort in.

, If you're stuck on any particular issues or have questions, talk to your teacher, a parent, an older sibling or a friend. It can often help to talk things through, just to increase your own understanding of the topic.

, Check that everything makes sense and flows logically. Check that all the facts needed have been provided. Ask other people if they can check your, or your group's, work. You may have looked at it so many times, you skim over the simplest mistakes.


Double check that you have the correct facts and that they're properly referenced.

, Cross check the rubric requirements against the project work you've completed, just to make sure that you have met all the requirements.

, You will get marked down points if your project is late (for just forgetting the project, or an element of it, not because of absences).

Take AP courses that will be beneficial later on.,
Consider what other classes you will take.",How to Get Good Grades in AP Courses," First and foremost, you should learn that your AP course is not simply a more difficult version of a high school course. Instead, it is a college course that has been re-worked to fit into a high school environment. Just because you have breezed through your high school classes doesn’t mean you will be able to do so in your AP courses. AP courses are made to show you what college is like, and to show colleges that you can manage the workload. Be prepared for this reality.


This is not meant to scare you, but rather to prepare you for the course. It is not at all impossible to do well in an AP course, but you may have to spend some time adjusting your typical approach to school. You will need to spend more time studying and understanding the material, and you will need to keep track of your assignments and exams. Don’t expect the teacher to do it for you or to remind you about a test or an assignment that is due.;
, In your first meeting with the teacher, they may spend some time talking about what you should expect in the course. They might also discuss any special rules they have or expectations that you need to know about. Be sure to have pen and paper so that you can take note of these expectations.For example, some teachers have somewhat unusual guidelines about how they want an assignment to look. They might ask that you always print your name in the top right-hand corner along with your student ID number. It may not seem like a big deal to you, but some teachers will simply throw an assignment away if it doesn’t fit the guidelines they have specified.
Don’t assume that the first day will be a blow off day. While the teacher may (or may not) spend quite a bit of time talking about expectations, they might also get straight to business and start lecturing. Come prepared with all of the materials you plan to use for note-taking (e.g. notebook and pen/pencil or voice recorder).

, The syllabus will hopefully contain all of the important information you need to know in addition to anything your teacher has said. Read through the entire thing carefully, and write down any important dates that are scheduled.


For example, your instructor may already have the due dates for every assignment put in the syllabus. The examination dates might also already be scheduled. Find a way to keep track of these dates as it is unlikely that they will remind you of them.
If there is something in the syllabus that you don’t understand, or if you have additional questions after you’ve read it, be sure to ask the teacher.

, If this is your first AP course, you might not be sure what you should do differently in order to really stand out. If you are putting in your best effort, but not getting the grade you want, talk to your teacher about what you can do to improve. They may be able to point out areas that you can work on, or show you specific instances that are bringing down your grade.Remember that college-level courses are not meant to work in the same way as high school classes. Often, the content of an AP course is cumulative. This means that something you read about early in the year will remain important throughout the course. If you missed something or didn’t understand, it will only make it more difficult as the year progresses.
You may also need to practice your critical thinking skills in an AP course. For example, in a high school history course, you may only be asked to remember the names and dates of a specific event. In an AP course, you may be asked to think deeper about this event. You may need to be able to discuss the implications of this historical event, or what other events led up to this historical event.

, Many AP courses will require that you complete some “pre-work” that you will need to turn in before the semester officially begins. If you aren’t sure what or if any pre-work has been assigned, be sure to get in touch with the teacher to find out.


If you aren’t sure who the teacher is yet, you can also try contacting someone in administration to be sure. For example, try asking the school secretary or even the principal if they can help you find out.
Pre-work can give you a good idea about what to expect in the course, so don’t assume that it isn’t important. Take advantage of the fact that you aren’t busy with your normal classes and do your best on these assignments.

, If you haven’t developed your own method of keeping your assignments organized yet, you’ll want to do so before your AP courses begin. The amount of work, reading, and studying will be much greater in your AP courses. As a busy high school student, you’ll want to have a method for keeping track of your academic work, your extracurricular activities, and any social events that are important to you.


You can keep your calendar on the computer using a program such as iCal (for mac) or Google calendar. Many people enjoy keeping a physical calendar where they can write down details and anything that pops up without needing access to a computer or smartphone.
When you get your syllabi for each of your classes, be sure to write down all the important dates that are already clear. For example, many teachers will schedule every test at the beginning of the year. Write down each test, what subject it is in, and any other useful information (such as what chapters the test will cover) in your calendar.
For your AP courses, you could use a system that will help make the AP course stand out in your calendar. For example, choose a highlighter color for each AP course you are taking and highlight anything you write in your calendar with the chosen color. This will help it stand out when you check your schedule.

, Although it is not a substitute for studying regularly, spending any spare time you have before class to review the previous lesson’s notes will refresh your memory, and also help you prepare for what’s to come in the next lesson.


It will also remind you of anything that you are confused about or that you wanted to ask a question about. If you have a question, and your teacher is OK with it, you can approach them before class to discuss the topic.
You may think that you don’t need to review your notes until right before the test, but if you take time each day to review your notes, and develop a disciplined study routine, you won’t need to spend a stressful all-night cramming before the test., When you have a lot going on, it can be easy to put off something that doesn’t seem too important at the moment. With AP courses, though, if you start procrastinating, you’ll be surprised at how quickly the work builds up.


For example, you may have a lot of additional reading to do outside of class. Don’t put this off until the night before class. You will probably realize that it is more than you can read in one night. Instead, review the syllabus for the course and see how you can split the reading up into more manageable chunks.

, The material in an AP course will probably be more challenging than what you are used to. Don’t get discouraged if you are struggling, it doesn’t mean you aren’t smart enough or that you can’t do well. If it is a specific part of the material that you are struggling with, talk to your teacher. Ask them if they can spend some time helping you with it, or if they can point you in the direction of helpful resources (e.g. websites or tutors).


Very few teachers will be annoyed by a student who is genuinely asking for help. Most teachers will be impressed that you are taking the initiative and asking for help rather than complaining when you get a bad grade.

, This may seem obvious, but you’ll need to study hard to do well. Be flexible about your study methods if you haven’t quite found what works for you yet, or if you are struggling to remember what you’ve learned. How much time you need to study depends on you and the specific course, but if you have a big AP exam at the end of the year, it is recommended that you begin studying regularly for the exam no later than halfway through the year.For example, if you are used to studying by yourself, but find that you aren’t grasping the material as easily as usual, try studying with a group. Your peers can help explain things in a different way, and you can help them out with things they are struggling to understand.
Though the AP exam at the end of the year may be the big focus of everyone in the course, don’t forget that you will probably need to study for smaller (but still important) exams during the year. Additionally, there will likely be assignments that you need to complete.

, While reviewing your notes before class is a good idea, it doesn’t constitute a good strategy for comprehending what you have learned. One potential method for making the most of your study time is to use a method known as SQ3R.This method involves being systematic about your reading instead of just jumping in without any goal in mind.


SQ3R involves surveying the chapter. This means seeing what the chapter is called, reading the sub-headings, and looking to see what any tables, charts, and graphics contain. You should also read the questions included in the chapter, and any questions your teacher has given to you before you begin reading.
While you are surveying, ask yourself questions. For example, “what do I already know about this topic?” or “what did the teacher tell me about this topic?”
While you are reading the chapter, try to answer the questions that are in the chapter and those given to you by the teacher. Answer any questions that came into your head while you were surveying the chapter.
Re-read sections that you find difficult to understand.

, You shouldn’t view note taking as a passive activity where all you have to do is write down what’s on the board or what the teacher is saying. Instead, try to develop your note taking skills so that you have to think about what you are learning.


One of the most common methods for note taking is known as the Cornell Method. This method involves splitting your paper into three sections. In one section, you will write down the notes. When you are going over your notes, you will use the other two sections to develop questions based on what you have written and then summarize what you have learned from that lecture., In an AP course, you will probably be required to write at least one essay (and many more if it is an AP English course!). This is a good opportunity to practice your writing skills while adding a top score to your grade.


One of the best things you can do is begin by outlining your essay. Think of the outline as the skeleton of your essay. Here you can make note of any special instructions to remember (e.g. font size, due date, sources to use, etc.), and also make a note of the important topics you want to cover along with any ideas that come into your head.When writing your essay, try to show the teacher that you are actually thinking about what you are writing. Don’t just regurgitate the information. For example, if you are writing an essay in an AP History course, talk about how you think the events and conflicts that led up to a certain war, and how that impacted the outcome of the war instead of just writing about facts. You can back up your ideas by citing credible sources of information.

, During your high school years, there is a lot going on. Not only do you need to do well in school, but you might also be involved in lots of other activities, such as sports, clubs, or volunteering activities. You probably also want to spend time with friends, girlfriends, and boyfriends, too. With all this going on, it’s important to remember to be realistic about what you can handle. Just because your high school offers 5 or 6 AP courses doesn’t mean you need to take them all.Instead, evaluate the courses that you think will be most useful for you. If you want to become a biologist, then an AP biology course will be a great idea. If you’re not sure what you want to major in try looking for AP courses that might be able to cover some of your core college classes such as English literature or history.
Many students take AP courses during their final high school years, which also happens to be the time when many begin thinking about and applying for college. Don’t forget that visiting and applying to colleges can be a time-consuming activity as well.

, Think about the types of colleges you want to apply to. If you’re planning to apply to prestigious or ivy-league schools, they’ll probably want to see that you’ve taken the hardest classes available to you. In this case, you should try to take as many AP courses as possible (without overloading yourself). Try to get your core curriculum out of the way, but also explore lots of interests. For example, try some hard sciences such as biology or physics, but also look for other areas such as psychology or economics.On the other hand, if you think you will be happiest at a less selective college or state school, the number of AP courses you take won’t matter as much during the admissions process. Even if you do plan to attend a less selective college, AP courses may be able to help you earn scholarships or college credit.
Remember there is no magic number of courses that you need to take. In all likelihood, a university will be more impressed if you do extremely well in all of your classes (AP or not) rather than squeaking by in a bunch of AP courses.

, If you go to a large high-school with lots of money to put into AP courses, you might be able to fill your schedule full of AP courses (not that you necessarily want to or should); however, if you go to a smaller, more rural school you may only have access to one or two AP courses. This means that you will still need to choose from the standard high school classes that are offered. Don’t forget to make the most of these as well. Choose the more difficult courses, if you think you can manage. Use your best judgment, and choose classes that you think you will be able to do well in while also managing your AP courses.


AP courses are not the end-all of getting into college, though they are obviously helpful. Colleges will notice if you managed to get great grades in your AP courses but barely passed your regular classes.

Make sure you get enough rest.",How to Avoid Homework Stress," This does not have to be right after school or at the same time every day. Each person is different and works better at different times. Some people like to come home and start right in on assignments, while others prefer to decompress for a while before starting work again. Consider the following:


Try to work earlier, rather than later, if possible. This way, you won’t be rushing to finish your work before bedtime.
Find a time of day during which you can concentrate well. Some people work best in the afternoon, while others can concentrate better on a full stomach after dinner.
Choose a time when you will have relatively few distractions. Mealtimes, times during which you have standing engagements, or periods usually used for socializing are not the best choices.
Allow enough time to complete your work. Making sure the total time you allow yourself for homework is sufficient for you to complete all your assignments is crucial.;
, When your teacher or professor assigns you a project that is due in a few weeks, take the opportunity to begin immediately. Leaving it until the last minute will be stressful. Instead, try starting projects on the day they’re assigned. Then work a little bit on it every day or every week. You’ll have that project done in no time, and you’ll probably get a better grade.Save an appropriate amount of time for projects considering your normal homework load.
Estimate how much time you will need each day, week, and month depending on your usual workload. Allow yourself at least this much time in your schedule, and consider allotting a fair amount more to compensate for unexpected complications or additional assignments.
Reserve plenty of time for bigger projects, as they are more involved, and it is harder to estimate how much time you might need to complete them.

, In most cases, your teacher or professor will give you a pretty decent idea of how much work you’ll have to do every week. After you’ve figured this out, make yourself a homework schedule taking into consideration all of your classes.


Get a day planner or a notebook to write down your homework assignments, and assign an estimated amount of time to each assignment. Make sure to always over-estimate.
Plan to finish daily homework every day, then divide up weekly homework over the course of the rest of the week.
Rank assignments in due-date order. Begin on those assignments due first, and work your way though. Finishing assignments according to due-date will help you avoid having to hurry through homework the night before it must be handed in.
Allow more time for more difficult subjects and difficult assignments. Each individual person will have their strong subjects - and those that come a little harder. Make sure you take into account which subjects are harder for you, and allow more time for them during your scheduling.

, Asking questions is critical to forming a good understanding of the material. This will enable you to complete your homework in a timely fashion and avoid frustrations. Consider the following:


If you’re too shy to ask questions, or don’t feel it’s appropriate to do so during class, write them down in your notebook and then ask the teacher or professor after class.
If you don't understand a concept, ask your teacher to explain it again, with specifics.
If you're having trouble with a math problem, ask the teacher to demonstrate it again using a different example.
Remember, when it comes to learning and education, there are no bad questions.

, Writing down the information discussed in class helps you organize your thoughts and remember important facts and ideas. In addition, note taking aids in homework completion. When you are doing your homework, you’ll be able to flip through your notes and easily locate the material that will help you address your homework activity. It is important to keep your notes nice and tidy wit no distractions.


Pay attention to important terms and ideas. Make sure to note things your teacher stresses, key terms, and other important concepts.
Write clearly and legibly. If you can’t read your handwriting, it’ll take you longer to reference your notes at home.
Keep your notebook organized with dividers and labels. This way, you’ll be able to locate helpful information in a pinch and finish your homework quicker., Sometimes hearing a lecture again will really help you form a good understanding of the subject of the day. But first, ask permission from your teacher or professor. Then bring in your recording device.


Get permission.
Sit up front and close to the instructor.
Make sure to label your recordings so you don't lose track of them.
Try to listen to them that same day while everything is fresh in your mind.

, This way, you’ll be way ahead of the game when you get home and need to start on your homework. You might even be able to get some work done at school or in class. But remember, the key is to not get stressed out. Only use spare time if you see it as an opportunity, rather than an obligation.


Work in class. If you finish a class assignment early, review your notes or start your homework.
Study at lunch. If you have time at lunch, consider working on homework. You can do this leisurely by just reviewing what you’ll need to do at home, or you can just jump right into your work.
Don't waste time. If you get to class early, use that time for homework. In addition, many schools let students go to the library during this unplanned time, and it's a great place to finish uncompleted assignments.

, When the scheduled time comes, sit down and do your homework. Let your friends and family know this, so they won't tempt you with other activities. Procrastinating won’t help, and it will just stress you out more. Tell yourself you’re going to do your work, then do it. Also, try to keep a positive attitude.

, Pick a quiet, out of the way space, and reserve it for your work. Make sure you’ve got supplies there including pencil, paper, and a calculator. This will be your homework safe space. Embrace it as a happy place., A quiet environment with minimal distractions it the best sort of environment to get work done in. Turn off the TV or radio and put your cell phone or tablet aside. All of these things will probably just distract you from getting your homework done in a quick and effective manner., Build small breaks into your homework routine. You don’t have to sit there for two hours finishing all of your work at one time. In fact, your productivity will probably go way down and your stress level way up if you do sit for hours working. Take a break, it’ll relax you and recharge your brain. Consider the following:


Get some fresh air.
Go for a short run.
Do pushups.
Walk your dog.
Listen to music.
Have a snack.

, Try to think about your homework as a good thing. Keeping this positive attitude will avoid creating more stress, and might even energize you to get it done. In fact, the more engaged and interested you are in your work, the quicker it will seem to pass., Think carefully about the classes you choose for the upcoming year or semester. Many middle schools now offer gifted and honors programs. High schools are increasingly offering Advanced Placement (AP) courses, International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, and addition to honors classes. These sorts of classes all have an increased workload over regular classes. Consider this as you are planning your schedule.


AP or IB classes often have two or three times the amount of reading and homework as regular courses.
Honors classes may have up to double the amount of work required as regular courses.
College students need to consider whether they want to take the recommended load of class (often 4 classes) or more. More classes might help you finish your degree sooner, but if you are juggling work and extracurricular activities, you might be overwhelmed., You need to decide what classes are most important and where extracurricular activities come into play. Sports and other activities like debate club or newspaper might take up considerable amounts of time. Think about how these time commitments will impact your overall schedule.


Rank your classes and activities in order of importance.
Estimate (realistically) how long your academic and extracurricular activities will take.
Figure out how much time you have overall.
If you’ve over committed, you need to drop your lowest ranked class or activity.

, Working all the time rather than enjoying family time and having fun with friends can potentially make you a much more stressed out person. You need to create a balance between homework and down-time.


Make sure to reserve mealtimes for family, rather than working.
Try to set aside the weekend for family, and work only if you need to catch up or get ahead.
Don’t plan on working on holidays, even if you try, your productivity likely won’t be high.

, Depending on your age, you need between 8 and 10 hours of sleep. Most teenagers need at least 9 hours of sleep, while college students might need a little bit less. Sacrificing sleep in order to complete homework might seem like a good idea sometimes, and it might be necessary at other times, but it will probably result in substandard work and will increase your stress level.


Pick a reasonable hour to go to sleep every night.
Try to do your morning prep work like ironing clothes and making your lunch at night.
Take a nap after school or after classes if you need. You’ll probably be able to do better work in less time if you are rested."

Reward Yourself.,
Know Where You Are Wasting Time.,
Get Rid Of The Causes Of Procrastination.,
Motivate yourself to perform better each day.,
Arrange All Your Study Materials.",How to Avoid Procrastination for PCAT," There is nothing more satisfactory than accomplishing a difficult task. At first, you need to toil hard to achieve your goal. When you manage to accomplish your goal (or a task), praise yourself. You should reward yourself for executing a work and then come out with flying colors. Listen to your conscience and possess a strong will. When you start rewarding yourself for your accomplishments, you would generate that hunger of performing better each day. At the end of the day, sit and write down your accomplishments, so that you can keep a track of your performance.;
, One of the easiest ways to avoid procrastination is self-realization. You need to know where you are wasting your time. Are you on the micro-blogging site when you should be busy with PCAT studies? You need to figure out where you are wasting your time and then try to put off those works. Once you are able to know where you are wasting your time, you can surely eliminate them and expect a better preparation for the exam.

, What are some of the causes of procrastination? There can be millions of reasons for which a student might procrastinate. Waiting for the right mood and right time are the excuses that the students often put forward when they are asked to perform a task. In case of your PCAT study, you should keep in mind that you need to get rid of your causes of procrastination to make your preparation a smooth ride. On the other hand, often the candidates underestimate the time that they have in their hand and misuse it. Hence, it is necessary that you accomplish your work on time and shed off all the excuses from your mind.

, Self motivation is essential to keep the flame of good performance alive and kicking in you. When you are preparing for PCAT, you should keep that stimulus alive in you to perform well. Dream big, make plans to attain your dream, keep a positive attitude, be consistent, and never quit. With a dedicated effort, you would surely be able to master your syllabus without procrastinating.

, You need to be organized and get hold of the standard study materials to fair well in the examination. When you have all the study materials with you, at the end of the day, you would feel confident and can concentrate on your goal. Never lose your confidence and focus on the right track. Make an early preparation so that you get sufficient time to study and revise. Moreover, only bookish knowledge would not help. You should read other books as well to get an overall knowledge about everything. On the other hand, practice as many sample test papers as you can. The more you practice; you would be able to know the type of questions that you are going to face in the examination. With regular practice, you can even master the test-taking techniques and strategies to perform well.

Check how the environment sounds after the BiNaural Beat.",How to Concentrate on Studies," A quiet place with a suitable environment. Whether it is your room or a library, choose an atmosphere that is silent & free of distractions in order to concentrate. It should be away from the TV, pets, and anything else that spells for an easy distraction. What's more, you want a comfy chair and good lighting. There should be no strain on your back, neck, or eyes – pain is also a distraction.


For example, do not study right in front of a TV; you will only do your homework when the advertisements come up. Go to get a ""snip"" of TV or radio only as a quick break – exactly as if it's a few moments to go to get a drink of water or ""fresh air"" for a minute.
Sit in a chair at a table or desk while you study. Don't study in bed, except maybe reading on top of your covers, propped upright with a bright reading light behind you. However, don't get under the covers – you'll just want to fall asleep. What's more, you'll start to associate your bedroom with studying and that's definitely an impulse you want to avoid.
A standing desk does a remarkable job making you focus on your task (in addition to being a healthier option to sitting).;
, Your pencils and pens, highlighters and books should be within your reach so that you are not distracted while studying. Organize the area, if need be, so the clutter doesn't clutter your mind. There should be no reason you have to get up, interrupting you from being ""in the zone.""


Even if you're not sure you'll need it, it should be in your ""study area."" All the textbooks, notebooks, and papers you need (remember that syllabus) should be within arm's reach. This is quite literally a set-up for success. Use your laptop if it is necessary for your studies otherwise keep your laptop away from you.

, Try to keep it to something simple that you can repeat, like a few nuts, blueberries/strawberries, 1/4 an apple, or break off a piece of a dark chocolate bar. Keep water nearby, too – don't drink too much coffee, caffeinated teas, or any energy drinks (you'll be up all night long). They inevitably lead to a crash that makes you feel dead-tired – and pinching and slapping won't fix it.


Looking for some ""super-foods?"" Research shows that blueberries, spinach, squash, broccoli, dark chocolate, and fish are all brain-boosting foods that can help you get your study on.

, For just today, what do you want (or need) to get accomplished? What should you do to be able to walk away feeling like you've done all you needed to do? These are your goals, and it will give you something to work toward during your study time.


Make sure they're doable. If you have to read 100 pages this week, break it down to 20 pages a day – don't bite off more than you can chew. Keep in mind your time constraints as well. If you only have one free hour tonight, do the most important thing to get done?

, This will help you avoid temptations to be off-task and allow you to stay on your plan. Only use your computer, if you need it for your studies; otherwise, it's just an unnecessary risk. As for your phone – put it in airplane mode unless you need it on for an emergency.


There are website and software blockers like SelfRestraint, SelfControl, and Think that can keep you away from the websites and software that are the hardest to resist.Understand yourself and whether you need Facebook to be blocked for the next hour or so. Don't worry – it'll come back.

, For some people, music helps them concentrate. For some, it doesn't. Try it out and see what works best for you. A little something in the background can make you forget that you're just studying instead of out having fun.


Keep in mind that the music that's right for you to study to may not be the music you traditionally like. Traditionally music that you don't know is better because recognising a song makes your mind wonder or even sing to it. Experiment with listening to other genres to see whether there's something you enjoy but can easily tune in and out.
Try to use a background noise generator that plays natural sounds such as bird chirping, rain, river stream or other pleasant sounds in order to help you study. There are several free tools available online.

, If you have a long night of studying ahead of you, make a plan for the day. Aim to work for 30-60 minute periods with 5-10 minute breaks in between. Your brain needs the break to recharge. It's not laziness – it's letting your brain synthesize the information.Try to switch subjects every hour or so, too, to prevent yourself from getting bored and saturating your mind. Too much of one subject and your brain will start going on autopilot. A new subject will wake up your mind and your motivation.

, Sometimes it's hard to study because the real world keeps creeping into our minds, good or bad. We feel like we don't have control over our thoughts, but we do. Tell yourself that you'll think about that problem or that girl or boy when you're finished. You'll feel a bit of solace knowing you'll get to it eventually. And when the time comes, the urge may have actually passed.


If you start to feel your mind wander, stop it dead in its tracks. Take a second to shake it off, and then resume with the material. You are the ringleader of your thoughts. You started them, and you can stop them, too!
Keep pen and paper besides you and write down everything that comes to your mind during your study sessions. Do or think about those things once you're having a pause.

, Let's say you just got done reading 20 pages of a textbook. The last thing you should jump into is 20 pages of the next textbook. Instead, do a quiz with some flashcards. Make a few charts to help you remember those economics stats. Listen to those French tapes. Do some studying that involves different skills and different sections of your brain. Point blank, you'll be less bored.


And it'll be easier for your brain to process, too. Switching up what skills you're using helps you brain process the information faster and hold onto it. The time will go faster and you'll remember it better? Check and check.

, Sometimes we need a little pick-me-up to keep ourselves going. If the good grades aren't enough of a reward, create something else to keep you concentrated on your studies. Maybe some sweet treats and some noshing time in front of the TV? A shopping spree? A massage or a nap? What would make studying worth your while?


If possible, get your parents involved. Could they help supply you with incentive? Maybe getting better grades could get you out of your least favourite chore or could temporarily up your allowance. Ask them whether they're willing to help work out some type of reward plan – it never hurts to ask.

, Have you ever been handled a pile of paperwork and wanted to fill it out, but you just didn't know what some of it meant? That can be what studying is like sometimes. Recognize when you need to go back and make it simpler. If you don't know the basics, don't try to tackle the content. Parse it out first.


When a question comes up saying, ""What was George Washington's stance on the Boston Tea Party?"" it'll help to know who George Washington is. Figure that out and then move onto the content at hand.

, Teachers know it, but they'll rarely say it: reading can get boring, especially when it's in a topic you don't enjoy. To make your studying more effective and to make it easier to concentrate, use active reading techniques. This'll keep your brain from wandering and make sure your grades stay top drawer. Here are a few ideas:


Ask yourself questions as you read.
Look away from the page and summarize out loud what you read.

, Use as few words as possible and brief examples to tell what you mean to say. Abbreviate the spellings of what you write in your notes. Note page numbers, titles and authors of books in case you need to refer to them again for a bibliography or another reason.


Create a quiz as part of your note making, as you read and use it later for checkup and a review.

, During your break, make your time online count. Get right on Facebook. Turn your phone on and check for texts or missed calls. Don't spend time answering them right then unless there is an emergency. Take part in all your favourite break activities – but only do so for a few minutes. Get it out of your system, and then get back to studying. You'll feel a little better having been ""plugged in"" and ""connected,"" even if was just for a few minutes.


This little recharging session will do wonders for your focusing ability. You may think it could be distracting and get you off course, but ultimately you'll be able to get more done.As long as you use your break wisely, that is.

, The fact of the matter is that we all have high-energy periods of the day and super low-energy bouts, too. When are yours? If possible, study during your high-energy time. You'll be able to focus better and retain the knowledge you're inputting into your brain. Any other time will just be an uphill battle.


For some people, this will be bright and early in the morning when they still have plenty of energy for the day. For others, they get their juices running at night, after powering up for a while. Whichever is yours, listen to your body and study during that time.

, The benefits of sleep are practically innumerable. Not only are your hormones regulated and information synthesized, but it helps you fire on all pistons the next day, too. In fact, trying to focus while overly tired is physically similar to trying to focus while drunk.If you can't concentrate, this could be why.


Most people need between 7-9 hours of sleep a night. Some a little more, some a little less. How many hours do you like to sleep, when you don't have to set an alarm? Try to get that every night by going to bed a bit earlier than usual, as required.

, You are what you eat after all, and if you eat healthy, your mind will be healthy, too. Aim to eat your favourite colourful fruits and veggies, whole grains, lean meats and dairy, nuts (not greasy fries/chips and fattening candy), and good fats, like the ones in dark chocolate and olive oil. A healthy diet will keep you more energized and make it easier to put your mind to the test.Avoid white foods like white bread, potatoes, flour, grease and sugar. They're just ""dead"" foods and sugary drinks that cause you to crash in class and at study time.

, You are your motivation when it comes down to it. If you convince yourself you can focus, you can. Grab your mind by the horns are start thinking positive: you can do this and you will. There's nothing stopping you but you.


Try the ""5 More"" rule. Tell yourself to do only five more things or five more minutes before quitting. Once you've finished those, do another five. Breaking tasks up into smaller chunks makes things easier for those with shorter concentration spans and it keeps your mind going longer.

, While fresh, you can sizzle with the highest powers of concentration at your disposal. Do the most critical and deep background concepts early before moving onto easier (less challenging) but necessary grinding out of details. If you do the easier tasks first, you will be thinking about and stressing about the harder ones the whole time, reducing your productivity and ability to focus.


That being said, avoid bogging yourself down when reading, or getting stuck and defeated on difficult problems or essay questions. Sometimes the least desirable part of an assignment may be too time-consuming and it could drain/kill all your available time. So try to limit your time and self-supervise to move on to easier matters, if absolutely necessary.

, Search on YouTube for a BiNaural Beat, and use of headphones or earbuds are required. If BiNaural Beats work for you, this will be like magic!


Listen while studying. For best results you should listen on a low to medium volume during your study period. Prolonged use is not harmful.

, When combined with a good timetable, food, rest and anything else that benefits your study, this track may improve your memory.Study is such an important part of life and to learn how to maintain good focus and concentration is a lifelong skill.

, After listening for a few hours your ears will take a few minutes to readjust to the normal ambient sounds in the room. It is perfectly normal, if your hearing is a little distorted. Many other strange effects are possible with BiNaural Beat, but for the majority they work.


Headaches are normal for about 10-25 minutes, this is your brain adjusting to the beat. If it does not subside after 30 minutes, better to leave this out of your routine.
Music can also be played along with the beat to make the sound more appealing. Together they may aid further in concentration.

Summarize the lecture notes at the bottom of the page.",How to Take Lecture Notes," Teachers assign notes so that you will be familiar with the topic being discussed in class. If you do the assigned notes before class, you’ll already know many of the background details. Then you can focus your note-taking on key concepts.


Read through your notes from the previous lecture before class as well. This will help you get back up to speed on where you last left off in the class.;
, If your teacher provides outlines, PowerPoint slides, or even a basic summary of the upcoming lecture, use it to your advantage. Think of it as the framing for a house, which you will then complete and furnish with your note-taking.


It may be tempting to just print out that lecture outline or slideshow and figure you can skip note-taking during class -- or just jot down a few things on the printout here and there. But it is much better to use these materials to structure your notes. This is the best way to process information, which is after all the goal of note-taking., Many students are more comfortable typing than writing, but there are still reasons to consider the tried-and-true method of putting pen to paper. Some studies indicate that students who hand-write notes are more able to comprehend and recall lecture material than those who type. It can be easier to fall into transcription mode on a laptop. This is when where you try to type everything said instead of actively discerning what is most important to write down. Writing things down by hand can help you achieve greater focus.On the other hand, using a laptop or other electronic device makes it easier to format, save, edit, share, and read notes (with no worries about messy handwriting).
Note-taking aids available on laptops are nearly endless, such as: “notebook layout” formatting on Microsoft Word, etc.; software that connects a recording of the lecture to your notes; note organization programs that let you unite materials of various type and formats, such as emails and PDFs; and collaborative note-taking platforms that allow you to team up with others to take notes in real time. These may be lifesavers or distractions for you. Only you can judge what works best.
Some instructors and institutions ban the use of laptops in class, so don’t discount the need to know how to write notes by hand.

, Choose a spot in the class where you will have few distractions. Then you will be able to pay attention better and take better notes. Find a spot where you can see and hear the lecturer clearly. You should also be able to see the board clearly. Show up to class a little early to ensure you get your pick of seats.


If you find yourself distracted by noisy fellow students, an air conditioning vent, or an unfortunate glare on the projector screen, discreetly move to a new seat if you can do so without causing a significant disruption. Otherwise, do your best this time and find a new spot for the next time.

, If you take notes by hand, bring extra pens or pencils and paper. If you take notes on a laptop or other electronic device, make sure it is sufficiently charged and ready to go as soon as class begins.


Some people prefer using loose note sheets so they can lay them out on the table or floor when studying, while others find bound notebooks more tidy.

, Make sure your notes are clearly labeled for future reference. Write the date of the lecture and the topic at the top of each page.If you have multiple pages of notes, include page numbers as well. This will help you keep your notes in order.

, The more orderly your notes are at creation, the easier they will be to understand, revise, and study. One option is the outline format, especially if the lecture is clearly structured and/or presented in such a manner. In this format, you’ll have section headings. Underneath each section heading, write down ideas in bullet form and supplementary ideas with indented sub-bullets. This is much better than just writing down everything as a new point.


Be warned that lecturers are not always organized about following main points with subpoints. Keep in mind that you may have to reorganize your notes after the lecture.

, In order to take better notes, you need to be an “active listener.” This means that you don’t just record what is said. Instead, you should engage with the material and determine the essential elements of what is being said.


For instance, instead of spending time writing down every detail of Theodore Roosevelt's various foreign policy actions, strive to establish key concepts of his overall foreign policy and identify the examples as support. This way, you have already begun the process of learning and understanding (or, in other words, studying).
This necessity of active engagement is one reason why many experts advise against recording lectures.,If you do insist on recording lectures, or have a legitimate need to do so. Ask the professor beforehand if it’s okay to record. The lecture is considered the professor’s intellectual property. In addition, some institutions have specific policies regarding recording.

, Don’t waste time easing your way into note-taking mode at the beginning of class. Be ready to go from the very start.


Lectures often begin with an explicit preview of what will be covered, or at least implicit “leads” about what is to follow. Listen carefully to the opening of the lecture for context clues that can help your organization and discernment of what will be most important.
Don’t pay attention to students who arrive late or who are not yet ready to take notes.

, Every instructor organizes each lecture into some sort of outline, even if it's implicit and loosely followed. The information that is included on lecture slides will give you a solid idea of how to keep your notes organized.

, The lecturer will use vocal patterns, hand gestures and other indications to emphasize important parts of the lecture. Start observing these patterns and gestures in order to discern what is essential information..Recognize main ideas by identifying signal words and phrases that indicate something important is to follow. Your instructor is not going to send up a rocket when she states an important new idea or gives an example. But she will use signals to convey what she is doing. Every good speaker does it, and you should expect to receive these signals. Examples include:

There are three reasons why...
First... second... third...
The significance of this is...
The impact of this is...
From this, we can see…


Learn to identify other clues as well. When making a key point, the lecturer may speak more slowly or loudly; repeat a word or phrase; take a longer pause before resuming speaking (perhaps even to take a drink of water); gesture with his or her hands more demonstratively; stop walking around and / or look more intently into the audience; and so on.

, Shorthand writing is a way to use shortcuts so that you don’t have to write every single word. You can also write notes more quickly, an essential skill when listening to a classroom lecture. But when taking notes, don’t use true shorthand like a stenographer. This requires lengthy transcription. Instead, develop your own set of shortcuts, abbreviations, symbols, sketches, etc. Even if no one else knows what your shorthand means, you’ll know what you mean.Use abbreviations and skip unimportant words to take notes efficiently. Only record the important words that you need to get the idea of the point made. Skip words like ""the"" and ""a"" that do not convey additional meaning to the lecture content. Create abbreviations to help you write things down quickly, such as drawing arrows for increase/decrease or to show causation, and especially for terms used over and over again (e.g., IR for international relations).
Paraphrase everything except formulas and specific definitions or facts that will likely be required verbatim on the exam.Underline, circle, star, highlight, or otherwise identify key examples, definitions, or other important materials. Devise your own marking code to indicate each type.
Try drawing diagrams or pictures for concepts you can't quickly describe or immediately understand. For instance, draw a pie chart to roughly indicate the relative strength of political parties in a particular election instead of writing these details out.

, Make sure your letters and words are adequately spaced and legible so that you can read them later. Few things are more frustrating than being unable to read your own handwriting, especially when trying to study for a biology exam.

, Don’t try to cram as much as possible onto each sheet.Give yourself lots of white space on your page. More spaced-out writing allows plenty of room for revision and annotation later. This style is also easier to read and digest the information when studying.

, It is easy to zone out as the clock ticks near the end of the class period. Other students may be starting to gather up their materials and whisper with their friends about what’s for lunch. However, the conclusion of the lecture is just as vital as the introduction in laying out the big picture and key themes and concepts.


If there is a summary at the end of the lecture, pay close attention to it. You can use it to check the organization of your notes. If your notes seem disorganized, copy down the main points that are covered in the summary. It will help in revising your notes later., During lecture, as well as at the end of the lecture, make sure to ask questions about points that you don’t understand. When other students ask questions, write down the questions and the instructor's answers.This additional information might answer questions you have as well.


If you are self-conscious about holding up the class by asking a question (and annoying the students who already have one foot out the door), ask your professor after class. You’ll likely find other students doing the same, and can listen in on their questions as well.
You can also bring a list of questions to your professor’s office hours.

, Do your review within 24 hours after the lecture. By this time, you may have already forgotten 80% of the lecture material.Build upon what you have learned, instead of having to re-learn the material.

, Think of your in-class notes as your draft copy, and the revision as your edited copy. Create a new version of your notes. This will be helpful especially if your notes are sloppy, disorganized, or borderline illegible. Don’t just copy down your notes as you originally wrote them. Make this part an active process of revision.Use the clues you picked up during the lecture regarding structure and key concepts to reorganize what you wrote down.
Fill in weak spots with material from the textbook.

, When you are revisiting your notes, you should also spend time to highlight or underline important parts of the lecture. Use different colored highlighters or pens to color-code recurring concepts. Marked-up notes will be valuable when you begin to study for the test. These allow you to quickly and efficiently recall key parts of each lecture.

, If you have missed a class due to illness or another reason, you should be sure to get notes from a classmate. Talk with the instructor as well so that you understand the material.


Don’t rely on a notes-for-sale service. Most universities have a policy against using these types of notes.Remember, using purchased notes is not “active learning” that aids in understanding and retention.
If you have a physical or other documented disability which makes note-taking difficult, discuss options with your professor and your institution’s student services. Various options, including perhaps special lecture guides, note-taking assistance, permission to record lectures, or tutoring, will likely be available.

, The Cornell Method is a way to take notes that involves first taking notes and then developing questions from those notes. Divide your sheet into two sections by drawing a vertical line about 2.5 inches from the left margin. Continue this line until about two inches from the bottom of the sheet. Then draw a horizontal line two inches from the bottom edge.


For laptop users, there are programs that can format your word processor in Cornell Method style.

, In the largest section of your now-divided page, take notes on the main ideas of the lecture as you go. Leave ample space for later revisions.


Add examples, diagrams, charts, and other material that the instructor discusses.

, The left-side section of your page is used for generating your own questions from the lecture notes. These questions may help clarify points, definitions, and so on. Review your notes within one or two days. This will ensure that your recall of the information will be stronger.


You can develop potential test questions from this material. What do you think the instructor is going to ask on an exam?
When you are studying your notes for an exam, cover the right-hand side of the page. See if you can answer the questions that you’ve included on the left-hand side.

, Use the bottom section of your page to provide a summary of this page’s notes. This will help you recall the important points for this portion of the lecture.

Try to sit in the front seats and with a person who has a good reputation in preparing notes.,
Listen.,
Write accurate notes.,
Highlight as you write.,
Write questions as you listen.,
Be a proactive listener.,
Take care with recording devices.",How to Actively Learn During Lectures," Sit in the position where the lecturer can easily see your preparation of notes. This will propel you to prepare better notes, note more points and will make you able to create a better reputation in the class. If you sit in the front, you will have fewer distractions and will be able to focus on the lecture.;
, This means staying alert and not wandering off into a daydream, mentally creating a to-do list or even outlining what you will write your next research paper on. Forget everything except what you are listening to and watching - devote all of your senses to the lecture. Being genuinely interested in the lecture subject will help you maintain the focus.

, It is important to write down key points from the lecture. This does not mean writing everything, word for word. It means that you need to follow the art of distillation, namely drawing out the points that matter and the points that sum up the gist of each section of the lecture.

, In the margin of your notes, write keywords or use signs that will draw you to the points quickly when you are re-reading the lecture notes. This does two things - it immediately creates a quick connection in your mind to the point and it makes it very easy to find the key points when you revise or write using the notes.

, If you can formulate questions aimed at the subject-matter as you are listening, this will help to solidify the information in your mind. Whether or not you get to ask these questions of the lecturer, you are learning a key skill that will be useful for the rest of your life. Asking questions enables you to explore the information further and forces you to examine the information you are receiving in a more active manner.

, If the lecturer makes points that you disagree with or find are worth further consideration, place an asterisk or exclamation marks next to the point and single-words such as ""nonsense"", ""unverified"", ""explore further"". This creates a connection in your mind with the possible further research avenues for you after the lecture.

, If you are allowed to record a lecture, be careful about relying on this as your sole source of remembering what was said. Do you really want to have to sit through the entire lecture again just to find the key points? It isn't really a time-saving device at all and you are much better off writing notes.

Annotate with a highlighter and a pen or pencil.,
Use sticky notes or tabs if you can't mark up the book.,
Try an electronic annotation program.,
Remove distractions.,
Read the book slowly and carefully.,
Underline key phrases.,
Circle or box key words.,
Bracket key sections.,
Make a list of words you don’t recognize.,
Reflect on the book in the margins.,
Make a list of questions you have about the book.,
Link ideas together with arrows.,
Summarize each section at the bottom of the page.",How to Annotate a Book," One of the easiest ways to annotate a book is to use a highlighter and pen or pencil directly on the text. Choose a highlighter in a shade that is easy for you to read on the page, such as a light blue or orange color. The standard yellow highlighter shade would also work too. Go for a pen in a dark color so it's easy to read.Try to stick to one highlighter color for the annotation so you do not end up with highlighted pages that are hard to re read.
Choose the highlighter and pen or pencil option if it's okay for you to mark up the text.;
, Sticky notes or sticky tabs are a good option if you’d prefer not to mark up the book’s pages. Get colored sticky notes or tabs to mark pages or passages as part of your annotations.Look for sticky notes and tabs in different colors. You can then use the different colored notes or tabs to annotate the book.

, If you are annotating a book on an eReader, there are several different annotation programs you can download. Programs like Skim and Marvin make it easy for you to annotate a text on your eReader.You can download electronic annotation programs in the Apps store on your eReader.

, Go to a quiet, isolated spot at school, like the library or a study hall. If you are at home, close the door of your room and let others around you know you are not to be disturbed., To annotate a book properly, you need to take your time and read the book slowly. Pay attention to each word in the text. Pause and think about a passage in the text before moving on. Moving slowly through the text will ensure you do not miss anything and that you annotate the text well., Start by underlining any phrases that feel important to you. Often, key phrases appear at the end of a sentence. They may also appear after a colon or a comma. Look for phrases that appear several times in the text, as they are likely important.Try to only underline phrases that seem very important in the text. You do not want to end up with pages of underlined phrases, as it will be difficult for you to determine which ones are actually important.
You can also underline phrases you like or find interesting. If a sentence strikes you or stands out to you, underline it so you can return to it later.

, Look for words that seem important to the author. You may circle words that connect back to the main idea in a section. Or you may draw a box around words that are repeated several times in the book.For example, if you notice the word “power” appears several times in the text, circle or box it as an annotation.
The author may tell you to keep certain words in mind as you read the text. Make sure you circle or box these words as part of your annotations.

, If you feel several lines in a section are important, use brackets to indicate this in the text. Try to choose only several lines or short sections of the text to bracket. Bracketing long sections can make it hard for you to return to the annotation later and get a clear sense of why you noted the section.For example, if there is a section that focuses on a particular case study in the text you find interesting or important, use a bracket in the margins to annotate it.

, Keep a running list of words that you do not know or are not familiar with. Write them down on a separate piece of paper or at the end of the text. Then, look up the terms so you know what they mean. Consider the meaning of the term in the context of where it appears in the book.Keep a dictionary handy so you can look up terms you do not recognize quickly and easily.

, Have a conversation with the text by writing down your thoughts and reflections in the margins as you read. You may write one or two words to mark your thoughts. You can also jot down short phrases in the margins as they come.As you read, ask yourself questions like, ""What is the author trying to tell me as the reader?"" ""Why is this passage in the text?"" ""How do I respond emotionally to the text?""

, As you read, write down any questions you have about the text. Jot them down in the margins or at the bottom of the page. Ask questions about words or phrases that confuse you. Pose questions about ideas that you find hard to follow or do not agree with.For example, you may ask questions like, ""Why did the author include this example in the book?"" ""What is the goal of the author in this passage?"" ""What is the author trying to say here?""
To make the questions short so they can fit into the margins, you may simply put a question mark next to passages you do not understand. Or you may write the questions like, ""Goal of the author?"" ""What is being said?"" to keep them short.
You can also keep the questions in a separate notebook or piece of paper so you do not clutter up the margins of the book.

, Use arrows or lines to connect ideas and themes together in the text. You may circle key words on the same page and then link them together with arrows. Or you could highlight a passage and draw an arrow to another passage further down the page.Linking ideas together will help you think critically about the text. It will also deepen your annotations and notes on the text.

, Once you have completed a section of the book, try to condense the main thoughts and ideas in the section with a few key words. Write these key words at the bottom of the page so you can return to them later.For example, you may summarize a passage in the book with key words like “power,” “female sexuality,” and “Freud case study.”
You can keep your summaries in a separate notebook or piece of paper so the margins do not become cluttered with your notes.

Just get started!",How to Get Motivated to Study," This could be a library, a cafe, a room in your house, or anywhere else that is free from excessive noise and interruptions. Avoid places where you're likely to run into your friends.;
, Make sure you have all the pens, pencils, paper, highlighters, and Post-Its you need. You don't want to interrupt your study time to get more.

, People are more productive when they're hydrated and taking steady sips of water will help stave off thirst. Small snacks like peanuts, granola bars or fruit will help keep you energized.


Avoid fast food and pastries. This includes pizza, hamburgers, nachos, doughnuts, muffins, cinnamon rolls, and croissants. These foods will give you a short energy rush that quickly turns into sleepiness.

, Little things like having to pull up your trousers can eat away at your concentration. Wear clothes that are familiar, fit loosely, and don't constrict you.


If you have long hair, tie it back so that it doesn't fall into your eyes.

, You do not want to be taking calls from friends and family members when you're trying to study. Let them know in advance that you need time to study, if you think they'll be concerned. Better yet, just place it on silent and keep it somewhere out of view so you won't be tempted to keep taking a sneak peek.

, Unless you absolutely need it for studying, turn the computer off. Likewise, stay away from public computers. It's a minefield of potential distractions. It's all too easy to tell yourself ""I just want to check my e-mail"" or ""Let me just look at this bit of celebrity gossip."" Before you know it, you've wasted a whole hour.


If you do need to use the computer as a research tool, consider printing out the information once you get it so that you're not tempted to open up another browser window and check your Facebook status. If you're really tempted to go on social sites, why not deactivate for a little while?
If you need to use the computer solely as a word processor, think about temporarily turning off your Internet access.

, Think in specific, achievable goals instead of vague generalities. Instead of telling yourself, ""I have to get good at math,"" think of a specific goal such as, ""I will learn how to graph a quadratic equation."" Achieving this goal will make you feel accomplished at the end of your study session.

, Think of a small way to reward yourself when you've met your goal. If you're in the middle of a study session, you can take a quick walk, eat a granola bar, or listen to a favorite song. If you've finished your study session, then feel free to have some fun by playing games, talking to friends, or watching a video.


If you decide to reward yourself with a quick break from studying, remember that you will eventually have to get back to work. Set a time limit for your break and don't listen to the voice in your head saying, ""Just a few more minutes.""

, In order to keep up a positive attitude, try to visualize the good things that will come to you by studying. Imagine getting a good score on a test, receiving praise from your teacher, or the good college you might be planning to attend. Although studying is sometimes boring and hard, thinking of the end result will keep you pushing ahead.

, Set aside a specific block of time for studying for each day that you need it rather than telling yourself vaguely, ""I'll have to study sometime this week."" Planning it out will make it easier to stick to your resolution.

, Don't wait until the last minute to study for a big exam or read a 90-page chapter. If it is assigned Monday and due Friday, start on Monday and finish early in the week so you don't have to worry about it at the last minute.

, Sometimes that can be the hardest part. If your study schedule looks too daunting, set a smaller goal. Consider reading half of the chapter today and half tomorrow. Just do one or two problems from the workbook. Remember that it is always better to do a little now than end up doing nothing at all.

Studies show that we learn best before 9:30pm, so aim for an early evening start to the party.Plan for a Friday or Saturday, so that your guests can sleep in the next day if the party runs late.;
, Narrow your potential guest list to your classmates from one class. Don’t overlook your friends! Invite at least a few classmates who take good notes, ask good questions, and rarely miss class—even if you don’t ordinarily talk to them. They’ll bring some motivation to the party, and you can make new friends in the process.

, Collect your classmates’ email addresses or use the built-in email list of your class’s online portal, if you have one. If you have the time and the skills, you could design an eye-catching invite. If not, you could choose from the many websites (such as Care2 or WWF) that let you send free e-cards to multiple addresses. You could also send a group text spiced up with emojis.


Send your invitations about two weeks in advance.
Ask your guests to RSVP no later than one week before the party.

, In the RSVP section of your invitation, ask everyone to tell you whether they’re vegan, Kosher, lactose intolerant, gluten-free, sensitive to caffeine, etc. Make a list of how many guests need accommodations, and take it with you when you go shopping., Tell your guests to do this before they arrive at the party. They can check off each goal as they fulfill it. Remind your guests to limit their goals to what they can achieve in the timeframe of the party. During the final 15 minutes of the party, have everyone share what they managed to accomplish. This creates a sense of accountability and also makes everyone feel more productive as they depart for the evening., Make sure the space you choose is well-lit so that no one strains their eyes.If possible, choose a room with a variety of seating areas so that everyone is comfortable. Have enough chairs at the table. Create a place on the floor with a few pillows for guests who want to stretch out.

, For a study party, you don’t have to worry about a thorough clean, but a quick tidying up will show your guests that you care. Clear any clutter that you won’t need for the party. Vacuum the carpet. Wipe away any dirt from the windows. If you plan on studying in your bedroom or dorm room, neaten the covers on your bed.

, Have everyone silence their phones during study time. Turn off the TV and the stereo. Have everyone put their laptop/tablet screens in plain view of each other to make sure no one wastes time on irrelevant websites. If you share your living space with others who will not be joining the party, ask them to be quiet around the party space.

, Have extra sheets of loose-leaf paper, pens, and/or sharpened pencils for guests who forgot theirs. If your guests want to sit away from the table, have a few clipboards or hardcover books for them to lean on as they write. Provide extra copies of vocabulary words, short readings, study guides, etc. for your classmates.

, When guests start to arrive, don’t force them into studying right away. Allow everyone to settle in for about 20 minutes. Provide a relaxing atmosphere with some music. Set out some snacks for guests who might be hungry.

, In the traditional Pomodoro Technique, students alternate 25 minutes of uninterrupted study with five minutes of break time.Feel free to make modifications, such as 30 to 45 minutes of study with 20- to 30-minute breaks. Some examples of break activities include:


Playing music
Watching TV
Streaming short videos online
Playing video games
Relaxing outside, if possible

, Write different class topics on strips of paper, and put them in a hat or similar container. Have everyone randomly draw a topic from the hat. Have them pair up or form groups of three. Each person should then “teach” their topic to the other group member(s) by putting the material into their own words. After about 10 to 15 minutes, have the groups split up and find new partners to “teach.”

, Many websites, such as DiscoveryEducation.com, generate free crossword puzzles, seek-and-finds, jumbles, etc. Decide on the one or two puzzle formats most relevant to your subject. Take about an hour to fill out clues and answers. Print enough copies for everyone attending the party. You can decide whether to have everyone pair up or work as one big group.

, A few fun games will prevent your party from flopping. Use your favorite game shows, board games, etc. as inspiration to make your study session more interesting. Divide your guests into teams. (The number of teams will depend on how many people show up.) Each team member will take turns answering questions. Some examples of games include:



Jeopardy: Buy or find a stack of index cards. Write point values on one side and questions and answers on the other. Questions should become more challenging as point values get higher.

Trivial Pursuit: Use the board from the original game with new questions tailored for the party. Use index cards for the questions.

Modified Charades/Pictionary: One or two people are assigned a topic to draw or act out. Everyone else must use clues in the sketch to figure out the answer. Unlike regular charades, actors should be allowed to talk.

If you’re studying U.S. History, you could have two people “debate” which issues should be included in the Constitution.
If you’re studying English Literature, everyone could act out chapters from the novel your class is reading.



, Disposable (includes recyclable and compostable) plates and cups reduce the amount of cleaning you’ll have to do after the party is over. If you stick to finger foods, you won’t have to worry about utensils. Buy one package of plates and one package of cups.

, This is especially helpful if you have to consider dietary restrictions. Point out indicators such as vegan, gluten-free, caffeine-free, etc. However, even without dietary restrictions, your guests might simply prefer, say, diet cola over regular. Letting your guests know what they’re about to consume is the courteous thing to do.

, If you have access to an oven, buy a few frozen pizzas from the grocery store, and cook them. If this isn’t the case, order a few pies from the local pizzeria. How many pizzas you buy depends on the number of guests and their dietary preferences.

, Bake the snacks if you have access to an oven and are confident of your cooking skills. If you aren’t a good cook or live in a dorm room, it’s best to buy them from a grocery store or bakery. Place them on a tray on a surface separate from the main study area. Some options include:


Cupcakes
Brownies/blondies
Doughnuts
Cookies

, Salty snacks are inexpensive, easy to eat, and easy to clean up. About two party-size (18-ounce/510-gram) bags of chips should accommodate a group of five or six. Have a variety of dips on hand to accommodate everyone. Some possibilities include:


Potato chips
Tortilla chips
Pretzels
Ranch dip
Hummus
Salsa

, Since studying requires alertness, most of your beverages will likely be caffeinated. However, you should also have a few caffeine-free drinks on hand. Consider hot beverages if you’re allowed to have an electric kettle or coffee maker in your room. Buy soft drinks in two-liter bottles for smaller groups or six packs for larger groups. Some ideas include:


Coffee
Hot tea
Regular and/or diet cola
Regular and/or diet version of clear soda (like Sprite or 7-Up)
Bottled water

,
The more fun, the more worthwhile!,
Try writing spelling words out 5 times.",How to Have Fun While Studying1," If you are not the tech type you can have an older sibling/parent/guardian make a game for you and play it!;
, Put on some music that has catchy tunes that will relax you. Never use music or songs that have lyrics to them: it will catch your attention too much, unless you are a type that can zone out lyrics, and it will take your mind off of studying. Something in the electronic music genres such as pop or jazz is great for studying. Also if you do not like music you can keep thinking about a favorite scene in a book or movie that you like.

, Get together some healthy snacks to nibble on as you study. Allowing yourself a little nibble every now and then helps the study time to pass more pleasantly. Also, it is often effective if you use snacks as a form of treat for yourself every time you complete a part of the work. Don't have a huge bag of chips - try to have something simple such as an apple or banana. Vitamin B is great but an occasional treat is okay like hard candy is fine because you don't need attention about that. Something with a lot of B vitamins such as nuts are great for studying because B vitamins are great for brain fun hours, no matter what. Decorate your spot with favorite things like postcards, knick-knacks, figurines, notes from friends etc. Even temporary spaces can be decorated with bits and pieces you keep in a portable box. But, try not to make your study area too distracting. The less clutter in your study area, the better.

, Nothing makes study more difficult than feeling uncomfortable as you sit and not being able to read the work properly. This is especially true in the winter months. It is also good to study near a window or natural light because that will have a bigger boost in energy than artificial light.

, Nothing sends a person to sleep faster than lack of air. Get fresh air into your room regularly - even in winter! Make sure it circulates, even if this means using a fan in winter to blow around warm air; this is better than stale, stagnant air.

, Being too hot or too cold will make studying hard and you'll be tempted to crawl off to somewhere more comfortable. Turn the heating on or the cooling if you can. If you can't, then improvise and do what most students have always done to heat and cool: open or close windows & doors; use a red heat lamp at your feet (uses a lot less electricity); use a blanket; remove or put on extra layers; drink hot or cold drinks; put on a fan etc.

, Your supplies can encourage you to study - a pen that feels just right in your hand, paper that is so soft the pen glides over it, a book stand that stops your book from slumping over, a row of colored highlighters begging to be used and a scented eraser that smells delicious. Think of the things that you enjoy having around you at study time and make these your little props for amusing yourself with during the study. Don't let them distract you from the study though!

, Don't make your study a never-ending process. Give it its time slot and devote yourself to it during this times and then reward yourself with the things you really feel like doing afterwards. Use the study time effectively, don't doodle, feel sorry for yourself or call up friends. That just stretches out the pain and increases your lack of interest. Assign the tasks to be done, do them and then forget about it and go and do the other stuff that you feel like doing. Also if you wanted to you could take a longer break and in the summer go start an ice cold lemonade stand and have friends help you enjoy yourself. Once it's time to come back in you can fell good and finish your studies while felling good about your self.


, Maybe it's study in an area you really dislike or you just don't care about. Try to think outside the actual pages before you and put the topic into a wider perspective. Think of the sorts of careers people have using this study topic; think of how everyday problems are solved using the techniques that the study is requiring of you. This can help to enliven otherwise dull matter and can also impress a teacher if you show how this knowledge applies elsewhere in some way. It demonstrates application to the topic in spite of your reservations. And hopefully, it also helps to chase away the boredom of it.

, Sure, it might not grab you the same way that a basketball game outdoors would or a TV show you're missing because of the study. All the same, you're learning coping skills. You're learning how to prioritize, how to be patient and how to deal with something you don't like or feel disinterested in. Perhaps it doesn't feel like it at the time but these are some of life's most important skills because you'll come up against the temptation to fall into boredom many times - during work, a meeting, ceremonies, even parties! You're also learning about the general way the world works and where you might best slot into it yourself. How can you be sure you do or don't want to do things in life unless you know about them first?

, If you have a household friend, such as a cat or a fish, you can have them around you as you study. Purring cats provide a great source of rhythmical comfort that can ease the studying time and a fish swimming around and around can do wonders for reminding you that it's worth studying so that you can become a bigger fish in a sea of many. And some of you may be thinking wait a minute what about dogs... well dogs are great companions for studying if they are trained they should be quiet when you are hard at work and playful when you re ready for a break.

, Frequent, short breaks are better for you and your thinking processes than infrequent, long breaks. Set an alarm on your computer or on a clock to go off every half hour and go for a stretch, get a coffee or milkshake, see what the weather's like outside. No matter how old you are, try to make your material into a game. It works so well. If you have a younger brother or sister, let them help you. Make up a song or a rap about your material. You would be surprised by how much it helps.

, For example: Beth has 5 apples. If she goes to the apple orchard and picks 5 times the amount of apples she already has, but drops 3 on the way home how many apples she have now? Isn't that a boring problem? You can make it more interesting. For example: Mr. Gidget has 5 bubbles. He goes to the magical bubble island and his friend Mr. Gadget gives him 5 times the amount of bubbles he already has. If Mr. Gidget drops 3 of the bubbles into a pit filled with needles, how many bubbles does he have? Isn't that better? If you use funny names, objects you like, or made-up places, the problem is 10 times more interesting, making it more likely that you will solve it.

, If you don't have time to make a song, search YouTube. Chances are is there will be some sort of relevant song. You might want to start with the Animaniacs. If you are the creative type take a song and wipe out all the lyrics and put your study material in there and sing it to the tune of your chosen song. If you just sing their songs to yourself it can help you to ace that test! Be sure to print out the lyrics to the songs and make it a point to sing the song at least once a night so you'll remember it.

, The best site on the internet to make flashcards on is Quizlet. When making your flashcards, always do the term in capital letters and the definition in lowercase letters. Using different handwriting, colors, and decorating your flashcards will help you remember them. Be sure that you actually USE your flashcards. Just making them won't do anything for you at all.

, For example, If one of your notes is ""Ohio produces more cheese than Wisconsin"", draw some cheese and a picture of Ohio smiling and Wisconsin frowning. This works really well if you are a visual learner.

, Get a piece of large A4 paper and rule a table. Use bright color pencils, highlighters etc. and make a color order. For example,for history you could use neon green for dates, blue for the names of important people, and purple for what significant things they did.

, It is also good if you record yourself and listen to the recording at least once every night. This is helpful in literature and history textbook.

, For example, the 5 great lakes = HOMES (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior) However, make them creative so that you can easily remember them. A creative one for remembering the eight levels of classification is Dumb King Philip Came Over From Greece Sneezing (Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) Or you could do, King Henery Died Unexpectedly Drinking Chocolate Milk {Kilo, Hecto, Deca, Unit, Deci, Centi, Milli}

, Decorate them and draw pictures. On the night before the test or quiz, present and explain them to your family.

, Have a parent or sibling read a word from your list to you. If you spell the word correctly with the cereal, you can eat it!

, If you work well with computers, you don't have to stick to handwriting your notes, which can take forever and it can be very mind-numbing. Go ahead and use the computer if you find it much easier to type. You could create a cool animation with a voice-over, a Prezi presentation, a multimedia PowerPoint slideshow with music, pictures and video. If you write your notes on a Word Document, personalize them by creating your own personal logo and using it as a letter-head - and that way nobody can steal your notes.

, Have a parent or older sibling that didn't take the test grade it. If you feel confident, you can grade it yourself.

, This makes the material a LOT more interesting.

, Pack up your textbook, notes and binder and try heading to your local coffee shop or library. Bonus: someone there may be able to help you with your homework!

, It really works!

,, Play math games online or play a writing game on paper!

, This will help you memorize them quickly.

If you have an older sibling at home, you can study together so you have company.,
Talk out loud.,
Quiz each other.,
Race against each other.,
Invent crazy punishments to motivate you and your friends if you just can't be bothered studying.,
You can create a scenario and make a short play or skit with a friend.,
Study in the same place quietly, and take a break every half hour or hour.",How to Have Fun While Studying2," If you do not have one, you can ask your mom whether you may go over to your buddies house (that is in your class) and maybe play a studying game, but be sure to get the needed studying done.

, Everyone learns differently, and for some, talking out loud helps cement ideas into your head. Discuss sample test questions or homework problems with each other.

, Take turns asking each other questions, or quizzing each other on vocab words.

, Set the timer and see who can finish filling in their worksheet/writing their notes the fastest. The slowest person loses. However this method might not be the best method as it isn't always fair - some people would rather take their time.

, For example the first person to leave without finishing their assignment isn't allowed to go to the upcoming school formal.

, Pretend you're a character from TV or Broadway etc - or make up your own character. Physically turn your notes into a script and memorize your 'lines' by talking it out loud, over and over again. Then when you memorize the entire script, talk out loud as you would if you were your chosen character. You could even use funny accents if you like, you could even sing it Broadway-style. If you're really confident, you can perform the skit in front of friends, teachers, parents etc...and make them laugh! It helps if you are a tactile learner (you learn by touching) or a verbal learner (you learn by talking). It seems a bit crazy at first but when you think about it, it actually works, especially if you do it with a friend. By looking at it this way, it doesn't seem like boring study at all!

, Do something fun, such as watch TV or play video games or a board game.

Select group members.,
Choose a location.,
Set a time.,
Make a commitment.,
Choose a group leader.",How to Have a Study Session With Friends1," The ideal study group should have around 3-4 members, but no more than 5. Take some time to work out whom you would like to include. Think about your friends' personalities. (For example, your distracting, rebellious friend who hates homework might not be the best candidate.);
, Some good choices include a local library, a coffee shop, or at someone’s home. A home is probably the easiest place to get distracted and stray from your work, but a library requires you to be somewhat quiet. Although either of those choices are free of charge, whereas working at coffee shop costs some money. Think about what resources (like internet or access to art supplies) you need and which place can best accommodate you.Many libraries have study rooms that allow talking and large groups, so check with your library beforehand.

, Set up a regular session at a time that works for everyone. You can use an online platform like GatherGrid or Doodle to compare everyone’s schedules and find a time that works best.


You may want to consider meeting more than once. If possible, plan to meet at least once a week.

, If you want your study group to be effective, it is important for all of the members to make a commitment to the group. This means showing up on time, ready to work; as well as completing any prep work necessary before the meeting time. If all of your friends are on the same page, your group will do a great job studying together., It is a really good idea to select one group leader or facilitator. This could be one specific person, or group members can take turns. This person is in charge of keeping everyone on track, so that you don’t waste valuable time. Additionally, this person could send out an email or text reminding everyone about the approaching session."

A routine will also make you psychologically better prepared to work when the time comes. The two best times to work are immediately after you get home or after dinner.


The advantage to finishing your homework as you soon as you get home is that you don’t need to worry about school for the rest of the day. The disadvantage is that you might have trouble concentrating without a break. Also, finishing your homework directly after school will interfere with prime playtime.
The advantage to working directly after dinner is that you have some time to rest and might be able to concentrate more when you get to work. The disadvantage is that once you start pushing back homework you can be tempted to procrastinate for the rest of the night. If you hold fast to working immediately after dinner, however, this can foster discipline.;
, You should keep a good record of all your assignments so that you don't forget anything and be forced to rush to finish it in the morning. Purchase a day planner. Record assignments as soon as they are mentioned in class. List all details, including the due date, page numbers, and requirements for the assignment. Review your planner to make sure that you don’t forget any assignments when you sit down to work., Draw up a schedule of when you are going to work and how much work you are going to do. Start by blocking out fixed obligations like school and club meetings. Estimate how much time you need to finish all of your assignments and set aside enough time to finish each of them.Write your schedule down and stick it on the fridge or another place you visit daily.
Alternatively, use a computer scheduling program that can alert you when you have something to do.
If you are having trouble figuring out your schedule, ask your parents if they can help you.

, Waiting too long to finish a big assignment will end with you rushing to complete your work in the morning. If you know there is a test coming up, study a little every day. If there is a big paper due, start work on it as soon as you get it. When you draw up a schedule to complete it, be sure that you schedule several extra days, in case the project takes longer to complete than you thought it would., Misplacing your homework assignments will make it hard to finish on time. Keep a homework folder with completed assignments. Keep your notes and incomplete assignments in binders designed for each subject.Finishing a paper several days in advance will also give you time to review it with fresh eyes and better notice things that need to be fixed.

, When you don’t start your day with homework, you’ll have time in the morning to take up habits that will give you the energy to finish the next day’s work. Have a breakfast that is heavy in protein and whole grains to give you energy throughout the day.It is good to start your day by squeezing a little bit of lemon into some water and drinking it. The lemon water will help you digest your food, giving you more energy when you eat.
Food that can give you energy throughout the day includes: oatmeal, yogurt with granola, and eggs.

, Some short cardio during the morning can boost your energy and concentration throughout the day, helping you stay on schedule. Try going for a ten or fifteen minute jog in the morning., You should start your day with a clear head. Stay away from your computer until after you eat breakfast. Spend some time planning your day. Consider meditating for a few minutes after you wake up so that you are calm and ready to begin your day., When we associate a place with work, our mind becomes primed to work when we sit down. Create a designated workspace where you won’t need to worry about distractions. Pick a place with no TVs or phones. It might help to have a computer around, in case you need it for research, but maybe not so close that you are likely to be distracted by the internet. Be sure that the space is far from noisy siblings or parents. Make your workspace your own with decorations that make you happy. You are more likely to be productive when you decorate your workspace to your taste.
The colors in your workspace have been shown to affect your performance. Red creates greater attention to detail--a good skill for a subject like math. Green and blue tend to encourage creativity, meaning they might be useful when you are working on creative writing. , When you design a schedule, you might find that there isn’t enough time in the day. In that case, you will need to figure out what is most important. You might need to cut some extracurricular activities, like sport or club obligations, that distract you from your school work. If your school work itself is too much, consider dropping some AP or Honor’s classes. Be leery of obligations that require you to wake up earlier in the morning, cutting into your sleep.Consider preparing for the SAT and ACT over the summer or winter break, so that they don’t interfere with your school year work. Ask friends who are also in your extracurricular groups how they manage their schedule. They might be able to give suggestions.

, Modern electronics like TVs, cellphones, and computers can be addictive. When you sit down to work, you are often distracted by these addictions. That not only makes it more difficult to finish homework promptly, it can affect your ability to remember material, or concentrate for long periods of time. You should take some time away from these devices, even when you aren’t working, to break bad habits.For example, consider going a couple of days without using any technology.
Alternatively, promise not to use any technology after a certain hour of the day. This can also make it easier to sleep, because the light from screens causes insomnia.
Consider spending more time on activities that build your attention span. These include reading books and meditating.
Consider downloading an app for your cellphone or computer that blocks distracting websites.

, Your siblings and parents can be part of the problem if they are loud when you are work. Let them know what time of the day you plan to work so that they will give you quiet space and help keep you on task., Ask your parents for help by giving you incentives for doing well in school. Alternatively, reward yourself when you do a good job, and punish yourself when you fall short. You should try, for example, to make the most out of your newfound time at the beginning of the day, so in the future you won’t be tempted to push your work off until the morning.Make yourself a big breakfast in return for finishing up your work on time. Watch a show that you enjoy. Go for a jog.
You could also ask your parents to pay you or give you gifts if you get an A on your report card. This can help motivate you to get to work.For more immediate reward, you could go out with your friends to a movie when you finish a big assignment.

, You are more likely to be motivated if you are in a friend group that reinforces academic goals. You can also learn things, even when you aren't trying, by spending time with intelligent people. You might even want to try taking summer courses at a college, so you can see how college students motivate themselves., Your parents know you better than most people so they might be able to help explain why you are having trouble. They can also help enforce your homework time. Similarly, you can ask your friends how they manage their schedule. If you don't understand an assignment, ask them to explain how to complete the work."

Decide how long your session will be.,
Set a goal.,
Start with a review.,
Plan for breaks.,
Summarize at the end.",How to Have a Study Session With Friends2," In addition to setting a regular time that you will meet with your group, you can begin to structure your study sessions by imposing a time limit. Setting a time limit will help you stay on task. A good mark to shoot for is two hours, and any more than four hours is too long., The best way to make your study sessions productive is to determine what you’d like to get out of the experience. Determining the overarching goal of your group will keep everyone on the same page, and help you set smaller goals to meet during your session.Are you preparing for a particular exam, or trying to work through the basic concepts of a course?
Do you want to use this group to outline each chapter, or are you trying to complete a specific group project?

, Depending on the length of your session, you could begin by spending about half an hour reviewing what you learned that week. Rather than wondering where to begin, this provides a really good place to start, and helps to clarify what direction the session should go. Furthermore, this gives everybody a chance to ask questions and get some clarity on anything they didn’t understand., You can study more effectively if you know you will get to take a break, so it is a good idea to factor some breaks into your study session. After all, what is the fun of studying with friends if you never get to chat or gossip? Set a timer for 50 minutes and study without breaking your focus until the timer goes off. Then reset the timer for 10 minutes, during which members can talk, grab a snack, or use the restroom.

, It is a good idea to use the last 10 minutes to do a quick review of the session itself. If you plan to study together again, this can also be a good time to think about what you’d like to cover during the next session."
"
Teach one another.,
Take quizzes.,
Rotate notes.,
Answer each other’s questions.,
Create a routine.",How to Have a Study Session With Friends3," One of the most effective and rewarding ways to learn is actually to teach other people. In a study group, you can use this to benefit everyone! Try assigning chapters to each members and take turns teaching each other. This greatly benefits both the individual “teacher” as well as the whole group., Another great aspect of working with a group is the ability to quiz one another. This can be done a couple of ways. First, you can simply ask each other questions out loud, orally quizzing one another. Or, different members can create quizzes for different sections and give them to the other members to take (once again, involving “teaching” as a part of learning.), Three or four heads are better than one! Try rotating the notes that you each took in class. Each person likely emphasized a different concept, grasped an element of the lesson a little better, or gained a little insight that the other members of the group did not. When you put all of that together, you’ll walk away with a much stronger understanding of the material., There will always be elements of course that you don’t quite understand. Try answering each other’s questions. First, identifying what you don’t understand and putting that into a question for your group is an excellent exercise. But further, attempting to answer each other’s questions as a group is great for the individual as well as the collective., Humans are creatures of habit. If you can establish some kind of routine within your study session you are likely to be more productive. It may take a little time, as you may have to try out different methods with your group to see what works for you. Here is one example: Try starting off with a review of what you learned that week, and what you’d like to accomplish during this session.
Then, one group member should present a chapter (or lesson) they prepared.
After this, take a break. You could all bring a snack to share.
Then, shift into “question and answer,” where you each present your questions to the group.
Finally, wrap up by summarizing what you’ve covered that day. (If you will be meeting again, you can use this time to assign duties and assignments for next time.)

Get yourself in a homework mood.,
Find a study buddy.,
Write on a topic you’re interested in.,
Write a test for yourself.,
Work on different subjects in a session.,
Space out your homework sessions.,
Make a game of your homework.",How to Make Homework Fun1," For some, it might seem crazy or impossible to 'think' yourself into a mindset for studying. It can be done by taking control of your inner voice. Simply tell yourself you are in the mood for studying. No matter how much you want to go do something else, tell yourself you're in the mood for it. Your motivation won't change instantly, but if you keep telling yourself the right thing, you'll eventually start feeling it a bit.Shifting into the right mindset is an important part of enjoying anything-- not just your homework!;
, Sharing your homework session with someone else helps a lot. If your friend is studying the same materials, you can bounce information off one another. Even if the two of you aren't studying the same material, it's usually inspiring to work with someone else around. You can keep each other accountable, and make sure the other doesn't get lazy.


Make a competition out of the stuff you're working on. Competition with a study buddy is an easy way to add some stakes to the thing you're working on, and the motivation can be a great thing for both of you. Competitions can be a longer-term thing as well. Consider a ""days in a row"" homework persistence bet with a friend. No one likes to be a loser, and you'll probably end up getting far more done than you first imagined.
Choose your study buddy well. In some cases, your study buddy can be a terrible distraction. If the two of you are known to make trouble together, it's probably not a good idea to ask him to study with you.

, Some teachers will assign you a very specific topic to write a paper about, but others will give you more freedom to craft your own topics.Take advantage of these opportunities to find a way to approach the subject matter that really interests you. Think about what aspects of the material engaged you most, or about which you had the most to say. The more invested you feel in a topic, the easier it will be to write about, and the more you will be able to enjoy the process of writing

, There's good evidence to show that we have an easier time remembering things we once forgot.The questions you get wrong on a test will probably be the things you remember most once you get the answers back. Write up a closed-book test of facts you're not too sure about and take it. When you look up the questions you can't answer, you'll remember them better for the real test.


This tends to work better if you have a study buddy to work with. The two of you can trade tests. That way, you won't know what answers you need to know beforehand.

, It's normal to focus on one subject for homework. However, you can learn more if you change up the subjects. For example, if you're reading up on your history for an hour, try switching to science for a bit. This will give the history information time to settle in.

, It's good to take a break from learning after a while. Information needs some time to settle into your brain. Spacing out your homework sessions will keep you from feeling overloaded.A three-hour session isn't as good as three one-hour sessions, spaced throughout a day. If you give yourself time to decompress, you'll have a far easier time of properly engaging with the material.


This is similar to taking breaks throughout your homework session. In this case however, you'll have enough time to go about the other things in your life.

, There are lots of ways you can turn homework into a bit of a game. If you wanted to, for example, you could make a Bingo sheet with the necessary tasks on it. Once you complete a task, you can blot out that task and give yourself a reward once you complete a row or column. There are also math and science sites online that have games specifically made for learning material.So long as the game you're playing doesn't overwhelm the learning itself, it can be a great way to keep yourself engaged with the stuff you're working on.


Inventing a game of your own based specifically around the work you're doing can be a fun activity of its own, and motivate you even more to finish the tasks at hand.

Make a to-do list to cross off over time.,
Promise yourself a reward if you study well.If you are having trouble staying motivated with your studying, you should make yourself a promise.,
Eat a snack while you work.,
Meditate when stressed.Stress can quickly pile up on you if you're doing homework.,
Take regular breaks.,
Save your big rewards for the end.",How to Make Homework Fun2," Even if a to-do list doesn't offer any real rewards of its own, there's a psychological satisfaction behind seeing each item crushed as you continue studying. For some, the satisfaction of crossing things out can be enough to keep you engaged with the material.

, If you have a certain mark you'd like to get on the exam, promise yourself you'll buy yourself a sizable treat if you reach it. This sort of promise can give you a more real incentive than a mere score on paper. Write the contract on paper and set it next to your homework for a lasting reminder.


For example, write something like: ""If I get at least 90% on my history final, I will buy a brand new video game from the store.""

, Snacks can be a great way to stay focused. Full meals may distract you from the homework, but something light and tasty (like Oreos) can keep your body centered while you focus. Popcorn is a good option, since it's light, not very filling, and won't make your hands dirty while you write. Apples and other fruits work well too, as do mints, jawbreakers, and other candies you can suck on while you study.


Keeping up to date with water will keep you in your best shape.

, While we want to make the most of the time spent studying, you won't get far if you're going through it feeling stressed out. If the work is getting to you at all, give yourself a few minutes to collect yourself. At the end of a few minutes of conscious meditation, you'll be refreshed and enjoy working more.


Meditation is a skill. It's not something that comes easily to people in a high-tech age. Even so, you should give it a legitimate chance. Let your thoughts go and focus on your breathing. Close your eyes. The more you practice meditation, the more you'll figure out what does, and doesn't work for you.
The benefits of meditation are well-documented. People who meditate report better attention and memory.These are obviously things you will want while you do homework.

, Five-minute breaks may be seen as a sort of reward. It's always nice to take a while for yourself when you're in the middle of a big study session. Telling yourself you'll give yourself time to stretch once you hit a certain page number or word count is a great way to keep your spirits high. What's more, your studying will improve if you give yourself the time to collect yourself once in a while.


While it will be different for everyone, giving yourself 5-10 minutes of break time per hour of homework is a good place to start. It may seem like a lot of downtime, but it will make sure you never get too overwhelmed with the tasks at hand.

, Rewards can do great things for someone's motivation. However, the motivation is gone if you skip right to them. Even if you think you're doing a great job on your homework so far, don't let the promise of something fun get in the way of your progress.Smaller rewards throughout the session can be helpful, but only as long as they don't hurt your flow.

Change up your environment.Sometimes, simply sitting in the same place for too long can wear you down.,
Study outside.,
Listen to music.,
Check out a library.Libraries may seem like boring places, but they're great for studying.",How to Make Homework Fun3," Changing rooms will refresh your energy. Studies have shown that changing your surroundings helps improve learning. If you're working in your bedroom, think about taking the work to your living room or kitchen. Better still, take it outside.


If you're living in a dorm, it's also fun to take your homework to a public learning space. A commons area is a good place to study, as are libraries.

, You would be surprised to know how much homework strain can be caused from simply being indoors for too long. Consider taking your homework outdoors. Provided the weather is decent, the time you spend working on school will pass by a lot faster. Going outside will reduce stress and improve your brainpower.So long as it's not raining, there's no good reason why you shouldn't give it a shot.


Vitamin D deficiency is a well-known cause of depression. During your exam weeks, you'll want every edge you can to feel good. Sunlight will give you an added boost if you're feeling down.

, Music is a tried-and-true way of making just about any situation better. Whether you're listening to something with headphones or speakers, your surroundings will be immediately uplifted. Because your homework might take a while, this ill give you a chance to really throw yourself into an album or playlist. Listening to music can improve your learning. It's recommended you experiment with a few different styles of music and see how they affect your work.

Instrumental music is preferable. Music with lyric can distract the language center of your brain, which gets in the way of your homework.

Some people simply won't be able to focus on their work while listening to music. If you're easily distracted, it's a good idea to steer clear of music for the time being.
Certain types of music, from neoclassical to dark ambient, are great for studying, because they can fit into the background without demanding anything of the listener.
During the test, if you think of the music you were listening to while you were studying, you might have a better chance at remembering the information you need., It's inspiring to be around other people who want to work, and the quiet atmosphere is suited for thinking. There are lots of resources at a library that can help you, including books and databases. Being at a library can make studying feel a bit more fun and exciting than staying stuck in your room all day.


Try to respect the other people in a library. Most people in a library are there for the peace and quiet.

Establish how often your child will be asked to do homework at the beginning of the school year.,
Create an incentive system.,
Create a chart with 4 to 6 columns and many rows.,
Add fun graphics or color to the chart, if the child is small.

,
Print out a batch of homework charts and store them in a binder.

,
Give the student a new homework chart at the beginning of each school week.,
Ask your child if they have questions about the assignments and all the needed materials before they begin their homework.

,
Check the homework chart after the student has completed their homework, to ensure that they are on track.,
Encourage your child to come to you with the homework chart once he or she has reached an incentive.,
Keep old homework charts in a 3-ring binder, so that you can reference them if need be.

",How to Make a Homework Chart," Most teachers tell their students or send home a letter to alert parents to the homework involved in this level of schooling.;
, For example, if 5 homework assignments are required in a week, you may want to allow extra play time, a family game or an hour of TV as an incentive.


The incentive should be chosen as something the child likes, but does not encourage bad behaviors.







, You can use a word processing program with a ""Table"" function, or a spreadsheet program.


The columns should include some or all of the following: subject, assignment, due date, materials needed, time the assignment will take and a space to mark when the homework is done.






The rows should be blank spaces for the child to fill in their homework chart. There should be enough rows for a week's worth of homework.






Leave enough space at the top to write the week's dates. Leave enough space on the side to use a 3-hole-punch.







,,, Ask them to fill it out as homework assignments are given throughout the day and week.

,,


Checking can be done as frequently as is needed to develop responsibility and trust between you and your child.







, Reward accordingly.

Trick your brain into enjoyment.,
Sit somewhere new.,
Take notes in a new format.,
Challenge yourself to follow the material more closely.",How to Make the School Year Go Faster1," Even when a class is just plain boring, you can literally convince your brain – at least to some degree – that you’re having fun. It sounds to good to be true, but try it. Simply think to yourself “Hey, I’m actually kind of into this stuff. I’m starting to really enjoy this class.”Believe it or not, the old adage that time flies when you’re having fun is actually supported by how your brain works.
Accordingly, tell yourself you’re having fun – even if you admittedly aren’t having a blast – to make if feel like time is passing more quickly.;
, As simple as it sounds, changing your visual perspective of the world will help make time pass more quickly because your mind will be occupied by all the new information. Even the same classroom will look entirely different from a new angle. Your brain will be monitoring new information without you even thinking about it, making time pass more quickly., An alternative method of taking notes is another way to provide your brain stimulation. This is also especially constructive, as you'll be thinking about how to organize the material that is being covered. Try keeping notes in bullet points, short paragraphs, or even with small, relevant drawings every so often, and stick with what you enjoy.When considering how to take notes differently, ask yourself ""How can I convey this information in a more interesting, but equally accurate way?""

, Challenging ourselves with specific tasks increases the energy and excitement with which we approach that task. It works even better when the challenge has a bit of drama built in. To heighten your own level of focus, imagine a quick scenario in which you must complete the trying task of complete concentration, or else…!For instance, pretend the teacher is a werewolf, but only morphs into a frothing-mouthed beast when she sees students eyes fully glaze over. There have been mysterious disappearances in her class every year. Can your class be the one that escapes unscathed, with full knowledge of the teacher’s lessons?
Challenge yourself to accomplish specific tasks. If you’re usually quiet, make a point of speaking up next class. If you usually finish your in-class work quickly, see if you can work through something with another student who hasn’t finished.

Write a list of all your homework.,
Get all your homework together and put it in a pile in the order you want to do it.,
Collect the supplies you'll need, such as a calculator, ruler, pencils, drawing paper, or anything else you know you'll need to complete all of your assignments.

,
Create a lore for your epic game of doing your homework.,
Sit back and continue the story in your mind.,
Once you have worked for an hour, give yourself a ten minute break.,
Continue in this way until you have finished your homework.",How to Make Homework a Game,"


A good way to organize your list is by subject and in the order your day proceeds. If your first subject is science, mark science as a category and write all your science homework under it. Then do the same for math (or whatever subject you have next), etc.;
,


Doing the hardest assignments first will make the rest seem easier, while saving them for last only makes them seem even harder when you finally get around to doing them.
Put what you want to do last at the top and what you want to do first at the bottom. It will give you motivation to finish the boring subjects first, and move on to the better, funner ones.
If you have too much homework to stack up in one pile, make two or even three piles, but make sure they don't crowd your workspace.

,,


For example: 'You are an agent of the CTU {(Counter Terrorist Unit) (like Jack Bauer in 24)}. _______ (imaginary name) is a threat to national security. He/she has obtained _______ (nuclear weapons, masses of nerve gas, tear gas, or another WMD- Weapon of mass destruction) and plans on using them in _______ (densely populated city). You must stop him by ______________ (insane scheme with no chance of working that will save the country from this awful villain).'
This is obviously only an example. There are an infinite number of possibilities. You could go back in time to the medieval times and fight an impossible war, struggle to become president/emperor/king in modern times or in history, stave off an alien attack, colonize Mars, be the first to stand on the surface of the Sun or another star, etc, etc, etc.

, When you get to the climax (giving the pep talk to your knights, in the final election, in the spaceship to the sun, etc) stop and dive into your homework. Work as quickly and accurately as possible.

, Fifteen even, if you've got the time to spare, but no longer than that. Do something active for a little while, like jumping jacks or jogging around the house, then settle in back to your work area and take the plot of your game a little farther.

, Reward yourself by finishing the story and giving your game-self riches and prestige. If you wish, next homework session, be it tomorrow or next week, you could continue with this story, giving your character a new challenge to overcome. Or you could start fresh, with a whole new series of untapped adventures waiting.

Get physical during breaks or recess.,
Use weekends wisely too.,
Get involved in school activities or clubs.,
Be social during the school day.",How to Make the School Year Go Faster2," In between classes or at recess, do something physical. Your breaks will be especially beneficial if you switch from your brain to your body at various points throughout the day. This will help get rid of the ants in your pants and rejuvenate your mind for consistent learning.Even if only for five minutes, find a corner where you can stretch or do a few yoga poses.
Get the heart pumping by doing 10 pushups and 20 jumping jacks.

, Treat your weekends as breaks from school. Though you may need to catch up on some homework, don’t let school responsibilities dominate your weekend – or the weeks will only continue to drag on and on. Plan something fun – and, if possible, physically active – every weekend.


Invite kids who you don’t usually hang out with to join in on group activities. You may wind up with a new friend, a new study buddy, or both!

, One way to ensure you’re always busy and socially engaged is by taking advantage of the extracurricular opportunities offered by your school. Join a sports team for an especially fun way to meet friends, stay healthy, and occupy your time constructively.


Another great option is joining the school band. The ability to play an instrument is likely one that you’ll enjoy the rest of your life, and there’s something especially fun about band people.

, At the very least, make a point of saying hello to other kids in the hallway. Another trick to having more fun and being more social at school is taking advantage of silly holidays or other chances to add some spice to the day.


If one of your classes is having a special event, or your school is holding some sort of soiree, dress the part.
Not only is dressing up more fun than you might think, it’ll firmly place you in the fun crowd at school.

Remind yourself of your responsibilities as a student.,
Listen to your teacher during class.,
Interact with your teachers more.,
Reflect about how to approach tough classes or unpleasant teachers differently.,
Interact with your classmates more too.,
Plan ahead.,
Take study breaks.",How to Make the School Year Go Faster3," As a student, your most important responsibility is learning the material your classes cover. Not only will taking your classes seriously help make the school year go by quicker, it’s important to remember why you’re in school in the first place.Reminding yourself of your responsibility to yourself as a student will help motivate you to show up to your classes ready and willing to learn.
If your mind starts to wander during class, think to yourself “right now my best course of action is to pay attention.”

, Listening fully will help you better comprehend the material and will likely increase your interest in class too. As you’re listening, take notes about the things you find interesting or don’t fully understand, and think about any questions you may have.If anything is unclear, raise your hand and ask about it. Know that other students will probably benefit from your question too.

, You don’t have to be the teacher’s pet in order to get along well with your teachers. If you’re bored in a particular class and can’t help thinking about stuff outside of class, talk to your teacher about it. Remember that your teacher was a student once too!Ask to speak with your teacher after class. Let them know how you’re feeling.
Say things like “I’m having a hard time getting into the course material and I’m wondering if you have any advice.”
Ask your teacher about what interests them about the subject they teach!

, Think about ways you can act differently during especially challenging or boring classes. The fact of the matter is that you’re not always going to enjoy every class or every teacher. But you can find something about every class and every teacher you can learn from. Take a moment to ask yourself, ""What can I learn from this class?""Find out if a teacher who may be a bit dry during lecture is more interesting to talk to one on one. They may even know a lot about something that interests you.

, If you’re struggling or simply not enjoying a certain class, talk to other students that seem to be doing well or are engaged with the material. You can even ask them for tips. For instance, ask how they approach ideas they don’t understand at first, or what they use to help them with homework for that particular class.Listen to your classmates’ questions too.
Even if you think you understand the lesson, your classmates’ comments may make you see it in a more interesting way.

, Set specific goals or deadlines for yourself, and decide on the specific steps you'll take to work towards each one. For instance, if you know you have a project due on Friday, start working on it the weekend before and think about ways you can improve it early in the week.Planning ahead helps you complete specific assignments and achieve more general goals too.
Avoid putting off homework or studying. This will add stress to your life and wind up leading to lower grades.
Try using a calendar or day planner to help you stay organized, and to keep your thoughts organized about what you have to do and when. Better organizing your time will help it go by quicker!

, The school day can drag on sometimes, in part because it’s a full day! Believe it or not, even adult brains can only focus for surprisingly short amounts of time. Whether between classes or between homework assignments, take a few minutes to do something fun – or even just to rest quietly.If you get up to walk around – which can be a great way to stretch your body and prepare for another focused school session – don’t allow yourself to get distracted by your phone or a TV, as these will make it harder to refocus on what you’re trying to learn.

Find out why you don’t enjoy school.,
Recognize school-related stress.,
Plan how you will address the aspects of school that you don’t enjoy.,
Get help enjoying school!,
Meet with a school counselor for anything at all.",How to Make the School Year Go Faster4," Sure, there’s homework, and the daily mini-traumas on interacting with other growing human beings. Still, you should be able to enjoy school most of the time. If you’re dreading school, or if it feels like torture all day, every day, there’s likely a reason you feel this way. The first step in addressing these sentiments is identifying where they’re coming from.Ask yourself whether there are certain people you don’t want to see – this may include other students who don’t treat you well, or a teacher that is impatient with you.
Consider whether you’re feeling stressed about school itself, including classes and schoolwork.

, If one subject is especially challenging for you, or it feels like you’re falling behind your classmates, you may start to become worried or stressed. In turn, it may become harder to concentrate. Further, your body may be negatively affected by stress, making it even more challenging to focus in school, let alone enjoy it.To begin to identify the specific things that are stressing you out, make a list of the things you don’t enjoy about school.
Include both social and academic things on this list of negatives.

, You’re capable of changing some of the situations that might make you dread school. Make a list of all the things you enjoy, to remind yourself that school isn't all bad. Then, revisit your list of negatives and plan how to improve your situation regarding each one.If a lot of the negatives have to do with a particular subject or class, make a plan to talk with the necessary teacher and share the fact that you’re struggling with the material.
If the negatives on your list tend to have more to do with people, recognize that you may need to get help addressing your ability to feel comfortable at school.

, When you’re busy growing up, school can be challenging. And when you’re busy with school, growing up can bring some challenges of its own too. Fortunately, there are people who care about you that will be happy to help.Talk to someone. Whether an older sibling, a parent, other relative, or a school counselor – they’ve all likely faced similar challenges in their own lives and lived through them.

, School counselors are specifically trained to help, and it’s their job to do so. Don’t ever hesitate to speak with a school counselor about anything at all – especially if you’re being treated poorly by other students of a particular teacher.If you’re unsure about meeting with a counselor because you don’t know how to convey what you’re feeling on a day-to-day basis, write your feelings out. This will help you organize your thoughts and identify what it is you might benefit from talking about.

Include plenty of brain-rich nutrients in your diet.",How to Make Yourself Smarter," Try brushing your teeth or eating your breakfast with your non-dominant hand. Routine behaviors are run by the brain’s sub-cortex, which control automatic functions of the body.If you make a point of mixing up your routines, your brain will be forced to be active and alert.
For any activity to help exercise your brain, it must be both novel and complex. The simple act of switching to a new hand for easy chores allows for both qualities in everyday activity.;
, Research suggests a strong correlation between learning to play a musical instrument and the development of executive function skills. Executive functioning is the brain’s ability to organize and act on perceived information, which is a critical component in the application of intelligence. Learning to play a musical instruments requires the coordination of multiple parts of the brain and body..The particular musical instrument you choose to learn doesn’t appear to make a difference in intelligence level.
Choose an instrument that you enjoy, and one to which you have easy access. Lessons are often a good way to find a local music community that will help support your new hobby.

, The best activities to improve your intelligence are those that require split-second, rapid decision making. Scientists have found that people who take social dance classes improve their intelligence no matter what age they are.Frequent dancing was the only physical activity that seemed to offer any protection against the development of dementia in people aged 75 and older.
Doing activities which use rote memory, no matter how complex, do not require the development of new neural pathways, which improve intelligence.

, Research has suggested that dual n-back exercises increase fluid intelligence. Fluid intelligence is one of the most important factors in IQ. It refers to the brain’s ability to reason and problem solve without relying on previously learned information.N-back is a memory test. N refers to a certain number of previous stimuli that must be recalled by the player. For example, in a 1 = n sequence, you have to recall a stimuli 1 item back; with a 2 = n sequence, the stimuli must be recalled 2 items back.
In dual n-back exercises, two independent sequences are presented simultaneously, and usually using two different modalities. For example, a sequence of numbers would be read, while a colored sequence was also present.
You can find open-source software for dual n-back software online at brainworkshop.net.

, Being able to consolidate a narrative into only 7 words will help keep your brain alert and active. This activity relies on the brain’s ability to sift through a wide range of knowledge, and distill in in a particular way.Generating both the narrative and the words used relies on multiple functions of the brain, including fluid intelligence and executive functioning.
These word-limit constraints will also give you practice in writing clever social media updates!

, Acronyms provide a word to help you remember a larger set of information. They help your brain encode and recall the information. Acronyms are a shorthand way to remind yourself of complex information through a simple image or word.One of the most common single-word acronyms people use is ASAP, which stands for as soon as possible, or NASA, which stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Many times acronyms become so well known that the meaning of the acronym becomes a new word itself, such as with SNAFU or Taser.

, An acronym is the shortest form of mnemonic device, but you can also make a sentence that helps you to remember a stream of words or information. Developing your own mnemonic devices that are specific to your interests and knowledge will be the most effective way of using this memory aid.For example, a simple sentence that helps children remember the order of the 4 directions on the compass might be: Never Eat Soggy Worms.
You can see how the first letters of these words (N, E, S, W) align with the first letters of the 4 directions (North, East, South, West) in an easier-to-remember fashion.

, For people with strengths in visual and spatial memory, the imagined construction of a location (such as a house or “palace”) with mnemonic devices throughout can help to develop a strong memory of even detailed events or information. You can start by using your own home as a tool to memorize something commonplace, such as a shopping list.In your imagination, place the items you’ll need at the store in a variety places throughout the house. For example, consciously imagine placing a bunch of bananas on the coffee table, a loaf of bread on the chair nearby, and a bag of coffee on top of the television. Then, at the store, visualize walking through your created image of your home with these items in it.
Try adding items, adding rooms, as your ability to remember increases.
You can also try this process by placing your mental attention along a familiar walking route, fixing items along landmarks of your walk.

, Mind mapping is a visual tool to write down details of a larger project. Mind mapping can help at the start of a project to generate ideas, or to increase comprehension of learned information. The way it’s sometimes represented is as a trunk of a tree (the main idea) as seen from above, with branches (details) coming from all directions.Start by writing the central idea in the center of a blank, unlined sheet of paper. You can also draw an image if this helps you better focus on your project.
Next, draw a line from the central idea to represent each one of the main topics within this idea. Label these topics with your pencil.
From these lines, draw smaller lines, or branches, representing even more detailed ideas.
Use colored pencils if this helps engage your attention and comprehension. Continue to illustrate with pictures if you prefer.

, Regular aerobic exercise has been connected to the growth of new neurons. Exercise stimulates the hippocampus, which is associated with both learning and memory.Most experts recommend that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. This means at least 30 minutes, 5 times per week.
Moderate aerobic exercise includes jogging, walking, biking, dance classes, swimming, or any activity which requires regular heavy breathing over a period of time.
Make sure to check with your healthcare provider before adding physical activity to your daily routine.

, When you don’t get enough sleep, your mind becomes functionally impaired as if you were under the influence of alcohol intoxication.Needless to say, this doesn’t do wonders for your cognitive performance. One of the simplest paths to making yourself smarter is simply to ensure that you get enough sleep at night.Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night.
Teens require 8-10 hours of sleep per night, while school-aged children (ages 6-13) require 9-11 hours.

, According to studies done by UCLA, the brains of people who engaged in regular meditation practice were both larger and contained more gray matter than the brains of people who did not have such a practice. Not only does meditation appear to prevent a person’s brain from losing key neural connections, but the brain size actually increases in a few critical areas.Evidence suggests that meditation can make a person smarter, and more resilient.
People who meditate are better able to handle stress, and this helps to block the development of the hormone cortisol, which impedes brain function.

, Omega-3 essential fatty acids are vital to healthy brain functions, while higher levels of vitamin E are correlated with slower cognitive decline in the aging brain.Include plenty of omega-3 essential fatty acids by including deep-water fish, such as salmon. Fish oil supplements might also be tried, at the level recommended by the American Health Association (1 gram daily of EPA and DHA).
Blueberries, high in antioxidants, help protect the brain from oxidative stress and may also help guard against age-related dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Try adding an 8-ounce cup of blueberries to your daily diet to improve your brain functioning.Nuts and seeds are a good source of vitamin E. Consider adding a handful of walnuts, hazelnuts, Brazil nuts, filberts, almonds, cashews, peanuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, or a tablespoon of unhydrogenated nut butters such as peanut butter, almond butter, and tahini to your daily diet.

Decide what sections to include in your planner.,

Write your assignments into your planner.",How to Make a Homework Planner1," Staying organized usually requires more than one type of planning list, such as a monthly calendar, a weekly calendar, and a daily to-do list., One of the benefits of crafting your planner is that you can use any type of paper. Use what you have on hand, print planning templates, or make a trip to the craft store to choose prints that inspire you.


Notebook paper offers a quick solution because you probably already have some in your backpack.
Blank computer paper allows you an unstructured space to plan, which may work really well for people who are creative.
Using templates makes it easier to get started and stay organized. Since you’ll be printing your own templates, you can choose what best suits your needs. Templates may take more work than notebook paper, but they will make it easier to get started with your planning since the calendar and planning spaces are already created for you.
Try printed papers for a fun approach to creating your planner. Visit your local craft store for tons of design options. If you use printed paper, keep in mind how you will be using the planner when you pick your designs. For example, don’t choose all dark colors if you want to write directly onto the paper because you won’t be able to see what you wrote.

, You can organize your paper to match how you will use it, which could be by type of planning sheet or by month.


Organizing into monthly, weekly, and daily sections will allow you to keep similar planning sheets together. This is a standard format for many planners and will allow you to keep weeks together when the month changes midweek. It also allows you to be flexible with how you use your to-do list sheets.
If you want to organize by month, take one monthly calendar and pair it with five weekly planning sheets and enough to-do list sheets to accommodate your planning needs.

, Once you’ve organized your paper, it’s time to put it into sections as it will appear in your final product.


You can mark your sections by placing a sheet of colored paper between them.
Another option is to mark the sections with tape. Take a strip of tape and fold it over on itself so that just the edges of the tape touch the paper between two sections, leaving the fold of the tape sticking out of the stack.

, When you craft your own planner, you get to be creative with the cover.


If you like to work on the computer, design your cover using your favorite app and then print it out.
If you want to skip decorating your cover or want something that looks store-bought, use a piece of scrapbook paper from the craft store as your cover. For example, you could buy a piece of zebra print paper and print your planner title on the front.
If you’re an artist, draw or paint your cover.
If you don’t like to draw or craft, you could try decorating your planner with stickers that represent something you love, such as your hobby or favorite bands.

, Common section names will include monthly calendars, weekly planners, and to-do lists.

, Now that sections are clearly marked, it’s time to bind your paper. The simplest option is to staple the paper together.


For a cleaner look, cut a two-inch wide slip of paper and fold it so that it will fit over your staples. Glue the paper in place to make your homemade planner look like a composition book.
You can also make a notebook using a hole punch and ribbon.

, Using your course syllabi or assignment sheets, copy all of your assignments into your new planner.


Use the different colored inks for each class for best results.Enter assignments for the whole grading period at once, which will prevent you from overlooking due dates.
Divide your larger assignments over several days so that you have time to complete the assignment. For example, if you have a science project due at the end of the month, you need to start working on it in advance. Write your project work days onto your calendar as well."

Make your weekly planning sheets.,
Insert your assignments.",How to Make a Homework Planner2," Get started by finding the perfect notebook for you, such as a composition book, spiral, or journal. While you can choose a nice print, decorating your homework planner is a great way to express yourself.

, Designing your cover gives you a chance to be creative, even if you don’t consider yourself an artist. You may decide to use ink or paint directly on the cover of your notebook, or you may find it more fun to glue on your decorations.


If you’re artistic, take this as an opportunity to express your talent by sketching or painting your planner cover. Another option is to create a collage using clippings of photos, words, and phrases from a magazine. Simply glue the clippings to the cover of your notebook in your desired arrangement. To protect your work, self-laminate it with clear packing tape.
If you enjoy crafting, you could glue fabric, paper, or magazine photos to your notebook.
If you don’t like to draw or craft, you could try decorating your planner with stickers or photos. For example, you could cover your notebook with stickers representing your favorite bands, or you could print out your favorite photos of your friends to glue on the cover.

, Before you can use your newly decorated notebook as a homework planner, you need to create sections for your planning. Common sections will include monthly calendars, weekly planners, and to-do lists.


Count out the number of sheets for each section. Because it’s your planner, how many sheets of paper you will need per section will depend on you. However, for a standard year-long planner, you would need at least 14 sheets of paper for monthly planning and 54 sheets of paper for weekly planning. Including extra sheets in each section will allow for section labels, do-overs, and section buffers.
Create your section dividers by either using tape or cutting the edges of the paper. To make your dividers using tape, fold a piece of tape over on itself so that just the ends touch the paper. Leave a flap of tape sticking out from the paper so that you can easily see the divide between sections. You can also divide your planner by cutting the corners of two of your sections. For example, you could cut the top outer corner of the monthly calendars and cut the bottom outer corner of the weekly planning sheets, leaving your third section un-cut. This would allow you to easily find each of those three sections.

, On the first page of each of your sections, create a label. You can write, draw, or use stickers. As an alternative, you could print out what you want your label to say, trim the excess paper, and glue it onto the title page.

, Drawing or pasting in a calendar will allow you to better plan your assignments because you can see a month at a glance. You can also more easily plan out time to work on big assignments.


To draw your calendar, you will need a ruler or a straight surface to trace. Using your ruler, draw a large box.
Lengthwise, trace six evenly-spaced lines to create seven columns for the seven days of the week.
Then draw four evenly-spaced lines down the width of the box to create the rows of weeks. When you are finished, you will have 35 boxes.
Write the days of the week above each column.
Write the name of the month and the correct dates for the first month of your homework planner.

, Much of your actual planning will happen in your weekly section, so it’s important to create those planning sheets. Fortunately, it’s very easy to organize your weekly plans by dividing your sheets into eight even boxes so that you will have seven for the days of the week and one extra box for notes.


Draw a line down the center of your paper, and then draw three evenly-spaced lines across your paper to create eight boxes.
Label seven of the boxes with the days of the week, and label the eighth box “Notes.”

, You’re now ready to use your homework planner! Use your syllabi or assignment sheets to fill in your assignments.

Choose your binder.,
Decide how you want to plan.,
Print your planning sheets.,
Insert your dividers and planning sheets.,
Enter your assignments.",How to Make a Homework Planner3," When you pick a binder, remember to consider size. You could save space with a .5-inch binder, but you may find that you require more planning space, so using a 1- or 2-inch binder may be ideal. You can recycle an old binder or purchase a new one.


To avoid adding bulk to your backpack, print out calendars and weekly planning templates and put them in your regular binder. That way you can easily track your assignments without worrying about juggling an extra notebook.

, Most planners include sections for monthly calendars, weekly planning sheets, and to-do lists. Since you’re using a binder, it will be easy to add new sections later if you decide you need additional planning materials.

, Using either a template or your own design, print out the sheets you will need for each section. This will include blank calendars, blank weekly planning sheets, and your favorite to-do list organizer. You may choose to use regular notebook paper for your to-do lists.

, As you put in your planning sheets, you will want to separate them with standard index dividers for binders so that you can easily flip between sections. Using index dividers will also allow you to label each section for easy organization.


Open the rings on your binder and first insert your to-do list paper. Place an index divider on top of the stack.
Add your monthly planning sheets, followed by the index divider for that section.
Finally, add your calendars, and, if you like, an index divider for that section.

, Your homework planner is ready to use! Use your syllabi or assignment sheets to schedule your assignments on your planning pages.

Make a fun conclusion.",How to Make a Webquest," You can choose from a number of formats (website, Power Point, Google Doc, Word Doc, printed worksheet, etc) but you should generally always have a title page. This sets the tone for the assignment and makes it look more professional. The Title page just shows the title of the quest and your name. Give it an interesting title!, The introduction will...you guessed it: introduce the student to the assignment. Usually it introduces the concepts dealt with in the assignment. Many times a WebQuest will have a bit of a story that goes with it, and the introduction can serve to tell the story and give a summarized, basic description of what the student is supposed to learn., The Task page clearly states what the student needs to learn by the end of the assignment. Remember: the goal of the question, this learning journey, is the knowledge they come out with at the end. Use this knowledge goal to create the ""story"" of the quest your students will be sent on.


The official Webquest site lists a variety of Task types which each serve a different education purpose. Some of the types include Journalistic, Mystery, Persuasion, Analytic, and Compilation.

, The Process page clearly outlines what the student needs to do and in what order the tasks need to be done. Be as clear as you can: the idea is that the student can do the assignment perfectly without you needing to give them any more explanation.

, The Resources page gives the students a direct map to all of the sources of information they can use. This means you'll need to identify sources for the information you want them to learn. Get good at using a search engine and learn how to use keywords and boolean properties to find the information you want.

, The Evaluation page contains a rubric, so the students know exactly what you're looking for from them and what they need to do to get a good grade.

, The conclusion page wraps up the assignment, goes over the sorts of things that your students should have learned, and encourages them to learn more. You may wish to include more sources for them to do some extra learning and research if they're interested or finish early.

, The old school method of making Webquests was a Word document with hyperlinks or a basic html webpage. If you don't want to go through the pain and heartbreak of making your own website, there are templates or you can use other mediums to present the same information. A Google Doc or Spreadsheet can give your students what they need without putting so much of a burden on you.

, The task itself should be interesting. Get creative! The word ""quest"" is in the title for a reason. Give the task a sense of mystery and your students a sense of purpose.

, First, give a primer on citations, evidence, logic, bias, and things like peer review, so that they can learn to evaluate resources. Then, let your students know that one resource that you give them is a dud and contains bad information. Choose a dud website that looks as convincing as possible. This will let them practice those skills.

, You want to set a good example for your students, by showing them quality websites and teaching them how to evaluate information on the web. Look for age appropriate material but also look for reputable sources, citations, and current information.

, You don't want to just spoon-feed your students the information that they need. You also don't want to give them just one side of the issue. Let them see lots of different information and teach them how to evaluate and decide what's right and wrong.

, By putting students into teams, they'll not only learn how to work with others to complete tasks, but they can also cause each other to think more and discuss the validity of information they find on the web.

, While websites are the main point with WebQuests, don't feel limited to this kind of resource. Add is other materials like handouts, books, magazines, or even peer-reviewed journals if your students are in high school.

, Inquire with experts from local universities and see if they'd be willing to email responses to set questions from students. They will usually be happy to write up a standard response that can quickly be sent in response to basic questions and your students will earn the confidence to contact experts who can advise them.

, When you write the rubric or evaluation page, make sure that it is completely clear. You want your students to be able to do well, not suffer because the instructions were ambiguous or unclear.

, Conclusions can be kind of boring...but you can snazz them up with additions like extra YouTube videos that cover the topic in a fun way. This is a great way to reward your students for finishing early or being curious enough to do more learning on their own.

Make a list of your responsibilities.,
Collect all class/assignment information.,
Consider optimal times of day for studying.,
Decide on a format.,
Draw the grid.,
Choose a single or custom timetable.,
Block your study times.,
Schedule time for breaks.,
Be as specific as possible.,
Schedule multiple subjects during each session.,
Make your timetable look nice.,
Keep to it.,
Don’t stress about it.,
Revise it.",How to Make a Study Timetable," You need to think about and write down all of your responsibilities so that they can properly be factored into the list. By thinking about all of this in advance, before filling in your timetable, you’ll make the actual creation of your timetable go more smoothly. You should consider all of your classes, your job, your chores, sports and exercise, and anything else you do on a regular basis during the times you might be studying.
Don’t forget people’s birthdays and major holidays.
You’re probably not going to think of everything up front, but that’s okay—you can add it in later.;
, This will probably mean getting all of your syllabus together and any assignment sheets for papers or projects, and maybe looking online if there’s a place for your classes there (like Blackboard or another course management system)., Spend some time thinking about when you do—or would do—your best studying. Are you morning person or a night person? Thinking about this now will help you do your best to schedule important study time during your peak study hours. When completing this step, try not to think about your other responsibilities (like your job, etc.); just note your best times as if you had nothing else on your plate.

, You can make your timetable on a piece of paper or in digital format, such as a spreadsheet or an app on your phone.


Spreadsheet programs, like Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers, offer obvious solutions. Also, many word processing programs have templates for what you’re trying to achieve.You might choose an online solution. One well-reviewed program that has an app and web interface is My Study Life.
Even if you are online or on your phone frequently, a physical paper timetable might still be best for you. This could be the case if you’re not allowed to be on devices while in class.
Both paper and digital study timetables have their advantages. A digital timetable might be easier to setup and make big revisions to, while you can make a lot of little changes to a print timetable that you keep with you. A print version might also be easier (or at least more fun) to color and personalize.
You may also choose to combine paper and digital: use your computer to print out a grid that you’ve already added days and times to, then print out as many as you like (depending on the number of weeks you’re planning for) and fill it in by hand.

, Any timetable should be a chart consisting of the variables “date” and “time,” with days of the week along the top and times down the side.


If you’re making a timetable by hand on paper, you’ll need to create the grid yourself. You can use regular notebook paper or blank paper. Draw your lines with a ruler for a clean look.
The biggest downside to the paper-and-pencil method is probably how hard it is to make changes later. Even if you use pencil for everything, it could be a real challenge to adjust the number of rows or columns. Also, if you need multiple pages, like one for each month, you would have to do all of this every time.

, You can make a single timetable that will stay the same each week. Or, you can build a custom one for each week, that changes depending on the specifics of that week. You would build all of your custom timetables at the same time.


For a custom weekly timetable, start in reverse. Start with big assignments or final exams and work backwards. Your study schedule will need to change depending on what big assignments are coming up.Don’t forget to fill in everything you brainstormed earlier in the process. You should do this before you put in study times. This includes all regular commitments like a sport practice. You need to do this first so you know where you can put your study times.
If you’re making a custom weekly timetable, don’t forget to include exceptions like birthdays and holidays.

, Aim for blocks of study time that are fairly long, such as 2–4 hours at a time. This will help you get into the groove of studying and help you to be more productive with your time.Just because you don’t have a large chunk of time doesn’t mean you can’t schedule a study period, however. If you feel it will be beneficial to schedule in 45 minutes here or an hour there, by all means, do so.
You’re going to want to schedule more time for more difficult classes., Break are essential to your success. You’re not a robot, so you can’t work non-stop for hours on end. You’ll do better overall if you give yourself regular breaks from the work.Many experts recommend that you work for 45 minutes every hour, and then break for 15 minutes. Everyone is different, though, so experiment to find what works best for you., Remember how you gathered all your of assignments and syllabi? Now is the time to put them to use. You can schedule blocks of time for particular classes and also write in assignments and give yourself chunks of time to work on those.


Things will change over time, of course, and something you planned for two months ago may not apply anymore. But don’t let that stop you. Look at this as a helpful guide, something to keep you on track and something that will help you break large assignments into small pieces.
If you always have a certain amount of homework for a class every week, that would be great to add to your timetable. For example, if you always have 20 math problems to do each week, you can break this up in your timetable.

, Working on different subjects during a single session will keep you from getting completely burned out by one subject and having no energy to do anything else.Of course, this can change come exam time when you need to devote all your energy to a single subject!

, Color coding classes and responsibilities will help make your timetable easier to use and easier on the eyes. You might be looking at this timetable a lot—make it your own!


You might want to use colored pencils if it’s on paper. Or you could highlight things on the computer and print in color. If you’re using an online-only app, the timetable will already be color-coded, though you may be able to customize it to some extent.

, It might take some time for you to really get used to using your timetable but keep at it. Once it’s a part of your routine, it’s going to be a big help

, Don’t feel like you have to follow the timetable down to the exact minute. It’s a little system to help you do better in school. Base your time on it, but don’t get stressed about not following it perfectly.

, See what works and what doesn’t, and if something isn’t working, fix it! You already put effort into making the timetable—there’s no reason to scrap it when a few simple revisions could make it work well for you. Always stick to your timetable.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Identify the North pole of the magnet.,
Rub the North pole from the middle of the metal to the end.,
Test the magnetism.,
Continue rubbing the magnet against object to increase the magnetism.",How to Magnetize Metal1," To magnetize metal with this method, you just need a strong magnet and a piece of metal with known iron content. Metals without iron will not become magnetic.


A strong magnet, such as neodymium, can easily be purchased online.;
, Every magnet has two poles, a North and a South pole. The North pole is the negative side, while the South pole is the positive side. Some magnets have the poles labeled directly on them.If your magnet is not labeled you can use a pole identifier magnet. This is a magnet that has the poles labeled on it. Place the identifier near your magnet and see which side attaches. Opposite sides attract, so if the magnet attaches to the South pole of the identifier magnet, that side is the North pole.

, With firm pressure, quickly run the magnet across the piece of metal. The act of rubbing the magnet across the metal helps the iron atoms align in one direction. Repeatedly stroking the metal gives the atoms more opportunity to line up.Repeat the stroke towards the negative pole at least ten times. Ten strokes is just a good number to start with. You can do more or less as long as the metal works to your satisfaction as a magnet.

, Tap the metal against a pile of paperclips or try to stick it to your fridge. If the paperclips stick or it stays on the fridge, the metal has been sufficiently magnetized. If the metal does not become magnetized, keep rubbing the magnet in the same direction across the metal.


If you are magnetizing a screwdriver, put it next to a screw to see if it holds it.

, Make sure you rub the magnet in the same direction every time. After ten strokes, check the magnetism again. Repeat until the magnet is strong enough to pick up the paperclips. If you rub in the opposite direction with the North pole this will actually demagnetize the metal.If the metal still does not maintain magnetization, it might not have a high enough iron content. Try this method again with a metal that has a higher iron content.

"
"
Gather the necessary materials.,
Identify north with the compass.,
Position the piece of metal facing north.Place the piece of metal on a table and orient it so that it is pointing in the same direction as the needle of the compass (north).,
Hit the end of the metal with the hammer.,
Test the magnetism of the metal.",How to Magnetize Metal2," To magnetize a metal using a hammer, you will need a compass, a hammer, and a piece of metal with some iron. These items can easily be purchased at a local hardware store.


A metal alloy that doesn’t have iron in it is less likely to be magnetic. Pure gold, silver, copper, etc. cannot be magnetized with this method.

, A compass works because of the magnetic poles of the Earth. There is a small magnetized needle in the compass that always faces north due to the poles. Place your compass flat on the table and let the needle swing until it stops moving. The direction the needle points towards is north., The piece of metal needs to be facing north so that the iron atoms will align along the magnetic pole of the Earth.Secure the piece of metal to the tabletop using tape or a clamp such as a vice.

, With the metal securely in place, strike the bottom end (end facing south) of the piece with the hammer.Striking the metal allows the iron atoms to move around and align themselves in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field.


Hit the end multiple times to increase the magnetism of the metal.

, Place the piece of metal on top of some paperclips and see if they stick. If the paperclips stick, the metal has been magnetized. If the paperclips don’t stick, try striking the end of the metal a few more times.


If you find this method doesn’t work, the amount of iron in the piece of metal might be too small. Try it with another piece of metal that you know has more iron in it.

"
"
Gather the necessary materials.,
Wrap the insulated wire around the piece of metal.,
Strip the ends of the copper wire.,
Connect the wires to the battery.,
Test the magnetism.",How to Magnetize Metal3," To make an electromagnet, you will need insulated copper wire, a piece of metal with known iron content, a 12-volt battery (or other DC power supply), wire strippers/cutters, and electrical tape.The insulated copper wire needs to be thin enough to easily wrap around the metal and long enough to wrap a few dozen times.
Make sure the metal has no magnetization before beginning.
Using an AC power source will also work, but is not recommended because it is high voltage and there is potential for an electric shock., Take the wire and leaving a tail of about an inch, tightly wrap the wire around the metal a few dozen times.The more times you wrap the coil, the stronger the magnet will be. Leave a tail at the other end of the wire as well.


At this point, you should have two wires dangling off either end of the metal, with the wire coiled tightly around it.

, Using the wire strippers, strip off at least ¼ inch up to ½ inch from both ends of the wire. The copper needs to be exposed so that it can come into contact with the power source and provide electricity to the system.


Take care not to cut through the wire when stripping it.

, Take one bare end of wire and wrap it around the negative terminal of the battery. Using electrical tape, secure it in place and make sure the metal of the wire is touching the wire of the terminal. With the other wire, wrap and secure it around the positive terminal of the battery.It doesn’t matter which wire is connected to which terminal as long as both are securely attached to separate ones.

, When the battery is properly connected it will provide an electrical current that causes the iron atoms to aligned creating magnetic poles.This leads to the metal becoming magnetized. Tap the metal against some paperclips and see if it can pick them up.


Some metals will remain magnetized when the battery is removed, while others, such as “soft iron” require the electric current for the magnetization.

Open Excel.,
Enter your categories and the data for each category.,
Select the data in the worksheet.,
Open the pie chart option under the Insert tab.,
Customize the design of your pie chart.,
Confirm the pie chart data is correct.",How to Make a Pie or Circle Graph1," One of the easiest ways to create a pie chart is to use a program like Excel, which has a pie chart builder option. You should open a new worksheet in Excel and then enter in the data you would like to put into the pie chart., Start by typing in the categories that you want to compare in the pie chart in the first row of the worksheet.For example, you may be comparing the number of men, women, and children who lived in your town during 2012. So you would type in the following three categories in the first row of the worksheet: Men, Women, Children. Enter the year that applies to the data in the first box, cell A1. In this example, you would enter the year 2012.
Enter in the applicable data for each category. For example, under Men, you may type in 2,200. Under women, you may type, 2,100. Continue to do this under you have put all of your data into the worksheet.

, Use your mouse to select all the data in the worksheet. The filled in rows should be highlighted blue.

, There should be a pie icon that appears on the right of the toolbar, with a graphic in the shape of a pie chart. Click on the drop down arrow and choose the type of pie chart you would like to build.There will be a 2D option and a 3D option. You can decide if you’d like your pie chart to appear two dimensional or three dimensional.

, You can also choose the design of the pie chart by going to the Design tab and selecting the chart layout you would like to use. You can decide which colors appear on your pie chart, as well as the overall the appearance of the pie chart., Once the pie chart has been created in Excel, you should look over the pie chart to confirm all the data has been entered into the pie chart correctly.


You can also highlight a certain section of the pie by clicking on it with your mouse. The slice should move slightly up and away from the rest of the pie chart."

Enter your data into a table.,
Convert the data into percentages.,
Determine the sectors of the pie chart.,
Use a protractor to draw a circle.,
Divide each section of the pie chart.,
Title the pie chart.",How to Make a Pie or Circle Graph2," Start by organizing your data so it is divided into categories, with the applicable data noted for each category. You can do this by drawing out a simple table and entering in data by hand.For example, maybe you took a survey of your friends to find out which animals are the most popular pets in your friend group. You may have the following four categories in your table: Rabbits, Cats, Dogs, Birds. Then, you may enter the following data underneath each category: Rabbits, 4, Cats, 6, Dogs, 8, Birds, 2.
Add up the values to get a total number of participants. In this case, it is 4+6+8+2 = 20.

, The percentages are essential to creating the pie chart, as this will help you determine how big of a slice each category is going to take in the pie. To determine the percentages, you will need to divide each value by the total amount of participants and then multiply this value by 100.For example, if 4 people say they like rabbits, then you would divide 4 by 20 to get 0.2. Then, multiply 0.2 by 100 to get 20. This means 20% of the participants said they prefer rabbits as pets. You can do this with the rest of the values. For cats, divide 6 by 20 and multiply by 100 to get 30%, for dogs, divide 8 by 20 and multiply by 100 to get 40%, and for birds, divide 2 by 20 and multiply by 100 to get 20%.

, A pie, or a circle, has 360 degrees. So you will need to take the values for each category and multiply them by 360 to determine how they fit into the full circle, or pie chart. This will give you the sectors of the pie chart.For example, to convert the values on rabbits, you would divide 4 by 20 to get 0.2 and then multiply 0.2 by 360 to get 72 degrees. For cats, you would divide 6 by 20 to get 0.3 and then multiply 0.3 by 360 to get 108 degrees.

, Place the protractor in the middle of a clean, white sheet of paper. Draw a perfect, round circle with a pen or pencil.

, Use the protractor to measure the degrees of each sector. Mark each sector with a pen or pencil as you measure out each sector until the entire circle contains all the values.You should label each section with the appropriate category and color each section a different color with colored pencils or a marker. You should also include the percentage associated with the category. For example, the category on rabbits should take up 72 degrees of the circle, be labeled “Rabbits” and have the percentage 20% written down in that category.
You may include a legend under the pie chart with the applicable colors and categories if you would prefer not to label the sectors right on the pie chart itself.

, Once you finish labeling and coloring each sector of the pie chart, you should add the overall title of the pie chart at the top of the chart.For example, you may title your chart about favorite pets as “Favorite Pets According to My Friends”.

"
"
Use a pie chart to compare parts to a whole.,
Put nominal data or ordinal data in a pie chart.,
Make data easy to read and present by putting it in a pie chart.",How to Make a Pie or Circle Graph3," A pie chart is useful for dividing data into distinct categories, or looking at the parts of a larger whole. You can use a pie chart to compare as small as two categories and as large as seven categories.You should also use a circle graph if there is a significant amount of difference in your data. For example, 10 people who prefer rabbits and only 2 people who prefer dogs.
If you are trying to show changes or shifts in a category over a long period of time, for example, year to year, you will need to create multiple pie charts, one for each year.

, Nominal data is data that can be categorized by descriptive or qualitative information. It is data that can be named, or made nominal. For example, a country of birth or a type of pet would be nominal data.Ordinal data is data that is set in a specific order. It can also be named and easily categorized but it is ranked, from lowest to highest, or from biggest to smallest, etc. For example, the hottest time of the year or the most popular movie genre would be ordinal data.

, Pie charts are often used as tools in presentations or talks, especially for a large crowd. Pie charts are great visual tools and can allow you to present data in a way that is easy to understand and comprehend. Often, pie charts are used to demonstrate distinctions between groups or preferences between different individuals.

Approach studying in a positive manner.,
Create and stick to a good study schedule.,
Pick a good place to study.,
Be organized.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Learn Without Forgetting1," If you crack open the books while in a bad mood about having to study, you won’t have an effective study session. However, if you are excited about what you are about to learn, you will have an easier time learning it and remembering it come test time.Don’t tell yourself, “I’m never going to learn this.”
Be patient with yourself as you try to master new material.;
, Take the time to think about when you are most alert and able to concentrate. For some, this may be immediately after school. Others may be more productive if they take a break after school and relax a bit before opening the books. Regardless of when you choose to study, you will retain more information if you study a bit each day (for 30 to 60 minutes at a time) rather than cramming at the last minute.Remember to incorporate breaks into your study schedule. Breaks give your brain a chance to absorb what you just studied.
During your break, it is helpful to take a short walk or get some fresh air to help clear your mind., You need to find a quiet space free of distractions, such as a library or an isolated area of your house. By having an area devoted to studying, your brain will become used to calming down and absorbing material once you get there.


Once you pick a spot to study, bring everything you may need there. You don’t want to get distracted searching for a missing book or paper once you’ve settled in to study.
If you need a computer for your research or studies, you can utilize an app to block specific websites for a certain period of time. That way, you won’t be tempted to check social media accounts or newsfeeds when you should be studying instead.

, Disorganized notes or a messy study room can be enemies to your memory. By creating order in your environment, you foster order in your mind, so you can better memorize facts and recall them later., When you sleep, your brain converts facts from short-term memory to long-term memory. Even a short nap can help with this process.If you study in the afternoon and don’t have time for a nap then, review your notes or flashcards at night before going to bed.
Aim to get 9 hours of sleep each night, the optimal level for adolescents. The recommended sleep range for adults is between 7 and 9 hours."
"
Read your materials out loud.,
Discuss what you are learning or teach someone else.,
Write out what you have to memorize.,
Take a practice test.",How to Learn Without Forgetting2," Using multiple senses can help you retain more information, so even just saying the words out loud and then hearing them can be helpful. Don’t worry about looking foolish reading your biology notes to your dog. You’ll be happy if it helps you ace your next exam., Similar to reading your notes out loud, talking about what you are learning can also help you retain the information better. You can either study with a friend and quiz each other, or you can try to teach the material to a parent or younger sibling.


Using your brain to figure out a way to teach the material to someone else causes you to think about the material more in-depth and analytically.
You will be able to figure out which materials you need to further study if you have a difficult time teaching the concept to someone else.

, Putting pen to paper and either taking notes on what you’ve read or simply re-writing over and over a formula or concept you’re trying to master can really help.


It can also be helpful to write out an outline of the materials you are trying to learn. Just the process of organizing the materials in a visual manner can help your brain recall the information in an organized manner.
You can also write out flashcards with important facts, dates, or formulas on them. This is doubly helpful, since the act of writing will help you remember, and the flashcards are a portable tool you can review while riding on a bus or waiting for an appointment.
If you’re reading, summarize each paragraph in the margins. You are in effect teaching it to yourself when you summarize and analyze it., If you can locate a practice exam or one used in the past, this can be a good tool for figuring out what you have mastered and which topics you still need to study.


Once you finish the practice test, research the material you did not know and try another test again in a few days.
Remember not to limit your studies to only those items found on the practice exam. Odds are, your test will include all of the information you’ve been assigned to study, not just questions you found on a previous or practice test.

Master mnemonic devices.,
Create rhymes for what you are trying to remember.,
Develop a mind map.,
Chew gum while studying.,
Use your sense of smell.",How to Learn Without Forgetting3," These are memory tools that help you recall things such as names, dates, and facts through turning that information into a memorable rhyme, word, or sentence. For instance, you can remember the names of the Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior) by remembering the word HOMES. The first letter of the name of each lake is used to create that new word.Another example of a common mnemonic is the name “Roy G. Biv,” which correlates with the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.Be creative. Use the first letter of a group of words you’re trying to remember and make a silly sentence or phrase with words that start with the same letters.

, Rhymes are a type of mnemonic device that use audio (sound) information to help remember things. In other words, the rhymes are easily linked together for us by their sound. Think about this classic rhyme: “In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.” Try to organize the information or list of words you’re trying to remember into a rhyme.

, Mind maps are diagrams or pictures you can create to help you visually organize information. They help show relationships between pieces of information so you can better understand the connections between different concepts or groups of data. By better understanding how different ideas connect together, you can better remember them and recall them at test time.Place the main idea in the center of your mind map, and use connected branches to add related information.
You can create a mind map on paper, or there are computer tools to help you create them digitally.

, Some researchers believe that the act of chewing gum actually allows more oxygen into your brain, which helps you concentrate better. Furthermore, if you chew a particular flavor of gum while studying, such as peppermint, you may be able to better remember information you studied if you also chew that gum during your test., Smells are often associated with memories, so you can use this to help you remember what you’re studying.Try this experiment: smell a perfume or scent while studying. Then, smell the same scent right before your exam. You may be able to better recall the information you studied.

Watch and pay attention.,
Take notes.,
Observe again.,
Describe what you observed.,
Reproduce what you observed.,
Instruct others.,
Read about different approaches toward observational learning.,
Attend events where you can learn about observational learning.,
Enroll in relevant degree or non-degree granting programs that focus on related problems.",How to Learn Through Observation," Your first step in learning through observation is actually watching and paying attention to whatever you’ve focused on. Without committing your full attention, you won’t be able to understand and internalize what you’re observing.


If you're observing someone teach in a classroom, put all of your attention into it. Make sure you have a good vantage for watching the person instruct. Also, make sure you can hear everything they're saying. Finally, pay attention to body language and how they speak to and interact with their students.
Avoid engaging in any other activities when observing. For example, put your smart phone away, turn off music, and don’t chat with the people around you.
Don’t think about anything not related to whatever it is you are observing.;
, If possible, when you observe something, you should also take notes on whatever it is you are observing. By taking notes, you’ll give yourself the ability to record both large and small details that have to do with whatever it is you are observing.


Use a journal to record your observations. For example, if you're observing someone teach, make notes about what they do. If the person you're observing verbally repeats what they're writing on a whiteboard, write that down. It may be a technique you'll want to mimic later.
Write in shorthand, use abbreviations, or utilize some other sort of system so your notetaking will be efficient and will convey what you are observing.
Type or re-type your notes later, this will help you retain the information you learned., After you’ve observed and taken notes, you should observe again, if possible. By observing again, you’ll gain a better understanding of whatever you’re observing and you’ll be more likely to notice small details.


For example, if you’re observing someone teach, ask if you can observe them again. This time, pay closer attention to the interactions the teacher makes with students, the things the teacher says, and how the teacher organizes their desk and papers.
The more you observe, the better. Every observation will help you learn more about whatever it is you’re watching.

, An important step in reinforcing what you’ve learned is describing exactly what you observed. By describing what you’ve learned – either in writing or through words – you’ll help yourself better conceptualize what you saw.


Write a short summary of what you observed. For instance, if you observed someone else teaching, you should write a summary of how they taught. Make sure to consult your notes when you write your summary.
When writing your summary, consider writing something like ""Nancy gave the lesson while showing relevant pictures. She then passed out a handout and walked her students through the directions. Afterwards, Nancy walked around the room answering questions and instructing as her students worked in groups.""
Talk to someone about what you observed. For instance, if you observed someone teaching, talk to that person about what you saw. Describe how they taught and the things they did that were effective., After you’ve described what you observed, its time for you to try to reproduce it. By reproducing what you observed, you’ll further reinforce what you learned. Fundamentally, by doing something, you’ll gain a much better understanding of it.


Make sure you have all the materials and resources that you need to reproduce whatever it is you observed. For example, if Nancy used an overhead projector, a whiteboard, and a handout, make sure you have those materials, too.
Ensure that you have the proper time to reproduce what you saw.
Try to see if the person you observed can be present when you reproduce what they did. That way, they can guide you along through the process. For example, if you observed someone teaching, see if they can sit in on your classroom for the day. , The final step in reinforcing what you learned through observation is to instruct others about whatever it is you observed. By instructing others, you’ll further internalize and better conceptualize what you observed. This is because teaching is one of the best ways of learning.


Create a structured and well-planned lesson about whatever it is you observed.
Carefully explain, in steps, what you learned. For example, if you’re instructing people how to teach, explain to them basic principles and steps involved in teaching.
Answer any questions the people you are instructing might have., There are a wide variety of academic and popular books available that you can read to learn about observational learning. By reading about observational learning, you’ll learn about different techniques and perspectives about how to do so effectively.


Consider the 1977 book ‘’Self-Efficacy: Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change’’ by Albert Bandura.
Read “Observational Learning: Evidence from Randomized Natural Field Experiment” by Hongrin Cai, Yuyu Chen, and Hanming Fang.
Consider ‘’Opening Doors to Equity: A Practical Guide to Observation-Based Professional Learning’’ by Tonya Ward Singer. Singer’s book focuses on observation and learning in the education profession. , A great way to educate yourself about observational learning is to attend events where people will teach you or discuss different theories or methods about it. At such events, you’ll both learn by watching other people and by listening to them discuss their techniques.


Go to educational conferences. Depending on the conference, they might have panels or speakers that will address observational learning.
See speakers in your area who speak on the subject.
To find useful events, use an internet search engine to search for ""educational conferences"" or ""observational learning speakers."" Scroll through the results to find events in your area., The most formal way of educating yourself about observational learning is by relevant classes at your local college or university.


Consider classes on behaviorism, which focuses observing human behavior and drawing conclusions.
Programs that might offer relevant classes include education, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and the sciences."

Do problems neatly and completely.,
Have a plan to tackle each problem.",How to Improve Math Skills," Math games are good tools for honing your math skills and are designed to let you have fun while doing it. Some recommended online math games (that are in line with the new Common Core standards) include:


DragonBox 5+ which lets you gradually build your algebra skills until you’re able to master more and more advanced equations.Prodigy, a game targeted at elementary-school students, that integrates math practice into a role-playing game that allows players to use math to make their way through an appealing fantasy world.Many other productive games are available online and as apps, so do a little looking around and find those best suited to your needs and goals.;
, Incorporate math equations into your daily routine to help keep your skills sharp and to help you recognize the many ways that math exists all around you.Take the time to apply math in common situations. For example, if, say, a sweater that’s regularly $38 is on sale for 30% off, what is the sale price? Or if you need to double a recipe that calls for 3/4 cup of flour, how much flour will you need?
Also take the opportunity to put your math skills to work in new and different situations outside your normal routine. For example, if you plan to hike a new trail that’s 7 miles long and it takes you 20 minutes to walk a mile, how long should you plan for your hike to take? Or if you need to drive 13 miles to pick up your friend at 1:30 and the average speed limit there is 45 mph (72 km/h), what time will you need to leave to arrive on time to get your friend?

, It’s easy to become frustrated with math when all you’re doing is memorizing a formula that, at base, means nothing to you. But if you work to truly understand the principles behind the formula, your understanding of math can become deeper and more productive.Start by doing some research. Say you’re learning the Pythagorean theorem. Who was Pythagoras anyway? What does he have to do with triangles? How did he discover the theorem that was named after him and why does anybody care? Having a sense of the development and broader implications of a math concept can turn it from something you simply have to memorize into something you genuinely understand and can take an interest in.
Translate the math principle into everyday language. Staying with the Pythagorean theorem, you know that the basic definition of the Pythagorean theorem is a2 + b2 = c2, but what does that translate to in everyday language? Try to figure it out. Translating it might result, for example, in this: the square of the longest side of a triangle (c2) is the same as (or equal to) the squares of the other two sides (a2 + b2) added together. Translating the principle into everyday, non-intimidating language can help you more easily understand, remember, and apply that principle.
Explore with that new principle--in the Pythagorean theorem example, try applying the theorem to other shapes than triangles. Can it be translated and applied to other shapes like rectangles, hexagons, squares, etc.? Why or why not? Understanding why a principle specifically applies to some instances and not others will help you better integrate and apply that principle as you go forward.

, Designate a separate binder or notebook specifically for math class (one binder or notebook per class if you’re taking multiple math classes).


Set up a section for in-class notes, a section for reading notes, and a section for homework.

, Set aside time in your schedule for math homework and study. Otherwise you may be tempted to procrastinate, find yourself getting behind, or end up studying at inopportune times (like when you’re tired or rushed).


Make time each day to work on math. Even if you don’t have a homework assignment every day, set aside at least 15 minutes to spend working on sample problems and reviewing your notes. Studying every day will help cement your math knowledge in place and make it easier to access when you need it.
At the university level, you can plan to need approximately 2-4 hours of studying per week for each hour of class instruction.
Remember that studying math, unlike some other subjects, is about doing math, so your study/practice time is the most important to your success.

, Read ahead in the book to the chapter that will be covered in the next class.


Knowing the main idea and general precepts of the chapter before going to class will help you better understand and keep up with the material in class.

, Read back through the notes from the previous class before your next class so you’ll be up to date and prepared for the new material.Reading your previous notes will help you make necessary connections between the old and new material and give you a more solid foundation on which to build new skills.

, It should be obvious, but it’s hard to do well in a course if you don’t show up to learn the material.


Try to sit near the front and center of the classroom. It will be easier to see and hear and harder to get distracted.

, Though it may seem like all you need to take notes is to write down what the instructor says, successful note-taking has as much to do with how you write them as what you write in them.


If the material covered in the class is closely related to the material covered in the textbook, you can use what’s called the “2-3-3-2 technique”: Make a two-inch column down the left side of the page for “recall clues,” make a three-inch column down the center of the page for lecture notes, make a three-inch column down the right side of the page for text notes, and make a two-inch horizontal space at the bottom of the page for your own observations and hints.If the material covered in class is not closely related to that covered in the textbook, use two different sheets of paper, one for class notes and one for reading notes, and use what’s called the “2-5-1 technique” for each. Make a two-inch column down the left side of the page for “recall clues,” make a five-inch column down the middle of the page for lecture notes or reading notes, and make an inch column down the right side of the page for your own observations and hints.Your “recall clues” should be key words or phrases that label the kind of information in each part of your notes. These should be cues rather than extensive or repetitive notes so that you can easily glance through your notes and associate them with the relevant concepts.

, Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you have them!


If you’re intimidated by the idea of asking questions during the instructor’s lecture, write down your questions and speak to the instructor after class or during in-class work time.

, Set aside time to work on math at the same time and in the same place everyday. Doing so will help you avoid procrastinating and make it easier to get into “math” mode (rather than sitting and staring blankly at the math book for 10 minutes).


After putting in your study time, reward yourself by doing something you enjoy. It will motivate you to get through your math work and help you associate it with something pleasurable.
Take a break every hour. Don’t try to slog through four unbroken hours of math problems--you won’t be able to maintain necessary focus and you’ll quickly tire yourself out.Instead, take a quick break to stand up, stretch, get a drink, or use the bathroom every hour.

, Your study habits have a huge influence on your success in math. And it’s not just about the quantity of study time, it’s about the quality.


Work with a tutor or study-partner. Having someone to whom you can address questions and who can help point out mistakes is often crucial to effective learning.
If you encounter questions neither you nor your partner can answer, write them down and bring them to the instructor.
Make note cards. Write out important concepts and formulas on note cards so that you can easily refer to them while doing problems and use them for study guides before exams.
Study in a quiet place. Distractions, whether aural or visual, will detract both from your ability to pay attention and to retain information.
Study when you’re alert and rested. Don’t try to force yourself to study late at night or when you’re sleep-deprived. You won’t be able to concentrate sufficiently, which leads to unwitting mistakes and frustration.

, When sitting down to read a math section in the textbook, read strategically.First gather an overview. Read the title and headings, then read the introductory remarks and summary paragraphs to give yourself a global view of the topic.
Look for main ideas. Next, look over the section to gather the main ideas: look for and read bolded or italicized words, bulleted lists, pictures and tables.
Read the full section. Next, read the section in full from beginning to end--this should move comparatively quickly because you already have an idea of the point and main ideas of the section.
Read with a pencil in hand. Write down and complete each sample problem given. This will help you actively absorb what’s being demonstrated and help you recognize problem concepts early on.
Set the section aside and write down the main idea and key ideas. Recall tends to fade immediately after reading, so taking the time to recall what you’ve just read after reading will give you a significant memory advantage.
Make connections. Think about how the new material you’ve learned relates to and builds on what you’ve previously learned. Making these connections will help you better understand and integrate the new material.
Review. Finally, after reading, reflecting on, and completing the new material, you’ll need to return to it as time goes on and you get closer to taking a test or exam.

, In math, each topic builds upon the next, so, much like reading, it’s difficult if not impossible to make forward progress if you haven’t mastered all of the necessary steps.


If you’re struggling with a particular idea or concept, don’t skip it and move ahead. Instead, seek help from the instructor or a tutor until you’ve mastered the idea.

, Avoid trying to solve math problems in your head. Instead, write out each step of the solution without skipping steps.


If you don’t write out each step as you go, you may miscalculate without realizing and be unable to retrace your steps when trying to fix and learn from your mistake.
Don’t do math problems in pen and work out problems vertically and neatly, with only one step per each line.Not only will working neatly make it easier for you to systematically solve a problem and avoid mistakes, but many teachers also grade math exercises based on the completeness of the steps to the solution, not just the solution itself.

, It can be easy to freeze up when confronted with a math problem to solve, but having a basic strategy of attack can help get you through.Understand the problem. Start by reading the whole question and determining what problem it’s asking you to solve.
Identify which skills and concepts you’ll need to solve the problem. This will give you an overall sense of what you’ll need to do to find the solution.
For word problems, sketch out the scenario rather than try to picture it in your head. Even if the problem includes a sketch, make your own--it’s important that it makes sense to you if it’s going to help you solve the problem.Review your solution. Look over your work and check that you’ve answered the question and that your solution to the problem makes sense. If it seems off, go back over your work and look for mistakes or missteps.

Study with short breaks.",How to Increase Concentration While Studying," Generally, it is a good idea to eliminate distractions as much as possible while studying, so you can concentrate on what's in front of you. You want to find a place that is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable for you.


Find a quiet area, such as a private room or a library. If you like fresh air, go outside to an area that is reasonably free of distractions, and somewhere you can still connect to Internet, if necessary.
Keep in mind that everyone has their own studying environment preferences. While some prefer to study in quiet, others thrive in a bustling environment that mimics white noise.
If you don’t know your studying preferences, experiment in different areas, studying in a group or studying solo, studying with or without music, etc. Your ability to concentrate and be productive in different environments will reveal itself rather quickly.;
, Your studying materials include things like notes, textbooks, study guides, papers, highlighters, or anything else you might need to concentrate and be productive while studying; this includes a snack like a granola bar or nuts, and a bottle of water.All your materials should be within arm's reach so you don’t disrupt yourself by going to retrieve your things when you’re in the zone, studying.

, Clear away materials you don't need to study, and keep your space organized to reduce stress and allow for better concentration. Having any materials around you that don’t directly contribute to your concentration only serve as potential distractions.


This includes throwing away food containers, paper garbage, and other miscellaneous items.

, Turn off any electronics that you don't need, especially cell phones, music listening devices, and perhaps computers (provided you don't need a computer to study your material).


Your laptop or computer could serve as a huge source of distraction when you’re trying to concentrate.

, Arrange a schedule for study time, and keep with it. This allows you to build studying time into a habit, making you more likely to follow through on study plans. Be aware of your energy levels throughout the day. Are you more energetic (and therefore more able to concentrate) during the day or nighttime?It may help to study your harder subjects when you have the most energy.


Once you know the time of day that you’re more energetic, you can make sure you study during those times, increasing your ability to focus and concentrate on your work.

, Sometimes reviewing material with someone else can help break up the monotony of studying, clarify confusing concepts by bouncing ideas off of someone else, and see things from a different perspective. This partner can help you keep on track with your studies, and concentrate on the task in front of you.


Some people may find study partners distracting. When looking for a study partner, try to find someone who is sensible and focused, maybe even more of an active student in class than you are. That way, you are always pushing yourself to stay matched with them.

, Before you start studying, think of something that can serve as a reward for you successfully studying. For example, after reviewing your history notes for 1 hour, talk to your roommate about your day, make dinner, or watch your favorite upcoming television program.An incentive can motivate you to concentrate on studying for a specific amount of time, and then you reward yourself for your solid block of time concentrating on your work.


For bigger projects, develop a bigger incentive to reward yourself for your extra hard work., Finding an effective study method that suits you can help you stay concentrated while studying. Again, every person studies differently, so you will have to experiment and find a method that works best for you to maintain focus. Essentially, the more ways you can experience and interact with what you’re learning, the better your chances will be of staying on task and absorbing what you’re reviewing.Sometimes, simply reviewing readings, notes, or quizzes can serve as an effective way to study, but some other study methods include:



Making notecards. For vocabulary or academic terms, making notecards and flashcards and repeatedly reviewing them can help with memorizing words, terms, and concepts.

Drawing. Some studying requires reviewing structures and diagrams. Copying those diagrams and structures, and drawing them yourself allows you to create and visualize what it is you’re trying to study, therefore making it more memorable.

Creating an outline. Creating an outline may help with mapping out bigger concepts including the smaller details. It can also help create visual sections and groupings of information that may help recalling details when exam time approaches.

Using elaborative interrogation. Elaborative interrogation is basically producing an explanation for why something you’re learning is true. It’s like you coming up with a defensive reason for why a fact or statement is important.You could also use this method to talk about concepts out loud and make yourself more familiar with the material by justifying and explaining it’s significance.

, When reading or listening to a lecture, try to engage with the material. This means instead of just being present with the material, challenge it and yourself. Ask questions about what is being lectured, connect the material to your real life, compare it with other information you have learned throughout your life and discuss and explain this new material to other people.


Actively participating with your studies makes the material more meaningful and able to hold your interest, which, in turn, makes concentrating on it easier.

, Working on improving your concentration takes time and patience. After practicing some of these strategies, you’ll probably begin to see improvement within days.Some concentration strategies include:



Be here now. This simple and effective strategy helps bring back your wandering mind to the task at hand: When you become aware of the fact that your thoughts are no longer on your studies, say to yourself, “Be here now,” and try to reign in your wandering thoughts, and focus back on your study material.
For example, you're in class and your attention strays from the lecture to the fact that you're craving coffee and the last bagel at the café is probably gone by now. As you say to yourself, “Be here now,” you fix your attention back to the lecture, and keep it there for as long as you can.Keep track of your mental wanderings. Mark down every time you catch your mind drifting away from what you should be concentrating on. As you get better and better with bringing yourself back to the present task, the number of times you break concentration should be less and less., Research has shown that when people put aside a designated time to worry and think about things that stress them out, people worry 35% less within four weeks.That proves that when you let yourself worry and think about things during a certain amount of time, you spend less time worrying and getting distracted when you should be concentrating on other things.


If you ever find yourself worrying about something while you’re trying to focus and concentrate, remember that you have a special time to worry about things. You can even try the “be here now” method to bring yourself back to concentrating.
For example, give yourself a half hour before you start studying to worry about upcoming exams, your family, or whatever else is on your mind. Worry during this elected time so when you have to study, you can put all your attention and focus on doing that., While the subjects you need to study might not be the most interesting topics, you can shift your perspective while studying to make concentrating easier. By setting goals for yourself, you change your studying experience from having to “get through,” the subject, to reaching check points and continually succeeding in progressing with your study session.For example, instead of having the mentality of, “I have to study all of chapter 6 tonight,” set a goal for yourself with something like, “I will study sections 1-3 by 4:30, and then take a walking break.” That way, conquering a study session transforms from a large, daunting task, to a smaller, more achievable portions. This sectional break up of study time increasing your willingness to concentrate and reach your studying goal.

, Normally, studying for about an hour at a time and then taking a 5-10 minute break is the most effectual study schedule to maintain concentration on a given task. Taking a short break gives your mind time to relax, so it can be ready to stay productive and absorb information.


Move around. Get up and stretch after sitting for about an hour. You could do some yoga, push ups, or any other kind of physical activity to get your blood pumping. These short breaks in studying will make the time you spend studying more productive and attentive.

, A levels are a big step up from GCSEs and require a lot more independent studying. Make sure all of your class work and homework is completed swiftly and to a high standard. You'll be using these notes to revise from later on, so make sure they are clear and understandable., This is really important; you'll need those notes to revise from come exam season. Borrow the completed work from a friend in the class to copy up from, and ask the teacher to explain any work that you don't fully understand., Complete any homework or catch-up work you need to do. If you didn't quite understand something in class, use this opportunity to ask your friends for help or to use the school computers to look it up. If you have an upcoming test or exam, use this free time to revise and go over notes. It's okay to spend the odd free lesson socialising, just make sure you're not avoiding doing urgent work., Most teachers will be happy to discuss any problems you have before or after school, or even during break times. Some will even let you study in the back of their classroom when they are teaching, so they can give you occasional guidance., It is likely that many of the small groups that used to hang out together will now merge into bigger, mixed groups. You will have an opportunity to get to know people you hardly knew before. Plus, there will be probably be plenty of new students joining you, so be sure to make them feel welcome., Most universities and jobs will require a couple of references from your teachers, especially if you have no previous employment. They will be asked to vouch for your behaviour, attitude and key skills. Be sure to behave in class and ask plenty of questions to show that you're listening., Have fun, but don't let it affect your studies., When you hit 17 years old you can start learning to drive a car. Lots of people opt to start learning in sixth form and book lesson for lunchtime or at the end of the school day., After sixth form you'll be heading into work or higher education, it's a lot easier to get access to these opportunities if your CV/personal statement stands out. You can ensure this by gaining extra skills, qualifications and experience. For example, you could get a part-time job, volunteer, go on courses or gain work experience in the field of work you wish to enter. Paid work is also a good way to fund your social life and start saving up for your future., Decide if you want to go on to higher education, get a full-time job, an apprenticeship or something else. Make sure you do plenty of research before making a decision; take into account your career prospects and what qualifications are needed, costs/pay, your interests, and how you learn best."

Exercise just before you study.,
Try light exercise while you study.,
Go to the gym right after studying.,
Take a walk around the library.,
Exercise at your desk.",How to Improve Your Study Routine with Exercise1," If possible, do physical activity before you study. Go for a jog before you sit down to study for a test or go over your class notes. Hit the gym on the way home to swim some laps so you are ready to study that evening.Doing aerobic activity gets blood, oxygen, and nutrients to your brain, which helps your brain function better.;
, A few studies have shown that performing light exercise while studying can help recall of information. If you are going to exercise while studying, just make sure to keep it gentle.These studies found that vigorous exercise while studying may hurt recall because your brain is focused on the workout instead of the information.
To try this, take your textbook or notes to the gym. Use the stationary bike while you study for at least half an hour, making sure to keep the intensity light and gentle. You can also use an elliptical, treadmill, or stairclimber., Studies have shown that exercising before and while you study are not the only times that benefit your recall and mental processing. Working out after a study session can also help boost your mental function and improve your studying.Go for a walk or even lift weights after you study to help your brain stay active so your studying can pay off.

, If you are studying in the library, break up your study sessions with physical activity. Get up and take a fifteen-minute stroll around the building or around campus nearby.You can also do this if you are studying in your dorm or a coffee shop.
Taking a break helps refresh yourself and gets blood flowing to the brain, which can help you think and remember better.

, You can get your blood pumping at your desk while you study. If you don’t want to leave everything and go for a quick 15 minute stroll, try getting some physical activity in where you are.Do some chair squats at your desk. Stand up from your chair, then squat down without sitting down. Hover just above the chair for about 10 seconds. Repeat this 20 times.Try wall sitting. Lean against the wall and slowly lower yourself into a squat position, using the wall to support your back. Hold for as long as you can, or do 20 sets while holding for 10 seconds each. You may also wish to lift one leg as you hold the squat for an extra challenge.
Use resistance bands while you sit there and study. Put one in each hand and pull on them for an upper body workout. You can also try holding hand weights and doing bicep curls while studying.

Determine an appropriate amount of exercise.,
Choose an aerobic exercise.,
Make time for your workout.,
Focus on consistency.,
Make the exercise an enjoyable experience.",How to Improve Your Study Routine with Exercise2," Adding exercise to your schedule may take some planning, but it won’t be impossible. To get the benefits of the physical activity, schedule 150 minutes of exercise into your week.Adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or a combination of these.Adolescents should get at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity each day., There are so many activities you can do for aerobic exercise. You can join intramural sports teams, go for walks with friends, or hit your college’s gym. Make sure to think about whether you are doing moderate or vigorous intensity workouts.Moderate physical activity includes brisk walking at three miles per hour or faster or bicycling slower than 10 miles per hour. You can also play doubles tennis, go ballroom dancing, or do general gardening.
Vigorous intensity workouts include race walking, jogging, or running or cycling faster than 10 miles per hour. You can also swim laps, play singles tennis, do aerobic dancing, jump rope, or hike with a heavy backpack or uphill.Many gym classes provide excellent opportunities for vigorous and moderate exercise.
Any aerobic activity should be performed for at least 10 minutes at a time to gain brain-boosting benefits. You should also spread it out throughout the week to keep your brain focused and sharp.

, Committing to an exercise program to help your studies may be difficult at first. Keep in mind the mental and cognitive benefits of the exercise and how it will help improve your school performance.Sit down and list all your commitments, activities, and study hours. Don’t forget to list sleep times, meal times, and time for other things, like showering. Look for places you can incorporate exercise.
Don’t forget to count daily exercise. If you walk 10 or more minutes to class or work, this counts as aerobic physical activity. If you can start walking to class, make that one of your changes.
Choose something that you believe you will enjoy and that can easily be placed into your schedule. If you have trouble finding time to workout, consider going out for a 30 minute jog or dancing around your room for half an hour.
Breaking up exercises into smaller increments, such as three 10-minute fast-paced walks, can offer brain-boosting benefits if you struggle fitting exercise into your day., Consistent daily workouts, or workouts that coincide with your studying and classes, are more effective than trying to get 150 minutes of physical activity in on the weekend. The consistent physical activity throughout the week will boost your brain during the week, closer to when you study, instead of isolating it on the weekend.If you have class three times a week and study on those days, try to go for at least a 30 minute walk or jog before you go back to your room to study. If you go to school every day for eight hours, spend half an hour to an hour after school lets out doing something physical, then study after you get home., Exercise is great for relieving stress and reducing anxiety. Therefore, try not to make the physical activity a stressful part of your day. Allow yourself the time to take care of yourself. Remember, though you are not studying or working when you exercise, you are helping to boost your overall studying effectiveness.


Listen to music while exercising. Numerous studies have linked music to stress relief and the reduction of anxiety. While out for your walk, listen to music that either relaxes you or makes you happy.Exercise with a friend. This can do two things at once: get physical activity into your day while letting you socialize, which can help boost your mood and reduce stress."

Know that exercise boosts mental function.,
Exercise to reduce stress.,
Incorporate exercise to improve energy.",How to Improve Your Study Routine with Exercise3," Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental alertness and cognitive function. Your brain works better and you can think more clearly after exercising.Physical activity also helps boost memory and recall, which is important when studying.
Aerobic exercise helps pump blood to your brain, which helps give it oxygen and nutrients that it needs to work and process information.

, Exercise has many benefits, but one important benefit for students is that exercise helps boost your mood. Regular exercise helps reduce anxiety, which you may feel because of your studies.Regular aerobic exercise has been found to help reduce tension, stabilize your mood, and reduce stress.
Just five minutes of cardio can help start to reduce anxiety., Exercise provides multiple benefits that help improve your energy. This is important if you are a student trying to study for multiple exams or classes. Doing some aerobic exercise may be more effective than hitting the coffee shop.Regular exercise boosts energy levels.
Since exercise reduces stress, it helps reduce fatigue associated with elevated stress levels.
Exercise boosts your ability to sleep. Adequate rest helps you feel more alert and allows your brain to function better as you study."

Keep trying new things.,
Exercise.,

Read fiction.,
Play games that require reasoning skills.,
Create.,
Pay attention to the purpose behind your actions.,
Identify your biases.,
Consider the implications of your options.,
Watch for over-generalizations.,
Do not make assumptions.,
Avoid catastrophic thinking.,
Pay attention to how your read situations.",How to Improve Reasoning Skills," A great way to improve reasoning skills is to keep trying new things. The mind is like any other muscle. It requires exercise and stimulation. Make a point of trying out new hobbies and activities on a regular basis.


Pick activities that are vastly different from one another. If you're already an outdoor enthusiast, instead of taking up hiking consider learning to crochet. If you're big into crafts and working with your hands, consider trying to do crossword puzzles or Sudoku in your spare time.Take classes if possible. Taking a pottery class or poetry class at a local community center can be a fun way to challenge your brain and encourage you to try new things.;
, Physical exercise actually has an effect on memory and thinking. Many studies indicate the parts of the brain responsible for thinking and reasoning are bigger in those who exercise regularly. Also, exercise reduces stress and anxiety and boosts mood, which can make it easier to concentrate and learn. Strive to incorporate regular physical activity into your day-to-day routine. This can lead to an improvement in critical thinking skills. While researchers are still unsure if one form of exercise is better than another, some research indicates aerobic exercise is most helpful to mental stimulation., Daily journaling can actually help improve critical thinking skills. In addition to helping you revisit your day, journaling encourages reflection and thought.


Writing is an active endeavor. It forces you to expand and explore your thoughts. Keeping a journal that details your day, your feelings, and anything you thought about throughout the day can make you a more introspective, aware person. This can lead to higher reasoning skills.Make time to journal every day. Schedule regular journaling time into your day-to-day life as you would brushing your teeth, showering, and eating dinner. It may be helpful to schedule journal time after an activity you're accustom to doing every day, as this will make it easier to remember to keep up with your journal.

, Reading in general is great for improving critical thinking. However, fiction specifically can allow you to be more comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. This can lead to more sophisticated thinking as well as more creativity.Fiction can force you to become more insightful about other perspectives due to the focus on character.This can make you more in tune to the cultures, belief systems, and skill sets of those around you. You may be better at, say, reasoning with those around you as you'll have a greater capacity for empathy.
Black and white thinking is also lessened through reading fiction. People who read fiction over time may have more sophisticated thought patterns as they're able to navigate and accept the ambiguity in a variety of situations., There are a variety of games that require you to reason. Strategic board games, games like chess, and word games all help reasoning skills.


Look for board games that rely on more than just look. Explore in depth strategy games where decision making is a key part of the process. Schedule a regular game night with friends and aim to play games that require thought and attention. Clue and Risk require critical thought. Games like Scrabble and Boggle teach you to analyze information quickly.Chess and checkers all require reasoning skills. Consider joining or starting a chess club.Consider games you can play on your own. You can play certain card games alone online. Purchase a Rubik's Cube and spend time trying to solve it., Forcing yourself to create on a regular basis can improve reasoning skills. You don't necessarily have to be highly adept at a creative activity but forcing the mind to try new things can increase reasoning skills. Try to play a musical instrument. Take up drawing. Write a poem. Compose a short song., Each time you make a decision throughout the day, there is some purpose behind it. Given the hectic demands of day-to-day life, people sometimes lose track of the purpose and goals behind their actions. Try to be aware of the inherent purposes driving you throughout the day.


Focus on larger goals at work or school. Where do you want to be in five years? Two years? One year? How are you current actions serving this goal? Do your actions make sense reasonably given your larger purpose? Answering these questions can help you improve your reasoning skills.Try to make sure your actions are actually serving some purpose. Oftentimes, people get caught up in the idea something has to be done in a particular way or they have to follow a particular path. Actions then become unreasonable. Try to keep the end in mind when you take a certain action., Everyone has biases, whether they are aware of them or not. If you want to improve reasoning skills, try to identify your biases.


A major bias is that people often only consider a situation or a problem from one point of view. When dealing with an issue at work, school, or home pause and ask yourself a few questions before taking action. Ask, ""What do I believe about the situation? Why do I believe this? What assumptions might I be making about the thoughts and ideas of others?""It's important to take steps to be self aware of your own biases. This can help you avoid having those biases obstruct your judgment.It may even be helpful to ask a close friend about your gaps in thinking. Approach a friend with a question like, ""What are some ways I sometimes behave irrationally?"" Ask for honesty and openness.

, Each time you make a choice, there are consequences. A good way to improve reasoning skills is to make a point of stopping to consider those consequences on a conscious level.


Use your imagination. Before making a choice in a given situation, pause to imagine a variety of possible outcomes. How do you feel about these outcomes? What's the worst care scenario? Best case scenario? What is reasonably most likely to happen? Why?Also, do not neglect to consider the viewpoints of others affected by your decision. This can help you explore your decision through a variety of angles., Many people over generalize without realizing it. This is toxic to rational thinking. Try to be aware of any over-generalizations you may make in day-to-day life.


Over-generalizations are taking one particular event and seeing it as evidence of how things have always been or always will be. For example, if you do bad on one test you may think, ""I'm stupid and always fail at school."" In making this statement, you're glossing other academic success you have had in the past in the light of one event.All-or-nothing thinking is a form of generalizing where you see things in black and white terms. All-or-nothing thinking places things in only one or two categories: good or bad, success or failure, etc. This results in missing the shades of gray in a situation. For example, if you get a mixed review of your performance at work you may see yourself as a failure. In reality, you're likely a competent worker with some areas that need improvement.Filtering out positive is a thought pattern in which too much focus is placed on the bad aspects of a situation. If 20 good things happen in a day followed by 1 bad thing, you may focus entirely on the negative. For example, say you make a single mistake during a musical performance but otherwise play perfectly. You might be tempted to declare the performance a disaster. In reality, you are probably the only person who noticed a single wrong note., People make assumptions about all kinds of situations. This can lead to unreasonable thinking. Strive to be aware of any assumptions you make.


Sometimes, people engage in mind-reading. That is, you make assumptions about what others think of your or a situation. In reality, it's impossible to know what another person is thinking without asking. For example, you may find yourself thinking ""I bet everyone thought I was an idiot in that meeting"" or ""I bet that co-worker thinks I talk too much."" If you notice yourself engaging in such thoughts, try to remind yourself that you are probably not as good as reading people's opinions as you think you are.Fortune telling is a form of thinking where you think you know what will happen in the future. This can be in the form of a defeatist attitude. For example, ""I'll never be able to stick to a diet and lose weight"" or ""I know I'm going to sound like an idiot during my presentation tomorrow."" Keep in mind that, in reality, you cannot know what will happen tomorrow or in the coming weeks., Many people catastrophize situations when they're upset or stressed. For example, you might think you'll be financially bankrupt forever if you need to pay for car repairs one month. If you get rejected romantically, you might decide you're not destined for love. Try to keep in mind that one setback or misfortune is not necessarily indicative of things to come., Oftentimes, people unconsciously read situations in an irrational way. Watch how you think and perceive situations in day-to-day life.


Labeling is the tendency to put a name on a situation. For example, ""This person made a mistake"" or ""I made a bad choice."" This leads you to put people and situations into categories based on solitary instances. Try your best not to categorize and avoid the temptation to judge.Personalization is the tendency to take situations and other people's reactions personally. For example, you may assume a co-worker is mad at you if she doesn't stop to chat in the break room. In reality, she may just be busy. Try not to take situations personally.Oftentimes, you hold yourself to an unreal ideal. You might see someone else's success as evidence of your shortcoming. Try to keep in mind everyone is different and moves at a different pace."

Produce development plans that work.,
Improve leadership development programs.,
Make learning opportunities more visible.,
Align training more to organizational needs: In many organizations, budgets allocated for learning and development are among the first to be cut during a recession.,
Link training and HR for strategic value: When learning and performance functions converge to create a true talent development framework, both functions benefit by becoming more relevant to supporting the organization’s critical strategy.",How to Improve Learning With Performance Management," Most organizations struggle to adopt development plans managed independently through the Learning Management System (LMS). When performance management is automated and tied into the learning process, organizations and employees alike are more likely to buy into the integrated development plan. The development plans align directly with the organization’s goals and are therefore linked to the company’s overall strategy. Employee engagement in prescribed learning is certain to improve when employees see how this development ties directly to their performance evaluation and merit considerations.;
, Leadership development is one of the most popular learning initiatives — and for good reason. Demographic shifts, increasing employee turnover, and increased specialization in the workplace all contribute to significant talent shortages. Performance management, equipped with career and succession planning tools, provide the diagnostics to zero in on the job functions and targeted individuals that need leadership development the most. Performance management tools help the learning group systematically develop an organization’s critical talent. They can complement generic leadership development programs by helping to account for roles, flight risk, and potential.

, In most organizations, the LMS is just one of countless other applications employees need to use. Engaging employees to log in and look around can be a challenge. Once mandatory processes are tied directly to salary increases, LMS usage numbers start to increase. As aspiring employees focus on competency gaps and individual development plans, they spend more time developing career plans with unsolicited development opportunities.

, An effective way for a training group to change this fact is to prove how training programs directly relate to organizational strategy. With integrated performance management, talent development professionals can see precisely which development is needed most. Aggregated review data, showing competency gaps and aligned strategic initiatives, highlight the areas where learning and development groups should focus. It thus becomes easier for the training group to justify the significance of talent development within the organizational strategy. Many companies that have integrated learning and performance have been able to drastically improve their ability to forecast for and anticipate formal development needs.

, Traditional organizational development activities important to the business, such as managing mandatory compliance and certifications, are improved by automated tracking and reporting. But there are other strategic areas of the business that need strong formal and informal learning. These include many pressing talent management issues: retaining critical talent, managing succession plans, and giving employees the skills they need to succeed. Truly actionable talent development is only feasible when performance management and learning management converge.

Pay attention in class.,
Utilize all resources made available to you.,
Pick apart the textbook.,
Put information into your own words.,
Process, then summarize the information.,
Put the information into practice.",How to Use Your Whole Brain While Studying1," Good study habits begin before you even leave the classroom. Listen attentively to what the teacher has to say on the subject. Ask questions, and answer the teacher’s questions. Pay close attention for cues (or direct statements) from the teacher about what is most important to know, and take notes especially on these topics., Read the assigned chapter in the textbook, and read over any notes, handouts, or other materials given to you. If there is a review or study session offered by the teacher, go to it. Give yourself the best chance for success. You'd be surprised by the number of people who do poorly on tests because they don't read the book.

, Don’t just read the assignment mindlessly — actively engage with it. Pick out the important words (sometimes they’re in bold), look them up if needed, and write your own definition for them. Carefully examine introductions, conclusions, review sections, and recap questions you find in textbook chapters.

, As with writing down your own definitions for key terms in the textbook chapter, it’s best to put all the critical information in your own words. Keep a notebook and pen near you, and write out the key points you are studying. If you have someone else’s notes, rewrite them yourself; it’s even best to rewrite your own classroom notes. This is a proven trick to help your brain engage more in the material., Our brains engage the material we’re studying at multiple levels at once. While we consciously take in and try to comprehend the material we’re studying, unconscious layers of our brain are working behind the scenes to organize and make sense of the material. Stop every so often so that you can take advantage of this behind-the-scenes work you’re doing without realizing it.Concentrate intently on your study materials for a reasonable period of time (a half-hour, for instance), then take a step back, pull out a sheet of paper, and try to summarize what you’ve just learned in your own words. You may be amazed at how much of the material you actually recall and understand. You can also try summarizing the entire study session the day after.

, Associate what you’re learning in theory with a more practical or tangible example. If you are studying history, for instance, try to make a story related to the subject. Or visit a museum, battlefield, etc. associated with it.


If you’re reading about how to do a simple science experiment, try doing the actual experiment.
Create games, songs, images, or other types of mnemonic devices to help you associate and recall the information."
"
Don’t delay in getting started.,
Organize your study space.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Relax.,
Take breaks.",How to Use Your Whole Brain While Studying2," Start studying as soon as you can after school. The minute you come in the door, get everything together that you need and begin your study session. Not only will the information be fresher in your mind right after school, you’ll also head off potential distractions before they have a chance to affect you.

, Maybe you think you can study just as well with a messy desk as you can with a neat one. In reality, though, having only the things you need right where you need them eliminates distractions and makes your study time more efficient.Place your pencils, notebook, folders, textbook, calculator, and any other important study materials within easy reach so you don’t lose focus while reaching or looking for them.

, Choose a quiet, isolated spot for your study space. Ask not to be disturbed. Play soothing music or put on noise-canceling headphones to block out distracting sounds if necessary. Keep common distractions like cell phones tucked away and/or out of reach, and silenced or shut off., Before you begin studying, and during your study session, take a moment to gather yourself and reduce your stress level. Do some deep breathing exercises, meditate or pray, listen to some soothing music, or do whatever else helps you to relax. Excess stress will cause you to lose focus.

, Generally speaking, do not spend more than an hour studying without having a break, because your brain gets tired and can’t give full attention to the subject. Make them quick breaks — just a couple minutes — so that you don’t lose your momentum. Just give yourself enough time to take a drink, stretch out a bit, use the bathroom, do a quick calming exercise, or something similar."

Keep your brain active to strengthen it.,
Challenge your mind with puzzles, games, and activities.,
Exercise regularly for body and brain health.,
Eat a healthy diet for brain benefits.,
Play a musical instrument.",How to Use Your Whole Brain While Studying3," The human brain operates by making neural connections. When we put our brains to use regularly, new connections are made and existing ones are strengthened; when we don’t, connections become dormant or decayed. Keeping your brain actively engaged will help it function at its peak now and throughout your life.Try new things. Create. Debate. Ruminate. Daydream. Keep your brain working and it will work better when you need it for studying.

, If you want to build muscle, you have to keep increasing the amount of weight you’re lifting. If you want to build brainpower, you have to keep challenging your mind. While some of the claims made by “brain training” apps and programs are dubious, challenging your mind with puzzles, games, new activities, and difficult subjects can help enhance mental performance.Actively acquire information instead of passively receiving it. This is the difference between taking a cooking class and watching a cooking show, or attending a political candidate forum and checking your news feed.

, Your brain is part of your body, so it makes sense that the healthier you are overall, the healthier your brain will be. Regular exercise creates greater efficiency in oxygen and nutrient supplies to the brain, and can enhance your mood and immune system, among other benefits.


Maximize the brain benefits when your exercise — when out walking, focus intently on the surrounding environment and try to mentally recreate it when you get back home., The human brain requires an incredible amount of energy (in relation to size) in order to function, and this requires fuel.Just like regular exercise, a healthy diet is good for your brain and the rest of your body. While there are plenty of claims about specific “brain foods,” focus on eating lots of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, and limit refined sugars, unhealthy fats, and processed foods.


Don't study with either an empty stomach or a fully loaded one. Either scenario can be distracting. Have a light (and healthy) meal or snack instead.

, While the popular understanding is that the left side of the human brain controls logical thinking and the right side provides our creativity, the reality is far more complex.However, it is true that activities that spur both creativity and logical details simultaneously will invigorate more parts of your brain at once.


Playing a musical instrument is one of the most obvious — and enjoyable — ways to stimulate both the creative and logical aspects of your brainpower. To play effectively, you have to have precise timing and fine motor movements, but at the same time be able to improvise and think ahead.While the science behind many supposed left- or right-brain boosting activities is limited at best, doing things like juggling, playing board games, or attempting simple activities with your non-dominant hand will certainly give you a mental workout."

Mark the text with a pencil, pen, or fine-tipped colored markers.,
Underline the topic sentence in a passage.,
Avoid marking large volumes of text.,
Use a color system.,
Circle words you don’t know.,
Avoid marking the obvious.",How to Write Useful Notations in a Book1," Although a highlighter may be the first thing you reach for when taking notes in a book, it may not be the most effective option. There are two drawbacks with a highlighter: first, you may be tempted to highlight way too much text, and second, you can’t take notes or do other types of annotations with a highlighter. Try using a pencil, pen, or (the best choice) fine-tipped colored markers instead of (or maybe in addition to) your usual highlighter.


One important benefit of using pencil is the ability to erase! Use pencil if you are prone to making mistakes or if you'd like to be able to remove your notations later.;
, Rather than underlining an entire passage, aim to underline only the topic sentence of that paragraph. Not only will this make it more efficient for you to return to your notes, but taking the time to identify the topic sentence of a passage is an excellent way to learn and solidify what you know.

, Whenever you are trying to work through a text, it may be tempting to think that almost everything is important. One common mistake is for readers to highlight or underline very large volumes of text. Resist this urge, as it will only make it more difficult for you to return to your notes. Instead, underline only that which is most important, such as keywords, or crucial quotes., In order to make it easy for you to look back over your notes and gain quick understanding, you may want to use some kind of color-coding system. For example, you could use orange to indicate any new vocabulary words; blue to indicate a specific theme for an essay you are writing; and green to identify places where you have questions., An important aspect of reading is expanding your vocabulary. Anytime you encounter a word that you’re not familiar with, circle it (perhaps using a specific color pen), and find out what it means. You may even want to write down a brief definition in the margin., Another way to limit the volume of notations you make in your book is to avoid marking things that you already know. Even if it is central to the overall point that the author is making, if you encounter a concept or idea that you already have a firm grasp on, don’t bother marking it."
"
Write themes in the margins.,
Generate a system of symbols.,
Jot down questions in the margin.,
Draw arrows to related ideas.,
Write connections to other authors in the margins.",How to Write Useful Notations in a Book2," In addition to underlining (or highlighting) important text, it is also quite useful to write down some notes. One of the best annotations you can make is to simply jot down the main theme (or main idea) of a section in the margin. (It can also be useful to list themes at the beginning of chapters.)


Once again, taking the time to identify themes and main ideas is an excellent learning strategy.

, Create your own system of symbols to help guide your note-taking. For instance, you might use a question marks to indicate something you don’t understand (or don’t agree with), an exclamation mark to note something you feel strongly about, a triangle to show a shift in thinking, and finally, a star to indicate something very important.

, An important part of learning is being able to identify what you don’t know, don’t agree with, or don’t fully understand. These questions are valuable points of discussion, particularly if you will be talking about this reading in a class. (You can ask these questions of your instructor or classmates.) Furthermore, these give you places to deepen your research with alternative sources. Jot down any questions or concerns you have about the text in the margins., If you see a link between one section and another (particularly if the author is not making this link explicit), it is a good idea to draw a small arrow to indicate this connection. Alternatively, if a related idea appears on a different page, you can write the page number down instead.

, Literary analysis (or any type of analytical thinking) is all about making connections. Whenever you think of a connection while you are reading (to another author’s work, a concept from a different reading, or even an example from your personal life) take a moment to write this down in the margin. This will be valuable for future essays, research, or discussions."

Summarize at the end of each chapter.,
Use sticky notes.,
Use colored tabs to mark pages.,
Make a list of new vocabulary.,
Create an index in the front of the book.,
Revisit your notes.",How to Write Useful Notations in a Book3," After you finish each chapter (or sub-chapter), it is a great idea to stop and summarize the chapter in your own words. Don’t compose an essay. Instead, shoot for a few concise sentences. This will make it easy for you to locate specific ideas within the book when you return to it., If you have borrowed this book from a friend or from the library, it is best not to make marks inside. However, you can use sticky notes to follow many of these same strategies. Sticky notes come in many different sizes, so you can use them to mark specific quotations or main ideas. You can also stick them in the margins and use them to jot down themes, questions, symbols, or other notes.Sticky notes also come in a variety of colors.
You can use these colors to your advantage and create a color-coding system for your notes.

, Similar to sticky notes, colored tabs are placed near the edges of your book’s pages, and stick out when the book is closed. These tabs serve as little page markers, enabling you to flip to a specific page with ease. You can use colored tabs to indicate significant pages to yourself. Once again, you can use a variety of colors to indicate the location of specific themes or questions., If you don't wish to write in the book, instead of circling new vocabulary words, you can keep a separate list. It may be useful to provide the page number on which you found the word and to look up the definition in a dictionary. If you're reading a novel, you might want to wait to look up a word after you've finished a chapter so that you don't interrupt the flow of your reading.

, As you go through and identify key themes, you can save yourself a lot of time in the future by using that data to create your own index. On the inside of the front cover (or on a separate page or index card), you can list significant themes and their corresponding page numbers. This way, when you are looking for information on a specific topic, you’ll know right where to turn., In order to get the most out of your notations, it is important to go back and look them over. This will help solidify your comprehension of the material and provide you with the opportunity to quiz yourself or deepen your knowledge. You have taken the time to generate excellent notations, don't forget to use them.

Brainstorm a list of ideas for various topics that your survival guide can cover: Crushes, tests, dances...the list goes on and on!,
How to survive...


Crushes
Tests
Dances
Your first kiss
School spirit days
Mean teachers
Enemies

,
Go to your friends and have them add to the list.,
Time to write!,
If you have some topics that you haven't had happen to you, go to your friends and find someone that has!,
Revise it!,
After revising it, rewrite/retype it.,
Make a cool title page.,
Now, you have a finished student survival guide!",How to Write a Student Survival Guide," Here's a few to get you started:;
,, If you want this to be a good survival guide, you need to cover as many school-related topics as possible. Once you have as many topics has humanly possible, you can start writing your guide.

, When writing a survival guide, it's a great idea to reflect on your own experiences. How did you survive your first failed test? Write about it. You'll find that it's actually really easy to write a survival guide as long as you use your previous experiences and make it as relatable as possible.

, Did your friend have to survive going to school for a week with blue hair? Or a day with toilet paper stuck to their shoe? How did they deal with it?

, It will take a long time, but once you're done writing your survival guide, have friends, teachers, and family members revise it. Look for spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes. They might even be able to add another story or topic for you to write about! This is kind of a boring step, but it's a necessary one if you want your survival guide to be epic!

, Once you're done this, your survival guide is pretty much done. It's probably easier to type out your survival guide, because you can choose a cool font and it's just easier to read, but if you want to write it out, that's good too. Either way, rewrite/retype it, and then print it out. This is your survival guide!

, You can really get creative with this. Draw a notebook, make a camouflage background...do whatever you want! Stick a title on there too. You can make your title generic, such as ""Billy's Student Survival Guide"", or make it creative, such as ""Surviving School: The Ultimate Guide"". Make it yours!

, If it's a project for school, turn it in knowing that you going to get a good grade on it. If it's a gift for friends/family, give it to them with pride. If you're going to try to get it published, your chances are going to be good! And if you made it simply for your own enjoyment...enjoy!

Divide your paper into three sections.,
Provide a heading.,
Understand each section.",How to Write Information in a Cornell Outline Format1," Measure about two inches from the bottom of the page and draw a line horizontally. Then measure about 2.5 inches from the left of your paper. Draw a line vertically. Your template should now consist of three separate parts for note taking in class, in an upside-down T shape.


The Cornell outline is organized for almost any number of presentation formats to make scanning, locating, and studying notes easier.
The outline is also aesthetically pleasing compared to page-after-page of unending, and often needless, note taking.
You can find many Cornell templates online if you don't want to divide your own paper up.;
, As with all note taking, your notes should be organized chronologically and topically by placing a heading at the top of the outline for each page. Staying organized will save you time and effort.


Place the title of the lecture, the class, and date at the top of the page for easy reference. If you must take multiple pages of notes, make sure to add page numbers.

, The Cornell outline functions off of the 5 R’s: recording, reducing, reciting, reflecting, and reviewing. All three processes take place within the template you just created. Because this system can be applied to a diverse range of note taking environments it becomes a reusable and efficient system for studying.


The largest column of your template is the note taking section. This is the only section you will use during class to record notes.
The first column on the left, the cue column, will be used after class to help reduce your notes to key words and main ideas.
The bottom section, called the summary, is also used after class to reflect on the meaning of the notes you took in 2-3 sentences.

"
Remember that your first paragraph should be no longer than four or five sentences.,
Keep it clear and concise, yet detailed and specific when it comes to faculty and areas of potential research.

,
Don't tell the admissions committee how amazing you are.,
Use short anecdotes to highlight your strengths.,
Focus on your previous and future research experiences.,
Remember that a Statement of Purpose is only one, albeit extremely important, part of your graduate school admission portfolio.,
Apply to as many schools as you can afford.",How to Write an Effective Statement of Purpose," However, it should also give a summary of the entire Statement of Purpose. Many graduate committees will read your first paragraph to decide if the rest of your application is worth reading as well.

,, Avoid empty phrases like ""I'm talented,"" ""I'm very intelligent,"" ""I'm a great writer/engineer/artist,"" or ""I had the highest GPA in my department as an undergrad."" Instead, show them your worth through your professional Statement of Purpose and application portfolio and let them decide if you are amazing enough to attend their institution. Should you attempt to explain how amazing you are, make sure that you justify it. Yet, you must remain humble. For example: ""I believe that I have the confidence in myself to strive for the furthest goal.""

, After committee members have read a few dozen, all statements start to look alike; some specific and interesting details can help a candidate stand out. Of course, it helps if these anecdotes are related to the broad point you're making in your statement.

, Many students make the mistake of summarizing their CVs. Committees that bother to read your application know already that you're a good student; they now want to see whether you'll successfully make the transition to a more self-directed and unstructured form of learning in graduate school. They look for evidence of this in how you describe your past research experiences and your future plans. The key is not particularly the topic you propose--the committee will expect this to change after you get some more experience. Instead, they will look to see whether you have a realistic and well-informed sense of what a graduate student would expect to do to earn a degree.

, Carefully examine all the requirements on the university's admissions webpage before you submit an application.

, Four distinct Statements of Purpose for four different universities should be your minimum.

Prepare for lecture.,
Use smart note taking strategies.,
Focus on clues.,
Save time.,
Take accurate notes.",How to Write Information in a Cornell Outline Format2," Before the lecture, take time to complete your assignments, finish your readings, review your notes, and do some background work online for upcoming lectures in order to prepare yourself for identifying important information. In other words, being prepared for class is just as important as attending class. Not being prepared for lecture often equates to you trying to write down everything that your teacher says.


Usually assigned work is given in preparation for the lecture. Getting familiar with the overview of main ideas, support information, and important concepts will enable you to spend more time listening and participating in class rather than writing.
Recognizing key words, definitions, and ideas before class reduces confusion.
Preparation and taking fewer notes allows you to ask more questions, ever endearing you to your teacher.

, There is no single method suggested for taking notes in a Cornell outline format other than avoiding a formal outline. How you take notes will largely depend on what class you are taking. Since lectures move at varying speeds, it is best to be prepared on how you will take notes before going to class. Remember that during class, you are only recording notes in the large, right column. There are several techniques the Cornell method suggests:Write short, telegraphic sentences and phrases instead of long, complete sentences.
Write down key words. It's okay for these to be fragmented. For example, instead of writing ""America declared its independence from Great Britain on the Fourth of July, 1776,"" write ""Am. independence from GB - 4 July 76.""
Use symbols and abbreviations to cut down writing time.
Focus on recording testable information such as big ideas, important definitions, and key supporting details.
Stay organized by effectively using bullet points, skipping lines between ideas and topics, and writing clearly

, Every teacher has their own method of instruction but they teach in a way that focuses on content they want you to remember. Figure out the common clues your teachers provide by paying attention to specific cues. When a teacher repeats specific sentences, ideas, or concepts, it is important.
Tone of voice, large gestures, and strongly emphasizing a point usually leads to a potential test question.
If your teacher presents specific questions at the beginning of class or provides a summary at the end of class, it is usually important enough to be in your notes.
If your teacher begins listing things – first, second, third, etc. – write them down.
Excessive amount of time on a single point. Good idea that you get the point.

, Without fail, there are students who waste unnecessary time that could be better spent doing something else because they did not take good notes from the beginning. Take notes efficiently and accurately the first time while in class. Avoid going back to your room and rewriting your notes from lecture. This activity bears no fruit and doubles your troubles.
Forget the tape recorder or cell phone. Recording the lecture provides flexibility, but it is also passive learning. Not engaging in note taking usually means thinking about what’s for lunch.
Shorthand, if it still exists, is not a cool idea in an academic setting. Remember shorthand has to be transcribed, costing you time and effort with no mastery of the material.

, Listening to a lecture is important in gaining new knowledge, but in order to improve your study and work habits, write the notes down. Understanding what you hear in class does not equal to remembering it for the test. Taking notes enables you to retain important information and details that you will be required to recall at a much later date on an examination. The best way to remember is by putting large amounts of information into your own words, but be careful not to change the meaning or lose data.
Keep your notes short and condensed. Avoid long, drawn-out descriptions and full sentences.
Do not fear missing some information during the lecture. Teachers are usually looking for your ability to grasp large or comparative concepts and theories.
Try to consistently use the same kind of paper, writing utensil, and notebook.
If you missed something important, try to obtain the information as quickly as possible.
Review your notes regularly to achieve a lasting memory.

"
"
Reduce your notes by using the cue column.,
Ask yourself good questions by reciting and reflecting on your notes.,
Review your notes for the upcoming examination.",How to Write Information in a Cornell Outline Format3," After class, and as soon as possible, take time to reduce your notes by completing the cue column. The cue column is important for identifying key words or phrases that will trigger your memory to recall large amounts of information. Begin by highlighting key ideas, definitions, or phrases to identify what trigger words you will use in the cue column.
Create questions that help you recall the information in the note taking column. This active learning technique avoids passively staring at a bunch of trigger words and, instead, helps you anticipate questions for the examination.
If you are a visual learner, consider drawing pictures in the cue column rather than using trigger words.

, Taking notes, highlighting key phrases, and using trigger words is not always enough. Sometimes you need to ask yourself important questions and mull over your notes to digest all of the information properly. Place these important thoughts and answers in the summary column at the bottom of the page. Try answering questions about how well you understand all of the information. Could you teach the same lesson in your own words to a friend based on the notes you took?
The summary section should only be a few sentences that condense and sums up that particular page’s notes, not the entire days’ lecture. This should be completed at the bottom of each page of notes.

, After completing all of the above steps, you should have a ready-made study guide. As with any type of note taking, you should prepare for the examination a few days prior so that you do not cram. When studying, focus on the cue and summary columns. This is where all the important information should be located.
Try not to move on the next page until you have mastered the information on the page you are studying. If you are having trouble, then you might have to take extra time to review the actual notes you took before breaking down the information.
The Cornell outline method is not only designed to help you study better and get good grades but also to help your time management skills.

Have a daily plan.,
Give every day a theme.,
Segment the hours in your day.,
Learn how to multitask the right way.,
Set small goals.,
Prioritize task.,
Plan ahead.,
Put an end to procrastination.,
Use a stopwatch while you work.,
Designate mornings or weekends as “me” time.,
Do Homework.,
Disconnect during break time.",How to Work Faster," The most important step you can take towards working faster and more efficiently is to establish a plan before you start your day.Plan your day the night before and prepare your desk by laying out all your study materials, or prepare your chore list for what you want to accomplish. This way, you can just jump right in the next morning.
Write your daily plan down on a notepad, digital planner, or a calendar. Writing things down rather than committing them to memory will help you to remember and actually accomplish your tasks.
Writing down all you plan to accomplish in a day can also help you avoid over-booking yourself and taking on more than you can handle in the time allotted. It’s good to be ambitious, but it’s also important to have a realistic daily plan that you can accomplish.;
, If you find yourself juggling a lot of different work objectives or even multiple jobs at once, considering theming your days to focus on one of these at a time.If you’re a student, consider setting aside specific days for specific subjects: Mondays can be reserved for doing all of your science reading for the week, for example, while Tuesdays can be dedicated to math.
In an office setting, allocate specific days for specific tasks: Mondays can be just for administrative tasks, for example, while Tuesdays can be focused on creative projects.

, Stay organized by breaking down your working day into discreet hours, and plan to do certain work only during that time frame.For example, the first hour of your day can be dedicated to answer emails and phone calls.
Set a series of alarms to cue you to move on to other work and stay on task during the day. 
Lunch time can also double as working time, especially if you eat from your desk or take your computer with you out to lunch. This can be a great time to catch up on emails, while also grabbing something to eat. Multitasking at it's best!

, Multitasking can be a double-edged sword: it can be a helpful strategy for getting lots of things done in a short amount of time, or it can spread your time and attention too thin, leading to poor quality work.To reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls of multitasking, follow these strategies:


Focus on related tasks at the same time. Reduce the amount of mental energy used when switching between different tasks by bundling your multitasking activities together. For example, respond to all of your mail messages at the same time -- email, voicemail, snail-mail.Write down your workflow items. Writing down all the stuff you want to juggle will help you to not get distracted or sidetracked with all the multiple things going.Take some time at the end of your tasks to go over each item alone. This narrowing of focus can help with catching any errors and making sure you've done all you wanted while working on it in a multitasking atmosphere.

, Setting small daily goals helps you stay on task, work more efficiently, and gain energy as you go through your working day.Getting little tasks out of the way, like grocery shopping or running errands, can help you focus on larger tasks that need to be accomplished later in the day.
If you have long-term objectives or big projects, break them down into smaller goals that you can make progress on and tackle in a series of small steps or stages. This will help you feel like your getting work done, which will encourage you to keep going.

, Prioritizing tasks is not quite the same as making a to-do list. Rather, you are categorizing to-do items and prioritizing those that are small and manageable or most pressing and important.Set up a chronological list of when things are due or need to be done by. Start with the ones at the top of the list and that need to get done soonest.
Once these are off your plate, you can take a breather and focus on the one's that are due later.

, After you’ve mastered the daily short-term plan, you can start creating long-term plans to organize your future work and tasks.


Knowing what you need to accomplish ahead of time -- whether it's a big term paper at the end of the semester, or an international conference trip -- can help you stay on top of your preparations.Make a monthly calendar for yourself, or create a calendar for your entire school semester term.
Note any big deadlines or due dates and pencil in some reminders a week or so before the actual deadline. This will help you work more efficiently and get your big tasks done in easier increments.
This type of advanced planning will also help you schedule leisure actives, breaks, and vacations. If you know when things are going to be due, you can more easily plan around them and make sure you have enough time to get things done as well as thoroughly enjoy your break time.

, Many of us procrastinate or put things off (especially things we don't like) which can negatively impact our productivity as well as overall work quality.


Don't fall into the faulty misconception that ""one does their best work under pressure."" Psychological studies have shown this to largely be untrue!Procrastinators who wait until the last minute often get less done and produce work with more errors.
Pull the plug on procrastinating by turning off distractions. Turn off your internet while working so that you're not tempted to surf the web, check your social media, and fall into a black hole of cyber-distractions.Give yourself a carrot at the end of the stick: plan a celebration or treat for yourself when you complete your task on time or even early. If you have something fun to look forward to you'll give yourself extra motivation to get your work done.

, In business, there’s a concept known as “Parkinson’s Law,” which states that “work expands to fill the time allotted for it.”In other words, if you leave the amount of time needed to complete a task open ended, you will almost always take more time to complete it than if you set strict time limits.


Use a stopwatch or another type of timer to keep track of how long you work on each task.
Set goals for yourself and turn this into a game; you’ll work far more rapidly if you’re attempting to beat the clock.
Try to do unimportant tasks within ten minutes. Following this tip alone can often give you an extra 90 minutes a day. You'll be surprised how much time is wasted on unimportant tasks like writing emails!Working this way can help you develop a work “flow,” something that behavioral psychologists have described as a feeling of accomplishment, productivity, and happiness.

, It might sound counterintuitive, but you can actually increase your productivity and work ability by carving out some break-time during you day and week.Spending the first few hours in the morning on something you care about -- playing with your kids, taking the dog for a walk, doing yoga, etc. This can help clear your mind and put you in a better mood for the rest of the day, which will help you stay focused and work faster.
Research has shown that your mind reaches its peak performance rate 2-4 hours after you wake up, so designate your early pre-peak hours for something non-work related to avoid spinning your wheels and working inefficiently.

, School and office settings are not ideal places to get work done because they can be noisy and full of distractions. To counteract this, try taking some of your work home with you and finish it there in comfort and quiet., Sometimes our minds can be at work even when we’re not physically working, which can lead to burnout and an overall decrease in productivity and work quality.Set up separate personal and work/school email accounts and limit how often you check your work/school account over the weekend.
Make a point to turn off your phone or computer while lounging at home or watching TV so that you're not tempted to check your work email.
Try to be mindful and take some time to really switch off from your work worries, especially on the weekends, so that when you do get back to the grind on Monday you can be refreshed and ready to work faster and more efficiently.

Especially leading up to important examinations,remind the student of what you expect.,
Discuss the matter with the principal if things have become very poor.,
See if your child can change classes.",How to Help a Student Who Hates the Teacher," Use active listening technique and do not belittle the student's concerns. Do they feel like the teacher sneers at them? Do they have a clash of views or personalities? Does the student think the teacher is poor at their job?


Draw on particular instances or incidents that might have happened and work through them to lessen any negativity.;
, Add some of your own suggestions to help build on the solutions.

, If you feel that the student will continue clashing with the teacher and their studies will suffer as a result, speak to the principal or dean about making changes.

, Don't be aggressive or accuse the teacher as this will harden any resentment and make life harder for the student. Instead, ask for a meeting after school and explain that you are aware there are issues and you would appreciate the teacher's perspective and advice. Let them know that you are their friend as this will make them feel there must be good in the child and they will come to you with problems or queries, instead of taking it out on the child. See Build and Effective Relationship With a Child's Teacher for more advice.

, Many students and teachers clash because the student doesn't feel challenged or is overwhelmed. Give the child some revision notes and a textbook - try not to use what they use in class, as this will cause negative associations. Challenge the student and allow them to achieve goals. If the student is more enthused about the subject, feels confident in preparing for their examinations, realise the structure of the subject in preparation for exams and is being challenged by someone they like and respect, they are more likely to be tolerant in class. The level at which you will have to intervene will vary according to the severity of the situation in class.

, Do not tell the child that they are wrong for not liking the teacher or belittle what may be very real concerns and acknowledge problems but a constant stream of jokes and insults will only harden the student's attitude. Affirm that the teacher is trying their best, has made an improvement, is entitled to their own opinion etc.

, Be realistic. Troubleshoot the main things that provoke this particular teacher, such as being corrected. Ask the student to attend the class and to remain for the duration, to avoid giving cheek or correcting the teacher, to have homework completed, to be polite etc. If you are aware that they may be asked to leave the class or are likely to walk out, remind them of arrangement you have already made with the principal or other teachers, such as If you leave the class, I want you to wait outside the office until the principal can talk to you or When you're mad, you are to go down to Mrs. Reynolds room and she will let you have some quiet time until you feel better. In addition to behavioural issues, remind them of their academic goals, being realistic about what can be achieved. Set short, medium and long term goals, such as I will do my homework this week, I will achieve a C in the next test and I will work hard so I can go to college and become a nurse. Support them by doing work with them to bring them up to the required standard. Remind them that you expect a certain, achievable attempt, despite the difficulties they face.

, Inform him/her of what you are doing to improve the situation and arrange support which may vary depending on how serious things have become.

, If they have the option of studying in the back of another class it may be a good choice for all concerned. They may also have the chance to transfer to another grouping. Discuss your choices with the principal.

Wrap things up with a conclusion.",How to Write a Response Paper," Highlighting the text as you read it is not sufficient. You need to take notes on the material, and those notes need to be in your own words.


Highlighting draws your attention to words and passages you found significant in the text you read, but it does not allow you to record your initial thoughts regarding those passages.
Take notes on a separate piece of paper. Include paraphrases and quotes taken from the passage as well as your own thoughts about the information you write down.;
, Before you can build your own subjective opinion of the work, you need to understand the work for what it is. A response paper requires you to focus on your own interpretation of the text, but if you want to form a solid opinion, you need to have a basic understanding of the text itself.


Questions worth asking include:

What is the main issue that the author or creator is attempting to address?
What stance does the author take on this issue? What is the author's main claim or point?
Are there any assumptions the author makes in forming his or her claim? Are these assumptions valid or biased?
What sort of evidence does the author offer in support of his or her point?
What points of the argument are strong?
What points of the argument are weak?
What are some possible counterarguments to the claims or arguments made by the author?
What, if anything, makes the main issue or author's main claim important?



, This step is not always needed, but if you are studying a work within a broader context of works—the works of the author, the works of contemporaries in the same field who address the same topic, and so on—comparing the object of your response to those other works can broaden your understanding of the work and how effective it is.


Questions worth asking include:

How does this work relate to others within a collection of works on the same topic, or with regards to another work on a similar topic written by a different author?
Do the authors of comparable works agree or disagree?
Do the authors of comparable works address the same part of the same issue or different aspects of it? Do they view the matter being discussed in a similar or different way?
Does the author who wrote the piece you're responding to have past works that address the same topic? How has that author's views become stronger or weaker in comparison to past works?
Does the information from one text strengthen or weaken the text you're responding to, and if so, how?



, The best time to start prewriting for your response paper is immediately after you finish reading the text so that the ideas are still fresh in your mind. If you cannot do any prewriting immediately after, at least do some as soon after as possible.


Even if you think your ideas would benefit from simmering for a little while before performing a thorough analysis, you should still take the time to write down your initial reaction while it is fresh. In many ways, your initial reaction is the most honest. You can talk yourself into another reaction as time passes, and that other reaction may seem more “intellectual,” but your initial response was your true reaction to the text and should be kept in mind.

, A response paper is centered around your personal, subjective reaction to the text. You may have a general sense about how the text made you feel, but you need to analyze your own feelings regarding the work well enough to understand the underlying thoughts responsible for that feeling.


Questions worth asking yourself include:How does the text relate to you personally, whether in the past, present, or future? How does the text relate to the human experience as a whole?
Does the text agree or disagree with your worldview and sense of ethics?
Did the text help you to learn about the topic or understand an opposing view? Were your opinions or previous assumptions challenged or confirmed?
Does the text directly address topics that you care about or consider important?
Was the text enjoyable or admirable for its genre? In other words, if the text was fictional, was it enjoyable as entertainment or art? If it was historical, was it admirable from the perspective of a historian? If it was philosophical, was it adequately logical?
What is your overall reaction? Would you recommend the work to another person?


As you progress through these questions, write your answers down. In addition to writing down your answers and reactions, also provide evidence from the text to support these answers. Evidence can be in the form of direct quotations and paraphrasing.

, While it is true that a response paper is personal and that there is no single “right” response to have, you must do more than simply state what your opinion about a work is. Your opinion must be supported with evidence from the text. Sort through your reactions and thoughts and home in on those that have the most textual support.


There are multiple brainstorming techniques you can use to help you determine which ideas are strongest. Among these techniques, consider:

Re-examining your notes
Recording new ideas as they come
Using pro/con analysis
Raising questions about your reactions and using your notes from the text to answer them
Comparing your reactions directly to your notes and determining which topics have the most overlap



, A response paper is not a traditional thesis essay, but you still need to choose an area or argument to focus the majority of the paper around.


Depending on the requirements of the assignment, you may need to come up with one organizing argument or multiple arguments to discuss. Even when you have multiple points to bring up, however, they should still be somewhat connected to each other.
A key difference between a traditional thesis and an organizing argument is that a thesis usually exists to prove a point, fact, or thought. An organizing argument demands that the writer analyze the reading in an ongoing manner., You should use your introduction to identify the major themes or ideas of the work and to state your reaction or reactions to these themes.


For a four to five page paper, your introduction can extend to one or two paragraphs. For a shorter paper, though, restrict it to a short paragraph made up of three to five sentences.
Introduce the work by describing how the work to which you are responding fits in within the broader topic it addresses.
You could also introduce the work by explaining your own beliefs or assumptions about the topic the work agrees with before explaining how the work challenges or supports your beliefs.

, Your response paper should not focus on a summary of the work. There is some debate as to the proper length a summary should be for this type of paper, but as a general rule, the summary should only span half of the body paragraphs if not less.


For a four to five page paper, this section should only take up about two to three paragraphs.
Describe the content of the work and present the author's main arguments, especially as they affect your response.
The summary should be somewhat analytical in nature instead of a strict retelling. As you present the details of the author's work and argument, you should use an analytical tone and discuss how well the author managed to get those points across.

, This is the point at which you must explain how you react, on an intellectual level, to the work you are responding to. You can include separate paragraphs explaining where you agree and where you disagree, or you can focus on agreement or disagreement alone, and write out as many paragraphs as needed to cover your response.


Note that this response format is best to use when you are focusing on a single major theme or argument in a work. It does not work as well if you are discussing multiple ideas presented by a work.
Back up your analysis with quotes and paraphrases. Make sure that each example is properly cited.
If you took the time to find textual evidence to support your responses during the prewriting stage, this portion of your paper should be fairly easy. All you really need to do is arrange your argument in a coherent manner and write in the details of the support you have already gathered.

, At this point, you need to restate your stance to the reader and briefly defend the significance of your stance.


Even for a four to five page paper, you only need one standard paragraph to accomplish this. For a shorter paper, make this paragraph only three to five sentences long.
State how this work has a broader effect on you and to the genre or community in which it is a part.

, Create a short paragraph that introduces the major themes and ideas you plan to respond to. Also state or briefly indicate your reaction to these themes.


Your introduction can span one to two paragraphs for a four to five page paper, but for a short one to two page paper, keep the introduction down to a single short paragraph.
You can either introduce the work by describing how it fits into the topic it addresses as a whole or by explaining how it impacts your own beliefs on the topic.
By the end of the introduction, you should have mentioned your ""thesis"" or organizing argument.

, Your summary of the theme and how the text represents it should not take up more than one-third of the paragraph, and your response to it should fill up the rest.


Note that this mixed response format is a better option when you have many loosely connected themes or ideas you want to react to instead of a single overarching one.
This method allows you to weave your summary and analysis together more naturally and more cohesively. As you bring up a point or example from the text, address your own interpretation of that point directly following your mention of it.

, When using this format, you should aim to have at least three points to summarize and respond to in single-paragraph form.


Continue on as you did with your first point. As you summarize a point or argument from the original text, immediately follow it with your own intellectual response to the argument.

, Restate your stance or reactions to the text in a short paragraph. If desired or appropriate, explain why the matter is important overall.


For a four to five page paper, your conclusion should be a standard size paragraph. For a shorter paper, keep this paragraph down to about three sentences.
When appropriate, explain how the work has a widespread effect on the genre or community it fits into.

It is acceptable to take at least one day off. Go on and sleep in, play video games, and do whatever else you want. Refreshing your mind will help you study better later.;
, Gather up all the work you need to get done. Write these assignments out on a piece of paper. Keep this paper on hand to remind yourself of the effort you need to put in as you complete goals.

, Consider what subjects are going to be more difficult or work-intensive. If you have to write a book report, for example, get more of this work out of the way in the beginning so you’re not stuck at the end of the break with a stressful amount of work. Make these the first assignments on your list.Begin to formulate the order you’ll tackle these assignments. Alternate the subjects you study, possibly between easy and difficult subjects. Spacing out your efforts improves your memory., Get a calendar if you need a visual reminder to study. On the calendar, block out the time you’ll have each day. Decide what subjects you’ll want to study on what days. You don’t have to stick exactly to this, but setting a routine helps keep you from procrastinating.An hour a day for studying is a fair balance between doing work and avoiding burnout. You can add more time later if you feel like it.Try scheduling some fun activities around study time, such as playing video games. This keeps you disciplined by establishing a schedule with rewards.
If you can, schedule your study time for when you work best. You can do this by observing your habits during the day. If you’re most efficient during the morning, study then and leave less intensive activities for later.

, If you know what topic you’ll have to study after the break, now is a good time to look into it. If it is a difficult subject, break provides you an opportunity to read through the topic. Even if you don’t fully understand it, studying it now may make it easier to understand in class later.Read your textbooks or search online for information regarding your subject.

, Retreat into your bedroom, your kitchen, or another location where you won’t be bothered. Choose a place that has good lighting, a comfortable temperature, and minimal socializing. If you have to leave home in order to get work done, go to a place that’s comfortable, such as a coffee shop., The holidays include traveling, which leaves down time. Whether you’re flying home from college or riding with your parents to grandma’s house, you’ll be stuck in a car with minimal distractions. Bring your books or flashcards.


Again, set boundaries. Instead of getting caught up in conversation or other distractions, consider bringing along a set of headphones and your own music.

, It’s no good to get away from your siblings screaming during a sports game marathon if you’re distracted. You intend to check your email for a minute but end up browsing social media for hours. Turn off your phone. Shut off your computer.


If distractions are a big problem for you, install a phone application such as Offtime or a browser extension such as LeechBlock for Firefox., Chances are that while you’re at home, friends and relatives will interrupt your study time. It is difficult to refuse spending more time with them, but if you need to study, let them know.For example, you may choose to spend time with family or friends going to a movie but turn down their offer to spend time chatting afterwards.
Don’t fall into the trap of asking someone to help with flashcards. Often you’ll end up socializing instead of working.

, If you have friends who are busy with the same assignment as you, it can be beneficial to learn together. Work with them to develop a study schedule. Studying together lets you combine your efforts and makes studying more enjoyable. However, keep in mind that more people often means more distractions.If you know your friend is a procrastinator or has no interest in keeping to a schedule, avoid studying with them.

, Standing is healthy and once you’ve spent a little time sitting and working, take a break to refresh yourself. Go outside. Take a walk around the block or head to a library, park, coffee shop, or other area where you might like to study. This will give you some time to clear your head and let settle what you’ve read., Rewards serve as an incentive to work. Think of how you would have looked forward to opening a door on an advent calendar every day or being given a cookie for good behavior. Once you’ve finished studying, do something enjoyable such as eating a cookie, watching videos online, or having a glass of your favorite drink to encourage your efforts.If you don’t do the work, don’t reward yourself. If you reward yourself for no work, you’ll have less motivation to study.

, This is still your winter break, after all. Rather than burn yourself out on studying, enjoy yourself. Spend time with family and do fun activities. Giving yourself fun time between studying is beneficial in several ways, including allowing your mind to recover for your next study session and making you happier.


It’s important to space out your studying between relaxation. If you ever feel like you’re burning out, slow down your pace for the day.

, Your break winds down eventually but you’ll still be tempted to continue bad habits such as going to bed late. In the last week of break, start practicing the habits that will permit you to do your best in school. Go to bed at a reasonable hour in order to solidify your study efforts and keep your mind refreshed."

Determine why you want to quit.,
Identify other solutions.,
Find moral support.,
Write what you will say first.,
Practice with a friend or family member.,
Give yourself a pep talk beforehand.",How to Tell Your Coach That You Are Quitting1," Talking to your coach will be easier once you have defined the reasons why you need to leave. Perhaps you have an obvious reason, such as a medical condition. Maybe you’re just overwhelmed or stressed out by your duties. Being able to put your feelings into words will help you talk to your coach. Some reasons might be:


You have a medical condition or injury
You need more time to focus on school or work
You're not having fun anymore
You no longer have the time
You have family or personal reasons
The coach or teammates are bullies;
, If you are upset about quitting or if you are uncertain about your decision, there may be factors that can help you stay on the team. Think about your situation. Are there compromises that you and your coach can work out to help you stay on the team?


If you are quitting because the sport takes up too much of your time, perhaps the coach can cut back on practice hours, or perhaps practices can be rescheduled to fit more easily into your schedule.
If you have problems with other people on the team, ask the coach to mediate your arguments. Perhaps you can work out a solution together.
If you are injured, you can ask the coach if you can still attend practices and events on the sidelines until you have recovered. If you are not certain you will be able to play again, you can volunteer for other, non-intensive tasks such as water duty., If you can, it may help to ask others to back you up on your reasons for leaving. Perhaps they can provide you moral support while you talk to your coach, or maybe they can give you a signed note that explains your reasons for leaving.


If you are quitting for medical reasons, ask your doctor or therapist for a signed letter detailing your condition. They may state in the letter that they recommend you to stop the sport.
If you are quitting to focus on your studies, you can ask a teacher or professor to write you a note, stating that you need to spend more time on your schoolwork.
If you are in middle or high school, your parents might come with you when you talk to your coach. Explain to your parents why you want to quit, and ask them if they would be willing to help you break the news to your coach.

, You can prepare to talk to your coach by writing an outline of what you plan to say. You do not need to write a script; rather, jot down why you are quitting and how you might introduce the topic to your coach.Think about how your coach might respond to you quitting. Do you think they will be understanding? Are you worried that they will be mad? Try to plan for that reaction as you write your reasons. How might you respond to their objections?
Keep a confident but polite tone. Emphasize that you want the best for the team, but that leaving is the right thing for you to do now.

, A good way to build confidence before you meet with your coach is to practice your speech on a family member or friend. Ask them if they would be willing to talk you through the process.


If you cannot find anyone to listen to you practice, you can talk to yourself in the mirror.
You may not want to tell your teammates that you are quitting before you tell your coach. You want your coach to hear the news from you, not from locker room gossip., You may be nervous about telling your coach about your plans to quit. Before you have the talk, energize yourself with motivational sayings. These can give you confidence and ease your nerves.


You can say, “You’ve got this. Just tell them what’s up.”
You might remind yourself, “You will feel so much better once you have done this. You can do this.”
Try to frame the discussion in a positive light.You might tell yourself, “Imagine how relieved you’ll be when this is done. You won’t have so much stress every day to worry about.”

Then, talk to your teachers about their own classroom policies. Keep in mind that rules might vary between teachers: some might allow unrestricted laptop use while others might want to monitor your activities.


Almost all colleges allow laptops in class.If you are a university student, double-check the syllabus your professors hand out to read up on their policies. In most cases, you'll be allowed to use laptops for note-taking.
Follow the policies your teachers or professors set: not only does this show respect for them, but it also lowers the possibility of your laptop getting confiscated.;
, Ask them about advantages or possible disadvantages they've noticed while using a laptop at school. Tell them to be as open with you as possible so you get a good idea of whether this is right for you.


If you're young and no peers use a laptop to study, talk to a college student! Most universities allow or even encourage their students to purchase laptops. If you have older friends, let them know that you're considering a laptop purchase and listen to their thoughts.
If you're a college student, ask a laptop-using student before or after class about their experience. Let them know what you're considering and ask them if they have any advice for working effectively.

, Using a laptop at school or university can be a tough choice. Making a list of pros and cons beforehand can help you avoid major mistakes.Take time to reflect on both the positives and the negatives, and write both down on separate lists. This can help you clear your thoughts and make a more balanced decision.


Possible pros may include:

Easy access to resources during lectures
Taking notes faster and more effectively
No messy handwriting


Possible cons may include:

Potential for distraction during class
Cannot draw diagrams or visual references
Can be heavy/fragile and hard to carry around



, Open up a document page before class so you're ready to type once the lecture begins. If you think you will need any resources during the lecture (such as a dictionary), open up these tabs beforehand so you're ready to use them.


If you are prone to surfing the internet during the lecture, turn off your internet signal before the lecture starts. This way, you can give your complete attention to the instructor.

, One benefit of taking notes on a laptop is how efficiently you can work during class. Pay attention to your teacher or professor's cues, and concentrate on what they say. If they emphasize a certain point, make sure you type it down.If your professor or teacher writes on a whiteboard or prepares a powerpoint presentation, do not copy their words down exactly. You will be much more likely to remember their points if you type them down in your own words.

, If you organize your notes as you type them, you'll be able to access them while studying when you need them. The options for organizing your notes are limitless. Many handwritten methods adapt well to note-taking;marrying organization skills with a laptop's efficiency makes for notes taken quickly and thoroughly.


Experiment with various note-taking styles until you find what works for you. Every student learns differently, and you may find that one style works much better than another.
Keep all your lecture notes the same file folder so you know where to find them later on.Make sure to title file names as you go so you know where certain information is.
Title and date all your notes so you know which notes are from what lecture. This will help you remember which information was presented when as you study later.

, If for some reason you are unable to attend class, use your laptop to email instructors and receive information about upcoming projects or tests. You may even be able to video chat your instructors to discuss missing lectures or assignments.


If you're going to be gone for an extended amount of time, ask your teacher or professor if you could video chat via another laptop-using student during lectures. In this way, you can listen to and even participate in class discussion during long-term absences.

, Some academic websites include practice tests, study guide materials, or online flashcards.Use these materials as a supplement to your notes, and consider using your surfing time to visit educational websites. The more you use your laptop to learn, the better.


Through online academic forums, you can connect with other students who may be studying similar subjects to you. If you're stuck on a homework problem or want to discuss something related to your studies, consider making an account on an academic forum and seeing another student's perspective.
Listen to study music. Laptops can also provide study music while you work, which can help relax you. If you choose this, try limiting yourself to instrumental music.Music with lyrics can distract you and diminish your studying effectiveness.
Only listen to music or use study resources beyond notes outside of class. Using them in-class can distract your classmates and, if you are a younger student, cause your laptop to be confiscated.

, Use an online scheduler to remember dates like study group sessions or final tests. Check your online scheduler often and plan your daily routine the night before to prevent wasting time. Look at upcoming events at least a week in advance so you are prepared for important dates.

, With your instructor's permission, ask if you can organize an online study guide for upcoming tests using your typed notes and share it with others in the class. Those who have a computer can then add to the study guide from home and help each other prepare for the test. This can be an excellent supplement to in-person study groups and help you connect with your peers.Some professors and teachers do not allow online shared study guides. If your instructor says no, do not go behind their back and do it anyways. Doing so puts you at-risk for serious punishment, including laptop confiscation or even a failing grade.

, Keep your laptop clean, and wipe it down with a lint-free cloth if it gets dirty. Avoid drinking near your laptop, as one spilled coffee can be enough to short your keyboard beyond repair. Avoid bumping or jostling your laptop: if it falls, you may cause irreversible damage to its hard drive.


Consider investing in a laptop case.In your backpack, your laptop might move around and get damaged. A laptop case will keep it secure and protected as you walk.
Install antivirus software in case you accidentally visit an insecure website or download a corrupted link. Viruses can slow down computer performance and potentially jeopardize your personal information.

, Surfing the internet can be fun, but if you're not careful, you can waste a lot of time. You can get in trouble with your teachers at school, and your grades may drop if you're not paying attention to class lectures. Do not use your laptop for social media or games in class, and only visit relevant websites when necessary.


If you know you'll be tempted, turn off your internet before going into class and keep your note-taking file open. Reward yourself after school with thirty minutes of gaming time if you went through the whole day without distractions.
When at home, monitor your surfing habits. This will help you be more productive with your time and look forward to free time when it comes.

, Social media can be a big time suck. Schedule time you plan to spend on social media and use willpower to stay away from temptation. The less time you spend on social media, the more time you have to study without distraction.


Try planning no more than 10-20 minutes a day spent on social media. Any more can be a major distraction.

, Evaluate your habits and areas where you are more prone to distraction. Actively avoid situations that will tempt you and reward yourself for meeting daily goals. When you reach your goals, reward yourself for a job well done.


For example, if you spend a lot of time on Facebook and need to write an essay, promise yourself to avoid Facebook until your essay is done. Turn off your internet to avoid temptation and work until you are finished. When you're essay is printed, reward yourself with ten minutes on Facebook.
Set realistic goals. If you love playing online games, ""quit games cold turkey"" is not very realistic. Instead, try to limit your gaming time a little more each day until you have the habit under control.

, Sometimes noise can be distracting. Find a quiet place where you can collect your thoughts and work without stimulation. If you cannot find a suitably quiet place, invest in headphones and play soft music while you study.


Silence your phone while you study to avoid losing focus when you receive texts or calls.
Again, try to find neutral music with minimal lyrics or exciting rhythms. Piano music is usually a safe choice.

, Internet time can be overstimulating, and you may find it hard to focus if you spend too much time online. If you need to access your notes outside of school, consider printing out your notes or alternating how often you use it by class.


Laptops are useful tools, but don't neglect your textbooks. Consult your books first for any information, then turn to the internet as a secondary resource.

Prevent interruptions.",How to Work Effectively with an Online Tutor," Read through reviews and feedback to help you to work out which tutors are considered good value and who actually deliver what you're seeking. Be ruthless in determining this because not all online tutors will be good.;
, Remember that some tutors may be poorly qualified to tutor, so always ask for evidence of their qualifications and tutoring experience. Check whether he or she has been screened by the tutoring site, and has a proper background check. A certified tutor should have the proper exposure and experience in the field. Such a person is much better placed to understand your difficulties and will be sympathetic to your needs.

, Be frank and express your requirements and expectations. Discuss your doubts about what you're studying and see how this person responds.

, After being certain about your choice of tutor, be sure that the costs are within your budgets. Look for any hidden fees and make your payment in a secure way, asking for proof of payment, which is important for you should anything go wrong.

, Once you develop a rapport with your tutor, learning becomes a lot easier and is even likely to be fun. The best situation is when you look forward to spending time with your tutor, and learning more.

, This can help you to make the most of your online tutoring experience each time. For example, if you only have a single question, set aside specific minutes for this single question about your topic, subject or coursework. Perhaps you have a single problem or two in maths which you find difficult to cope with; in this instance, you could seek help through the site's live chat help mechanism, and pay only for the answers to these specific queries. In this way, you don't waste time on long tutoring sessions but you still get the necessary help for those specific questions which you find difficult.


Be sure that you're satisfied with the explanations given, checking that they're to the point. If not, speak up!

, Try to keep your queries ready before the scheduled time. This will allow you to make the maximum use of time. This can be done by focusing on targeted areas in the subject, where you find difficulties. Focus on the topic.


Be clear regarding the subjects in which you want help. Suppose you are experiencing difficulties in algebra––you need to seek specific help in the subject from an expert tutor in algebra. Take care of your priorities and schedule accordingly with the right subject tutor.

, While seeking homework help online for a subject, specify your queries clearly. Focus most of all on ensuring that the tutor understands your requirements. State any deadlines correctly and clearly, in order to get right replies on time, with proper explanations.

, It is good to share your homework with your tutor so that he or she can clearly see what is required. This will help your tutor to understand your difficulties.

, Keep your computer and other tech tools in good order, so that they're not going to cause disruptions during tutoring sessions. Interrupted relays in virtual learning spoil the experience of learning and can hold you up just when you most need the help.

Ask your coach if you can talk after practice.,
Tell them that you are quitting.,
Explain why you need to quit.,
Let them know how you might consider staying.,
Tell them when you plan to stop.,
Thank them for their help.,
Write the coach an email if you cannot meet.",How to Tell Your Coach That You Are Quitting2," It is good to set aside time when you and your coach can talk one on one. At the beginning of practice, ask your coach if they have a few minutes afterwards to talk. This will give them a heads up that you need to discuss something, and they will not leave immediately.You can say, “Hey coach, can we chat after practice today? I have something I need to discuss with you.”
If your coach tries to ask you what you want to talk about, tell them, “I’d like to discuss my future on the team. We can talk more after practice.”

, When the time comes, you should let your coach know directly that you want to quit. By stating it in a clear, confident tone, you will demonstrate that you are serious. You might want to let them know that you have thought this decision over carefully and that this the right decision for you.


You can say, “I’ve been thinking this over for several weeks now, and I think I have to quit.”
Another way you can say it is “It’s time for me to move onto other things. I need to leave the team.”

, You should give your coach reasons why you want to quit. While they may want to change your mind, by stating why you want to leave, you will demonstrate that you have thought this decision through completely.


You might say, “I have to focus on my other work right now. My grades have been slipping, and I need to focus on my GPA so that I can get a good job.”
You can say, “I’ve been having pains in my leg, and I went to the doctor. I have a torn meniscus, and I won’t be able to play for a while. I think this will give me some time to pursue some other interests in my life.”
If you have a doctor’s or teacher’s note, now would be the time to present it. Say, “I have a note from my doctor if that would help explain the issue.”

, Perhaps you are quitting because of a problem on the team or maybe your coach can accommodate some of your needs. If there is a reason why you might stay, you should inform your coach what it is. They may be willing to work with you to fix the issue.You might say, “I will be honest. I’ve had some arguments with members of this team, and unless we can work out something between us, I think it is best for us all if I go.”
You can say, “I need more time to study so that my grades do not slip. Maybe if I didn’t have to go to that extra weight training session on Friday, I’d be able to manage my time more effectively.”
If you have a “bully coach,” it may be best not to tell them that they are the problem. They may redirect their anger at you. Instead, let them know that you are quitting for personal reasons, and do not provoke them., It is good to let your coach know how much longer you are planning to be on the team so that they can prepare accordingly. Give them a date when you will no longer be on the team.


You can say, “I’m planning on staying for the rest of the season, but I will not be returning after that.”
Alternatively, you might say, “I can only stay on for another two weeks. I’m sorry that I have to leave in middle of the season.”

, Make sure that your coach knows you appreciate their hard work since you’ve joined them. A sincere thank you can show that you are grateful for their influence and help while you have played the sport.You might say, “It’s hard for me to leave, and I really appreciate all that you have done. Thank you so much for believing in me up until this point.”

, If you cannot tell your coach in person, an email is the best way to get in touch. You may find your coach’s email on a school, university, or league directory. If you cannot find your coach’s email, you might try writing them a letter. Give that letter to a teammate, who can pass it onto the coach.


It is not a good idea to quit in writing unless you are unable to talk to your coach in person.Perhaps you must quit suddenly and can’t go to another practice. Maybe you’re receiving treatment and cannot see your coach.
A letter might read: “Dear Coach, It’s hard to say this, but I have to quit the team. I’m sorry I could not tell you in person. I have to go home suddenly for personal reasons, and I will not be able to continue on this season. I’m not sure if I will be able to continue playing. Thank you for all of your support and hard work. I will always appreciate it. Sincerely, Trent.”
If you are in middle or high school, you might CC your parents on the email. Alternatively, your parents might write the email for you.

Bring someone with you.,
Use I statements.,
Stand your ground.,
Ignore abuse.",How to Tell Your Coach That You Are Quitting3," If you have a coach that is known for abusive or insulting behavior, you should bring someone along with you. The coach may be encouraged to use more polite language if someone outside of the team is there. You might consider bringing a parent, teacher, or friend.

, Avoid blaming the coach or using accusatory language. This might incense them further. Instead, use “I” statements to focus on your needs. “I” statements are sentences that start with “I”, instead of “you.” They can help defuse the tension.For example, instead of saying, “You always make us stay an hour late after practice,” you can say, “I do not have time to spend on my homework, and I need to focus on my studies.”

, Some coaches might try to persuade you to change your mind. Let them know that you are serious about quitting. Let them know that you have thought the issue over very carefully and that unless they can make serious accommodations, you will not be able to continue.


You might say, “I appreciate all this team has done for me, but I feel as though my time here is coming to an end. With my family situation the way it is, I need some space to handle my own personal life.”

, If your coach reacts with anger or abuse, try to shake off their insults. They may try to call you a quitter or guilt you into staying. Be firm and confident in your decision to leave.Say, “I am not a quitter. I just know my limits, and I have other things in my life I need to focus on.”


Some coaches might try to tell you that you are making a mistake or that you will regret your decision. You can respond, “I know this is the right decision for me now. While I might regret leaving, I also might regret not leaving.”

Know it and love it.,
Install all required software on a laptop at the beginning.,
Avoid distractions.,
Listen to instrumental music.,
Avoid surfing internet unless for academics.,
Limit your laptop usage.,
Note down your weak topics.,
Open your laptop and search for any help you need.,
Use the save session option in Google Chrome.,
Study offline.,

Don't forget extracurricular.",How to Use a Laptop Effectively As a Student," As a student you already know that you can manage your time for various different activities and excel in them, but as laptop enters your world of activities you should remember one thing: it's an infinite entity. Its resources never end. Be careful when including a laptop into your activity circle.

, This makes sure that you don't waste your time searching for other, unnecessary software. Here is a general list of required software:


Driver software, to make the laptop run smoothly and to avoid alternate software downloads for a particular function. Linux users need not do anything as the drivers are eventually updated or downloaded.
Antivirus, to make sure your operating system runs smoothly without any infection and to avoid wasting time on corrupted or infected files. Linux users are less prone to viruses, though should still have a scanner to check emails and files sent from Windows.
VLC media player, to make all types of videos formats run on your laptop and thus avoid wasting time searching for codecs for various video formats. You can also try KM player which is equally good as VLC, but lacks sound boosting when compared to VLC. Linux users can use Democracy Player to play and download music.
Adobe Reader, to read PDFs and to avoid wasting time on searching for alternate PDF readers. You can also try Nitro PDF reader, if preferred. Linux users can use the PDF Creator to create and access PDF documents.
Google Chrome, to allow faster and issue-free browsing. Mac users can try Safari or Firefox. Linux users already have the Firefox browser installed and are best suited for browsing.
Adobe Flash Player, to use Flash-related educational programs or .exe files.
Internet Download Manager, to speed up downloading.
Microsoft Office. This is the core for any study-related documents on your windows laptop. Linux users can use OpenOffice.org, which allows you to create Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files for free.
Everything. This software allows you to search your documents in less than a second and doesn’t take up additional memory unlike the indexing option in Windows.
WinRAR. Allows you to extract files or archive files. Sometimes PDFs are in archived .rar format and require use of this software. Linux users can use 7zip to extract archives or archive files.
A photo viewer or editor.

, Don't download any unnecessary files such as games or music. If you have any, delete them.

, Avoid listening to music with vocals, as you may start to write or otherwise focus on the lyrics! If you simply must have vocal music, play songs in a foreign language you don't know. Use headphones to listen to the music while studying; try recording your subjects by singing them to the beat of the music. You can then listen to them at any time by transferring them to your iPod.

, Try to minimize your surfing to once a week for 4 hours. This will keep you motivated for studying, as you will look forward to the time spent surfing.

, Try to get down to 90 to 120 minutes, so you devote more time studying books rather than studying on your laptop.

, Whether it's just a bit confusing or you don't understand it at all, mark it down.


Make a list of unclear topics under various subject headings. Make a ""doubt book"" and note down the weak topic under the respective subjects along with the page number.
Put in brackets what you need to understand about that topic.
Read from the presentation slides you learned from. This may help with some troubles.
Once a topic is searched, write an explanation in your textbook or notes near the topic in question so it is easy to revise. Alternatively, write explanations in the presentation slides or OneNote study notes.

, It's recommended to do this with the help of friends and teachers. In your doubt book, strike off or tick the topics you've searched for. At the end of the day, research any that are not cleared.


Bookmark important sites so that you don't have to search for them again.
If you get videos, download them using Internet Download Manager’s quick download auto-links. Many educational videos are available on YouTube. Videos serve a great deal of learning. Download videos for topics you are about to learn so you can understand the concept beforehand and impress your teachers and friends; and get an edge over the other students!

, As your time on the laptop comes to an end, save your tabs so you can easily check them later on. You can also right-click on a tab, select ""bookmark all tabs"", and follow the directions that pop up to save all tabs to a bookmark folder.

, Read the course material. Practice on the relevant software for your courses. Don't limit yourself to the internet.

, Plan everything. Doing so will guarantee that you have time for it all.

, Don't drag yourself down looking at other peoples' fun online only to remember that you're a student. Be productive.

, You never know your true potential unless you try it. Have you ever wondered why the best students have so many doubts? It’s because while doing research, they come to explore even more new ideas and doubts. Stay hungry for knowledge and you may end up being a student with great ideas and skills. This will help throughout your life.

, Make sure you don't spend more than the allotted time on your laptop, and divide it up. Don't use it all in one setting. This ensures that you don't get distracted, plus you won't get as many cramps from sitting in front of a computer.

, Always long for activities which are helpful in real life and are practical. Social media is an example of what to avoid. You start making more and more friends, you keep checking for notifications, you start to worry what will happen if you don't reply quick enough, you start playing games; but what you’ll lose is the time you spend on yourself. Remember that students are known for their knowledge and discipline and not for reaching level 600 on Candy Crush.

, This will allow you to use a USB-pen to take notes and explore various possibilities. It also enables you to do things faster than normal. Using a USB-pen and OneNote, you can create pictures, mind maps, presentations, etc. in seconds.

, No, not the ""what type of cookie are you"" type of test - do tests about your subject! Note down the problems you were not able to solve or concepts you were weak in and study them. Finish your studying before you go online to write an exam.

, You can also email them. This is one of the best usages of a laptop, as it allows the student to communicate even out of school. You can use Google Hangouts to group-chat with teachers and friends and discuss subjects, projects, etc.

, Laptops aren't just for testing. Extracurricular activities can help you get a job later on and give you something to look forward to. Here are some things you can use a laptop for:


Sports. Laptops can provide you an edge over increasing competition when it comes to sports and can increase your potential. Search for tricks and tutorials on YouTube or sports websites and practice them to develop your game.
Music. You can use a laptop very effectively to help your vocal expertise. The internet serves as the best platform for musicians. Download various songs and practice them on a karaoke software. You can also record music using software such as Audacity. Watch various videos on the subject. You can even learn a new instrument!

Dance. Watch videos and learn more tricks to improve your dancing. Tutorial videos can show you your mistakes. Use YouTube or other sites; there are plenty of them!
Gaming. If you want to pursue a career as a gamer then a laptop provides you with an ultimate edge. You can play and design games. To become a professional game programmer, you’ll need to play and design many games, but don't rush; you'll lose focus on academics. Doing things steadily will make you win the race.
Graphic design. Graphic design is very popular and requires hard work and patience. Use software such as Medi Bang, Photoshop, Gimp, or Paint Tool Sai. Again, don’t rush; this takes time.
Feedback. Perhaps the only good reason for using social media is feedback. Upload your work on social networking sites or on blog forums to get feedback from people, and thus improve next time you do something. Upload your videos on YouTube to share your ideas with the whole world or inspire people. People might sometimes ridicule or abuse your work; ignore them. Know the difference between helpful suggestions and hate.
Fashion. Look on brand-name websites and keep updated on the latest trends.
Software development. Software development requires two things: programming knowledge and a platform to experiment on. By reading free tutorials on the internet, you can learn C programming without even applying for a course. This takes even more time than art or game programming, however, so don't expect immediate results.

Cooking. This is the most important of all mentioned here. You will likely live alone at some point in your life, and fast-food restaurants get old quickly. Invest some time now; it may save you from health issues later.;

Use cognitive behavioral therapy for test anxiety.,
Undergo psychotherapy.,
Try CBT for classroom anxiety.,
Try group counseling.",How to Use Counseling to Overcome Academic Challenges1," Test anxiety is a very serious academic challenge. For those with test anxiety, it may not matter how much they study, the anxiety of taking the test will interfere with their performance. This can lead to failing or a low score. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help with test anxiety.Part of CBT is challenging negative thoughts. During counseling, you will learn how to identify negative and damaging thoughts that you have about exams. Then you will work on modifying those thoughts.
For example, you may think, “I am going to fail this test.” Through counseling, you will learn how to replace that negative thought. You may eventually be able to say, “I feel like I’m going to fail. Feeling is an emotion, not a fact. I am not guaranteed to fail. A fact is that I studied for this test.”;
, Psychotherapy can be used for any academic challenge you are facing. Psychotherapy is therapy or other treatment given by a mental health profession. Talk therapy may be helpful for any of your academic challenges, such as test anxiety, social anxiety, depression, or learning disabilities.Using talk therapy allows you a safe, supportive environment to talk about your academic challenges. You can confront your feelings and work through them.
Since test anxiety is a real problem that stems from a specific kind of anxiety disorder, psychotherapy may be helpful. You may learn to identify any underlying reasons why you have test anxiety.
Psychotherapy may be helpful if you have behavior issues, anger issues, or feelings of isolation or depression due to a learning disability or mental condition.
Go see a professional therapist or you can talk to a counselor found through your school.

, You may have social anxiety that causes you to feel uncomfortable talking in class. You may feel like everyone is going to think you are stupid, or that your teacher will tell you you are wrong. You may just feel horribly embarrassed. In counseling, your therapist can teach you cognitive behavioral therapy strategies to deal with this anxiety.Through CBT, you will learn how to recognize your irrational thoughts and learn how to challenge them and replace them with positive or healthy thoughts.
For example, you may be afraid to speak in class because you think everyone will think you are an idiot. With CBT, you will learn how to challenge that thought by asking yourself, “Am I a mind reader? Can I tell the future? No. So, I cannot know if they will think I’m stupid.” You may ask yourself, “What is the worst thing that will happen if I say the wrong answer? The teacher will correct me, and I will continue listening in class. No one will laugh at me because no one laughs when other students get answers wrong.”, Group counseling is a treatment technique where you go through a therapy session with other people who have a similar issue as you. The session is facilitated by a trained mental health professional. Group counseling gives you a safe place to discuss your problems and meet others who have similar issues as you.You can learn from others as they discuss how they have faced or overcome obstacles. You can also gain support from them or offer support since you are going through similar things.
You can go to group counseling for many different issues, such as social anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, ADHD, and anxiety, among others.

Undergo counseling to determine the source of academic problems.,
Try counseling if you have behavioral problems.,
Undergo speech counseling.",How to Use Counseling to Overcome Academic Challenges2," Sometimes, there is an underlying reason why you are having academic difficulties. It may due to a condition like ADHD, autism, or OCD, or it may be due to a learning disability. Counseling can help you determine any problems you have so you can learn how to overcome them.For example, counseling may be able to help you identify if you have dyslexia or memory difficulties. Then, through counseling, you can learn specific skills about how to cope with your problem and how to be successful in school.

, If your academic performance is suffering because of your classroom behavior, counseling may be able to help you. There might be an underlying mental condition, such as OCD, ADHD, or autism, that is affecting your behavior. If you are angry about something or act out for attention, you can talk through your feelings in counseling.You can use talk therapy to identify and explore your feelings. You may be able to uncover why you feel the need to act out. If there is a reason behind it, such as feelings of anger or loneliness, the counselor can help you learn to cope.
If you have a behavior disorder, the counselor can help you learn how to manage the disorder.
Using CBT may be helpful in changing your negative classroom behavior., Approximately one fourth of students suffer from speech and language disorders. If you have a speech and language disorder, you may have trouble speaking in class or to teachers and peers, you may struggle to understand or process information, and you make struggle when reading. Receiving counseling from a specialist can help you learn how to overcome your disorder so you can perform better in school.Counseling will involve cognitive reorganization, memory retraining, language enhancement, and improvement of abstract thinking skills.

Find a counselor who works for you.,
Set realistic expectations.,
Schedule and keep regular appointments.,
Complete any assignments in between your sessions.",How to Use Counseling to Overcome Academic Challenges3," It is important to find a therapist who is equipped to deal with your situation and who you feel like you can trust. Therefore, you may need to talk to a few different therapists before you find one who really works for you. The most important thing is to find a therapist who makes you feel comfortable, so pay attention to how the therapist makes you feel.If you are in high school, check with your school counselor. You may be able to meet with your school counselor on a regular basis or your school counselor may be able to refer you to someone who has experience helping students to overcome academic challenges.
If you are in college, contact the counseling center at your university. Most universities have counseling centers that employ trained and licensed mental health professionals. Many schools include access to counseling services as part of a “Student Service Fee” that is charged to all students, which may entitle you to a certain number of sessions.When you call, ask about counselors who have experience helping students with academic challenges.

, Although counseling may result in significant improvement in your academic performance, you may not go from earning all C's and D's to earning straight A's. It is more likely that your improvement will be subtle and gradual.


For example, after a few months of counseling, you may notice that your GPA has risen from a 2.4 to a 2.7. Or, you might notice that after using some of the strategies your counselor has taught you, you improved your math quiz score average from 60% to 80%.
You might also notice little things, such as being able to retain more of the information that you read or hear in class, or feeling less overwhelmed by your schoolwork.
Keep in mind that counseling takes time to take effect. While using the strategies that you learn in your counseling sessions may provide some immediate benefits, you may not see the effects of these strategies for a few months. Try to be patient as you continue to attend counseling and use the strategies that you learn., Maintaining a regular counseling schedule is essential for continued growth. Make sure that you schedule and keep your counseling appointments. Do not stop going because you feel better or because you think it is not working.


Remember that it is important to be consistent with your therapy and follow through with the process so that you can achieve your academic goals.
If you find yourself wanting to skip a session or stop going altogether, consider your reasons. Did your last session make you feel upset? Are you worried about what you might have to talk about next? Try to figure out the reason you want to skip or quit and tell your therapist about it., Some types of therapy require you to do some work outside of the counselor’s office to work on changing certain thoughts and behaviors. These assignments can help you to develop new thoughts and behaviors that can help you to overcome your academic challenges. Your therapist cannot do this work for you, so it is up to you to make sure that you complete any assignments.If your therapist gives you an assignment to complete before your next session, then make sure that you complete the assignment. The assignment might be a writing exercise, a self-affirmation, or something else to help you become more aware of your thoughts and behaviors.

Learn relaxation techniques.,
Practice positive self-talk.,
Learn effective study skills.",How to Use Counseling to Overcome Academic Challenges4," Relaxation technique may help you work through academic challenges. Whether it is test anxiety, social anxiety, an inability to focus, or something else, relaxing and reducing your stress can help refocus your brain. Having a clear brain can help you perform better academically. A counselor can help teach you stress relieving techniques that you can do at school or at home to prepare for school.Relaxation techniques that you may learn in counseling includes deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery and visualization, and meditation.
For example, guided imagery is a technique where you visualize yourself in a non-stressful place. This helps you calm. You can also use guided imagery to help you visualize positive outcomes and success.

, Another thing you may learn in counseling is how to overcome damaging and negative self-talk. These statements are the ones where you mentally put yourself down, calling yourself stupid or something similar. Through counseling, you can learn how to stop using this abusive language with yourself and instead use positive self-talk.For example, you may tell yourself often, “You are so stupid.” Instead of this kind of damaging self-talk, your counselor will help you learn how to be less critical and nicer to yourself. You will learn how to change that phrase into something like, “You are not stupid. You studied and you will pass this class” or “You have a learning disability, but that doesn’t mean you are stupid. Your brain is different, and that is okay. You are still smart, and you can do this.”

, One thing you can learn through counseling to help with your academic challenges is effective study skills. A lack of study skills may lead to poor academic performance, lowered self-esteem, and feelings of inferiority. By getting help with your study skills, you can work to improve your grades and performance.Many school counselors will help teach you study skills. It doesn’t matter if you are in middle school, high school, or college.
You may be able to get information about good study skills in one counseling session, or you might meet with a school counselor multiple times to discuss your progress.

Know which materials are most authentic.,
Inspect the cameo for cracks.,
Look at the direction of the face.,
Observe the facial features.,
Note the type of pin.,
Take detail into account.,
Weigh the cameo in your hand.,
Look at the finish.,
Inspect the back.,
View the cameo in strong light.,
Use a strong magnifying glass to look for marks.,
Feel the temperature.,
Test the hardness.,
Poke the cameo with a hot needle.,
Examine the cameo for surface paint or enamel chips.,
Ask yourself how new it looks.,
Check the cameo under magnification.",How to Tell if a Cameo Is Authentic," Authentic carved cameos can be made of shell or natural stone, while authentic painted cameos are typically made from porcelain.


As a general rule, any carved cameo made from a natural material can be considered authentic. Some of the materials used include shell, agate, carnelian, onyx, ivory, lava, coral, jet, bone, mother of pearl, and various gemstones.
A cameo is referred to as being non-authentic or fake if it has been made with plastic or resin.;
, Hold your cameo up to the light. Regardless of the material and the age, you should see no chips or cracks in the foundation material.


Soft plastics chip easier than shell, porcelain, and stone do. Hard resins are fairly chip-resistant, though.
This speaks more to the cameo's value rather than its authenticity. A chipped cameo might be real, but these signs of damage will cause its market value to decline.

, The majority of antique cameos will have a figure facing right. After that, a leftward facing figure is most common, followed by a forward facing figure.


Since figures on authentic vintage cameos can face in any of these three directions, this alone is definitely not an indication of authenticity.
If you have other reason to doubt whether or not the cameo is real, though, the fact that the figure faces left or forward instead of right, as is most common, could give you further reason for doubt.

, An authentic cameo will have high-quality figures on it. The natural curves of the chin and mouth should be reflected in the design, and the figure will usually have rounded cheeks.


Portrait cameos that have a straight nose are usually from the Victorian era.
Portraits with strong, ""Roman"" noses are usually dated before the 1860s.
A nose that looks ""cute"" or button-like usually indicates a newer cameo created in the 21st century. If the nose is turned up and the features are flat, it could be a sign that the cameo is fairly modern and likely created with lasers, making it non-authentic.

, Flip the cameo over and look at the pin on its back. An antique or vintage piece will usually have a plain ""c-clasp"" on it.


With a ""c-clasp,"" the brooch pin loops under a crescent shaped piece of metal. There is no roll-over fitting there to keep the end in place.

, While some authentic cameos are plain, many valuable antique pieces will include finer details on the carving or painting. These features usually include things like earrings, pearl necklaces, loose curls, and flowers.


Note that some detail can actually indicate when a piece is fake. For instance, many laser cut imitations have a faint white band near the outer border of the piece.
Some authentic cameos will be set in 14K or 18K gold frames. Silver and gold filled metal frames are also common. This is not always the case, however, and many have no settings at all.
These frames may also be further decorated with valuable stones, but this, too, is not always true.

, Plastic and glass cameos tend to be set in heavy base metals. As a result, they are usually heavier than shell and porcelain cameos.


This is not always true, however, so weight alone is not a good indication of authenticity.
Many stone cameos are naturally heavier than their shell and porcelain counterparts, as well.

, Turn the cameo in your hand and observe the way the light hits it. A real shell cameo should have a matte appearance rather than a glossy one.


This is true of most carved cameos, in fact, since many natural materials are difficult to buff after being carved.
Some authentic stone cameos might be slightly shiny, however, so this is not a foolproof test.

, Hold the cameo face down and brush the back with your index finger. If the cameo is made from real shell, you should feel a slight concave or curve.


Shells have a naturally curved surface, so a cameo carved from a shell will usually have this curve, as well. The curve might be slight, though.
This does not necessarily apply to natural carved cameos made from stones or other materials, though.

, With the back of the piece facing you, hold the cameo up against the sunlight on a particularly bright day or up against a strong artificial light. You should be able to see the entire silhouette if your cameo is made from shell.


Note that this is not true of most stone cameos.
While somewhat rare, some plastic cameos are similarly thin and may show the silhouette, as well. As a result, this is not a foolproof test when done on its own.

, Inspect the front of the cameo with a very strong magnifying glass or jeweler's loupe. You should be able to see faint marks made by the carving tool around the carved portions of the piece.


This is true for all naturally carved cameos.
Carve marks will usually follow the lines and curves of the design. Scratches that do not appear to follow these lines are usually just scratches and should not be perceived as an indication of authenticity.

, Hold the cameo in your hand for 30 seconds or so. A real stone or shell cameo will feel fairly cool, but a plastic piece will quickly warm up due to the temperature of the room and the heat of your skin.


You could also hold the cameo to your wrist or chin. These areas are generally a little cooler than the palm of your hand and may give you a more accurate indication.

, Gently hit the cameo against your tooth and listen for the sound it produces. It it sounds dull or hollow, it is likely made from plastic.


In contrast, a cameo that sounds fairly solid is likely made of stone or another natural material.
Be careful when performing this test. Do not strike the piece against your teeth too hard since doing so could damage your tooth or the cameo.

, Heat a sewing needle over a small flame or under running water, then poke the needle into the cameo. It will easily melt soft plastic but should not damage shell or stone.


Note that many modern resins are too hard and will not be melted that easily, though, so the test may not work.
Work carefully to prevent an accidental burn while handling the hot needle. Wear heat-proof gloves or hold the needle with plastic tweezers.

, Examine the paint or enamel on the decorated front surface of the piece. The number deep scratches and chips should be few, if any.The quality of paint and enamel used by vintage artisans is usually more durable than that used by counterfeit manufacturers nowadays. Real cameos were made to last, so the design should be fairly intact.
This is also an indication of value. Scratched designs cause the value of the cameo to decrease.

, Even though the damage to the cameo should be minimal, an authentic piece will not look new. Expect to see faded colors, a few light scratches in the paint, and other signs of wear.


As a general rule of thumb, if the painting and the piece itself looks sparkling new, it probably is.

, Use a magnifying glass or jeweler's loupe to examine the front and back of the piece for signs of lighter, less obvious wear.


Even though there should be few scratches that are obvious with the naked eye, you should be able to see some faint scratches all along the surface under this sort of magnification.

Ask questions when needed.,
Identify important elements of the lecture.,
Review your notes after class.,
Use a laptop to take notes.,
Use an audio recorder in class.,
Skip words, not numbers.,
Use color for emphasis.,
Use a form of shorthand.",How to Take Perfect Math Notes1," If you aren’t certain about something your teacher said, or didn’t understand the way something was presented, make sure to raise your hand and ask for clarification. The best notes in the world can’t help you if you don’t understand what you’re taking notes on. Remember that the objective is to learn, so don’t be afraid to ask questions.Some professors may ask for you to hold your questions until after the lecture. Make sure to write them down to help you recall what you wanted to ask when the time comes.
If you aren’t comfortable speaking in front of the class, try approaching your teacher after class to clarify things you are unsure of.;
, In order to take effective notes, you will need to learn to pick out the important portions of what your teacher or professor says during their lecture. Disregard conversational material and focus on things your teacher places an emphasis on during class. Make sure to make note of any new topic, questions you have, and anything the teacher places a large emphasis on while covering the course material.If there was assigned reading prior to the class, make note of anything covered in the lecture that differs from how it was presented in the book. Your teacher likely wants you to follow the methodology taught in class.
Things teachers write out on the board are usually important and should be considered when note taking.
Make sure to record new topics, formulas needed to solve equations, and anything the teacher suggests is important.

, Taking great notes can help you to retain information in the first place, but studying for an exam or test should always include a thorough review of your notes. You should always go over your notes again after class, then refresh your memory by reviewing them once more before a test. You may also want to compare notes with a classmate to help ensure you both took down all of the important information.Studies have shown that after a week, you can usually only recall 35% of what you learned in class. Retention and recall can drop as low as 21% after two weeks.
Reviewing your notes or going over them with a friend can refresh your memory and help to ensure you retain more of the course material.

, Some people may prefer to use their laptop for note taking rather than writing by hand. If you feel as though you could write faster or take more efficient notes using a laptop computer, you should consider doing so. Some teachers and professors don’t permit open laptops in their class, so make sure laptop use is permitted before you start.Laptops can help you to organize your notes and even type them faster in some cases.
Make sure you don’t allow yourself to get distracted by using other applications on your laptop during the lecture.
You may want to ensure the laptop you use to take notes in math class has a keypad to record numbers faster.

, It can sometimes be hard to keep up when taking notes in class. Using an audio recorder during class can allow you to revisit portions of the lecture that you may have missed, or listen to the entire class again while you’re studying to help clarify topics or refresh them in your mind.If your teacher or professor does not address the use of recording devices ahead of time, you may want to ask them before recording them.
Digital recorders often allow you to transfer recordings to a computer to better control which portions you want to listen to.

, When taking notes, it’s perfectly normal to skip unnecessary words, use abbreviations or even come up with your own shorthand. However, don’t allow yourself to skip steps when writing out how to complete math problems, or copying them from the board.Although you may know how to complete a problem in class, you might have trouble remembering how to in the future.
Writing out all of your work will help you to recall each step in the future.

, There are a number of ways you can incorporate different colors into your note taking methods to emphasize the importance of sections or to help you organize your notes. Use different colors to write titles, draw lines between sections, or to help you pick out important elements.Use a highlighter to highlight important things as you take notes or after class when reviewing them.
Try different colored pens for titles or to add emphasis to sections.
Use markers or colored pencils to make colorful divisions between topics or sections.

, Sometimes the concepts you need to take notes on in math class involve more than just numbers and equations. When your teacher or professor is going over concepts that require you to take notes that aren’t math problems themselves, use a form of shorthand to limit how much you have to write.Try leaving out unimportant words. An example could be, instead of writing “Pythagoras made influential contributions to mathematics,” try simply writing, “Pythagoras was influential.”
Use abbreviations and punctuation to reduce your writing. Your notes only need to make sense to you, so feel free to use + (plus) signs instead of the word “and,” km instead of kilometers, or any other abbreviations you can easily understand.

Divide your pages into three equal columns.,
Title each page clearly.,
Use the left column for key words and topics.,
Copy math problems in the middle column.,
Take notes in the right column.",How to Take Perfect Math Notes2," Unlike the Cornell Method of note taking, the three column method is designed specifically for use in math classes. You will use each column for different kinds of content in order to better organize your notes.Draw two lines from the top of the lined section of the page to the bottom with a ruler, diving the page into three sections.
You may want to use a marker or different colored ink when drawing your dividing lines in order to help them stand out.

, You will need to write information at the top of each page to make it easier to locate the sections you are looking for and organize the material. Use the area at the top of the page to write the following information for future reference:Course Title
Topic
Page number (if there is a coinciding page in your text book)

, The left hand column of your notes should be reserved only for main points that you can associate with content in the following two columns. Keep the notes you take in the left hand column brief. Think of it as subject headers.Notes in the left hand column should be short and provide a title of sorts for information you’ll be writing in other columns.
You may want to record formulas in the left column that coincide with ones you use when writing problems in the middle column.

, Use the middle portion of the page only to copy or work on math problems. When copying math problems off of the board, make sure to write down each step your teacher uses, so you can go back and model your work after it in the future. When doing the problems yourself, ensure you don’t omit steps you complete in your head, so you can refer to it again if you forget how in the future.Mark math problems you are unsure of with a question mark, then ask your teacher or a friend with help with them during or after class.
Make sure to align your work with the appropriate title or main points in the left hand column.

, The remaining column will be used to take down notes that explain steps, or help you to better understand the topics and problems covered in the other two columns. Use your own words to describe what you did to complete a problem.The right hand column can be used to write down anything you feel you need to remember.
Try to keep the information in each column aligned with the corresponding material in the other columns.

Divide your pages into three sections.,
Label the top with the course name, date and topic.,
Take notes in the large box on the right.,
Review your notes after class to pull out the main points.,
Summarize the main points of each page in the bottom box.,
Review your notes.",How to Take Perfect Math Notes3," The Cornell Method of note taking involves organizing information into three sections. Dividing your note sheets makes it easier to write down and to retain information for when you take a test. You may want to use a marker to draw the lines that divide your page to make them easier to see while note taking.Draw one horizontal line across your page five lines from the bottom.
Draw one horizontal line across the top line of the page.
Draw a vertical line connecting the two about two inches from the left margin.

, When reviewing your notes, it will be easier to identify the sections you want to focus on if you write large, bold titles at the top of each page. The title section should be written across the top line you drew, and include the name of the class you’re taking notes in, the date, and the topic you are covering in class that day. Some examples of a title section would read:Algebra 1 – 6/4/2016 - Two-variable Linear Equations
Geometry – 8/1/2015 – Transversals
Calculus – 10/10/2014 – Chain Rule

, During the class, take short hand notes by copying main points your teacher writes on the board or writing important things your teacher says. Try to use abbreviations where possible to reduce how much you have to write, and leave a blank space between each new idea. This is also where you will copy down or work on math problems. Try to keep each topic and the math equations they involve together in your notes. Leave the other boxes blank during class.Keep your notes brief and simple. Only write as much as you need to in order to remember the main points.
All of your note taking in class will be within that large box on the page.

, After class, sit down and go over your notes again while the information is still fresh in your mind. As you read through them, identify the main ideas, points, dates or topics in your notes and list them in the left column you created with the vertical line.Try to list the main points in the left column alongside where the notes relating to them are in the box on the right.
If you need to, draw lines connecting the main points to the notes relating to them.

, Below the bottom horizontal line, summarize the material you took notes on above. Use your notes, as well as the main points you wrote on the left to help you.Writing a summary of the information on each page will help you to recall the content in the future.
You can read the summaries to help you find specific topics in your notes, or as a study aid.

, When you complete the summary of your main points, look back over your notes and make sure you didn’t leave anything out. Your notes should have main topics, important terms, and formulas in the left hand box, your in-class notes in the right, and a summary of the material covered on the bottom of the page.The left hand box might say things like, “Linear Equations,” as well as an example such as “ax+b=0.”
The right hand box would contain all of the notes you took in class, including any equations you solved.
The summary box at the bottom may say something along the lines of, “ax+b=0 is considered the standard form, and not all equations will start as such. The variable could be X, but may be indicated as a different letter.”

Find an appropriate dictionary.,
Read with your child.,
Explain to them what a dictionary is, and how it can be useful.,
To start teaching them how to use the dictionary, start by just letting them look at it for a minute.,
Next, explain that the dictionary goes by the alphabet.,
Ask them to read you the definition.",How to Teach Children to Use a Dictionary," It is difficult for children to learn straight out of you favorite full-size Merriam Webster dictionary, so make sure you have a children's dictionary. It is best if the dictionary has pictures, color, clearly labeled headings, and an easy to read font.;
, Find a book that is slightly above their reading level, and ask them to read it to you. When they stumble on a word the don't know, ask them what they think the meaning is. If they say 'I don't know', help them to use context clues first. If they still cannot work it out, then get the dictionary.

, Depending on the age of the child, say something like ""This is a dictionary. It is a helpful book we can use when we don't know the meaning of a word or we don't know how to spell something.""

, When they start to get bored of this, go back to the unfamiliar word and ask if they think the dictionary can help them to find out what it means. Encourage them to say yes.

, Ask them what letter their word begins with, and then help them to find that letter in the dictionary. Then explain that you have to find the second letter of the word, and so on.


For example, if their word was reptile, help them find the letter r. Then tell them to find the 're' section. Keep doing this ('rep', 'rept', etc.) until they find the word.

, Now they know what the word means. Go back to the book, and keep reading, until you have found three words they need to look up. Do this everyday and they will soon be able to use a dictionary by themselves.

Take a short nap or relax.,
Do some light exercise.,
Take a shower.,
Use caffeine appropriately.,
Have a snack.,
Hydrate yourself.,
Find a good place to study.,
Try to focus.,
Set goals and time limits.,
Avoid distractions.",How to Study when You're High," Go and sleep for a little bit. If you're wired and can't sleep, try to relax. Either way, make sure your alarm is set for 20-60 minutes so you don't lose track of time. Taking a short nap or spending time relaxing will refresh you. If you're high on marijuana, it will help you shake off some of the grogginess associated with your high. If you're amped up and wired from something else, trying to relax will help you focus. Your mind will become crisper and you’ll be able to think clearer.


Find a place that is cool and dark.
Use some white noise, if it helps you.
If you can't sleep, try to eliminate distractions while you rest and focus your thoughts. By calming your mind, you'll put yourself in a better place to study later.
Set your alarm clock or phone alarm so you don’t wind up sleeping all day and night.;
, Another great way to sober up so you can study is to do some light exercise. Exercising will help get your juices pumping, and combined with eating well and hydrating, should give you a burst of energy and make you more alert. Consider:


Exercising might make your high more intense (in the short term, about 15 minutes).
Exercising will help you focus your mind better.
If you're amped up on something, exercise will give you a positive outlet for your extra energy.
Going for a short jog, perhaps about 10 minutes long.
Doing some jumping jacks or pushups., Taking a shower is a great way to help you get into the right mind frame for studying if you’re high. This is because showers freshen us, wake us up, and recharge us. In a way, taking a shower is a way of starting your day anew. Consider:


Taking a cold shower if you need to “shock” yourself into waking up.
If you're wired, taking a shower will relax you and help you focus.
Don’t spend too long in the shower. The key is not to relax, but to freshen yourself up a bit.
Try to spend just 3-5 minutes in the shower, then get to work., Depending on what you're high on, you'll want to use caffeine appropriately. This is important, because if you don't use it appropriately, you could undermine your attempts to put yourself in a better position to study.


The best thing you can do to get rid of that nasty grogginess brought upon by marijuana is to get energy. To do this, drink some coffee or a 5-hour energy.
If you're amped up or wired from another drug, avoid caffeine at all costs. It'll simply reinforce the high that you're trying to fight.
Be aware that caffeine doesn’t necessary cancel out a marijuana high, and it may actually make you feel higher than before. As a result, only use caffeine if you know how it affects your body and yourself when you are high., Many drug users know that food can often help bring you down. This is because when you eat something, your body will start to metabolize that food, which will help your body breakdown and metabolize any chemicals that might be making you high. However, when taking this approach consider:


Don’t eat too much. You don’t want to get overly full and then feel sleepy from that.
Don’t eat too many carbs or sugar. Carbs and sugar might pep you up right away, but after a short while you’ll wind up crashing and you’ll be groggy and muddled again.
Avoid eating only meat. Eating only meat, depending on the meat, might make you groggy again.
Eat a well-balanced snack that includes vegetables, fruits, some carbs, and protein.
If you're high on an upper, it might hurt your appetite. Try to overcome this by eating something. Chances are, it'll help., Drinking lots of water and other non-alcoholic liquids will help you sober up a bit so you can do some work. Hydrating yourself works for a number of reasons:


Like with eating food, drinking liquids will help get your juices flowing and your metabolism pumping. This will help your body move THC and/or other chemicals out of your system and help you to become more alert.
Hydrating yourself helps in detox in the long run.
Consider drinking liquids that are rich in vitamins like vitamin C, D, or B-12. These vitamins will help wake you up and make your more alert., You need someplace good to study effectively. This is because environment is extremely important when it comes to concentrating. If you are on a couch or in your bed, the likelihood of you not studying increases tenfold. You might fall asleep or get distracted by something. Consider:


The library.
A desk at your home or in your bedroom.
A coffee shop or other public place that is peaceful and quiet., One of the biggest challenges when it comes to studying when high is focusing on the task at hand. You could have many challenges. It might be hard for you to read a paragraph through and process information. It might be difficult for you to do complex math problems. In order to overcome this problem focusing:


Continually remind yourself of the task at hand.
When reading, use a pencil to keep track of where you are and to underline and make notes. You might find that doing a close read while high is actually not so bad – if you commit yourself to focusing.
When writing, continually remind yourself of your thesis or the point of your paper. You might find that you can write much more (volume wise) while under the influence. However, the quality might be lower than normal. This is okay. Write a lot of volume and then go back later (when sober) and clean it up., Make sure you set concrete goals for what you’re trying to study. In addition, set a time limit on each section of what you’re studying. This way, at least you’ll be able to move through large amounts of subject matter rather than getting bogged down on a certain topic because you lose focus.


Start by mapping out what you need to cover in a certain amount of time and then divide your time up between the material.
If you are studying chapters 4-7 give yourself an hour to study each one, but no longer.
If you don't complete the chapters as thoroughly as you wanted to, then give yourself an hour for two chapters, and if you still feel that way after, give yourself an hour for the four., One of the most common problems with studying high is that you’re easily distracted by a wide variety of things. In order to overcome distractions, you need to shelter yourself away from common distractions. Don’t make yourself vulnerable to things that can take your attention off of studying. Consider:


Avoiding the internet, if you don’t need it.
Turn your cell phone off.
Study in a place that does not have TV
If you have to listen to music, make sure it is something that is conducive to studying, like classical music, jazz, or something instrumental."

Be here now.",How to Study Well," Water is the elixir of our bodies. Having a glass of water available while studying will help fuel your concentration during studying. Staying hydrated can benefit your memory as well.;
, Treating your body well is half the battle of entering the right mindset. There are certain foods you can eat that will improve your focus and your general well-being. Studies show that eating high-carb, high-fiber, slow-digesting foods like oatmeal are best for the morning of a test. The food you consume the two weeks leading up to the exam are just as important and affect how well you study. Eat a well balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables.Incorporate superfoods into your diet like blueberries and almonds.

, This system controls your heart and blood path. Part of healthy studying is a healthy flow of blood to your brain. Studies have proved that 20 minutes stimulating this system improves your memory. Don't feel obliged to go on a run if you don't want to. Bust a move in your living room to your favorite dance track. Let this be your time to unwind and alleviate stress during your study break.The main thing is to get your heart rate up. Once it is faster, continue doing an exercise for at least twenty minutes.

, Getting a full nights rest (at least 7-8 hours) helps motivate you to study. If you are sleep deprived, studying will feel like a chore. You won't learn nearly as much information sleepy as you will after a good night's rest.

, After planning out when the best times are for you to work, follow through. Set aside a chunk of time every day for studying. Even if your exam or presentation is two weeks away, a little each day goes a long way.

, It's common for students to memorize what they know they'll be tested on, but it's not as efficient. Understanding what you study increases your chances of retaining it. You might not care to retain trigonometry past your final exam, but in the long run, you will.Create links to what you are studying. Establishing connections to what you are studying to your everyday life is not always easy. This is a skill that you can improve over time. Spend extra time using your imagination to draw links from what you're studying to aspects of your life., This is one of the best techniques you can use in studying that stretches across almost every subject. The act of writing out the information onto the card begins your brain's focus onto the subject. Once you've finished you can test yourself for an extended period of time, and then let others test you.


If you read the definition side of the card and quiz yourself on the term, switch sides. Force yourself to give the definition or formula to the word or concept.

, Some people may find this excruciating because they already spent a fair amount of time creating the notes in class. Rewrite your notes by adding more information to them. Don't just sift through your notes mindlessly transcribing them. Use external sources like a textbook or an assigned essay.This is a good way to study because it requires you to take an extra step past reading your notes and textbook. Reading, thinking, and writing are all ingredients to an efficient study session.

, After spending a decent amount of time studying, between 45 minutes to an hour, take a quick break, 10-15 minutes. This is a tried and true learning method. After your break revisit what you were previously working on as a test. Revisiting subjects after distancing yourself will reinforce the materials into your brain.Don't watch a television program or play a video game on your break. You might become too engaged and distracted to go back to work. Try walking the dog or go out for a quick run.

, After studying for your allotted chunk of time, test yourself during the last 20 or 30 minutes. This is a good way of reviewing everything you just went over and will cause the concepts you've learned to sink deeper into your brain. Textbooks often have practice tests at the end of a chapter. Try your best to go through one of these even if it isn't assigned.You don't need practice tests to test yourself. You can always use your hand to cover up definitions or parts of your notes. Then say the idea of what you've covered up out loud.
If you're wrong, go through the correct answers.

, Cramming, or studying extensively the night before, doesn't work. Most people need a few days to review their notes for the information to really sink in.By cramming, the information you're memorizing will not be retained. Ignore those who claim to cram for everything. Sometimes people are freakishly good at testing and school. Don't compare yourself to them! Everyone is different and you'll need to do whatever fits your needs.

, In class it's important to write your assignments down.When your teacher tells you about an exam next Friday, write it down. Place a note about the exam for each day until the exam. Writing down your assignments will reinforce homework into your mental to do list.


An organized schedule for your school work prevents you from being overwhelmed.
For it to work, you need to use it everyday and look at it every time you sit down for homework.

, Different people like to work and read at different parts of the day. Try out a few time slots to figure out when you're most productive. It's common for students to take a small break after school and then study. Take time to have a quick snack and then sit down to study. If you finish your work in the afternoon, you can relax in the evening.Some people find it more beneficial to work on homework and study at night or early in the morning. This all depends on your schedule and habits.
If you're committed to sports or an after school activity, you'll need designate your time to study carefully. It's easy to blow off studying after an intense training, so be aware.

, You need a desk or a table with a decent amount of space. You will also need good lighting. Students will often say that listening to music, having the TV on, or keeping their phone out helps, but these are all distractions. If you can't work in silence, listen to ambient music instead of music that's lyric driven.


Avoid reading textbooks on your bed. The temptation to sleep is too great.
Studying outside of your house can help you focus. Changing the literal room of where you study can improve your retention rate.Try visiting a local coffee shop or a nearby library. It depends on your preferences.

, A lot of people benefit from participating in study groups. These can be extremely informal and are usually very effective. You don't need to be a lone wolf when it comes to academics. Humans are social creatures. Even if you feel that you don't know as much as these other students, you should still try it. You'll find that you do have something to contribute to the group.


Studies show that those who prepare for exams studying in a group have higher passing rates.

, There are four different types of learners: visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. If you're a visual learner, you might need to highlight your notes. If you're an auditory learner, you may need to make a song out of your notes. If you're a kinesthetic learner, you might need to act out your notes.


Your learning style is a big part of studying success. If you're not studying in a way that complements your learning style, the information won't sink in as well.
You need to at least study 2 and half hours everyday. So you need to study 30 minutes for each subject you have.

, In the classroom, you should be ready to learn and not view it as a time to clown off. Sit in the front row, if you don't have assigned seating. Avoid classmates who like to joke around in class. This attitude will sink into your study time., Concentrating on one subject for an entire study session can be counter-productive. If you can do it, power to you. Vary what subject you are studying. This will freshen your concentration by fixing your eyes onto a new topic., It can be the hardest thing to do in today's world of distractions. If you begin to feel like you're not being as productive, say to yourself, ""be here now."" Then slowly focus back to what you were studying. It might sound gimmicky, but reminding yourself in this way could help. It doesn't work for everyone.Say this with a deep breathe while your eyes are closed for a deeper calming effect.

Make writing a daily practice.",How to Teach a Child to Write," Give your child crayons specifically made for younger kids, and let them color. Younger kid's crayons are usually smaller and wider (more like a pebble than a stick), so they are easier to grasp.Just like any part of the body, kids need to build up muscle and dexterity in their hands before they learn to write.If it's a nice day, take it outside. Use chalk to color on the sidewalk.;
, Using macaroni or large beads, string them on yarn to create wearable art. The act of picking up pieces and stringing them works on dexterity.For this project, lay out the noodles in a bowl on the table. Cut a length of string. Thread a noodle onto the string, and tie the noodle in place on one end with a knot.
Place the string back on the table, and proceed to create a string for each kid.
Let your kids thread noodles on their respective strings, and then tie them off to create the necklace.

, Let them have fun playing around with the dough. Their creations don't need to be perfect--just let them create what they want with the dough.Working with Play-Doh and other clay builds up hand muscle and dexterity.

, Give your child a spray bottle to water the household plants. Ask the child to go around the house and give each plant some water. The action of squeezing the bottle builds up muscles in the hand., Give your kids finger puppets and ask them to come up with a story about them. Have them act it out with the puppets on their hands. You can demonstrate first if your kids seem confused. Moving the puppets increases dexterity and coming up with a story encourages their imagination., Any kind of cutting activity helps strengthen their hands and increase fine motor skills. Just be sure to give them safety scissors so they don't hurt themselves.To make snowflakes, fold a piece of paper in half horizontally. Fold it in half again, but do it vertically.
Fold it in half several times, always keeping one end without any folds. You should have a triangle shape that is misshapen on the non-folded end.
Cut shapes in the the paper. Angular shapes work best. Also, make the unfolded end regular by cutting along the edge in a design. Open the paper back up for a snowflake.

, Kids love stickers, and playing with them also encourages dexterity, as they must employ fine motor skills to peel them off the paper.Make sure to give kids paper to place the stickers on. Otherwise, the stickers will end up all over your kids and the house.

, Let her work with half a broken crayon, as that will encourage her to grip it in her fingertips instead of resting it against her hand., You should use a tripod grip. A tripod grip relies on the pointer finger, thumb, and middle finger to support the pencil equally., Holding it too tight can hurt your kid's hand over time.Signs of this problem include ripping the paper and white knuckles.To help a kid loosen his or her grip, place a small lump of something, such as Play-Doh, in the palm of his or her hand while he or she writes., Help your kid to understand how much pressure is needed. Too much can break crayons and pencils but too little means you won't be able to read what your kid wrote., The easel will hold the paper in place for the child, plus it teaches him how to hold his wrist for writing., Letting your kid write in shaving cream on a tray or pan will make the process more fun. You could also use whipped topping or pudding., Roll out lines to make letters with your kid. You can begin with their name to make it more interesting or go through the alphabet., To keep this less messy, try putting finger paint in a gallon zip-top bag and sealing it well. Be sure to squeeze out as much air as possible. Then your kid can trace letters on the outside of the bag., Write letters on the concrete with a hose or water gun. Your kid will be amazed at how fast the letters disappear. Just be ready to get wet., Give your kids letter blocks, magnet letters, or rocks with letters painted on them, as all of them encourage letter recognition in your child. These types of toys also help build dexterity and muscles., Ask your kids to identify letters when you're out places, helping them to see what letters make what sounds by saying the word out loud.

, When you see something that looks like a letter, point it out to your child.As an example, half a pretzel looks like an ""E,"" while the top of a cup looks like an ""O."", Write your kid's name on a paper in large letters with a marker. Help you kid trace the letter with her finger. You can then move up to having her trace it with a pencil., Write your child's name in light lines or dots so she has to connect them herself.Show her how to go over the letters with her pencil. Guide her hand the first time she performs the task.

, Let your child copy the letters of her name rather than trace them. This process will reinforce the letters, as she actually has to learn the shapes. When tracing, she might just follow what you did, but now she has to recognize and redraw the shapes herself., For instance, an ""A"" could be a house with two levels, while a ""Y"" is a person with their arms outstretched, yelling. Making it more fun will help your kid remember the letters and keep him interested., Have them write out the family's names, or teach them to write the words for their pets. Copy words from a favorite story. If your kid loves a particular story book, have her copy the words for practice., Phonemic awareness is the knowledge the words are made up of sounds.Look for words with similar beginning sounds. For instance, you could say ""Tent starts with a 'T.' What other words have a similar sound at the beginning?"" You can help your child along by giving him a few examples.Try rhyming games. Say a word, and see if your child can find a rhyme for it.Read aloud to your child, pointing to words as you go.

, When you're child is trying to write, make sure she has a visual reminder of the alphabet in upper- and lowercase letters., You can find writing worksheets for free on the internet. These worksheets will help your kids work on letters individually, as each worksheet focuses on one letter. It will show your kids how to write them, and it will include areas where they will trace over the letter and areas where they must write the letter themselves. Some of these worksheets will also have words that begin with the letter., When a child is having trouble making a letter, write the letter yourself but not on the sheet your child is working on. Tell your child what you're doing as you go.For instance, when writing an ""A,"" you can tell your child, ""First you make a slanting line upward. Then, you start from the top of that line and make a slanting line downward. Next, you go to the middle of your first line and draw a small line over to the other side.""

, That is, focus on certain letters, and teach them the sound that coordinates with them.For instance, you can say, ""'T' makes a 'tuh' sound. Can you hear it in words like 'tuh-able,' 'tuh-op,' and 'tuh-rycycle?'""

, Give kids a good foundation by helping them spell the words they commonly use correctly.Teach your child to spell phonetically. Let them sound out words and write down the spelling as they think it sounds. Start with words that contain letters they already know the sounds for, which will help them make connections.Help them learn the correct spelling by having them re-write a word after they've spelled it out themselves.

, For instance, some worksheets encourage kids to write what's going on in a picture, while others give them a prompt to write their own story., Group words with similar patterns together, and have your kids learn to write them. One way to help them is to encourage them to use the words in a story., Let your child learn by what you do. As you make sentences, your child will learn to put words together, too.You can take it one step farther by having your child ""play along."" That is, if you're writing a note to a friend, let your child write a not to her friend., Engage your kids in their environment by asking them to describe it on paper.


For example, give them an object to describe, such as a cup, and set a time limit. When the time limit is up, give them another object to describe that seems dissimilar, such as a cucumber. Let them describe it within a set limit. As the final part of the exercise, have them write about how the objects are similar, which asks them to make connections and engages them more fully., Give your child exercises that encourage him to write creatively, which makes it more fun.


As an example, try putting a number of unusual words on strips of paper, though they should be words that your kid already knows, such as ""tissue,"" ""frozen,"" ""flame,"" ""stroke,"" and ""fanning."" Let your kid pick a couple of words from the group without looking. Have her write a poem that incorporates all the words., Encourage your child to write everyday. Let them use their imagination to make stories that go along with their pictures. As your kid continues to connect meaning with letters and words, his or her spelling will improve.One way to encourage daily writing is to have your kid start a journal. You can ask your kid to write about what happened that day, or you can use prompts to help her along. As an example, you could ask her to write about one of her toys and why she likes it or to discuss a dream she had the night before."

Review your syllabus.",How to Study in One Day," Study somewhere away from distractions, such as your bed or your friends. Going to a new physical space will allow you to focus solely on the task at hand.


Make sure to find a place where you will not have to move for a while. A quiet room, library, or coffee shop are ideal options.;
, Make a list of your study essentials before you leave so you do not forget anything. This may include your textbook, notes, computer, snacks, post-its, highlighters and anything else you may need.


Make sure not to bring anything that may distract you.

, Unless you need it to study, try turning off your phone for long periods at a time while you study. This will allow you to be focused for longer without stopping, and reduces the chances of you getting distracted.

, With such a limited amount of time, it is probably best to study alone. However, it is sometimes helpful to work with a small group in order to compare notes and talk through concepts together. If you decide a study group will help you, make sure to choose classmates who are at least as smart as you so they don't slow you down. Be careful of studying with friends. It is easy to get distracted if you are only studying with good friends. Make sure your study group has some members that you only know from class. , If you don't have your own, make sure to have a copy of the notes from someone who you trust. Re-reading your notes is important, but it is not enough. Go over and highlight key words and concepts or use post-its to signify important sections.


Try writing summaries of your notes for each chapter or major concept. Write them in the simplest terms on a separate piece of paper. These summaries can help guide your study day.
Read your notes out of order as you review them. This will allow you to make sure you know each piece of information on its own, rather than part of a series.

, Make sure you are saying the information out loud as you review it. It will be easier to remember if your brain is hearing and pronouncing and not merely reading the information. Try teaching a chapter or concept to an imaginary student. This will force you to fully articulate the subject. It will be clear whether or not you have a handle on the material if you try to explain it to someone else. You can also do this with a study group or partner.

, As you prepare lots of last-minute memorization, it will be helpful if you use some memorization techniques.


Re-writing information over and over again may help it stick in your brain. Make sure to copy the fact or idea at least three times for this method to work.
Use mnemonic devices. Mnemonic devices are techniques that help your brain retain information. Creating rhymes, acronyms, and songs that you can associate with the material will help you recall it.

, Write terms and their full definitions on a set of notecards. This will allow you to test yourself throughout the day. They are also useful on the day of the test, as you can review them on the bus, or in line for lunch. , Simply re-reading your textbook will not help you retain information, especially when you only have one day to study. Look for chapter summaries and bolded keywords as you review and pay attention to chapter introductions and conclusions, as they usually contain essential summarizing information.


Look for review questions at the end of chapters, or in the back of your textbook. It is important to be testing yourself whenever possible to better gauge what you still need to work on.

, A study guide is an effective way to force you to review all your material. It can also be useful to look over the day of the test for a quick refresher. Type out a list of all the material you need to cover, including key terms, dates, and concepts. Next, go back and fill in each area using your notes, either typed or handwritten. Putting these ideas into your own words and writing them out will really help cement them in your mind.


A friend or classmate may have created their own study guide which you might be tempted to borrow when you are short on time. However, the act of creating your own study guide will force you to put the information into your own words and copying out the material will help it stick in your mind.

, Even with a time crunch, you need to make sure you prepare properly for the test depending on the format that it takes. Refer to the syllabus or your class notes to establish what format the test will take. If you are unsure, be sure to contact a classmate so you are studying for the right thing.


For multiple choice tests, questions will usually be geared towards smaller details and facts, as well as vocabulary and definitions. There may also be questions about sequences and steps. Questions that ask about the similarities and differences between things are also common on multiple choice tests. While it may be difficult to memorize all the tiny details with a limited amount of time, focus on specific areas rather than attempting to conquer the entire subject. For essay or short answer tests, you will be asked to have a good understanding of wide themes and ideas. Try preparing a few sample questions based on the textbook and syllabus. Time yourself for 15 minutes and write out a detailed outline for each question, as if you were going to turn it into a full essay. Be sure to memorize some key terms and examples that you can use for support in your essay questions during the actual test.

, Make sure you're clear about what you are being tested on. This may include date ranges, specific scientific theories, or mathematic equations. If you are unsure, as a classmate to verify what material you are being tested on. This is essential to your success, especially with such little time to lose.

, Divide up the hours in the day and decide what you will focus on when. Make sure you allow yourself time to sleep.

, Review the syllabus or any handouts given to you by your teacher. Figure out exactly what is being covered and create your own list of the material you need to review.

, Make sure that you are allowing yourself frequent breaks so that you do not burn out. Consider working for 45 minutes, and then taking a 15-minute break. During your break, feel free to check your email, use your phone, or get up and walk around.


One way of creating a break schedule for yourself is the 50/10 method. Study diligently for 50 minutes, without distractions. Hold yourself accountable. If you stop or get distracted, restart the 50 minutes. Once you have had a completely undistracted 50 minutes, go on a 10-minute break. This will force you to be much more productive when you are studying.

, Create a list of the major theoretical or categorical concepts, and make sure you understand them. As you are studying last minute, it is most important that you understand the largest concepts first. While you may be tested on small details, it is first important to grasp the large theories in order to give yourself a context for the smaller facts.


Organize terms and facts according to these larger groupings. This is a technique called ""chunking."" It is easier to memorize individual concepts when you are putting them in relationship to a greater whole , Usually, your teacher hands out a syllabus at the beginning of the year or semester detailing all the material that will be covered in the course. Refer back to the syllabus to ensure that you have not missed any areas of study.


You can also use the syllabus to guide your study. There is a good chance that your professor organized the material in a specific way to guide your learning. Use the syllabus to help you find ways to look at the course material from a larger perspective, and figure out how to best organize this mass of information.

Create a good study space.,
Stick to a study schedule.,
Have specific goals for each study schedule.",How to Study Harder1," The first step to studying harder is to create a study space for yourself. Studying in the same space each day is effective because your mind will learn to associate a particular space with work. It'll be easier to get into the flow of studying when entering your study space.


Students who spend time struggling to find a space to study often waste valuable time. Having a space you go every day to study is helpful.Choose a study space that is free of distractions. Find a space away from television and other noises. You should not study in bed or on the couch. Choose a place with a desk where you can sit upright to work.Make sure the space is set up for what you need. If you need to prepare a class project with lots of small pieces that must be arranged, a large, uncluttered space with a worktable will be best. If you just need to read your textbook, a cozy chair and a cup of tea may be just fine.;
, Once you've found a great space to study, create a study schedule for yourself. Having a regular study sessions will help you avoid procrastination and stick to your goals as a students. You should start planning your study schedule as you get your course syllabus -- that way, nothing will sneak up on you.You should strive to prioritize studying. Place study time ahead of extracurricular or social activities. Try to study shortly after class or school each day.Schedule study sessions at roughly the same time each day. Having a regular schedule can help you stick to studying on a regular basis. Put these sessions into your calendar, just as you would a dentist appointment or soccer practice.Start slow. At first, keep your study sessions between 30 and 50 minutes. After you've gotten used to this duration, push yourself to study for longer periods. However, stop to take short breaks occasionally. Studying for hours on end can cause stress. Take 10 minute breaks as you study.Don't go longer than 2 hours without a break., Studying without direction is not an effective way to learn and retain information. Go into each study session with specific goals in mind to try and make the most out of your study session.Keep your overall academic goal in mind. Branching off of that goal, break it down into manageable chunks and focus on each chunk per session.For example, say you have to memorize 100 vocabulary words for your Spanish final. Aim to memorize 20 words per session over the course of 5 study sessions. Make sure to review old words at the beginning of each new study session to make sure the information stays fresh in your mind."

Gather everything you need.,
Choose a good location.,
Find a spot that's comfortable.,
Consider the lighting.,
Avoid obvious distractions.",How to Study Outside1," Before you head out into the sun, grab everything you need for a study session of decent length. You don't want to have to head back inside because you forgot something.


If you'll be reading, it's a good idea to load several e-books onto the same device. This makes your homework more portable, and ensures you don't run out of things to do.Bring a snack and a water bottle. Hunger and thirst can be distracting and will eventually send you off in search of sustenance.;
, Choose a place to study where you feel safe and comfortable. There are lots of good places to study outdoors, each of which can have advantages and drawbacks.


A park or common area of your school can be a great choice, because it's free. The downsides here are that there can sometimes be too much activity going on around you, and you often end up sitting on the ground, which can get uncomfortable after a while.
A cafe with outdoor seating is a good option because you get to work at a table, and if you start to get hungry or thirsty, you can order something to eat. The downside here is that you usually MUST order something, so this option costs a bit more. Some cafes also won't want you to stay for a long time unless you keep ordering things.
Your own backyard, patio, deck, or balcony can be a good choice, because you have more control over your environment than in a public place. However, if you're looking to get out of your house or make this a social experience, working just outside your own back door may not satisfy those wishes.

, Bring a blanket to sit on and spread your study materials out, if you want. You can even bring a lawn chair or a cushion to sit on.


Sitting on the ground can get uncomfortable after a while, and that can make it hard to focus on your studies. So, make sure you find a spot where that won't be a problem.Don't get too comfortable, however, or you may fall asleep.You may not want to stretch out on your back with a blanket and pillow.

, Natural light can be great for studying. It can help you stay focused and calm, and can even decrease the likelihood of headaches.This is a real perk of outdoor studying.


Pick a place where you'll get plenty of light, but where you won't be blinded. The sun on the white paper of your textbook pages can be a bit much, and can also make screens hard to read. Pick a spot that works for you, and bring your sunglasses!
If you are going to study in direct sunlight, make sure to put on some sunscreen first. Partial shade is often your best option.

, While studying outside can help you avoid certain distractions you might find indoors (like your video game system or a pile of dirty dishes), it can come with its own set of distracting problems. In choosing a spot, try to avoid any obvious distractions.


The park can be a great place to study, but setting up right next to playground full of screaming children or an off-leash dog area can it make a lot harder to keep your focus.

"
Test yourself.,
Start with the hardest subjects.,
Use study groups effectively.,
Seek out help when you need it.,
Take breaks and give yourself rewards.",How to Study Harder2," A vital part of studying is repetition. Test yourself on difficult material during each study session. Make flashcards with vocabulary words, dates, and other facts. Use these to test your knowledge. If you have a math exam, do practice tests in your math book. If your teacher or professor provides practice exams, take as many as possible.


Try to make your own practice tests. Review the types of question your teacher asked on quizzes and try to replicate them in your own words. Make a test for yourself, containing 10 to 20 questions, and then complete the test.
If your teacher provides practice tests to help you study, take them home and do them on your own time.
Start well ahead of time and bring in your practice test to show your teacher. Ask her something like, ""I've gone through my notes and made this practice exam to help me study for the test next week. Could you tell me if it's on the right track?"" Your teacher isn't likely to tell you whether or not specific things will be on the test, but she will probably be happy to tell you whether you're studying the right areas. And your hard work and preparation are sure to impress!

, The most difficult subjects require the most mental energy. Start with this work first. After completing harder materials, studying easier subjects will feel a lot less stressful., Study groups can be a great way to maximize your studying experience. However, keep in mind that you need to use study groups effectively in order for them to have the best effect.


You should structure study groups as you would an individual study session. Choose which materials to focus on and have set timeframes and breaks. It's easy to get distracted if you're working with groups of people. A schedule can help you stay on task.Work with people who you know are hard workers. Even the best planned study groups can fall apart if you choose to work with people who are distracting and procrastinate.

, Remember, there's no shame in asking for help if you need it. If you are continually struggling with a particular subject despite diligent studying, seek out help from another student, a tutor, a teacher, or a parent. If you're a college student, there might be free tutoring centers on campus dedicated to helping students with a particular subject like writing, language, or math., As studying is seen as a chore, allowing yourself breaks and rewards can help motivate you to study harder. Take breaks every hour or so to stretch your legs, watch television, surf the internet, or do some light reading. Provide rewards at the end of study sessions to motivate yourself to work harder. For example, if you study 3 days in a row treat yourself by ordering take out."
"
Prepare your body and mind before studying.,
Study with the right mindset.,
Use memory games.,
Rewrite your notes.",How to Study Harder3," If you go straight from school to studying, you may feel burnt out and struggle to concentrate. Taking half an hour to prepare your mind and body for a study session can help you study more effectively.


Go for a short walk before beginning to study. Stretching by walking can help your body loosen up and clear your mind in preparation of studying.If you're hungry, eat before studying but stick to a light snack or a small meal. Eating a heavy meal before studying can result in sleepiness. This can make it difficult to concentrate on studying., The mindset you have going into studying can affect the effectiveness of your study session. Work on fostering a positive mindset going into each study session.


Think positively when you study. Remind yourself that you are building new skills and abilities. Do not get discouraged if you struggle with something. Remind yourself you're studying because you need to improve so it's okay if you don't understand some material.Do not engage in catastrophic or absolute thinking. Catastrophic thoughts include things like, ""If I don't get this now, I never will."" Absolute thoughts are things like, ""I always do poorly on these exams."" Instead, try to be realistic. Think to yourself, ""I'm struggling with this information at the moment, but if I'm persistent I'm sure it will come to me.""Do not compare yourself to others. You're focused on doing well on this assignment for yourself. Other people's success or failure should not matter., Memory games, always known as mnemonic devices, are a means of remembering information by creating associations. They can be extremely helpful when it comes to smart studying.


Many people remember subjects by stringing words together to form sentences, the first letter of each word signifying part of a topic that requires memorization. For example, the sentence ""Kings play cards on fat green stools"" can be used to help remember the taxonomy ranking for animals: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species.Make sure you use mnemonic devices that are easy to remember. If you're creating your own mnemonic device, pick words and sentences that have personal meaning to you and that you will easily remember later., If you have notes, rewrite them. Rewriting the notes you have, changing the wording slightly, helps you actively engage with the material. You're not just repeating information but trying to explain it over and over again. This can help you process information and more easily remember it later on.Don't just copy out the material over and over again. Instead, try to condense it to the most basic points.Then, try to condense it again, until you have gotten to the most essential points.

"
"
Take good notes.,
Read actively.,
Ask questions.",How to Study Harder4," Creating the proper resources for studying can help you. While you're in class, try to take good notes. These can serve as a valuable resource later on when you're studying.


Organize your notes by date and subject. Write the date on the top corner of the page at the beginning of class. Then, write headings and subheadings regarding the subject being taught. If you're searching for notes on a particular subject, it'll be easier to find later.Use your best handwriting. You want to make sure you can read your notes later on.Compare notes with other classmates. If you missed one class session or missed a few words here and there when taking notes, another classmate can help you fill in what you missed., When reading material for class, make sure you read actively. How you read can affect how well you retain information later on.


Pay attention to chapter titles and subheadings. These often offer clues as to the main point of a text. It indicates what material you should pay closest attention to while reading.You should also reread the first sentence of each paragraph once. This sentence usually offers a summary of key information you'll need. Pay attention to concluding sections as well, as they summarize key materials.If permitted, underline passages and write notes in margins summarizing key points. This can help you find important information later when studying., If you're confused about anything in class, ask questions. Usually, teachers will allow time for questions after class. You can also ask to stop by a students office hours to ask about topics that confuse you.Do yourself a favor and make it a habit to visit your teacher's office hours starting at the beginning of the semester. Waiting to ask questions until the day before the test makes it seem like you haven't been preparing. Making a habit of dropping in once a week or so encourages your teacher to see you as a student who works hard and prepares in advance -- she'll be more likely to want to help you.

Bring music.,
Disconnect from technology.,
Vary your tasks.",How to Study Outside2," If you are someone who can study with music on, bring some headphones. Music can help many people tune out distracting sounds in their environment, and there can be a lot of these outside.


Some people can study just fine in noisy environments, but for others, the sound of a barking dog or people talking as they pass by can really hinder their study efforts.Music can help you block these sounds out.
Music that you've heard before and that isn't too loud is often easier to tune out than noises in your environment.If the situation allows, bring speakers to use instead of headphones. Some research shows that listening to music on headphones can make it harder to retain information.

, Unless you need the internet for the work you're doing, consider disconnecting from the internet while you study.If you have your laptop with you, switch it to airplane mode.


If you get a lot of text messages or calls, you may wish to consider putting your phone in silent mode or even just turning it off for a little while to minimize distractions.
Many people find it easier to go without technology when working outdoors. In your bedroom, it's easy to fall into the routine of checking Facebook ""just for a few minutes,"" but you probably do this less when you are in outdoor settings., If you can, try doing several different types of study activities while studying outdoors. Variety can help you stay focused.Read a chapter of a novel for English class, then switch to some math problems or go through some foreign language flash cards. Changing things up keeps it interesting and makes it less likely that you'll be distracted by what's going on around you.

"
"
Make it a social activity.,
Move locations periodically.,
Take breaks.",How to Study Outside3," One great thing about studying outside is that it feels more like a social experience than studying alone in your room. Bring a friend or study group with you, and you'll finish up feeling like you've had some social time even if you don't talk much.Just being out with other people can produce this feeling of social connection, even if you don't bring anyone with you.

, Research shows that changing locations can help you retain information better. This is easier to do outside than in your house, because there are usually a lot more locations to choose from!Scientists believe studying in multiple settings enriches the information with more contextual stimulation, and this in turn makes the brain less likely to forget it.

, As with studying inside, you'll focus better and get more out of studying outside if you take breaks. Since you're outside, make the most of these breaks by getting a little exercise.Take a short walk or throw a Frisbee around for a few minutes instead of logging on to social media. You'll feel invigorated by some exercise, and that can give you renewed focus when you return to your studies.

Check the table of contents.,
Read headings, summaries, or keywords.,
Scan the first and last sentences of paragraphs.","How to Study Using the Preview, Question, Read, Summary, Test or PQRST Method1"," To get acquainted with the material you are going to be studying, check out the table of contents in a syllabus, textbook, or course pack. Note how the content is divided, and what the major topics are. Note how ideas are mapped out, and what concepts have more pages to devoted to them.For example, a history textbook will likely be divided by era, with subtitles listing important battles, elections, or other events of note.;
, To get a sense of what you are studying before you begin to read in-depth, scan the course material for summarizing text. Summaries could include topic headings, bolded keywords, or chapter summaries.) These parts should offer a general idea of what the chapter or section will cover and frame further reading of the content.In some study materials, pictures, maps, or diagrams may serve the same purpose.

, For further insight, or if no table of contents, headings, or other summaries are available, read the first and last sentences of each paragraph. Reading the introduction and conclusion of each paragraph will give you a quick overview of its content and help you trace the chain of ideas presented. Identify what the subject matter is, as well as the approach taken to the subject within the text (e.g. a comparative study or historical overview)."
"
Turn subject headings into questions.,
Generate questions based on your preview.,
Write questions based on your previous knowledge of the topic.","How to Study Using the Preview, Question, Read, Summary, Test or PQRST Method2"," Formulate questions that you would like to be able to answer once you have finished studying. Start by using subject headings or subheadings to formulate questions. For instance, turn the heading, “Einstein’s Theory of Relativity” into the question, “What is Einstein’s Theory of Relativity?”, Write down any questions you may have after your initial preview of the material to be studied. Include as few or as many questions as you have based of your understanding of the content. If the text that you are studying includes study questions, add them to the list.For instance, your preview of an astronomy article might lead you to ask questions like, ""how long does Mars' orbit take?""

, Use the limited knowledge (or pre-conceived notions) that you already have about a topic to write questions. The questions should be geared towards clarifying the truth about the subject (e.g. ""Is it true that bears hibernate for half of the year?""). As you study, these questions will be answered, and misconceptions debunked."
"
Read in clusters.,
Highlight important things.,
Evaluate your understanding.","How to Study Using the Preview, Question, Read, Summary, Test or PQRST Method3"," As you start to study, be mindful to read for ideas rather than keywords – do this by focusing on clusters of words while reading rather than single words. This effort reduces the number of times your eyes stop while reading, and increases comprehension by making you read with more direct intent. Be sure to keep this up throughout your studying; “cluster reading” can increase the speed of your reading.For example, read through an entire paragraph about an anaconda being able to eat an impala, instead of stopping after the first sentence stating that fact.

, Read through paragraphs with the intention of highlighting the important points of each. Each paragraph in a text contains one main idea and other, supporting ideas. Highlight the main point of each paragraph so you can refer back to it easily without having to skim through all of the content again (e.g. in a paragraph about the status of the snow leopard, highlight the sentence, ""Due to climate change, snow leopards are going extinct."")Jotting down notes in the margins of your study material is also a good way to note important details.

, Choose an interval at which to stop reading and evaluate your understanding of the content you just studied (e.g. every ten minutes, every chapter). Ask yourself if you’re learning anything from the text, or if you’ve absorbed all of the details you read. If necessary, reread the text."
"
Write notes for yourself.,
Record page numbers and references within your notes.,
Recite notes in your head or out loud.","How to Study Using the Preview, Question, Read, Summary, Test or PQRST Method4"," Based on what you’ve read, write notes for yourself using your questions, the answers to them, and other pertinent content that struck your interest. Use the format of note-taking that suits you best (e.g. lists in point form.) Be sure that your notes are legible and coherent enough to refer to easily later on.If you understand things better in list form, for instance, make a list of the most notable battles during WWI when writing your history notes.

, While you write your notes, record the page numbers of the source material that you are referencing. Having this information will allow you to go back to the source easily when you review your notes. If any pertinent maps, charts, pictures, or other visual aids relate to part of your notes, write down the page numbers for those as well., In addition to taking written notes, summarizing the content you’ve read (either out loud or in your head) is an excellent way to process and retain the information. Organize your thoughts as if you were giving a lecture or oral presentation about the subject, and make the “lesson” as comprehensive as possible.By formulating the material that you’ve studied in the style of a presentation, you make the content more engaging and understandable for yourself as well as your imaginary audience.

"
"
Read and answer the list of questions you wrote.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Review learning material.","How to Study Using the Preview, Question, Read, Summary, Test or PQRST Method5"," Answer the questions that you compiled for yourself as comprehensively as you can given what you’ve managed to learn from your studying process. Do not consult your notes until after you’re done testing yourself on the study material. Note the questions you got wrong or didn’t answer and focus extra attention on the content related to them., Mnemonic devices are memory techniques that allow your brain to encode and retain information. These study tricks are essentially shortcuts that allow you to recall things, in the form of acronyms, images, rhymes, songs, or other memorable devices. Create or use mnemonic devices for the content that you have more difficulty remembering when studying.For example, a popular mnemonic device for students learning history is, “in fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue”, used to remember the year of Christopher Columbus’ famous expedition.

, Based on the sections that you struggle with when testing yourself, review your study material. Reread your notes and, if necessary, re-write notes for the content that you have trouble remembering to reinforce your understanding of it. Continue testing yourself on the material until you feel confident that you've learned it."
"
Organize your notes from the class.,
Find all of your old tests and quizzes in that subject.,
Go to your local book store for Regents review books.,
Study a little bit at a time.,
If you know it already, don't study it!

,
If your Regents exam has reference tables (such as Earth Science or Chemistry) spend less time on those topics.,
Reread your notes before you go to bed each night, and if you can, the morning of the test, to keep everything fresh in your mind.

,
Go to extra help with your teacher often in the weeks leading up to the test.

",How to Study for Regents," For example, if you are taking a Regents in Biology, find your biology notebook. Clean it out; remove work from other classes, doodles, and other, unimportant things.;
, Include answer keys or Scantron sheets. Place these in a folder or a separate section of your binder.

, The company Barron's makes them in almost every subject. They are about $15 each, so talk to an older friend or family member who might already have a book in the subject you are looking for.

, The first things you study should be the things you learned in the beginning of school, since that's what you have most likely forgotten.

,, Just make sure you know how to read every single thing on the reference tables. Many of your answers will come right off the tables.

"
Look at the curriculum.,
Research the higher level skills.,
Consider the social impact.,
Improve your grades by studying really hard.,
Be active in class.,
Make sure homework and all class work is turned in on time.

,
Be more ready than you think you need to be, just in case.,
Wait until about half the year has passed, and make sure you get good grades in that half year.,
If you find you're stressing yourself out, it's possible that you're at the grade level you should be at.,
Talk to your parent and the school counselor about your desires.,
If school faculty or your parents say no, they do have a reason.,
Look into Independent Study or Online Classes.,
In America, consider home schooling as an option.",How to Skip a Grade," You might change your mind about shifting up based on this, or you might come away even more convinced that it's the right choice. Consider:


Do you understand the concepts in the next grade? For instance, if you readily understand the Quadratic Formula, maybe you can skip pre-algebra.
Getting a hold of a textbook or tutoring book can give a sense of what is involved.;
, If you can teach yourself, this is a sign that maybe you can move up. But also consider asking for assistance from teachers or parents. Doing so will make it clear what level you are actually able to work at.


Be sure to review the whole textbook! Especially in American textbooks, the first several chapters are usually review from last year. Do not read two chapters, find it exactly what you are working on now, and then assume you are ready to skip.

, Will you be able to handle a grade promotion? Skipping a grade can drastically alter your social life. You will be younger than most of your classmates, and your maturity level may not be the same as theirs. This can also play out in your later school career in ways you have not considered. For example:


After graduation, would you still be a legal minor? If so, how will that affect what you do after high school? The military, many universities, and employers will often not accept minors.
Using a grade promotion to escape a bad social situation may not pan out. If you are having social issues in one grade, they may actually be worse going into a higher grade.
Will you be missing out on extracurricular activities? School is not just about academics--there is also sports, drama club, school dances, yearbook, clubs, marching band, the prom and other activities you may miss out on if you move ahead. These elements of school are often just as important as the classes.

, You need to be making all A's, preferably high ones. By demonstrating you are consistently showing competence, you are more likely to prove your case. Letting your grades slip or not turning in homework may count against you in a grade promotion consideration. Do not slack off because you are bored.

, Demonstrating that you are a knowledgeable learner and a superior student will help your teachers see you are ready for a higher challenge. Be sure to ask questions that demonstrate your higher understanding, but do not be rude, disruptive, or sarcastic.

,, It would be bad to not be adequately prepared.

, The reason for this is that you may change your mind after you see some of the challenges in your current grade. Often the first few weeks are essentially review, and then as new concepts are introduced, suddenly the class is much more interesting.

, Rushing through studies can be wasteful if you don't lead a balanced life and enjoy being a student and a teen. Do some deep soul searching as to why this is so important to you and where you see yourself in five and ten years time.

, You will not be able to skip a grade without the approval of your guardian and the school. Also, if your school has a handbook the policies should be very clear.


You may not be able to skip due to something as simple as a required health or gym class. It may not be worth working extremely hard just to not be able to graduate early anyway.
Going ahead a grade may be most successful in a transitional year. For instance, if you are moving into a new school system or from elementary school to middle school.

, Just keep trying and eventually you may succeed.

, For gifted or students with an unusual ability, often schools can make an accommodation through these methods. This is particularly useful to meet academic needs if you are highly skilled in a particular area. This may include:

On-line classes.
Taking a class through a local community college, university, or trade school.
An independent study: self-directed learning (with the oversight of a teacher) of a particular field of interest.
Internships. Some high schools offer credit for internships at local businesses, or non-profit organizations. For example, perhaps you can intern at a local community center, real estate office, an animal shelter, historical site, or library.

, Many home schooled students are able to skip one or more years of school because of being able to control how quickly they advance because you are moving at your pace, not the pace of your peers.

Eat something before class.,
Think of common distractions and how to avoid them.,
Leave distracting technology behind.,
Do some light exercise.,
Sit away from friends.,
Try to sit in front.,
Participate in discussion.,
Take notes.,
Keep your eyes on the teacher.,
Sit up straight.,
Work on your sleep schedule.,
Maintain a good diet.,
Give yourself rewards.,
Figure out what helps you focus.",How to Stay Focused in Class," You should never go to class on an empty stomach. Hunger pangs can easily distract you from the curriculum. Always have something to eat before a class. In a morning class especially, make sure to get up in time for breakfast.If you don't have time for a big meal, grab something small. A piece of toast or a bowl of yogurt can really help you focus during class.;
, Prior to class, make a list of reasons you sometimes have trouble concentrating. This can include things like checking your phone, a noisy classroom, and a tendency to daydream. Then, write down ways you can combat these problems.For example, you can write down something like, ""I can't resist the temptation to check my phone when I hear it buzz in my pocket.""
Think of a way to eliminate this distraction. For example, ""I should turn my phone off before class.""

, Unless a laptop is required for class, leave yours behind. You'll be able to focus more when you take notes by hand as you're less likely to be distracted by a lingering internet browser.It's okay to bring your phone, as you may need it for directions immediately after class. However, be sure to power it down before class begins.

, Exercise can help you focus. If you have time, get a workout in before class in the morning. If you don't have time for a full workout, some light exercise can help. Go for a short walk before class or do some light cardio in your apartment.If you typically drive to class, try walking or biking instead. This will allow you to get in a brief workout on your way to class.

, If you have friends in your class, you may be tempted to sit next to them. However, friends can easily prove distracting. You want to resist the temptation to pass notes or whisper during class lectures and discussions.If you don't want to hurt your friends feelings, politely let them know ahead of time you'll be sitting away from them in class. Say something like, ""Hey, I know we like to all sit together, but I keep distracting myself lately. I think I'm going to try to sit on my own and see if that helps me focus.""

, In addition to sitting away from your friends, pick a seat towards the front of the classroom. It's easier to get distracted in the back, when you're struggling to see the board. Sit towards the front of the class so you will be able to focus., In addition to helping you focus, many classes grade you on in-class discussion. Whenever an opportunity comes up for discussion, always participate at least once. If you're actively engaging in a conversation, you will have to pay attention to what's happening in your classroom.You may be nervous about participating. However, keep in mind many of your classmates are nervous as well. Chances are, what you have to say is beneficial to the classroom.
Ask questions if you have them. While you may feel embarrassed asking questions, many students may have the same questions you do and are simply too shy to raise them.

, Throughout class, take well organized notes. Do not just copy down what the instructor says. Make sure to write it in your own words. Phrasing lectures in a way that makes sense to you will help you better retain the information.Make sure to date and label your notes. You should write down a header explaining what's being discussed.
Use shorthand when possible so you can keep up. For example, use abbreviations and acronyms when possible.
Do not write down everything. Instead, focus on information you may easily forget, such as names, dates, equations, and other hard to remember facts.

, Maintaining some level of eye contact with the teacher can be helpful for several reasons. You will prevent your mind from wandering, and your teacher will also see you are attentive. This can reflect highly on you when the time comes for grading. During lectures, if you're not taking notes, look to the front of the classroom., It's a small change, but can make a big difference in your level of focus. Maintain good posture throughout a lecture. Good postures helps you regulate breath better, preventing you from becoming drowsy during class., It's very hard to focus if you're not getting enough sleep. Establishing a routine that allows for a positive sleep schedule can help you pay more attention during class.Stick to a sleep routine. Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time, including during weekends. Your body's natural circadian rhythm will adjust to a regular sleep/wake time, making it easier to fall asleep at night and get up in the morning.Find a relaxing activity to do every night before bed, as this will let your mind and body know it's time to sleep. Do something that does not involve electronics, such as reading a book or taking a warm bath.

, Making sure you get enough water and food is vital to your focus. Pay attention to your body's cues. If you feel hungry or thirsty, have something to eat or drink. This will make a big impact on your ability to focus.Make sure to stay hydrated. Keep a water bottle on hand at all times, and make sure to drink water throughout the day.
Eat healthy foods. Go for whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats.

, You will be able to focus better if you're working towards something. If you go to a class you're not crazy about, plan to reward yourself if you pay attention and take notes. For example, you're allowed to get a candy bar after your science class if you take notes the whole time., Different people focus in different ways. If you want to stay on task, figure out what habits work for you personally. Pay attention to your mood throughout the day and take notice when you're at your most focus. Determine what factors are having a positive effect on your concentration.For example, you notice you're most productive right after a cup of tea. Try having tea every day before class.

Determine which variable you need to isolate.,
Use algebra to solve for the desired variable.,
Keep the equation balanced.",How to Solve Literal Equations1," Isolating a variable means getting the variable on one side of an equation by itself.This information should be given to you, or you can figure it out based on what information you know you will be given.

For example, you might be told to solve the area of a triangle formula for h{\displaystyle h}. Or, you might know that you have the area and base of the triangle, so you need to solve for the height. So, you need to rearrange the formula and isolate the h{\displaystyle h} variable.
;
, Use inverse operations to cancel variables on one side of the equation and move them to the other side. Keep in mind the following inverse operations:

Multiplication and division.

Addition and subtraction.

Squaring and taking a square root.


, Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side. This ensures that your equation remains true, and in the process you are moving variables from one side to the other as needed.For example, to solve the area of a triangle formula (A=12bh{\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}bh}) for h{\displaystyle h}:

Cancel the fraction by multiplying each side by 2:A×2=2×12bh{\displaystyle A\times 2=2\times {\frac {1}{2}}bh}2A=bh{\displaystyle 2A=bh}

Isolate h{\displaystyle h} by dividing each side by b{\displaystyle b}:2Ab=bhb{\displaystyle {\frac {2A}{b}}={\frac {bh}{b}}}2Ab=h{\displaystyle {\frac {2A}{b}}=h}



Rearrange the formula, if desired: h=2Ab{\displaystyle h={\frac {2A}{b}}}

Sit straight in half-lotus position.,
Close your eyes to avoid getting distracted.

,
Place your hands over your knees.

,
Breathe long and slow through your nose.,
You don't have to do numberless breaths at a time but in interval gaps as our mind loves short timings.,
After you have completed just 20 breaths, you will feel energetic and like never before.This will provide you with a fresh vital energy and you would be able to study so smoothly and naturally without much depressing effort.

,
Repeat this again after 5-10 minutes or when you feel the energy is completely exhausted from you.,
If you breathe 40 times, then it's much better and then you can repeat it again after 10-15 minutes since it provides you with a much longer sustaining energy.

",How to Study Energetically1,";
,,, Try focusing along the breath as it moves in and as it moves out. If it's difficult or you lose patience, start focusing on the more noticeable diaphragm or stomach movements.

, However, you have to do it through your entire study period. Just keep counting your fingers until it covers twenty. One complete breath (breath going in and going out) equals to one counting on your finger.

,,


Exhausting depends on the study time. Early morning is very effective for doing so but the great advantage is that it leaves you with a bubbling energy throughout the day and you become the most cheerful and happy person.

Remember the slope-intercept form for the equation of a line.,
Remember the standard form of a line.,
Use algebra to isolate the appropriate variable.,
Reorder the variables and constants, if necessary.",How to Solve Literal Equations2," The slope-intercept form is y=mx+b{\displaystyle y=mx+b}, where y{\displaystyle y} equals the y-coordinate of a point on the line, x{\displaystyle x} equals the x-coordinate of that same point, m{\displaystyle m} equals the slope of the line, and b{\displaystyle b} equals the y-intercept., The standard form is Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}, where x{\displaystyle x} and y{\displaystyle y} are the coordinates of a point on the line, A{\displaystyle A} is a positive integer, and B{\displaystyle B} and C{\displaystyle C} are integers., Use inverse operations to move variables from one side of the equation to the other side. Remember to keep the equation balanced, which means that whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must also do to the other side.

For example, you might have the equation of a line 3x+2y=4{\displaystyle 3x+2y=4}. This is in standard form. If you need to find the y-intercept of the line, you need to rearrange the formula to slope-intercept form by isolating the y{\displaystyle y} variable:Subtract 3x{\displaystyle 3x} from both sides of the equation:3x+2y−3x=4−3x{\displaystyle 3x+2y-3x=4-3x}2y=4−3x{\displaystyle 2y=4-3x}.

Divide both sides by 2{\displaystyle 2}:2y2=4−3x2{\displaystyle {\frac {2y}{2}}={\frac {4-3x}{2}}}y=4−3x2{\displaystyle y={\frac {4-3x}{2}}}




, If you are changing an equation to slope-intercept or standard form, rearrange the variables, coefficients, and constants so that they follow the correct formula.

For example, to change y=4−3x2{\displaystyle y={\frac {4-3x}{2}}} to the correct slope-intercept formula, you need to switch the order of the number in the numerator, then simplify:y=−3x+42{\displaystyle y={\frac {-3x+4}{2}}}y=−32x+2{\displaystyle y={\frac {-3}{2}}x+2}Now, since the formula is in proper slope-intercept form, it is easy to identify the y-intercept as 2.

Solve this equation for b{\displaystyle b}.,
Solve the circumference of a circle formula for the radius.,
Rewrite this equation of a line in standard form.",How to Solve Literal Equations3," R=5bd−6ba{\displaystyle R=5bd-6ba}.

Factor out the b{\displaystyle b}: R=b(5d−6a){\displaystyle R=b(5d-6a)}.

Isolate the b{\displaystyle b} by dividing each side by the expression in parentheses:R5d−6a=b(5d−6a)5d−6a{\displaystyle {\frac {R}{5d-6a}}={\frac {b(5d-6a)}{5d-6a}}}R5d−6a=b{\displaystyle {\frac {R}{5d-6a}}=b}


, The formula is C=2πr{\displaystyle C=2\pi {r}}Understand what each variable stands for. In this formula, C{\displaystyle C} is the circumference, and r{\displaystyle r} is the radius. So you need to isolate the r{\displaystyle r} to solve for the radius.

Isolate the r{\displaystyle r} by dividing both sides of the equation by 2π{\displaystyle 2\pi }:C2π=2πr2π{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{2\pi }}={\frac {2\pi {r}}{2\pi }}}C2π=r{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{2\pi }}=r}

If desired, reverse the order of the equation for standard form: r=C2π{\displaystyle r={\frac {C}{2\pi }}}.


, y=12x+5{\displaystyle y={\frac {1}{2}}x+5}

Recall that standard form is Ax+By=C{\displaystyle Ax+By=C}.

Cancel the fraction by multiplying each side of the equation by 2:2y=2(12x+5){\displaystyle 2y=2({\frac {1}{2}}x+5)}2y=x+10{\displaystyle 2y=x+10}

Subtract x{\displaystyle x} from both sides of the equation:2y−x=x+10−x{\displaystyle 2y-x=x+10-x}2y−x=10{\displaystyle 2y-x=10}

Rearrange the y{\displaystyle y} and x{\displaystyle x} variables so that they are in the standard form: −x+2y=10{\displaystyle -x+2y=10}.

Multiply both sides by −1{\displaystyle -1}, since A{\displaystyle A} should be a positive integer for standard form:−1(−x+2y)=−1(10){\displaystyle -1(-x+2y)=-1(10)}x−2y=−10{\displaystyle x-2y=-10}

=== Making History Revision Posters ===,, Learn them well.

, Use different colors for different facts or themes.


Add pictures to make you want to look at the poster more.
Make the font clear and really big so it's easy to read.

, Choose areas where you tend to pass by or look frequently.


A good place to put it is on your ceiling (if you can reach), above your pillow so you will read it every time you go to bed or wake up.
You could even stick the poster against the glass wall in the shower so while you shower you can read it.
Another place is either the wall opposite the toilet or even the wall opposite the stairs Every time you come upstairs you will focus on the poster.

, This is one of the best ways to revise if you learn by looking, as you will automatically subconsciously read it even when you don't realize your doing it. And quite possibly, other members of the household will start quizzing you after they've read the content too.

Exercise on your study breaks.,
Drink water.,
Have healthy snacks.,
Block out any distractions.,
Prepare last minute review notes.,
Pack your bag.,
Get a good night’s sleep.",How to Study at the Last Minute," Because you are studying at the last minute, you will not have time to go through all of your class material or your study notes. Instead, you should read over the class material and identify any topics you struggle with or have trouble recalling. You should then focus your studying on brushing up on your weak spots so you are better prepared heading into the test.You may take a practice exam and note questions that you did poorly on or scored low on. You may then focus your studying on these questions so you do not have any weak spots going into the exam.
For example, you may struggle to remember certain historical dates for your social studies exam. You may then focus your attention on remembering the dates and memorizing them so you can do well on these types of questions in your exam.;
, You can also study quickly and efficiently by making a mind map, which is a study tool to help you remember the connections and links between certain concepts or terms. Mind maps are useful if you have already taken notes on the course material and are looking for ways to organize this material to remember it better and recall it during the test. You can draw out a mind map on a piece of paper or use mind map software on your computer to help you study.For example, you may be trying to study for your biochemistry exam. You may then place a concept in biochemistry, such as “enzymes”, in the center of a piece of paper and use your course notes to draw information and terms that relate back to “enzymes”. You may circle these terms and draw lines so they connect back to the center circle around “enzymes.”

, You can also use a tried and true study tool, flashcards, to create an efficient, last minute study session. You may use colored flashcards to write down different terms or phrases to help you prepare for the exam. Flashcards have been shown to improve your memory recall and help improve your visual learning abilities.For example, you may write down certain terms that will be on your test on the flashcards. Then, write the definitions for the terms on the back of the cards. You can then test yourself on the terms or ask a friend or sibling to test you on the terms to ensure you get the definitions right.

, You may also lean on audio or visual aids to help you study at the last minute, especially if you tend to learn better from visual or audio cues. Using audio or visual aids may also help you recall information more quickly and more effectively than reading information on the page.You may listen to a recording of yourself reciting definitions and terms from your textbook or listen to an audio recording of the course materials and take notes on the audio to help you remember the information.
You may also try watching videos that relate to a concept in your textbook to better understand the concept. You should search online for educational videos and use them to help you study at the last minute.

, If you find you are struggling with specific topics or concepts in a class, you may consider getting a tutor to help you study. You may try to hire a professional tutor to help you with the gaps in your knowledge or ask a friend who is doing well in the class to help tutor you. You should try to reach out to others for help on topics you are struggling with, especially if you are trying to study at the last minute and are not sure how to begin.

, Though you are studying last minute and may be trying to cram as much information in your brain as you can, you should still try to take short study breaks. During your study breaks, you should do some exercise to keep your energy levels up and to improve your concentration. Even doing 5-10 minutes of exercise during your study break can help you stay fit and mentally prepared for more studying in the future.For example, you may do a quick jog around the block during your study break or go for a quick walk around campus. You may also do push ups or sit ups during your study break to stay motivated and alert.

, You should try to only drink water while you are studying, as this will ensure you stay hydrated and healthy. If you do drink coffee, you should only drink a small amount during the day and make sure you are drinking enough water to compensate for the caffeine., You should also try to have healthy, energizing snacks while you study so you can stay focused and not become too wired or too lethargic. Go for healthy sources of sugar, like fruit, as well as healthy sources of protein, like nuts, to help you stay focused.Avoid eating and drinking items high in processed sugar and fat, as these products will only make you more tired and distracted. Go for healthier options so your body has the energy it needs to stay focused and study.

, To study effectively at the last minute, you should create a distraction free zone in your room or general area. This may mean keeping your door closed so everyone in your home knows you are trying to focus on studying and can leave you alone. You may also keep the doors and windows closed to block out any distracting noises around you.If you are studying in a public place, like the library, you may use noise cancelling headphones to stay focused. You may also turn off your cellphone or put it on mute so it is not a distraction to you.
You may also find it helpful to turn off your wi-fi connection to avoid going on social media and getting distracted. Doing this can help you focus and not get sucked into using your time on social media instead of on your study notes.

, You should prepare some last minute review notes that focus on key concepts and terms that you struggle with. You may write these notes on flashcards and review them once at night before bed and once in the morning before the exam. Doing a scan of these last minute notes could help you remember them better for your exam.Try to focus on terms and concepts that you struggle with remembering or have identified as your weak spots, as you do not want to try to cram all of the information on the exam into your last minute review.

, You should do some preparations the night before the exam so you are less stressed in the morning and can head into your exam with a clear head. Start by packing your backpack so it contains all of your books, pens, and paper. Make sure you have working pens as you do not want to end up in your exam with a faulty pen.You should also make sure you have any other supplies in your bag that you may need for your test, such as a graphing calculator and a ruler.

, Many studies have shown that getting a full night’s sleep before an exam can help you perform better. Though it may be tempting to pull an all night study session, doing this could lead to a poor grade on the exam and an inability to recall important information for the exam. You should do a review of your notes before bed but try to get at least eight hours of sleep in the night before the exam.You should also set an alarm so you wake up in the morning with enough time to review your notes one more time before heading to the exam. Setting an alarm will also ensure you are not in a panic in the morning and can walk into the exam calmly and with confidence.

Use spaced repetition.,
Quiz yourself.,
Take notes long-hand.,
Explain your knowledge to someone else.,
Take breaks when studying.",How to Retain Knowledge1," If you want to remember something, don’t repeat it over and over to yourself – this is known as massed repetition.Instead, let some time elapse before you repeat it. Ideally, you want to try to retrieve the information exactly at the moment when you were about to forget it.The difficulty of retrieving the information correlates to how strongly you will remember it.


If you’ve just met someone and want to remember their name, repeat it to yourself every five or ten seconds while talking to them.
When studying, don’t go over the same flashcards over and over again. Let a few hours or even a day go by, then go through them again. You can stop studying the ones that are easy to remember. Focus on repeated the ones that are difficult, but always allowing some time to elapse in between sessions.;
, Taking a short test helps to keep information you’ve just learned in your mind. The process of retrieving the information from your brain seems to strengthen your mental connection to it, making it easier to remember that information over the long termWhen reading, stop every so often – perhaps after every chapter or section, or more often it’s very difficult reading. Put down the reading and ask yourself: can I summarize what I have just read in one or two sentences?
After a lecture, class, or important meeting, jot down the main take-away points in your own words. Don’t look back at your notes: see what you can remember.

, Even if you only use your laptop for note-taking, and stay away from distractions like e-mail or social media, typing is still less effective than hand writing your notes.Writing by hand is slower and forces you to put the teacher’s words into your own words. This is the first step toward understanding and retaining knowledge, rather than merely recording it.

, Teaching the knowledge you need to retain to a friend, roommate, or family member forces you to translate the information into clear, understandable language. This is an important activity in “active learning,” which has been shown to improve retention and understanding of knowledge.Spend two minutes explaining a concept to your roommate. Then, swap roles, and let your roommate explain a concept to you for two minutes.
Grab a whiteboard and teach a five-minute lesson to a friend. Then, ask your friend to explain what you’ve just taught them. Pay attention to what confused them: the areas that you explain least clearly are probably the things you understand least well.
Write a letter to a parent or other relative. Explain the concept in clear, simple terms.

, You need to allow time for mental recovery and for the information you’re learning to be absorbed. Even while you’re on your break, your mind will be turning over the new information, and you might find yourself better able to understand a problem when you return to it."
"
Link your knowledge to larger concepts.,
Connect facts to ideas.,
Evaluate your own learning process.,
Opt for the final project.,
Don’t focus on just one thing for too long.",How to Retain Knowledge2," It’s much easier to remember facts if you understand why those facts are true. Ask yourself, or your teacher: why do things work the way they do? If you understand the larger conceptual framework, you will be able to retrieve knowledge more easily and even guess more accurately.

]For example, if you have to memorize geographical borders, think about how those borders were formed. Notice that in many places, borders follow natural features such as rivers and mountain ranges. By observing a general rule like this you save yourself from having to memorize each individual border; instead, you can remember which borders follow this rule.

, You are more likely to remember something if you can associate it with other, related things. Tell a story to yourself about a particular fact: even if your story is light-hearted, it will cement the fact in your mind.


This is sometimes call the Baker/baker paradox. Shown a picture of a woman, people are much more likely to remember that she is a baker than that her name is Baker. This is because the idea of being a baker has more associations. It conjures up thoughts of bread and might suggest links with the image: perhaps her face looks doughy, for example., Assess yourself by asking whether you are absorbing new material and whether you understand the big concepts that underlie that material. Reflect on what aspects of the learning process have worked for you and what aspects were less helpful. This kind of self-evaluation is known as metacognition, and it has been shown to improve your ability to transfer what you’ve learned to new settings and situations., Sometimes you are allowed to choose between taking a final exam or completing a final project. In other cases, you might have the choice to take a class that assigns a project. Where possible, choose the final project. Completing a complex project related to the knowledge area is associated with greater retention of knowledge than taking a test alone., Instead, turn from one task to another, and intersperse studying one subject with studying something else.Look for connections between the different topics. Seeing how knowledge fits together into a larger picture will help you to understand its significance and remember it better.

Present the information in different ways.,
Make up a little song about the information.,
Create a mental image related to the information.,
Draw a concept map.,
Use mnemonics.",How to Retain Knowledge3," By learning the same material in different modes, you will increase your ability to remember it.Regardless of preferences, everyone can benefit from learning the same information visually, aurally, textually, and so on.


Many people feel or have been told that they are more of a “visual learner,” an “auditory learner,” and so on. There’s no evidence to suggest, though, that learning mainly in your preferred mode is advantageous.Instead, it’s helpful to learn in as many different modes as possible.

, Music accesses different parts of the brain, and the ability to remember music seems to have evolved earlier than the ability to process language.Singing about your topic helps you store that information in a different part of your brain.


If you’re studying a foreign language, learn a familiar children’s song in that language to solidify vocabulary. For example, “Heads, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes” will help you memorize that language’s words for major body parts.
You probably learned to count partly through nursery rhymes such as “Five Green and Speckled Frogs.”Make up similar silly songs about concepts in trigonometry or calculus – it still works!
Share your song with your study group. Singing in a group has profound benefits for your brain., This method builds on the importance of creating mental associations with an idea in order to remember it. A short scenario or picture in your mind will create a richer set of associations and allow you to remember abstract ideas more concretely.


Memorize the difference between the mathematical concepts of “zero slope” and “no slope” by picturing a skier. When the skier gets to a vertical cliff, she will scream, “No slope!”

, This is a visual representation of a set of related ideas. Use words and drawings as well as arrows to indicate relationships.

Concept maps can be very helpful in representing and remembering hierarchical relationships. However, they can also foster creativity, because it’s possible to visualize relationships in many dimensions instead of along one single line.The flow chart is one kind of concept map.It represents a procedure or decision-making process, representing steps in symbols and connecting those steps using arrows.

, These are devices to aid memory, often using poems, sayings, or initials. They should be catchy, funny, and easy to repeat.For example, the order of the planets can be remembered using the phrase “My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos” (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune).
The fates of King Henry VIII's six wives is often remembered through a simple, mostly-accurate poem: “Divorced, Beheaded, Died; Divorced, Beheaded, Survived.”

Create a positive attitude.,
Attend your classes regularly.,
Set goals for yourself.,
Do your homework daily.,
Ask for help when you need it.,
Manage your time effectively.,
Always review.,
Develop tests for yourself.,
Know your personal learning style.",How to Score Good Marks in School," You may ask ""how does creating a good attitude supposed to boost up my mark?"" Well, if you create a good attitude in studying and think positive things about studying, it's likely that you will start liking a subject that you were really not fond of before. You may also get marks for having a good attitude and for not disrupting a class.;
, If you attend classes daily instead of skipping them, you will be there to listen to all the lessons the teachers are teaching and won't miss important days. It's likely that you will remember or learn more if you are in class when the teacher is teaching than if you skipped class and then take notes later on.

, Set goals like 'get good marks in math, science etc' for yourself and then try your hardest to achieve those goals. If you fail once, don't give up, keep trying.

, When you get homework, do it, don't leave it. If you're tempted to watch your favourite TV show instead of do homework, think about it this way: Is your favourite TV show going to help you get to a good university and possibly help you achieve the job of your dreams? If the answer is yes, then by all means watch the show. Homework is important because it gives you practice on the subject that you are learning. Always do your homework.

, If you have a question on something, ask for help, don't just leave it behind. You can ask anybody who has knowledge on the subject that you need help with like your parents, teacher, brother or sister. It will most definitely help you in tests and quizzes.

, It will help you reduce anxiety and focus on studying. If you have a test next week, start studying now. Try not to study at the last minute and cram the night before. Try studying 1 or 2 hours daily and leave a half hour for homework. If you study before you do homework, it will help you do your homework faster and help you understand the subject better.

, After school, review what you learned that day.

, This will really help and increase your confidence when taking exams if you're familiar with the typical exam format, common errors to avoid, and know how the concepts in a subject area usually tested.

, It will help you maximize your learning by using effective study techniques, developing meaningful notes, and making the most efficient use of your study time.

Realize that studying is not just reading for information, it is reading for comprehension.,
Recognize unreasonable excuses that children give related to exam failure.,
Tell you child to avoid selective studying.,
Prevent your child from getting distracted while he is studying.,
Ensure that your child stays calm.",How to React After a Child Fails an Exam," Many times children fail to plan ahead and manage their time. Students must plan how to complete the courses in the available time given, while properly dividing the time between subjects.
, These could include:

“My roommate didn't set the alarm clock and I was not given enough time to get read.”

My school bag got stolen several days ago and I lost all my notes.""


""I thought our teacher would not ask any questions from the last two chapters.""

, Remember, an exam covers the entire content of a course, not merely selected areas of your course., Many times, children listen to music or turn on the TV while studying. It distracts the child from focusing on the material. Eating too much food while studying can distract children. and consume too much time. Although sitting on a bed may be comfortable, a bed can also lull a child to sleep instead of keeping them focused. Many children like group studying, but ensure that it doesn't morph into a gossip session. A bad environment, such as an uncomfortable chair, desk, temperature, can also result in an unproductive study session., Most children are nervous or afraid of taking an exam, although this affects some worse than others. For some children, it is enough just to think ""examination"" and their body reacts with symptoms of anxiety: rapid heartbeat, perspiration, and stomach aches.

Don't let your child push himself too hard. Because of stress and fear, children can forget the material they have studied during an exam, despite the fact that they have prepared well.

Set the stage.,
Check your attitude.,
Set small goals.,
Bring Snacks.,
Relax.,
Start with the hard stuff first.,
Break it down.,
Put it back together.,
Work in slow motion.",How to Practice Anything," Practicing something badly may be as ineffective as not practicing it at all. So before you even begin, make it easy for yourself to practice well by choosing a quiet, uncluttered environment. This means turning of the television, clearing off a space on the desk or table, moving to an empty room, or otherwise making your surroundings conducive to concentration and productive work.;
, As important as your practice environment is your attitude: Go into your practice session with enthusiasm and optimism. Having a positive outlook before you start can help you deal with the inevitable bumps along the way.

, Start out with goals that you can reach. If your practicing an instrument, trying to learn an entire piece in one practice session is a goal that may be too big to reach, which can leave you frustrated and even less likely to want to practice. The key to successful practice is to aim small. You will not only learn better what you're practicing, but also enjoy it more.

, Nobody can concentrate when they are hungry, thirsty, or tired so make sure you have some snacks on hand for when your attention is flagging.

, Before you practice take several deep, slow breaths in through your nose, filling your lungs with air. Then slowly blow the air out through your mouth. Do this several times to bring yourself into a relaxed state of mind.

, Whatever you are practicing-whether it's a piece of music or a swimming stroke you're trying to master-take a look at what you have to do and figure out which parts are hard and which parts are easy. Then, work on the hard parts first. This will accomplish a few things: First, it will get the stuff you dread out of the way, and free you up to spend time on the things that come easier to you. Second, it will make all the hard parts seem easier. Starting out with the hard stuff with a fresh mind will be easier than trying to tackle the tough stuff when you're tired from practicing everything else.

, Even if you have already started your practice with small goals, it is always a smart technique to break it sown even further. That means working in bite-size chunks. If you're working on music, that may mean working on one measure at a time; if you're memorizing a speech that may mean practicing one sentence at a time. Practice those small bits until you are able to do them five times in a row. Once you have one bite size chunk done, you will be able to move on to the next.

, Once you've practiced in small bits, then your job is to put them back together. In our music example, that means going back to that first chunk of a measure and making it twice as big. In our speech example, that means going back to the beginning and practicing two sentences at a time. One you can do that, keep enlarging those bite-size chunks you've been tearing off until, eventually, you put it all back together.

, For things such as homework, this means slowing down and not rushing through, reading carefully, and not skimming. For things such as a dance recital, this means working is literal slow motion, like a super slow motion instant replay in sports. Play or dance in very slow motion and you may be surprised at how much attention you give to small parts. Once your able to practice in slow motion, speed it up. You will improve greatly without a doubt.

Set priorities.,
Choose your study area wisely.,
Have everything you need.",How to Plan a Study Day1," It is easy to become overwhelmed when studying, especially when you have a very limited amount of time. Determine study topics in highest need of studying and in least need of studying.


Create a study checklist. Make a column listing the reading, assignments, lecture notes and handouts that were covered in class. Next, highlight the areas where you are the weakest. In addition, highlight areas that received the most attention during instruction.Identify areas in your notes where you have vague or insufficient information. Review a classmate’s notes to help fill in these gaps.Setting priorities are important, but be sure to not over prepare. Avoid trying to study all of the material covered in class. Your instructor will most likely test you on the most important ideas and concepts, so focus your attention on this.;
, Where you study is as important as what you study. You need to study in a place that is free from distractions and conducive to learning.


Choose a place to study that is free from TV or computer distractions. Also, don’t study around people who will distract you with off topic conversation. Consider studying at quiet places such as a library, coffee shop, or on campus study lounge.Sit in a straight back chair where you can maintain good posture and that isn’t too relaxing to avoid possibly falling asleep.Lighting and temperature are important too, so choose a well-lit area with cooler temperatures. It is difficult to focus when studying in a place that’s too hot.

, Make sure you are adequately prepared for studying by having all of your necessary resources and materials. This will prevent you from having to search for these things and wasting precious study time.


Bring all necessary textbooks, calculators, notes, and writing utensils such as highlighters, pens and pencils. Bring along some music if you find that helps you when studying.
Consider using only paper-based resources and materials and leaving your laptop and other electronic devices behind. It is too tempting to become distracted with emails, social media, and online games.

"
"
Map out your time.,
Take breaks.,
Stay committed.",How to Plan a Study Day2," You need a plan for how you will use your study time. Determine the amount of time you will spend studying each specific subject. Next, determine the topics that you will study, and split the time accordingly.


For example, maybe you are devoting two hours to study for an English class. You might want to devote 30 minutes to studying grammar, 30 minutes to studying literature, and one hour to writing topics.
Study the most difficult subjects and topics at the time you are most alert and attentive. The easier subjects won’t require as much energy., Your brain needs time to process and rejuvenate when obtaining a significant amount of information. Avoid studying for longer than two hours at a time without taking a break. Ideally, take short five minutes breaks after each hour of studying and longer breaks after longer stretches of studying.


For example, if you plan on studying for six hours, take a 30 minute break at the halfway point.Reward yourself during breaks. Grab a quick snack during your short five-minute breaks, and do something enjoyable during your longer break. You’ve earned it.

, There are probably a lot more things you would like to do instead of studying. However, honor your study time by setting strict time limits and sticking to them.


Set an alarm or alert to help you keep track of time. You can also simply write the times down and post it where easily visible."
"
Create an outline.,
Rewrite your notes.,
Use memory games (mnemonic devices).,
Engage your senses.,
Create study flashcards.",How to Plan a Study Day3," An outline is a useful way of focusing your attention on just the most important information. With an outline, you capture only the most important words, thus allowing you to retain what matters the most.


When creating an outline, make sure to put the information in your own words. This will make the information more meaningful and easier to recall. If you are copying someone else’s outline, also use your own words. Otherwise, you are likely to forget the information., It might seem like a waste of time, but rewriting your notes helps you to retain information. Why? The brain processes writing as a top priority, therefore allowing you to retain more information.Like outlining, make sure you take notes using your own words as well. Also, try and make connections to the information in your notes. For example, connect what you’ve read to something in your own life or to something you’ve read before.

, Remember how you used the sentence “every good boy deserves fun (or fudge)” to learn the notes EGBDF in music class? This type of mnemonic device and many others are useful in retaining information while studying.


Create acronyms as a way of retaining information. For example, the acronym H.O.M.E.S is used to remember the five Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).Use word and picture associations to recall what you study to connect new words and definitions to words and images that you can easily recall.For example, if you wanted to remember the definition of a waxing moon, you might picture yourself waxing your car, which increases the car’s shine. Therefore, a waxing moon is a moon whose illuminated surface increases., You probably recognize that you have a preferred way of learning. For example, you might prefer auditory learning activities such as listening to a lecture, or perhaps you prefer visual activities such as reading notes.However, the more senses you involve in learning, the more information you will retain.


When reviewing a concept, try to incorporate reading, writing, listening, and speaking throughout your study time. For example, if you were reviewing the parts of the body, you would not only read the definition and function of each part, but also draw a diagram and discuss the importance of each part with a study partner., Flashcards are an easy to make and an effective method for recalling and retaining information. They are also easily portable, so you can take them with you to review at anytime you want.


Create term flashcards by placing the term on one side and the definition on the other side. For math flashcards, write the math problem on one side with examples on the other. To study an illustration, on one side draw a picture with an arrow pointing to the area of focus, and the answer on the other side."
"
Study with others.,
Remind yourself of your goals.,
Exercise with friends.",How to Plan a Study Day4," Do you ever notice how more motivated you feel when exercising with others? Oftentimes, studying with others can be a morale booster as well. Be sure to have a clear plan when working with a study group to maximize its benefits.


Ideally, keep your study group small to about three to six people. Choose academically conscientious group members who have a track of record of focusing in class, taking notes, and performing well on exams. Be sure to set some group ground rules and expectations that all group members agree on. Also, set clear goals and objectives to help your study group remain focused. As a group, determine the structure of your study session. Decide how much time you will study and how much time will be devoted to various tasks. Two to three hours should be sufficient.
Spend the first half our of your study session clearing up any confusion or misunderstandings that individual group members have about the material. This will allow for other group members to clarify any problems or misconceptions.To clarify misunderstandings of specific study questions, check to make sure group members understand what the question is asking, the concepts being addressed in the question, and the steps taken to solve the problem., Don’t forget to see the forest through the trees. Your goal for studying extends well beyond passing the exam or test. Your long-term goal is to graduate, or land that dream job, or to get the certification necessary for that promotion you’ve always wanted. Keeping the ultimate goal in mind will help you to remain focused.


Use the Pomodoro technique to assist you in breaking down your work into manageable chunks so you stay motivated. Do this by setting a timer for 25 minutes to complete a chunk of work, and then taking a break right afterwards. This way, you have a chance to frequently celebrate these mini successes., Spending an entire day of studying without engaging in some physical activity is a sure way to go stir crazy! You can avoid this dilemma by scheduling some time to exercise with some friends.


Schedule an hour in your study day to meet up with friends for some swimming, biking, or playing basketball. Not only will this get you up and moving, but it also gives you some much needed time to socialize.

Know the difference between typical stress and excessive stress.,

Identify your sources of stress.",How to Reduce Teenage Classroom Stress," Stress related to schoolwork is often caused by a sense that there is too much work to do and too little time to do it all. Just as often, however, better time management skills can reduce schoolwork backlogs — and reduce stress in the process.Procrastination — putting things off to the last minute — is a common practice for many teens. It is also the source of a lot of stress when everything comes due at once. Budget your time, set a schedule, and start work on assignments and projects immediately. You’ll be amazed at how much you can get done with proper pacing.Good time management also means not “spreading yourself too thin.” Taking several advanced classes, preparing for college entrance exams, trying out for the school musical, playing on the basketball team, and being a member of multiple clubs may simply be too much. Determine your priorities and learn to say “no” or “not now.”;
, Not understanding what you need to do or how to do it is another common cause of stress related to schoolwork. When you’re confused by an assignment, don’t “get” your homework problems, or feel like you can’t keep up with a class, don’t be too proud or too timid to ask for help.When you get an assignment, especially a major one like a research paper or science project, ask the teacher to clarify the details, expectations, and time frame. If you need guidance, advice, or help along the way, ask for it.
If you need extra help with a subject, talk to your teacher or guidance counselor about options such as tutoring. The further behind you fall, the more your stress will build.

, Classroom stress is also often caused by unrealistic expectations. Sometimes other people — parents, siblings, friends, teachers — create these expectations, but at least as often you make them for yourself. When you demand too much of yourself, you usually end up having to work on homework and projects non-stop, which only further increases stress (and decreases overall performance).


Budget your time for schoolwork so that for every hour or so that you work, you can take a break of about fifteen minutes. Even short “brain breaks” can refresh your mind and body, reduce stress, and increase focus. Do something relaxing that you enjoy — take a walk, listen to music, meditate, paint, etc.Taking a short break is not “slacking off” or wasting time; it is necessary for optimal performance and health.

, Many kids and teens tend to hold onto and obsess over shortcomings, failures, and fears, and this can be another cause of classroom stress. You may be experiencing excessive stress because you are worrying about things that have already happened or that you can’t do anything about. Learning to let go of things that are out of your control can help eliminate a good deal of unnecessary stress.Part of letting go is identifying your stressors and determining which ones are beyond your control. For instance, you can’t control the avalanche of homework your math teacher loves to pile on, but you can control the way in which you budget your time for it.
Simple relaxation techniques like deep breathing (slowly taking in a breath, holding it in for a moment, and letting it out slowly); muscle relaxation (slowly and deliberately loosening your muscles); visualization (picturing a positive, comforting time or place); and mindfulness (focusing solely on your experience in the moment) can all assist in the process of letting go of stress.

, Teens can also experience excessive stress because they want to show how grown-up they are by dealing with everything on their own. In reality, being an adult means knowing when you need a helping hand, or someone to listen, or even a shoulder to cry on. Seek out the caring, responsible people in your life for help in dealing with your stress.Each person’s support network may be a bit different. It will hopefully include parents and perhaps siblings, other family, and close friends. For stress related to the classroom, teachers and guidance counselors can also be helpful.
You’ll know you’ve found the right person if you aren’t afraid to tell him or her what you are really feeling about your research paper, SAT exam, biology grade, etc. Be open and honest — you may be surprised at how helpful simply putting your stress into words can often be.

, Teenagers, like any other group, are less likely to experience stress when they feel comfortable and safe. Make sure your classroom is a welcoming place for all students, where they will be respected and valued.


Do not tolerate bullying or hurtful behavior. Even some snickering when a struggling student is called upon in class can create undue stress.
As a teacher, offer regular encouragement and support. Be a resource for stress reduction, not a source of stress.

, Stress is almost always increased by uncertainty and surprises, and reduced by the comfort of familiarity. If a student knows what to expect when walking into the classroom or starting a homework assignment, there is less likelihood of stress.As a teacher, keep your room orderly, organized, and generally consistent in look and layout. Consider posting or circulating a daily schedule for each week. Offer classroom materials and assignments according to familiar patterns (with room for “mixing things up” from time to time).
If the class is lengthy or intense, consider offering brief, planned “brain breaks.” Give everyone a couple of minutes to refresh and recharge., Regular disruptions or other inappropriate behavior can cause stress for other students and the teacher alike. While it is natural for a teacher to become agitated in such circumstances, it is better for the stress management of all involved if the issue is dealt with in a calm, deliberate manner.Whenever possible, speak with the disruptive student privately, such as after class. Chastising him or her during class may embarrass the student or simply provide the desired attention and induce more bad behavior.
In the end, though, maintaining the safety and order of the classroom has to be the teacher’s first priority. If a disruptive student must be dealt with immediately or removed from the room, act as required for the benefit of the other students.

, In an effort to combat the problem of student stress, some schools have implemented stress reduction programs. Whether or not this occurs at your school, you as a teacher can implement some basic measures in your classroom. Even brief lessons in mindfulness, meditation, or other stress-control strategies can provide lasting benefits for students.There are numerous common and simple stress-reduction techniques suited to the classroom that you can teach your students, including:The “take five” calming steps.
Deep breathing.
Muscle relaxation.
Positive images.
Positive self-talk.
Integrated movements.



, Despite the negative connotations attached to it, stress is not necessarily a bad thing, or something you’d want to completely eliminate. The stress response is a physiological reaction to challenging or threatening situations that harkens back to the “fight or flight” response required of our stone-age ancestors in order to survive.Under normal conditions, a regular amount of stress helps you to focus your mind, body, and energy on the task at hand. For instance, it is normal to have some nervous energy before a big algebra test, which can in fact aid in your performance.
Stress, however, is mentally and physically draining, and constant or excessive stress leaves you with insufficient time to recover. If you feel stressed all day while in school and all evening while doing homework, your body, mind, and emotions are all suffering from a lack of rest.

, When you experience stress, the physical response includes typical changes such as an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate, and a constriction of muscle fibers and blood vessels. In short bursts, these changes can be beneficial, but when experienced constantly, they carry numerous health risks.Excessive stress, even in teens, can cause troubling conditions like high blood pressure; headaches; eyesight problems; digestive issues; face, neck, or back pain; decreased impulse control and clouded judgment, reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving skills; and perhaps increased risks of developing several diseases through constantly-elevated cortisol levels in the body.
Visit How to Reduce Stress As a Teenage Boy for additional information on signs of stress in teens.

, Every teen student is unique, and will have unique sources of academic stress. That said, common sources of teenage classroom stress include: over-scheduling; unrealistic demands (by oneself or others); excessive pressure to perform beyond one’s ability (again, self-imposed or from others); disagreements with the teacher; difficulties with one or more other students; learning disabilities or non-traditional learning styles; or external sources of stress (family, social life, athletics, etc.) that carry into the classroom.Keeping a “stress journal” for a week or two is a good way to identify your unique classroom stressors (causes of stress). Take note of times or situations when you feel stress, and consider whether particular people, events, assignments, or other factors are the major culprits.Once you have identified what is causing you the most stress, you can develop more specific strategies to deal with those sources.
See this wikiHow article on teen stress for further detail on identifying and dealing with particular stressors.

Decide if you need complete silence or some background noise, like white noise or environmental sounds, if you’re outside, to help you concentrate.Have your books and notes organized nearby so that you don’t waste time looking for them.
Choose a chair or reading position that is comfortable, but make sure it won’t cause you to feel sleepy while you read.
Don't assume you can ""multitask,"" such as surf the internet or watch TV while you read. Multitasking is a myth. To get the most out of your reading, you'll need to focus on the book and not anything else.;
, It’s important to make sure you understand the purposes your teacher assigned the reading so that you can focus your reading on those topics and ideas. Maintaining that focus will also help you understand the book more deeply and take notes more effectively.If your instructor provided you with an essay question or topic, make sure that you understand the prompt.
If you need to answer a series of questions, read them carefully and use the dictionary and your class notes to clarify any words or ideas that you don’t understand.

, Using a basic previewing strategy will help you get a sense of the overall subject of the book, as well as an understanding of its overall organization. If you know, in general, the topics the book will cover, you’re more likely to understand it and to take good notes.Read the front and back covers of the book and the inside flaps, if any, for an overview of the subject and information about the author.
Read the table of contents for more detailed information about the subject and the book’s overall organization. Compare it to your course syllabus to determine the order you’ll be reading the chapters or sections.Read the introduction and first chapter to get a sense of the author’s style, as well as more information about the important subjects of the book or characters in the novel.

, This reflection will help you to feel more confident about your comprehension, and it will also help you to focus on the topic at hand. It will also improve your recall of the material in the book, since you it will give you a reference for the material you need to learn.


What did you learn about the subject and author of the book?
Is the book organized in chronological chapters? Is it a collection of essays?
How will this book help you to complete your instructor’s assignment?
How will you take notes?

, Establishing your background in the subject can support your comprehension of the book and help you read more actively and quickly.What is the topic of the book? What do I already know about this topic?
Why has the instructor included this reading with the other readings this semester?

, Even if you don’t have a particular assignment, you should always think about why you’re reading the book. Considering your own goals will help you understand the text and will affect your choice of reading strategies. Add your reading purpose to your reflection statement.We usually read nonfiction with a purpose of finding specific information or to get an overview of a particular topic or concept.
We read works of fiction to enjoy good stories and watch for character development. For literature courses, we may also be reading more carefully for themes that grow and change over the course of the book, or for particular style and language choices that the author makes.
Ask yourself: “What do I want to learn and what questions do I have about the topic?”

, Whenever you being reading a book, your own personal experience impacts your understanding of the story, the words, and the subjects. It’s important to recognize that your reading context may be very different from the context in which the book was written.Pay attention to the book’s original copyright date and country of origin and think about the history of that era and location.
Consider the topic of the book and note your own opinions and feelings about that topic. You may have to set them aside for a bit in order to analyze the book rationally and academically.
Be aware that the author, or authors, have different perspectives and your job is to understand their point of view as well as to have a personal response to the material.

, Taking this step will help you to read the material as the author intended, rather than only from your own perspective. It will also help you to understand the significance of events or ideas that the author presents in the book.


Ask yourself: “What is the author’s purpose for writing this material? Who is the audience? What is his or her critical perspective on the topic?”, Engaging actively with the text through note-taking will improve your comprehension, concentration, and recall. Rather than passively hoping that you will understand and remember all of the material, have a clear method for recording your responses and notes as you read.


Some students prefer to take notes in the margins of the book and to underline passages. If this is your method, then plan to gather these notes together after each reading session in a separate location.

Create a graphic organizer based on your assignment and/or your reading purpose(s). You might include rows for chapter summaries, for details about topics or characters, for themes that you notice, and for questions and responses that you have. Add notes to the organizer as you read.

, Use your preview of the book’s organization and your instructor’s assignment to determine the best way to manage your reading time. You can read for a set amount of time, or break up your reading by chapter or purpose.If you’re reading a work of fiction, you may be able to read for longer periods of time because of the nature of storytelling.
Nonfiction reading may require you to focus more on your reading purpose. You don’t need to read a collection of essays in order. Instead, try reading in order of topics or area of focus for your interest or assignment.

, If you are able to remember nearly everything, you have found a good pace. If not, stop a bit more often and try again.


As your recall sessions improve, try to increase the reading time or amounts again. As you practice, your recall and comprehension will grow and you’ll actually become a much more skilled reader.
Before starting a new session, try to recall your previous reading sessions. The more you practice your recall skills, the more powerful your concentration and recall will become., Different types of books require different reading speeds for good comprehension. Easier texts, like novels, can be read much more quickly than a collection of academic essays. The research shows, however, that going too slowly can actually hurt your comprehension in difficult material.Keep your eyes moving and your attention focused by using an index card, a ruler, or your fingertips to underline the text.
Stop to check your comprehension often to help you build your confidence as your speed increases.

, Each time that you stop to check your understanding of the details, make a note of the main ideas of the section you just completed. This list of main ideas will serve as an outline of the section that you can use to remember the material and to prepare for tests and essays.


If you’re writing notes in the margins, take this time to rewrite your notes in another location, such as a notebook, a word processing document, or a note-taking application.
Make a separate list of topics or subjects and take notes on the details you learn. Your summaries should only include main ideas and arguments, while these details are the facts and ideas that support those ideas. Add these to your graphic organizer.

, These words may be useful when writing an essay about the book, or they may be terminology that you need to know for a test. Keep a running list of these words, the sentence from the book, and the dictionary definition as a reference.

, Teachers ask students questions to check students’ understanding of the texts as well as to engage students in the topics in both academic and personal ways. If you ask questions while you read, you’ll remember and comprehend the information better, and you’ll be able to analyze and discuss it in greater depth.If you’re annotating in the book itself, write your questions in the paragraph and then gather them together in your note taking system or graphic organizer.
When you stop for a comprehension check, take a look at your questions from previous sections and try to answer them based on your new reading.
If your work of nonfiction has headings and sub-headings within the chapters, change those titles into questions that you can answer as you continue to read., Use the notes you’ve been making, either in the margins or in your graphic organizer, but keep it brief. Focusing on the main ideas will help you to see the “big picture” of the text and to connect the ideas from one chapter to another, as well as to your assignment. Carefully copy and cite the page numbers for any direct quotations that seem to answer your questions or fulfill your reading purpose.
You can also paraphrase and cite ideas that are useful to your assignment or purpose.

, Write down, in a separate section of your notes or graphic organizer, any repeated images, themes, ideas, or even significant terminology that you notice. You can develop these themes into essay topics or discussion comments, and they’ll help you think more critically about the book.Mark passages that seem important, that are repeated, or that challenge you in some way, with an “X.” Write a note in the margin, or in your organizer, about your reaction.
After each reading session, go back through the sections you’ve read and re-read both the marked sections and your notes about them. Ask: “What pattern do I see? What does the author seem to be saying about these themes or ideas?”
Write your responses next to your original notes. Include any direct quotations, with citations, and then explain why they’re interesting or important.

, Sharing your responses and the information you’ve gathered as you go will help you to remember the information better, and a classmate may be able to correct any misinformation or misunderstanding you might have. Together, you can think more actively about the major ideas and themes of the book.


Check your summaries and detail notes to make sure you haven’t missed anything.
Discuss the patterns you discovered and add any new conclusions you find.
Answer each other’s questions about the book and the assignment.

, Reread your summary notes and lists of main ideas, and then create a “master” summary no more than one page in length. This step is vital for your understanding of the book and your recall of the material. Synthesizing the main ideas in your own words leads to a more developed understanding of the book. Summaries that contain too many details may be overwhelming and distract you from the central points.
It may be helpful to use a “beginning-middle-end” structure to your summary of a novel.

, Using the main ideas as the major points on the outline, you can include the details and direct quotations as subpoints and explanations. An outline can reveal the structure of the book and support your understanding of the themes.Use complete sentences for the main ideas and short phrases for the details.
Keep your outline balanced by including the same number of subpoints for each major point.
Review your graphic organizer for ideas on how to arrange points and subpoints.

, Not only will noticing similarities between this text and others support your comprehension, comparing and contrasting them will help you explore different perspectives on the same topics. Ask yourself: “How does this author’s approach or style relate to other books on this topic or in this genre?”
Ask yourself: “What have I learned that may be different from the information or perspectives in other books?”

, Your instructor may be interested in your evaluation of the author’s reasoning and validity, so you should be able to critique the writer’s claim and the evidence he or she provides to support it. Review your notes on the main ideas and supporting details to make a critique of his or her thesis.Determine if the author seems credible: does he or she use accurate research? Is he or she influenced by particular theories or ideas? Does there seem to be obvious bias? How do you know?
Examine the graphics, such as pictures, and decide if they’re useful for understanding the author’s argument.

, Reread your notes and expand your responses to include your thoughts on the author’s style and structure of the text. Examine the author’s style and your response to it.“What style does the author use? Is it narrative or analytical? Is it formal or informal?”
”How am I influenced by the book’s format and style?”
Be sure to explain why this style and your response to it are important for understanding the book’s argument, themes, or story.

, Curiosity is one of the keys to comprehending and enjoying books, so if you’ve been asking good questions, you’ll have a broader and deeper understanding of the book.


Good questions can often lead to interesting and complex thesis statements for essays.
The answers may not be simple facts from the book; the best questions lead to greater insights about the ideas, story, or characters.
If you can’t answer some questions specifically, then ask your instructor, a fellow student, or a friend.

, Planning ahead for possible exam questions or essay topics, you’ll feel much more confident when your teacher assigns them. Even if your questions aren’t exactly what the teacher may ask, it’s worthwhile to think like a teacher so that you’re prepared for a wider range of assessments.Include different types of questions, such as short answer, vocabulary, and essay questions in order to practice your factual knowledge along with your critical thinking.
Prepare an answer key for yourself, including the essay question, so that you can use both the questions and the answers as a study guide or notes for a longer composition.
Work with a classmate to create a full-length test as a more intensive study guide.

, Reading your notes and thinking about your book will further deepen your understanding and lead to more mature responses to exam questions and essay topics. Always prepare for exams well in advance so that you can feel confident when you begin.Avoid wasting time rereading your book, unless you’re looking for a particular quote or fact. Rereading doesn’t encourage comprehension, and may lead to frustration or boredom., One of the most rewarding parts of finishing a book is taking the time to discuss it with a fellow reader. Together, you can check for understanding and details, and you can also share your personal responses and reasoning about the story or the author’s claims.


Conduct a final check of your notes for mistakes or omissions.
Have a conversation about the themes you noticed and your exploration of the ideas in the book.
Answer each other’s questions about the book and the assignment to make sure that you’ve both dealt with all of the components completely.

Consider your subject.,
Consider your purpose.,
Benefits.",How to Take Notes1," What type of notes you take and how you take them will partially depend on what the subject matter is. The format of the subject matter will also play a significant role in how you take your notes. Depending on the subject and format, you will also need to focus your attention to different types of information.


You may be taking notes from a lecture, during an assignment, or from a text. These formats each require you to work in certain ways. A lecture, for example, is fast paced and will require you to take notes quickly and efficiently.
Notes on the sciences will be very different than notes on the humanities. You might be taking notes on history, which will take on more of a narrative outline than notes on chemistry, which will focus on formulas and concepts.;
, Why you are taking your notes, your eventual goal, will also affect how you take your notes. It will play a part in determining what information you need to learn and what the most efficient way for you to learn it will be.


Test. If the material you are working with will eventually end up on a test, you will want to capture as much information as efficiently as possible. Focus on key terms, important events or facts, and broad concepts. Know the format of your test so that you can guess at the types of information that you need to know while studying.
Paper. If you’re taking notes that will be used to write a paper, you will want to focus on the types of information that you need. Take your notes to fill an outline of your paper or, if you don’t have an outline, look for themes and significant information.

, Taking notes has clear benefits. It will give you a guide for remembering information later but it will also help you to process the information. In having to think about what is important and how it should be organized, you will learn it much more efficiently. Studies have shown that students who work from broad notes do better on tests than those who rely on taking down everything verbatim."

If you don't have a bachelor's degree in engineering, you may substitute a master's degree in science, as long as it is related to engineering.You will need to prove that you have completed your degree by showing your diploma or a transcript of your final year. If you are still in your final year, you will show the last semester you completed. You can also show a provisional diploma/certificate. You can download a provisional certificate letter from the main GATE website, which your school can fill out for this purpose.;
, You cannot send in physical applications. You must apply online at your zone's website.You'll need to fill in biographical information, as well as choose a username and password. You'll also need to provide proof for certain information, such as your degree, which you'll need to upload.You'll need your address, as well as your college's address. You'll also need to provide an image of both your signature and your thumbprint.

, When choosing where you take the test, you have the option of a wide variety of cities, divided into zones. When you look at the list, you pick a first choice, second choice, and third choice. They do not have to be in the same zones.If you're an international candidate, you must take the test in one of the following countries: Singapore, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, or the United Arab Emirates. In these countries, you only have the option of one city.

, The GATE subjects are called ""papers."" You have the choice of 23 subjects you can take. You cannot take more than one. Therefore, you must decide which subject you will take before you finish applying for the test.You should choose based on where you want to get a master's degree, as most universities require a certain subject.
The 23 subjects are Aerospace Engineering (AE), Geology and Geophysics (GG), Agricultural Engineering (AG), Instrumentation Engineering (IN), Architecture and Planning AR Mathematics (MA), Biotechnology (BT), Mechanical Engineering (ME), Civil Engineering (CE), Mining Engineering (MN), Chemical Engineering (CH), Metallurgical Engineering (MT), Computer Science and Information Technology (CS), Petroleum Engineering (PE), Chemistry (CY), Physics (PH), Electronics and Communication Engineering (EC), Production and Industrial Engineering (PI), Electrical Engineering (EE), Textile Engineering and Fiber Science (TF), Ecology and Evolution (EY), Engineering Sciences (XE), and Life Sciences (XL).

, In India, the fee to take the test is 1,500 rupees or about $23. If you take the test internationally, the fee goes up. It's $50 to take the test in places like Singapore, Nepal, or Ethiopia. These fees are based on where you're taking the test, not where you're from.For women and people with disabilities, the fee is about 750 rupees.
You'll need to pay online with a bank account or bank card.

, The test is taken online. You will have some questions where you must write in the answer, while others are simply multiple choice. You can only use the calculator provided on the computer screen, as all outside calculators are prohibited.The test is 3 hours long and has 65 questions.

, In this test, you are penalized for wrong answers. Some questions count for 1 point, and you lose 1/3 of a point for wrong answers. Some questions count for 2 points, and you lose 2/3 of a point for wrong answers., Beyond subject material, you need to know how the test will ask you questions. The test will look at both your recall of facts, such as how well you know certain information. It will also test your comprehension, by requiring you to make a judgement based on fundamental knowledge. Finally, it will test how well you can apply that knowledge, as well as if you are able to analyze and synthesize information., The main website for the GATE exam has a syllabus you can use to study for the exam. Basically, it gives you an idea of what's on the test, plus it does provide some sample questions in some instances., The exam has a general portion that everyone must take, regardless of their subject. This section tests your verbal ability (in English) and your numerical ability, as well. The syllabus has sample questions to help you review., The syllabus has a section for each of the subjects you can take the exam in. It also breaks each subject down into sections and explains what each section will cover. However, it doesn't have sample questions for each section., When you apply to take the test, sit down and make a study plan. You don't want to leave the studying to a day or two before the test, and if you're a procrastinator, that's easy to do. Instead, make a plan where you work in a little study time each day for the amount of time you have left before the test., You can download and look at old exams. You can use these just for study purposes, or you can try taking them to see how you score. It can be helpful to see past questions. Keep in mind, though, that the questions will of course change from year to year.You can download just the one for your subject.

, Once you learn what will be on the test, take the time to review the relevant materials. Go over anything you've forgotten, in particular, and use the syllabus as a guide. Take time with each part of your subject, reviewing what you've learned in the past. If you don't know about certain parts, look them up to learn how more about them.

, You may want to sit in your chair and not get up for hours when it comes to studying. However, taking breaks helps your mental clarity. Try to take a break at least every hour, but every half hour is better. Get up and stretch. Move around, and shake out your brain., You may be tempted to keep cramming the night before. However, it's important to get enough sleep. You will be able to recall more if your brain is functioning properly, and it can't function if you don't give it what it needs, sleep.It's okay to review a bit the day before, but you won't have the time to really learn any new information.

, It can also help to try to find a way to de-stress. Stress won't help you take the exam, and stepping away from studying for an hour or two can help calm you down. Try anything you enjoy, or you could try meditation or yoga."

Search for your word in the index.,
Turn to the page of your word’s group or subgroup.,
Select the word that suits your needs.,
Look for rhythm.,
Experiment with different words to find the right one.",How to Use a Rhyming Dictionary1," Begin by searching for the first word you'd like to rhyme with in the index of your rhyming dictionary. Once you’ve located your word, you will be directed to either a “group” (e.g., 15) or “sub-group” (e.g., 15.3) within the rhyming dictionary. Either below the group number or next to it, you will also see a page number (e.g., p. 6).;
, Here you will find sets of words that will rhyme with your word. If you have been directed to a “sub-group,” you’ll see just a short list of words. If you have been directed to a “group” you will see a few sets of words, broken down by numbers of syllables.

, Read over the words available to you are see which ones you can use. Consider not only the literal meaning of the words (denotation), but also any cultural or slang meanings (connotation). Search for a word that not only rhymes, but fits the tone of your poem or song., A key component in any poem or song is rhythm. In addition to finding a word that rhymes, you should the rhythm of the word (or words). The ""rhythm"" might have to do with number of syllables, as well as whether or not the consonant sounds flow with the rest of your writing., Chances are, there will be several words that could accomplish your needs. Try a few on for size. Practice what a word sounds like in your song or poem until you land on the perfect one."

Basics.,
Outline.,
Terms and concepts.,
Use shorthand.",How to Take Notes2," Taking notes is more than just writing down what the lecturer says, word-for-word. You will need to position yourself to facilitate your note taking. Sit where you know you can hear and see and be sure to have enough table space to write things down. Sitting away from your friends might help, if you are prone to distraction, or you can sit with your friends if you benefit from collaborating on notes.

, As the lecturer talks, outline what they are saying. Mark in your notes when they start a new topic, then note each sub category as it is addressed. Fill in information and details as you have time. Sample outlines can easily be found on the internet, so that you can get a sense of the format.


Each lecture should have its own page or series of pages. This will help keep you organized. Make sure to date and title the pages so that you can find them more easily later on.

, Write down any terms or concepts which are new or unfamiliar to you. These should be written down separately from the rest of your notes, either on the adjoining page or in a separate notebook.


For notes on the sciences, it may be easier to accompany notes on concepts with small illustrations. Copy images used in the lecture or draw what you imagine from your understanding of the information.
Terms are probably best written down dictionary-style, with the word followed by the definition. Ensuring they are not spread randomly through your notes will make it easier to study them later on.

, A key to taking useful lecture notes is to use or develop a system of shorthand. This is where you write down a few letters or symbols which signify much longer words. Reducing the number of characters you write will help you write faster so that you can keep up with the lecturer and have more time to just listen and absorb.


For example, writing & instead of and or w/ instead of with. You can also use abbreviations, either ones you make up for familiar terms or official abbreviations.

"
Science labs.,
Math.,
Art.",How to Take Notes3," For taking notes on science labs, you may want to begin by outlining the experiment. Be sure each lab has its own page. The most important thing is to take notes in real time, so you do not miss any information or remember it incorrectly later. If possible, draw illustrations and graphs to visually represent information that does not come across well with words.

, The main key to math notes is to outline the steps. Write down, in detail, what you should do at each step and why you should do it. Make note of when things didn’t work and illustrate with equations whenever possible. When you have found the final solution and correct methods, outline these for future reference.

, For art assignments, you may wish to take visual notes of your creation process. This will help you think through your work, rather than wasting time or supplies on ideas that will go nowhere. It will also help you see gaps in your ideas and presentation, as well as lead you to think critically about what you like and why it appeals to you.


Do sketches of possible layouts and compositions. Mark the best aspects of each and eliminate what doesn't work. Take note of compositions of other works you enjoy or that fit with what you are working on. Make note of what it is about those compositions that make the original work so effective.
Make lists of themes or topics you wish to depict. If your piece is going have a larger message to it, take notes about what exactly you want it to say and how you intend to get your message across. If the art is commercial in nature, test out copy and branding in your notes before incorporating it into final design.

"
"
Define terms.,
List concepts.,
Fill in outline.,
Color coding.",How to Take Notes4," As with other subjects, you should keep a running (but separated) list of terms with which you are unfamiliar. Define them and, if desired, list pages on which they appear or are particularly relevant. This will help you go back to the text later for clarification if you become confused.

, On another page, you may wish to give brief outlines of important concepts. This will help you by keeping track of ideas which play a significant role in the text you are reading. It can also help you to simplify complex ideas.


Give a detailed explanation for all concepts. List how they arose, important people attached to them, and events in which they played a significant role. If the ideas changed over time, list this and briefly outline how.

, Begin with a general idea of what you’re trying to learn. Use a copy of your lecture outline or an outline of the paper you intend to write. When you see information in the text that is relevant to a topic in your outline, write it down and take note of the page number.


Taking note of the page numbers from which you pull information is very important, especially when writing papers. This will keep you from having to dig back through the text later in order to properly cite your information.

, Color coding your text is probably the easiest way to take notes, though it requires almost no writing. This method will help you to clearly visualize and organize the information. It can easily be adapted into an outline as well, for use in writing papers.


If reading on the computer, you can use highlighting tools to color block sections of information. Assign one color to each of the topics in your outline and then, when you find relevant information in the text, mark it with that color.
If you’re reading from a physical book, you can certainly mark text with a highlighter. It may be easier, however, to use color-coded tabs. These colorful stickers can help you to navigate the pages and find exactly what you’re looking for.

Identify “end rhymes.” End rhymes occur when the final word in a line rhymes with the final word in another line.,
Understand “slant rhymes.” Slant rhymes are also called “imperfect” or “near” rhymes.,
Recognize “internal rhymes.” Internal rhymes occur when two words rhyme within one line of poetry or song.,
Understand ”feminine rhymes.” Feminine rhymes, also referred to as “double rhymes,” occur when two syllables of a word rhyme with two syllables of another word.,
Understand ”eye rhymes.” Eye rhymes occur when words rhyme visually, as opposed to aurally; or in other words, when words look the same, but are actually pronounced differently (such as laughter and daughter, or food and good).",How to Use a Rhyming Dictionary2," For example, in the Grateful Dead song “Casey Jones” the lyrics go: “Trouble ahead, trouble behind / and you know that notion just crossed my mind.” The words “behind” and “mind” constitute an end rhyme., These occur when two words share just a vowel sound (such as hand and span), or just a consonant sound (such as prank and sink). For example, the Grateful Dead song “Friend of the Devil” uses a “slant rhyme” like this, “I set out running but I take my time / A friend of the devil is a friend of mine.” “Time” and “mine” share only a vowel sound., This also occurs with the Grateful Dead song “Casey Jones” in the line “Driving that train, high on cocaine / Casey Jones you better watch your speed.”, Examples of this include “notion” and “ocean,” or “double” and “trouble.” This occurs in The Beatles’ song “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”: “I don't know how you were diverted / You were perverted too / I don't know how you were inverted / No one alerted you.”, These are sometimes called “historical rhymes,” because at one time these words likely had the same pronunciation. The Trogg’s use this rhyme in the song “Wild Things” when they say, “Wild Thing, I think I love you,” and then later, “Wild Things, I think you move me.”"
"
Use the classic “ABAB.” This rhyme scheme occurs when you rhyme line 1 with line 3, and line 2 with line 4.,
Experiment with “XAXA.” This rhyme scheme occurs when you only rhyme lines 2 and 4 (lines 1 and 3 don’t rhyme).,
Try “ABBA.” This rhyme scheme occurs when you have a set of rhyming lines “sandwiched” between another set of rhyming lines.,
Attempt a couplet, or “AABB.” A couplet occurs when you have two rhyming lines, followed by two more rhyming lines.,
Play around with “AAAA.” This rhyme scheme occurs when you rhyme the end of four lines in a row.,
Listen for rhyme schemes.",How to Use a Rhyming Dictionary3," An example of this is the Simon and Garfunkel song “Scarborough Fair”: “Are you going to Scarborough Fair? / Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme / Remember me to one who lives there / He once was a true love of mine.”, This rhyme scheme allows for more openness and experimentation. This is used in the Paul Simon song “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard”: “In a couple of days they're gonna take me away / When the press let the story leak / Now when the radical priest comes to get me released / We was all on the cover of Newsweek.”, This occurs in the song “At the Zoo” by Simon and Garfunkel: “Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo / But you can take the cross-town bus / If it's raining or it's cold / And the animals will love it if you do.”, An example of this occurs in Simon and Garfunkel’s “Sounds of Silence”: “In restless dreams I walked alone / Narrow streets of cobblestone / ‘Neath the halo of a streetlamp / I turned my collar to the cold and damp.”, This method is also known as “monorhyme.” Clearly, this rhyme scheme can become monotonous, so use it with some caution. This rhyme scheme is used by Simon and Garfunkel in the song “Homeward Bound”: “On a tour of one-night stands / my suitcase and guitar in hand / And every stop is neatly planned / for a poet and a one-man band.”, These rhyme schemes (and many others) appear in songs, poems, limericks, and even advertisements. Keep an ear out for them! Try listening to some of your favorite songs and try to identify the various rhyme schemes used. Hopefully, this will help inspire you to write some of your own.

Get a separate notebook for each class.,
Get an expanding file organizer.,
Be prepared at the start of class.,
Pay attention to the teacher's cues.,
Title and Date all notes and work.,
Write neatly.,
Use bullets, dividers, numbering, pictures, diagrams, symbols, and highlighters.,
Take your notes in the right notebook and section.,
Use them!",How to Take Good Notes and Organize Them," While it may be tempting to have one big binder or notebook for several classes, it means that half the time you'll need to lug around ten thousand papers from various subjects when you really only need the stuff from one. Get either a notebook or 1–1.5 inch (2.5–3.8 cm) binder for each class. Three subject notebooks are usually the best- they're relatively compact but give you the dividers so you can have a section for notes, a section for homework, and a section for classwork.;
, If you look around, you probably will see that people tend to like the whole ""one single notebook and folder per subject"" idea. Really, though, this makes it easy to lose or destroy things. Instead, get a plastic file organizer, which expands accordion style to reveal pockets that can be labeled so you can keep your papers organized. Looks cool, too!

, Now that you've got the tools for success, be sure to be prepared in class. Arrive on time or, better yet, early, with all the books and things you will need. Sit down and immediately pull out last night's assignment, as well as your notebook, which you should then open up to a blank page in your notes section. Take out a pencil and eraser as well, and write down tonight's homework in your planner. Doing this stuff will save you time later and help you keep up.

, Chances are good that your teacher will tell you when she's about to tell you something you should write down, so pay attention in class and listen to your teacher. Prepare to write if she goes to write something on the board that could be important, or says something like ""You may want to write this down"" or ""This is good to have in your notes"" or something along those lines. In your notes, if she says something along the lines of ""This will be on the test"" or repeats it, put a capital 'T' with a circle around it in the margin. You'll get more accustomed to knowing when to and when not to take notes, but generally, you should take at least a few notes every class to ensure that you can later review what you did in class that day, since it will pertain to your homework and tests.

, Not only will your teacher thank you, but so will you! By titling and dating your notes, it makes it a lot easier to find the notes you need to study for a particular test and to know what you did on a certain day.

, There's no point to take notes if you can't read them later. Take the time to write neatly and clearly. It doesn't have to be your best handwriting, but it does have to be easily legible, so save the swirly script for a letter to your crush. Avoid dark smudges and scratch-outs on your paper by arming yourself with a pencil and good eraser. Make sure to leave a few lines of space between separate subjects.

, There are many ways to make your notes easier to read. Use bullets to separate pieces of information that belong together but would be easier to absorb separately. Dividers are good if your teacher chooses to jump from topic to topic. Number things that go in order, and use stars to draw the eye to important information. Pictures and diagrams can make information easy to absorb, and highlighters can help to visually separate multiple pieces of information. Just make sure to use these components in moderation- a page covered in highlighted sentences and stars may look pretty, but it's seriously distracting. The purpose in using the highlighter is to attract the eye to the certain piece of information that you need to know for a test or exam. Everyone has a different note taking style, so figure out what works for you!

, Designate a section of each classes' notebook to notes, and keep them separate from the rest of your work and papers. If, for some reason, you forget your notebook one day, borrow a piece of paper from another notebook or from a friend and record your notes on that. That night, bring your notebook home and transfer the information into it- repetition is a good thing! Also, if your teacher moves fast and you end up scrawling all over the page, rewrite the notes that night on the next page and toss the old ones when you're not rushed.

, Notes are pointless if you don't use them. When your teacher informs you of an upcoming test or quiz, take out your notes each night before the day and review the material. Even a few minutes of skimming over well taken, organized notes can make a big difference in your comprehension and grade. Some people even review their days' notes each night, too, which is a good idea to help solidify new sections or information in your mind.

Assert yourself as the type of leader that the students would like to follow and learn from.,
Structure your class.,
Have high expectations and your students will naturally want to achieve highly.,
Relax on the last day.",How to Motivate Adult Learners," The best way to work with adults is to respect the fact that they're essentially your equal once you leave the classroom. Try to assert the kind of image that allows them to respect your outside of the classroom, too.;
, Set expectations on day one and hold all students accountable for their actions. Make no exceptions for the first couple of meetings, too. Own your class and control the direction it goes in, you will find that the students will choose to follow or to leave. Luckily, they are adults, and you do not have to put up with their displeasure. If they don't behave appropriately, YOU have every right to ask them to leave.

, If they stumble and don't perform to your expectations, give them fair and honest grades. If they come to you seeking help, assist them in identifying their specific problem areas and provide resources that the student can use to improve their skills. That is just plain good teaching and it works for all students at all ages.

, Be the kind of teacher that is interesting and fun. Don't be so by-the-book that the students find you dry, but don't be wild and unpredictable. Maintain strictly professional relationships with students, but feel free to loosen your tie, or let down your hair, when the occasion calls for it. They are adults. You're not their role model, though you might be their mentor.

Skip digital distractions.,
Stop thinking about your studies.",How to Take a Break from Studying," Take one 15-minute break every 50 to 90 minutes to rest and recharge your mind. Your brain can only focus for a maximum of 90 minutes before it needs a break due to the ultradian rhythm -- a natural cycle of concentration humans experience off and on throughout the day.Exact results can vary from person to person, with some people doing best if they break every 50 minutes and others being able to go for about 90 minutes before crashing. Experiment with amounts of time within this range to find what works best for you.
The length of your break may also vary slightly from person to person, but 15 minutes is usually a good place to start. Avoid breaks that are less than 10 minutes long or longer than 25 minutes, and factor in the amount of time between breaks when determining how much time to take. For instance, a 25-minute break might be appropriate if you spend 90 minutes in between each one, but it would be more appropriate to take a 10-minute break if you only study for 50 minutes straight.;
, You may need to experiment at first to determine how often and how long your breaks should be, but once you set a break schedule for yourself, it’s important that you stick with it. Study only until you find a natural stopping point, then take your break, even if you aren’t completely done with the material yet.


For instance, if you’re reading through a chapter of a textbook, stop once you reach the bottom of the page you’re on or the end of a sub-chapter (for more complex material), instead of waiting until you reach the end of the chapter or unit.
Postponing the break may mean working past your brain’s ability to concentrate, or worse, inadvertently skipping it altogether.

, This prevents you from losing track of time during breaks so you can get back to studying as scheduled. For example, set an alarm on your phone when you step outside, or use a kitchen timer if you take a food break.


On a similar note, it may even be beneficial to set an alarm on your phone to remind you when to start your break, as well. Setting alarms should make it easier to concentrate, whether you’re concentrating on your learning material or your break time activity.

, While not a necessity, you might find it beneficial to change subjects or assignments after each break to further stimulate different brain pathways. Either plan out your study schedule to accomodate this in advance, or change gears as needed whenever your 15-minute break isn't enough to clear away the brain fog from your last assignment.For instance, if you were studying chemistry before your break, you might switch to language arts after your break.

, Fresh outdoor air helps clear your mind, while exercise promotes blood flow and makes you feel more energetic. Go for a brief walk, do sets of push-ups or jumping jacks, or engage in your favorite sport or physical activity.


If you do exercise or play a sport, make sure you don’t feel too sweaty, tired, or uncomfortable afterward. It’s best to stick with a moderate energy activity instead of a vigorous one. For instance, you could shoot a few baskets, but it might not be a good idea to play an actual game of basketball.
If the weather isn’t good or if you don’t want to exercise outside for another reason, consider including some indoor physical activity. Even marching or jogging in place for a few minutes should give you a quick energy boost.

, Clutter such as loose papers, coffee mugs, and trash can be distracting, and prevent you from being able to fully focus and relax while studying. Take advantage of break time to throw away trash and remove items you don’t need from your desk.


At the same time, keep in mind that this should be a break. If cleaning your study area seems like a long or demanding process--something to dread--it might be best to skip this activity during your break time and save it for after you finish this study session or before you start tomorrow’s session.

, Talking with someone in person or over the phone helps break up the monotony of quiet studying, and distracts you from your studies when you need a break.


Just make sure you’re able to stop talking once your time is up. Choose someone who will be understanding and willing to end the conversation early--a parent, for instance, or another friend who can coordinate their study schedule with yours. Briefly explain that you’re on a time limit, set your timer as usual, and avoid heavy conversations that are likely to extend past your break time.

, Healthy snacks such as nuts, fruits, and vegetables are loaded with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that give your brain and body the nourishment it needs to refuel so you can get back to studying.


Consider snacking on a handful of nut or seeds for some energizing vitamin E, or biting into a bar of dark chocolate (which also contains antioxidants and a small dose of caffeine). Since these foods tend to be high in calories and fat, however, you should stick to only an ounce a day.Other options might include whole grain popcorn, crackers, or chips, avocados, and blueberries.

, These exercises naturally help you feel calm and relaxed, and are effective at refreshing your brain so it can absorb more information.After setting your timer, sit somewhere quiet and comfortable, with your eyes closed or fixed on a blank space (like an undecorated wall). Take deep breaths--inhaling over five seconds, holding for five seconds, and exhaling for five seconds--and focus on the way it feels to have your lungs fill with and release the air.
There are other forms of meditation you can also dabble with. For example, you might try mantra meditation, in which you’ll repeat a short, calming word or sound--like “om”--to help clear your mind and release tension.

, Read an enjoyable book, magazine, or other content unrelated to your studies. This helps refocus your brain on another topic so you can return to your studies later on with a fresh perspective.Like any other break activity, you should make sure that you choose reading material you can break away from easily when your timer goes off. This is not the time to pick up that captivating, page-turning novel you’ve been dying to read. Instead, consider something like an anthology of short stories or a magazine.

, Research shows that listening to your favorite tunes encourages the release of feel-good chemical dopamine, which can make you feel rewarded after intense study sessions.If you’re the dancing type, consider dancing around or singing as you listen to your music, too. Doing so could also provide some physical activity, which gets your blood flowing in a way that energizes the mind.

, Showering refreshes and invigorates your body and mind, and helps you feel more calm and relaxed. If you feel frustrated or tired, take a quick shower to reset your brain.


Depending on how long your normal “beauty routine” is, you might want to save this for a break time happening later in the night, when you can skip the routine without worrying about leaving the house and being seen with your hair still unstyled and your clothes looking wrinkled.

, Foods that lack nutrition such as fast-food meals, and vending-machine snacks may be convenient, but can zap your brain and body of energy while studying. Fried foods and foods high in processed sugars are especially bad. Stick to eating healthy snacks and meals to stay energetic and alert.


Limit caffeine intake, too. Caffeine offers temporary effects as a stimulant, and can cause you to feel more tired after its effects wear off. Limit yourself to just one or two cups of coffee or tea, and rely on healthy food, exercise, and quick power naps for a burst of energy., Short power naps can help you refresh, but naps that last longer than 20 minutes can make you feel more tired, sluggish, and unmotivated. Set an alarm at all times when taking naps to ensure you don’t go over the limit.


For prolonged study sessions requiring more than one break (e.g., a four-hour study session in which you’ll take three breaks), limit the napping to one break only and try to balance it out by exercising for a few minutes during one of your other breaks.

, Avoid spending time on your computer, mobile device, or television during breaks. Browsing social media, playing video games, and watching television may seem like activities that can help you relax; however, these activities can hinder your productivity and make you feel tired. Stick to doing activities that don’t require you to look at screens on your break.


Staring at the artificially lit screen can wear out your eyes, making them feel tired and tiring out your brain as an eventual result. If you need to socialize during your break, skip the texting and opt for a phone call, instead.

, No matter what you do during your study break, remember: this is supposed to be a break! You won’t be able to effectively rest and recharge your mind if you’re still fixated on the material you were studying, so make sure that the activities you choose to do over your breaks are engaging enough to distract you, and avoid mulling over the material you just finished or the material you’re about to start on.

For the majority of the time, keep the mundane window open.,
During the break, do not engage in chat conversations you think will take forever.,
Be firm with yourself.",How to Use Facebook to Help Pull an All Nighter Studying," If you have a strenuous day filled with exams coming up, it may be better to stay up until midnight and then sleep. On the other hand, if you merely want to finish all your homework on Friday night so that you can have the weekend to yourself, go ahead.;
, It will be helpful to keep a clock nearby to keep track of the time.

, On one window, log onto Facebook. You may be feeling lonely and uninspired pulling an all-nighter. In this case, it may help to briefly log onto Facebook at 2 AM and see that all your friends are online studying as well. Open the other window to something mundane that would not distract you-like the yahoo or Google home page.

, Study as you always would. Every hour or so, get up and stretch for about five minutes. Now would be a good time to drink some water and have a small snack to eat, maybe a brownie, to inspire you. Lastly, now is the time for a five-minute Facebook break.

, On the other hand, briefly dropping by to say ""hi"" to another person who you know will not stay for long to chat, is okay. If you have any notifications, now is the time to check on it and refresh your brain.

, If you must, set a timer. After five minutes, go back to the other window, forget Facebook, and study.

Create a master schedule.,
Read your syllabi diligently.,
Carry your weekly schedule.,
Add specifics each week.,
Block off times to study.,
Keep a to-do list.,
Establish a daily scheduling session.,
Schedule exercise and socialization.,
Re-prioritize daily tasks constantly.",How to Manage a Busy Schedule As a Student1," As a student, you likely have recurring weekly responsibilities. Further, you will be notified in advance of your most important due dates and exams. Using this information, start a master schedule. Whether you use a paper monthly calendar or an online calendar, enter each weekly commitment and each important date as soon as you are made aware of them.Include other regular activities as well, such as a fixed work schedule and commuting time.
Post a paper master calendar above your desk, or keep an electronic calendar file saved on your desktop for quick access.
Expect to re-create your master schedule each term, as your course load or work schedule changes.
Consider using a weekly planner. Tangible weekly planners, which are usually small enough to easily carry with you, can be great scheduling tools. If you plan to use a weekly planner, which simply add of this information to your planner as well.;
, Your most important reading assignment in each class is the syllabus. Input all of the important information on each syllabus into you master schedule the day you get it. You don’t need to record too many specifics, in part because you’ll want to make more specific plans one week at a time., While you may find it more convenient to keep your master calendar on an electronic platform, you should still carry a weekly paper schedule as well. Ideally, print off each week as a one-page gridded document. This will already have your weekly commitment and forthcoming dates, and will have room for you to write down a more flexible, specific schedule for the week.Your weekly print out will contain your recurring commitments already. You can then add the specifics – such as what pages of which book you need to read before a certain day.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of a weekly planner is that your schedule is always with you – ready to a quick check or revision at a moment’s notice.

, Include meetings, social events, and all of the extracurricular components of your life on your weekly schedule. Simply by writing down all of your commitments in an organized fashion, you’ll improve your ability to prioritize tasks and meet all of your responsibilities.Don’t forget to schedule eating and sleeping time. The life of a busy student can often lead to skipped meals and late-night study sessions. Don’t let these behaviors become habitual by scheduling healthy eating and sleeping schedules every day.

, Each week, dedicate a specific amount of time to study and prepare for each of your classes. The amount of time for each class will likely change from week to week based on your assignments or exams, but make sure to spend a minimum amount of time on each.For instance, block off two hours per week to prepare for easier classes, and four hours to prepare for harder classes, plus additional time for assignments.
Schedule a short amount of time, such as 15 minutes, immediately prior to each of your classes. This will help you prepare for the class by reviewing material and prepping your mind to focus on class content. A similar review session immediately following each class will help you keep up in classes you find challenging.

, Aside from planning ahead and keeping a weekly schedule, keep a to-do list to help you make sure you complete daily tasks. Consider writing your to-do list right on your physical weekly calendar.If you’re using a computer printout of your master schedule, use a landscape layout with a column for each day. At the bottom of the column (or the bottom of the section for each day in a weekly planner), write down all the everyday tasks you need to complete.
To-do list tasks include things like doing your laundry, going shopping, or remembering to get a new three-ring binder.

, Every day, take a few minutes to plan out the next 24 hours. Opt for either right before you go to bed or first things in the morning. Look over the week, fine-tune your daily schedule, and add anything you need to get done to your to-do list., Regular exercise can help decrease anxiety or tension, improve your general health, and even help you meet the demands of a busy schedule. Be sure to exercise at least once a week. Ideally, participate in a scheduled team activity each week. Further, make sure that a chunk of every weekend is devoted to decompression. Pencil in a hike, or a nap on the beach. Heck, getting out on that dance floor one evening may even help you prepare for another busy week., Stated otherwise, be flexible. You’re spending more time researching than you planned, and starting to get stressed about it? Step out for a quick jog. The point being: your schedule isn’t written in stone, and don’t let it keep you doing from what you need to do.For instance, your tasks for the day piled up? Call of the date you scheduled for later. The sooner you do so the better for both your sake and your date’s.

It is likely that you will need to answer both simple fact-based questions and open-ended questions within a single assignment.


Starting to search before deciding on a research plan can waste time. It is better to break down the question into manageable portions and search for them individually. However, you will want to hold off answering any opinion-based questions until you have done some initial research.;
, Highlight the words in the question that you need to research further in order to answer the question accurately.

, Think of further questions you could ask someone in order to accurately answer the question.


For example, you are working with the question ""What social changes occurred during the Industrial Revolution?"" Write down ""When did the Industrial Revolution occur?"", ""Where did the Industrial Revolution occur?"" and ""What laws were passed during the Industrial Revolution?"" These questions will help you to get at specific details that will answer the industrial revolution.

, Try to use search terms of 2 to 3 words. They should be adequately specific to cut down your search results into a manageable amount.

, use search terms like ""Industrial Revolution dates"" or ""Industrial Revolution era.""

, In general, open-ended questions will require more research because they may include opinion or a comparing method. Fact-based questions should normally be listed as facts on a reputable site.

Figure out the route you will take to get there. If you can, walk around the school so that you will know where to go on your first day. This will help you be less stressed when your first day arrives and allow you to focus on your studies.If you have a friend or older sibling who went to the school previously, ask them what it is like.;
, Before you start at your new school, figure out what classes you will be taking. There will likely be a number of classes that you have to take, but you might have some electives that you can choose from. Think about what you courses you might be interested in and sign up for those. It will make things much less stressful when you start. You will also be more likely to do well because you are taking classes that you are interested in.


If your new school has an orientation, be sure to attend. This is likely when you will sign up for classes.

, If you know anyone at your new school, pick their brain about what classes you should and should not take. They may have some on advice classes that may be too difficult or teachers who are not very nice. This will help you avoid getting into a difficult situation later in the year.

, Once you know what classes you will take, look into what materials you will need for them. Depending on the class, you may not need to bring anything except your thirst for knowledge. However, some classes may require that you bring specific materials from home. If you do need to bring something from home, the school or your teacher will likely let you know what it is. Be sure to check with your teacher to make sure that you have everything that you need.


Your school will likely have orientation for new students, where they will fill you in on what you may need.
If your school does not have orientation, or if you miss it, call someone and figure out what you missed.

, If you feel confused or overwhelmed, be sure to talk to a teacher or counselor. They will help you figure things out and make sure that you are on the right track. Especially early in the year, it is important to stay on top of things so that your grades do not get hurt.

, If you are having a hard time with your school work, do not be afraid to reach out to someone. This can be a teacher, a friend or a parent. If you are having a hard time with a certain subject, ask your teacher for help. If a homework assignment is proving difficult, chat with a friend about it or talk to your parents. It is okay to ask for a little help. Stewing on a problem will only lead to further frustration and make it more difficult to solve.Asking for help at a new school might seem particularly intimidating, so you might want to talk to a teacher until you find a fellow student you feel comfortable with.

, Because tests and other assignments tend to cover materials that the teacher has covered in class, it is important to take quality notes. Pay attention during class and listen for important information the teacher mentions or writes on the board. Write notes that are clear and easy for you to read later.Taking notes will not only give you a guide for studying later, but will help you remember important information in the moment.
Leave space between each line so that you can add information later.

, Although it may appear to be a nuisance, homework is an important way for you to learn your materials. Completing your homework will help you master your subject and remember information better when it is time to take a test. Also, the points for homework assignments add up. At the end of the term or year, a few skipped assignments can make or break your final grade.Set aside a specific amount of time each night to do your homework. Find a time that works well for you and stick to it.

, It is not enough to simply skim over your assigned readings. You need to take some time and actively read your textbooks and other assigned materials. Find a quiet and distraction free place to sit and read.Set aside time each day to do your assigned readings. Find a time that works for you and stick with it.
Avoid reading in front of the TV. The distraction will make it nearly impossible for you to really retain anything.

, Although this may be difficult at a new school, finding a study partner will make studying more enjoyable and help you retain information better. As you make new friends, find someone that you enjoy spending time with and who will help you improve your grades. Set times for you to study and work on your homework together.Be sure your study partner is someone who is reliable. You want your study sessions to be productive and not spent goofing around.
A study partner is a great way to make a friend at your new school. Keep an eye open in your classes for someone who you think might be a good person to study with.

, When you start a new school, you might have a strong urge to keep a low profile and fly under the radar, particularly in the classroom. However, class participation is an important way to keep your grades up. Answering questions and engaging with other students will help you retain information better. It also ensures that the teacher knows who you are and develops a positive opinion of you, which never hurts.If you are shy, talk with your teacher about other ways you can participate in class. This might include writing posts for a class blog or engaging in class discussion forums online.

, A great way to stay motivated in a new school is to reward yourself for a job well-done. If you get the grade you wanted on an exam, give yourself an extra hour or two to do what you enjoy doing. Keep a positive attitude and find things that will reinforce your study habits and keep you motivated.


On the other hand, if you do not meet your expectations, take it easy on yourself. Do not get down on yourself. This will only make it harder for you to stay on top of your work.

, Because of the anxiety or excitement around starting a new school, it can be difficult to get enough sleep. Initially, this is difficult to avoid. However, as the school year progresses, it is important that you develop a good sleep schedule. You need at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep a night in order to get good grades and keep your mood stable. Not getting enough sleep will cause your grades to suffer. It will also cause your mood to be more unstable, making it more difficult to make new friends.


Try to go to sleep at the same time every night. Developing a routine around sleep will help you fall asleep.
Keep an eye on your clock. If you have to get up at 6:00am for school, make sure that you are in bed before 10:00pm to ensure that you get at least 8 hours of sleep.

, Adjusting to a new school and a different schedule can make it difficult to exercise and eat right. The stress can cause you to cut back on exercising and eat unhealthy foods, which can lead to low energy and poor grades. In order to stay motivated and keep your grades up, be sure to eat healthy diet and exercise regularly.Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, protein, and healthy fats, like avocados. Avoid foods that are high in saturated fat and sugar.
Try to get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise (i.e. walking) or 75 minutes of vigorous (i.e. running) a week.If you find that the food options at your new school are different or that you eat lunch at a different time, try bringing a healthy lunch and snacks to help you through the day.
If your school does not offer PE or gym, find time outside of school to exercise.

, When you initially start a new school, things can seem a little chaotic and beyond your control, which might cause you to lose your focus on your schoolwork. In order to regain control, you should organize your life. Create a schedule of your classes and assignments where you mark down when things are due and other important dates. This will ensure that you do not forget important assignments. Also, keep your locker, backpack, and other spaces clean and free of clutter. This way you do not lose important class materials.If you practice being more organized, you will feel more in control and the situation in the new school will appear less chaotic.

, With all of the distractions of a new school, you might feel the urge to disconnect by spending a lot of time doing things like watching TV or playing video games. Although it is important do these things in moderation, they can also distract you from your school work. If you are having a hard time balancing schoolwork, other obligations, and your personal time, try managing your time using a schedule. Free time is important to keep you from burning out but too much of it can hurt your grades.Set aside certain amounts of time for your schoolwork and for the things you like to do in your free time.
Use a calendar or a day planner to help you manage your day.

, Just because you are in a new place, it does not mean that you should quit doing the things you enjoyed at your previous school. If you enjoy playing sports, join a school team. If you like music, sign up for the band or choir. If you enjoy drawing or painting, take art classes. Pursuing your passions is also a great way to meet new friends who share your interests. Doing the things that you enjoy will help you stay positive and focused on your school.

, Although it might seem natural to be shy when you start a new school, being warm and chatty with your new classmates will make your integration much easier. You are a new person, so people will be curious about you. Feel free to fill them in on who you are.Avoid sitting by yourself at lunch. Sit by people who seem nice and who you think you might have something in common with.
Having a good community of friends around you will make it much easier to study and keep your grades up.

, An easy way to meet new people and get comfortable in your new school is to join a group or club. This can be an organization related to one of your hobbies, like a sports team or musical club, or an academic organization, such as the math or science clubs. Do not limit yourself to one group either, try out as many different groups as you can until you find the ones that you like the best.The bonus of joining an academic club is that it should help you improve your grades in the associated subject and provide you with a number of study partners.

, Your transition to a new school might be a little less painful if you stay in touch with your old friends. Write them letters and talk on the phone. You can also Skype, Facetime, or Google Hangout with your friends. Although you will make new friends at your new school, staying in touch with your old friends will make the move less painful.If you still live near your old friends, find activities that you can do with them outside of school, like going to the park or visiting an arcade.

, As a new student you may have to deal with some bullying, which can be a major distraction from your studying. You can talk to an adult about the bullying or try to avoid it, but the best method is to confront the bullying head-on. Tell those picking-on you that you do not appreciate their actions and to stop. Confronting a bully will demonstrate that you are not afraid of them take much of their power away.If the bullying persists or becomes unbearable, talk to a teacher or your parents.

, Although starting a new school might seem miserable at first, it will get better. Eventually all of the new people and places will become familiar. You will make new friends and find a place in your school. Remember to take it day by day and, eventually, things will get better.Your grades might suffer at first, but they will eventually rebound after you have gotten accustomed to your new situation.

, If you start to get a headache get up and have a little snack and some water. Don't get something sugary because you will get jittery in your seat.

, You can use your break as a reward and tell yourself a goal. If you reach that goal you can take a break for a few minutes.

, When taking your reward break be sure not to play games or go on YouTube. These get very distracting and waste a lot of much needed time.

Keep yourself engaged by taking notes and participating. If your attention wanders, say (in your head) ""be here now"" or the subject your class is discussing., Students who position themselves in the front row, in the middle of the class, get much higher grades than students who sit back or to the side.Stake out your front row seat on the first day, and stay there.


If your teacher assigns seating, ask to be moved to the front. Explain that you are worried about passing the class, because the subject is challenging for you.
If that fails, say you are concerned about failing to see the board and hearing instructions. This is not a lie, as all students benefit from being in the front row for these reasons.
Students are often advised not to sit with friends. If your friends are distracting, don't sit with them. If your friends are good students, however, sit near them and follow their lead.
Discuss the class afterwards with your friends.

, Participation will help you stay focused during class. If you aren't in conversation with the teacher, you won't have as much reason to stay focused. Answer questions if you know the answer, but ask questions if you don't. Don't be shy about asking for clarification if you aren't understanding something.

, At the beginning of the semester, go to your teacher's office hours, or visit him or her before or after the first class. Explain to your teacher that the subject you are taking has been challenging for you in the past, and that you intend to pass this class and learn the materials.


Ask if there are any additional resources you should check out before the class is underway. Teachers often have excellent recommendations of study resources and resources specific to their subject.

, If your school has a study center with free tutorials, sign up. If you or your family can afford a tutor who specializes in your subject, go for it. Tutors can be really helpful at supplementing the work your teacher does in class, because they are focused on your individual learning needs.

, Don't dismiss the importance of a subject because it is difficult for you. Rather, revel in what is beautiful and useful about that particular body of knowledge. Read journal articles and watch documentaries on the subject. Check out how it applies to your life.


Ask your teacher for help making these connections. For instance, if you are doing math you don't understand, ask how it is used in industry and design.
If you are reading a book you don't like, read about its historical importance. If you really, really hate the book, read criticisms of it as well! If you can articulate why you hate it, you will read more carefully and be able to internalize more of it.

, If you are worried about failing a class, go over the syllabus. Note what types of work are weighted most heavily in your grade. For instance, some teachers grade heavily on small homework assignments and participation, whereas others may primarily grade you on your performance on essays or tests. Make sure you are putting extra effort into the work that takes up the highest percentage of your grade.


Figure out how the grade is scored. Some teachers provide a percentage for each type of work (ex: Essays %50, Participation %10, Tests %20, Final Exam %20.)
Others work with a point system, awarding a number of points per type of work (ex: Essays: 10 pts each, a total of 30 points across the course. Participation: 1 point a day, 0 for absences.)
If your grades are percentage-based, look through the syllabus and see how many instances of each type of work there are. If essays are worth %50, or half your grade, go through and count how many essays there are. If there are 10 essays, they're only worth %5 of your grade each. If there are 2, however, they're each worth a quarter of your grade.

, First, learn what grade you need to pass. You can pass some classes with a C, while others require a high D, while still others require any D. Ask your teacher, or check your student handbook. Next, set an intention for the grade you want. If you need a C to pass, and the subject is hard for you, tell yourself you are going to achieve at least a B.


Go through and estimate what grade you need to get on each assignment to achieve your desired grade. Edit your answers are the semester progresses.

, Even if you struggled with an assignment, turn it in. Even if you are sure you will get every answer wrong, do the assignment. A 0 will hurt your grade far more than an F. Also, teachers do have some discretion in awarding points. If your teacher thinks you aren't trying, you will get a worse grade.


Don't blow off the answers. Try your best. Turning in work that has nothing to do with the assignment will make your teacher feel disrespected.
Always turn in every draft. If a teacher is collecting an assignment, do it. Even if it isn't worth any points, but feedback has been offered, turn the work in so you can get the feedback.
Do the extra credit. If no extra credit is on the syllabus, ask your teacher about the possibility of doing extra credit.
If you accidentally miss a homework assignment, ask to do make up work.

, Arrive on time, and don't start packing to leave until the instructor has dismissed the class. Coming in late could mean that you are marked absent. Bring all the materials required, and raise your hand at least once a class. Most teachers grade on participation as well as attendance.


Get your absences excused. If you have a medical or family emergency, get a doctor's note and explain the situation to your teacher.
Always let your instructor know ahead of time if you are going to have to miss class.

, Keep track as the semester progresses. Keep your own records, and check the records online if your class has a website. You may ask your teacher about your grade, but try not to pester him or her endlessly. Ask up to 4 times a semester, and only before or after class, or by email.

, As soon as it's time to study, get out the work for your worst subject. You will have the most energy and concentration at the start of your study session, so get the worst done first. That way you'll get the dread of your hardest work off your back.


Reward yourself by moving on to your favorite subject when you are done.

, Most people can concentrate well for about 45 minutes.Plan shorter sessions of study, with breaks in between. Stand up and move around during your breaks.


If you have a lot of material to cover, break it up thematically. For example, if you are studying the history of cancer treatment, try studying one breakthrough at a time., At the beginning of the week, write out what homework and study you will need to do each day, and for how long. Cross off the work you have done. If you are studying for an exam, do most of your studying in the weeks before the exam. Don't schedule anything but a quick review of key facts the night before the exam.This is because information stays in your head better if it has time to settle in.
Stick to your schedule as closely as you can. If you don't get to something, make sure to reschedule it.
Never reschedule anything twice. Once is the limit—after that, you're just procrastinating.

, Get together with a group of classmates you know are serious students. Together, discuss the material. Write up study questions, and quiz one another. Agree on a set amount of time, like an hour or an hour and a half. Put off hanging out until the studying is done.


If you do homework together, make sure that you indicate this to your teacher so that it doesn't look like you're copying.

, Prepare a quiet spot with nothing but your work to hold your attention. Clear your desk of other work, so that you do not feel overwhelmed and stressed. Music will divide your attention, but if you must listen to something, opt for nature sounds or music without words, or music you know really well and can tune out.


Turn off your phone, or put it on airplane mode so you can use its timer.
Sign out of email and social media until your study time is up.

, Before you start reading material you find challenging, read the headings, subheadings, and look at the illustrations. Pause to visualize the handout or chapter, and reflect on the purpose of the lesson. This will create a structure for your mind to fill in later when you read., Write two or three questions per page, or one question per section of the material you are reading. The questions should anticipate the material you are about to tackle.For instance, if you are reading a chapter on fractions, you might write ""how do I know when a number can be divided into numerals?"" or ""How do I divide mixed numbers?"" ""Can multiplication be used as a shortcut?""
As you go through, answer your questions. Revise them when you think they fall short, and add new questions as they occur to you., As you read the material, pause after each page read or each question answered. Think about the idea you just took in. If you answered a question, explain to yourself why your answer works. This will help you recall the ideas and put the information in your head.Review again when time has passed. During your next study session, or before your next class, go over your work slowly, pausing to remember what the key concepts were and how you figured them out."

Study in productive spaces.,
Use headphones.,
Delete the apps that distract you.,
Use small amounts of time productively.,
Reward yourself for achieving specific goals.,
Acknowledge persistent distractions.",How to Manage a Busy Schedule As a Student2," The physical space you spend time in greatly affects your potential productivity. Especially during times dedicating to studying, go wherever you are least likely to be distracted. For some students, this is at home, for others, the library, and for some, a busy coffee shop., Headphones can eliminate distractions caused by things you hear. If you prefer studying in silence, wear noise canceling headphones. Some models will play white noise. Alternatively, play ambient electronic or classical music – really, anything without lyrics – to provide background sound that may improve your ability to focus.

, This step is more important than you may think. If you find yourself on Instagram during times you’ve set aside to be studying, immediately close the app and get back to work. If this or any other app keeps pulling you away from more productive behavior, consider removing it from your phone.

, The bus isn’t coming for ten minutes? Resist the urge to start swiping through Tinder and open up your email instead. Send your professor or employer that question you’ve been meaning to ask. Even better, carry notecards with notes from one of your more challenging classes with you at all time. Even a bathroom break can help you prepare for that upcoming organic chemistry exam., Plan to call a friend later in the evening after studying for a few hours. Giving yourself something to look forward to can actually enhance your focus leading up to the reward. Further, focused studying followed by relaxation is more productive than studying interspersed with unplanned calls or texts.If you notice yourself becoming distracted, return to work and remind yourself you have plans to socialize later in the evening. This will help you keep from being distracted again.

, If something is on your mind and is keeping you from meeting your responsibilities, put down whatever you’re trying to get done and address the distraction. Spend a few minutes giving the distraction your full attention. You are more likely to able to focus after addressing something that’s been distracting you."

Assign yourself specific, measurable tasks.,
Work towards attainable, realistic goals.,
Work when thoughts arise.,
Take study breaks.,
Reflect on long terms goals periodically.",How to Manage a Busy Schedule As a Student3," Establishing goals for yourself is an important part of using your time wisely. Though you are likely working towards more comprehensive accomplishments, specific goals are more helpful for study sessions.Avoid vague, immeasurable goals such as “Read for philosophy class.” Instead, give yourself the goal of reading 15 pages or Sartre and writing a few paragraphs about the test. Similarly, instead of “study for biology exam,” establish the goal to “complete two of chapter three’s worksheets.”

, In order to be achievable, your goals should take a short, realistic amount of time to reach. Establishing the goal of studying for 28 hours next week doesn’t actually help you study for 30 hours next. However, deciding to study 4 hours every day next week can help compel you to reach 28 hours of studying!, You’re already planning on starting a paper tomorrow and it’s already late. However, an idea occurs to you. Take advantage of moments such as these by sitting down to record your thoughts. You don’t necessarily need to start writing, but you can get a head start on tomorrow’s tasks by reading the paper’s prompt and nailing down your specific topic., Break up any study session longer than 90 minutes. In fact, plan to study for only 45-90 minutes at a time, with 10-15 minutes breaks in between focused sessions.Try to establish a schedule that incorporates 3 total hours of studying each day, broken into multiple study sessions.
If possible, study during the day, as opposed to the evening, as your mind will be able to focus better and your memory will retain more.

, Once a month, spend a few minutes reflecting on your long-term goals. Are the ways you’re spending your time contributing to the achievement of those goals? If not, look for ways to tweak your schedule and behavior to ensure you’re on track to meet your goals both short and long term."

Getting precise results on a search engine can be difficult.,
Open up several tabs on your Internet browser.,
Search on scholarly search engines.,
Search for media on media-specific search engines.",How to Use Search Engines for Homework2," Search engines often rank things that are current or for sale high on the results, when you want to do historical, fact-based research. The following best practices will help you to get the best out of each search:


Make your terms specific. For example, if you know your class is discussing the English Industrial Revolution, type in ""English Industrial Revolution date"" instead of ""Industrial Revolution dates,"" because the search results will be focused on English history rather than industrial revolutions in America, India or other countries.
Use correct spelling. If you have trouble with spelling, look a word up in the dictionary or run your homework questions through a spell check to try to catch any errors. Although some search engines can recognize when a commonly misspelled word appears and change it, this is uncommon with proper names like people and places.
Type in the word ""AND"" to specify that all search results must contain keywords. You can also type a plus sign, ""+"", in place of the word ""and,"" so that the search engine knows to look for all terms together.
Type in the word ""OR"" between terms to specify that search results can contain either of the terms.
Type in the word ""NOT"" before a search term to exclude it from your search. You can also type the minus symbol before the word to exclude it. For example, typing ""Industrial Revolution -India"" will exclude search results that have the word ""India"" in them.

, Type in the URL address for some commonly used search engines into each tab. Use popular search engines, such as Google, Bing or Yahoo, but also try search engines specifically made for students.

, Try iseek.com, scholar.google.com, ojose.com, which is the online journal search engine and scirus.com for scientific research. While it is good to know how to navigate popular sites, these engines will save time in finding reputable sources.

, Search for video on Blinkx.com and for images on Picsearch.com, Pixsy.com and Retrievr.com.


Using specialized media and educational search engines will take you closer to finding reputable facts and sources. It is important to cite your sources, when asked, and to avoid using inaccurate or opinion-based websites.

"
"
Evaluate each website that you find using a search engine.",How to Use Search Engines for Homework3," If the website does not appear to be reputable and list its sources, then you should try again using another website from your search results. The following are ways to evaluate websites:


Give preference to any sites that have strictly controlled URLs. This means that any website that ends in .gov, .mil, .edu or .org falls into the institutions of government, military, school or non-profit, respectively. These organizations vouch for the material and are more selective that personal or company websites.
Determine if it is someone's personal web page. Look for a name, such as Jill Peterson, jpeterson or j. peterson, at the bottom or side of the page. Look at the author or ""about"" section to determine who has gathered the information. If the web page is personal, you must find out if the author has enough credentials to be an expert in the field. Most personal web pages give opinion, but it may be worth citing if the person is an academic or author quoting from their own journals or books.
Look for the publisher. The publisher is often listed in the ""about"" section, at the bottom of the page and in the URL. Decide if the publisher is a news resource, such as The Washington Post, or if it is relatively unknown. Search for information about the publisher in a search engine to find out if they are academic or news related. If not, it may not be a reliable source.
Look for the date the information was last updated. Near the top or bottom of a page, there should be a date listed when the information was last updated. If it is not recent, consider finding a source with more recent information.
Look for links or sources. If the person quotes other sources, ensure they are listed accurately. A well researched article should have a short bibliography or source link at the end.
Use your best judgment. Ask yourself if the tone and language of the website seems professional and objective. If it seems like opinion, look for a more balanced source.

"
"
Use search engine best practices and website evaluation for each of the search terms you have identified.,
Copy and paste relevant information onto a word document.,
Copy and paste the website URL and the date you researched at the bottom of each cut and pasted excerpt.,
Make a works cited page, when requested by your teacher.,
Read all of your information once you have gathered it.,
Respond to your homework assignment questions in your own words.",How to Use Search Engines for Homework4," Try to work systematically through your research questions, instead of hopping back and forth.

, In order to downsize the information you have gathered into a manageable size, you will need to take the portions that answer your question and place them on a document next to the research questions.

, Although you will use the information you have gathered to study and answer questions in your own words, you may be asked to cite your research.

, Ask your teacher whether it should be in MLA or AP style, since it will change how you refer to the websites.


Good resources for bibliographies are easybib.com/reference/guide/mla/website and mesacc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=38266&sid=281078.

, Reread for content and detail. Highlight any information that you may be able to quote directly.

Know what type of a learner you are.,
Look over the material briefly before you start studying.,
Write the material on index cards.,
Watch TV programs relating to the subject.,
Research on the internet.,
Study with a friend.,
Listen to an audio of a book full of information on the subject you are revising, if you are an auditory learner.,
Keep track of the major terms in reference to your topic.,
Record your study notes, or formal study guides, or language lessons and replay these notes softly as you are falling asleep.",How to Study Without Looking at Books or Notes," There are three types of learners: Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic.


Visual learners learn by looking at charts or graphs. Using colorful posters that are full of information, mind maps or flashcards tends to work best for visual learners. Try using flashcards and write your notes in a colorful way.
Auditory learners learn by listening to things. They learn better by listening to an audio story, listening to a teacher or debating with a friend. It also helps to read the information aloud, record yourself and then listen to it later.
Kinesthetic learners learn by doing things. They learn better re-acting a scene, making signs, or playing active learning games. Walk around while reciting your notes loudly, or make posters or signs which can help you to understand things better.;
, Make sure you understand it. Where possible, make sure you have formatted it in your preferred learning style. Also, most importantly, focus in class so you understand everything you need to know. If you don't know any terms, phrases or information, ask your teacher or a friend.

, Then, place the cards around your home. Whenever you see a card, you have to answer its question. A good place to put one of these cards is right below or above a light switch, so every time you turn a light on or off you see the card. Even if you get the question right, turn it over to help implant it into your brain.

, For example, for French class, watch a movie in French. For a History assignment, watch a relevant documentary. You should be able to find some videos about your topic, whether online or on television. If you are learning a foreign language, it is best suggested to watch animes is dubbed language with subtitles. Write down every new word and you would be surprised at the rapid growth in your vocabulary.

, You'd be surprised how much you learn, and how much you want to learn about the subject. There is so much information on the internet! Use it for your benefit! However, some websites may be unreliable, or the authors may have skewed the facts to match their biases. Look through the editing of the websites and make sure that they look legitimate. Always double check your sources.


Any website that ends with "".gov"" or "".edu"" is generally reliable for use, as it is created by a Government source or an education center. "".org"" is also dependable since it is created by specialists on that particular subject or topic, but you must check your sources on "".com"" since their authenticity may be doubtful.

, Call up a friend and study with them over the phone, or using computer-linked social media. Remember to avoid distractions and concentrate on the issues related to this study topic. Make a brief study guide, or quiz each other on important vocabulary that you must know.


Debate the topic with your friend. Share your opinions. You never truly learn something until you test it in debate!
Watch an informational TV show or program. There are many wonderful programs on the computer and television. It may be a lot easier than the alternatives, because there's always something for you to watch, no matter what subject. Try Discovery Channel, PBS, or a series like Supernova or The Magic School Bus.

, It helps if you have an e-reader like a kindle or a nook.


Try to recall what you have learnt so far. Replay everything in your mind. This shows what you really have committed to memory. Quiz yourself in your mind! This can sometimes -- surprisingly -- keep you interested, especially when you are lost in thought trying to remember something. You're completely engaged then!


, This can be done by writing those terms in bold on top of the pages of your notebook. This would help you to revise everything related to that term every time you go through your notebook!

, The idea is that the mind, in moving to a more relaxed alpha state, learns better and retains more.

, During this, read for content. Try to understand the overall message or story. Put a * with a pencil when you read something that you think is important, rare, or stands out. If you want, just read a page at a time.

, This time, read over, and see if the points with the * are still that important. If they are, Highlight them. There should be no more than 10 lines on a page that is highlighted. The highlighted points would help you find important quotes or sentences when you need them later on, or to study for exams. This way, you can skip reading it again, and only have to read the highlighted important points.

, Pull out your notebook and summarize what you read. Try to make it as short and precise as possible. You can make jot notes or a paragraph, which ever is easier for you to read later on.

, You already read through the passage twice and used your own mind to rewrite and make notes, so it should be stuck in your head. But remember to review every 2-3 days to make sure you don't forget.

, After reading comes the most important step–recollection. Recollection is what you get grades or marks for. Be prepared to give a thorough and detailed answer to the question, ""What have you read?"" If you can remember it now you will most likely remember it later. Your brain is like a muscle; you need to train it to do the job by doing it again and again. After all, you did not learn to run without learning to walk. You have learned your mother tongue by repeating again and remembering the use and meaning of every word you have heard from anyone around you.

Once your body becomes conditioned this way, abstaining from food and drink will become effortless when you are actually fasting and you will be able to concentrate on your studies.;
, It is pragmatic to start the air conditioning or cooling system well before time because in summer, it takes longer to get the room walls cooled. Keep the windows shut unless the air outside is cool; keep the blinds shut and the doors closed. Get used to the environment of the house.

, This idea may seem obvious but by breaking the syllabus/homework in small accomplish able tasks, you won't feel overwhelmed.

, Use this day as a diagnostic to tell you what changes need to be made. Improvise your schedule for better results.

, Keep as far away from the kitchen as possible, try staying in the coolest room of the house. If you are in the school try staying out of the sun. Staying cool is very important as it is the only way you can concentrate on your studies completely.

, Also if you complete all your tasks in the beginning you will feel more at ease. It is much cooler at sunrise and since most of the people are asleep, it is easier to focus.

, Try fitting them in between daily activities e.g 20 minutes of revision each hour etc.. This way it becomes easier for you to study and it keeps your mind occupied and off the hunger and thirst.

, In school, try to talk less, as you may lose essential energy. Find a cool and calm place during the break and read a book etc. Otherwise you can use this time to create a homework schedule.

, Just make sure no water enters the body or you may break your fast. This will considerably cool you down after a hot day at school.

, Try doing the written work first as it requires less effort than learning and you don't need to focus much.

, This will help you pass time quickly.

, After you break the fast, you get your energy back; this is the time to complete the rest of the tasks for the day. Drink lots of water between these times, water helps with concentrating. Make plans for the next day.

Although you don't want to get bored, you want to make sure you are in a place that is free of distraction. Distractions are counterproductive to learning and will actually cause you to become more bored because you are reminded of the things you could be doing other than studying.


Find a place that is well lit and temperature controlled. The light will help you stay focused and on task and the moderate temperature will help you avoid being too cold or too hot, both of which can lead to distraction and cause boredom.
Make sure there is enough room for you to spread all of your materials out. Also make sure it is tidy. If you are more organized, you are more likely to stay on task and not get bored.
Try other locales besides your bedroom or home. There are many distractions that can crop up while you are surrounded by your familiar environment. Places such as a library quiet floor are great places to study. It is made to be quiet, you are only surrounded by your study materials, and you are not likely to be interrupted since most people are there to study as well.;
, If you are too comfortable in your study environment, you are likely to get distracted, bored, or fall asleep. Avoid lying down when you need to study. You want a chair that supports your back and body, but don't sit in a chair that is too comfortable. You don't want to get bored or sleepy, which will defeat the purpose of your study session., One reason you get bored may be because you have no clear idea of where your study session is going or what you need to accomplish. Plan ahead and have what you want to do in your mind before you begin to study. Lay out what you know you need to get accomplished and how long you need to take to complete it. This way, you will have a clear objective, which will help you combat boredom. If you know when you can go back to playing video games or talking to your friends, you will be more likely to concentrate of your studies., To help you not get bored while you are studying, you should change up the topics that you are studying. It is unlikely that you only have one subject to study for at a time, so mix up what you study every half an hour to an hour or so. For example, study history for 45 minutes, math for 45 minutes, and English for 45 minutes before looping back around to the beginning. Make sure you don't spend all your time on one aspect of your content. If you switch it up often, you will be less likely to get bored of the subject that you are studying.


Try leaving your favorite subject to last so you have something to look forward to. You can also choose to study this subject a little longer than the others, which will help keep you on task longer without getting bored.
You can also lead with the subject you like second best, leaving your least favorite subject for the middle. That way, you will start with something you like and have your favorite subject to look forward to while you are studying the subject you hate., Studying during the time of day where you are most awake and active can help you study for longer periods of time without getting bored. You will be more aware and more likely to take in what you are studying as well. If you study at the same time everyday, you will get into the habit and train yourself to be in study mode at that time of day. This will help you not get bored because your mind will get used to the activity and be less distracted by other stimuli., Sitting in the same position for hours, especially when you are studying for a big exam, can lead to massive bouts of boredom. Try breaking it up with small breaks every hour or so. If you have been sitting down for a long time, take a stretching break. Reward yourselves every hour with a 10 minute basketball break or take a short jog around the block.This will get your heart pumping and help keep your mind focused on the tasks at hand. Plus, the less time you spend in one place, the less likely you are to get bored with the activity you are doing.You can also take a snack break as well. During one of your breaks, make yourself a healthy snack. Eat a snack high in protein and fiber, which will leave you fuller and will help you stave off boredom caused by hunger later in your study session.
Try a half a cup of trail mix made with walnuts, almonds, granola, and raisins. You can even throw in a few dark chocolate morsels. These ingredients will fill you up and give you the fuel you need to keep going., If you find some of the material that you are working on to be a little dull, try making it into a game or making flash cards. You can even make up a song to help you remember tough concepts or lists of information you need to memorize. This will make learning the information fun and help keep you interested in what you are doing. Plus, you will be less likely to get bored if you are focused on creating the game or making the flash cards., One way to help you get through a tough study session is to have something to look forward to when it's over. Tell yourself that you can have a large ice cream cone at the end or you get to start the next level in your video game. Even make plans with your friends for an hour or so after you know you'll be done studying. However, tell yourself that you can only get the reward if you truly focus while you study.


If you are working toward a goal like that, you will be more likely to focus on your tasks and not get bored because you have a fun event or tasty treat waiting for you when you are done., If you keep your mind and body engaged as you study, you will be less likely to get bored and distracted. While you are reading a chapter in a textbook, have a notebook out and jot down important notes about what you are reading. Not only will it help keep you engaged, you will also be learning more because you process the information once as you read it and then again as you synthesize the information to write down.


Try writing your notes in cool, funky colors. This will make the task visually appealing to you and help keep you interested in your notes instead of getting bored with the task.
You can also use highlighters and write in your book to help you stay engaged with the material. Pick colorful highlighters that you enjoy using to increase your interest in the task., If you have your cell phone or laptop right with you when you study, you are less likely to pay attention to studying and will become bored easier. Leave you phone in you bag or somewhere else out of sight and try to leave your laptop at home. You won't be as bored, but you will not be studying. If you remove the temptation, you are less likely to get distracted and get bored.


If you need to have your laptop for study materials, avoid searching the internet, going on social media sites, or playing games.
Let your friends know that you will be unavailable for the time being while you are studying. That way, they won't try to interrupt you or cause you to get distracted. Plus, if you know they aren't trying to get in contact with you, you are less likely to let you mind wander and get bored."

Find a quiet study spot with minimal distractions.",How to Study More Effectively1," Sit down and make a list of what you think will be on an exam or quiz. Next, write down all the resources you have at your disposal to help you learn the information, such as taking a practice exam or joining a study group., Once you figure out what you need to study and how you will take advantage of the resources at your disposal, sit down and make a study schedule. Block out periods of time within your schedule to dedicate to studying and stick to the plan.


Make sure you give yourself more time than you think you need.

, You need to be in as positive a mindset as possible when you sit down to study. If you are emotionally distracted, you will be less effective at learning and retaining information. Try to think positively while studying, and don’t compare yourself to others.Try saying something positive to yourself before you being studying, like, “I am going to ace this exam!”
If you find yourself thinking negative thoughts like, “I’m going to fail that quiz,” stop the thought in its tracks. Replace it with a positive thought, like, “I’m going to master this material and succeed!”

Develop a system of organization.,
Read assigned materials before going to class.,
Review previous lecture notes.",How to Study Lecture Notes1," A well-organized set of lecture notes is one of the most important tools in your exam-studying arsenal. Scattered, lost, incomplete and non-sequential notes create stress and take up valuable time that could be spent studying, not scavenging. Here are a few ways to organize your notes to avoid these pitfalls.


Color-coordinate the folders and notebooks for each of your courses. For example, buy a green notebook and folder for science, a blue notebook and folder for history, a red notebook and folder for literature and so forth. On the first page, write the title of the lecture and the date and begin taking notes. Start each subsequent lecture on a new page and again write the title and date. If you miss a class, leave several pages blank in your notebook, ask a friend or your teacher if you can get those notes and insert them into the blank pages.
Another way to organize your notes is by purchasing a three-ring spiral binder, loose-leaf paper, subject dividers and 3-ring pocket folders for handouts and assignments. For your first course, insert plenty of loose-leaf paper, then insert a 3-ring pocket folder and finally a divider. Repeat for the next course. If you are on an alternating-day schedule, purchase two 3-ring binders. Put science and history in one and literature and art in the other, for example.
If your teacher allows you to use your laptop in class for taking notes, create a folder for each course. For each lecture, either a) start a new document and “save as” the date followed by an abbreviated title of the lecture (doing this will help when it comes time to study as you will be able to quickly see the order of the lectures by date) or b) create a running document, in which you type the title of the lecture and the date at the start of each lecture. Leave some space between lectures, and bold and enlarge the font of the lecture title and date so you can easily see when a new one begins.;
, Reading before class primes those all-important neural networks, kind of like warming up gets your body ready for a strenuous workout. It will help you better understand what the teacher is discussing, more quickly absorb and process additional material presented and more readily recognize particularly significant points (say, when your teacher spends 10 minutes talking about the poison dart frog, not the spotted salamander, in a lecture on amphibians). When reading, take down notes of those areas that are confusing. Look up terms you are unfamiliar with or that are not fully explained within the readings. Create questions that you can ask in class, if they are not clarified during the class period.


Sometimes teachers will make course materials available online, including lectures, readings and helpful resources. If not stated in the course syllabus, ask your teacher how to access these materials.
If your teacher uses electronic media in class but does not post it online, ask if he or she might do so.

, Before going to class, review the previous lecture’s notes to refresh yourself on what was last discussed. Note any questions you have and raise them in class. Reviewing the previous lecture will also help you better follow along with what is presented that day, particularly if the lectures are cumulative, or built upon each other. It also will help you be a more active listener, which is particularly profitable in the retention- and recall-testing arena.


Doing this before each class meeting will have a multiplying effect, making all subsequent study efforts more, well, effortless.
It also has the added benefit of being ready for the often inevitable and generally dreaded pop quiz!

Find a study group.,
Ask each other questions.,
Take turns leading discussion.,
Quiz each other.,
Make the information into a game.",How to Study Without Getting Bored2," If you get bored and distracted easily when you are studying on your own, try working with a study group. You are all studying the same materials, so you all have a common goal. Look for people in your class that also might benefit from a group study session.


You want to make sure the people you choose are people you can get along with. You want the study session to be productive, not full of drama.
Although you can socialize a little bit when you first meet up, make sure you don't waste a lot of time just talking. Try to get straight to studying as soon as you can., One of the benefits of studying in a group is that they can help you understand concepts you aren't sure about. If you have a question, ask one of your group members to help you understand. The whole group will benefit from the discussion. If you were alone and confused, you would be more likely to get bored because you couldn't engage with the material. Now, you can engage with the material and with each other in order to better understand the information.This can help those who fill uncomfortable asking questions in class. If you are too shy or embarrassed to ask your professor when you are in class, you can ask one of your group mates instead. This way, you avoid any uncomfortable situations and can get the help you need., A great way to learn tough material is to teach it to others. In your study group, assign each other sections of the information to reteach to the study group. This way, not only will you benefit from teaching it to others, you will also get to learn from your group mates and get a different take on the material. Plus, with so many people talking about different topics, it will be really hard to get bored while you study., Once you have studied in a group for a while, you can start quizzing each other on the information you have been learning. You can make flash cards or try a round robin approach, where each group member asks a question to the group and, once it gets answered fully, the next person gets to ask the question. This will help you stay engaged in the information because it isn't just you quizzing yourself.In situations like this, the others are there to help you see different angles and to help you come up with ways to remember the information., When you have a ton of people, you can create multi-player games to help you all learn the information. If you love a sport, make it into a study game. Find a board game you all like and turn it into a study session. Before you know it, you will all have the information memorized and you will not have to worry about boredom.


Play a basketball game like Horse. Every time any of you miss a question, you lose a letter. To gain a letter back, you have to get the question right without looking at the answers. This will get a little competition going and help you all learn the material.
Take a board game like Trivial Pursuit and turn it into a study game. Assign a subject or facet of your subject to each color. For example, if you are studying history, you can break your questions down into categories based on centuries, decades, or large concepts you need to remember. Each time you land of a specific color, you have to answer a question about that topic.

"
"
Find your book at the library.,
Search for the book online.,
Borrow a friend’s book.,
Look for other books on the subject.,
Search for alternative sources online.",How to Survive Forgetting Your Homework at School2," It is very likely that a copy of the book will be held at your school’s library. You may be able to search by the name of your course, the course number, or your teacher’s name.If the library at your school is not open, a public library may also have the book.


You can search an online card catalog or call the library to see if they have your book. Then go there in person and check it out.
Sometimes the textbook may be “on reserve,” meaning you will have to work with it in the library.

, You may be able to find an ebook or PDF of the book. Search by the title of the textbook, the publisher, and/or the author. Download the PDF or ebook and read it on your computer or tablet.


Ideally, you will want to try to find the exact same edition, but a different edition will be better than nothing.
If you can find out the ISBN code for your textbook, this can be a good way to search as well.

, If you have a friend in the class, call them up and ask them to borrow their book. If they have the same assignment, you may need to wait until they are finished using the book. Another option is to go over to their house, share the book, and work on the assignment together. Be careful not to violate your teacher’s policies on completing assignments!

, If you simply need your textbook in order to answer questions, you may be able to find different books containing the information. If you need information about United States history, for example, the library will have many books that will contain the answers you need., You may also be able to find the information you need using online sources. For example, if you need information on cell mitosis, you can probably search for an article online that will have the information you need to complete your homework."
"
Go to school early the next day.,
Work during any free periods.,
Stay after school.,
Email it to your teacher.,
Get an extension.",How to Survive Forgetting Your Homework at School3," If there was no way for you to complete your assignment without the materials you left at school, try to go in early the next morning. If your school offers early morning study hall (or a breakfast period), you can easily get there early and work in the morning. If you need to get into your classroom, you can email your teacher to see if he or she can let you in early.

, If you are not able to go into school early (or if you do not finish your assignment during that time), you can work during any downtime you have during the day. If a teacher gives you time in class to work on something, you can work on the homework from last night instead. You can work during any free period, recess, or lunch in order to get the assignment done.

, If you were not able to get the assignment done during your school day, you may still be able to turn it in without getting a late grade. Talk to you teacher and find out if you can stay after school for a little bit to finish the assignment. It is likely that your teacher will need to stay for a little while anyway, and he or she may respect your initiative to get the late assignment complete as soon as possible.

, A similar option is to email the assignment to your teacher. Sometimes if you can get it to your teacher the same day it is due (even in a digital format), your teacher will not mark the assignment late.Talk to your teacher and find out if this is an option for you. Then complete the assignment as soon as you get home.


If you have multiple email accounts, use the one associated with your school.
Once again, use proper grammar, complete sentences, and good etiquette when you communicate with your teacher via email.

, If all else fails, talk to your teacher about getting an extension. Explain what happened, describe all the methods you tried in order to get this assignment done, and ask for permission to turn it in late. If this has never happened before, your teacher will probably appreciate your honesty and let it slide. If that happens frequently, however, you may not be as lucky."

Study in intervals.,
Quiz yourself.,
Use as many senses as possible.,
Play a memory game.",How to Study More Effectively2," Long, extended study sessions with no breaks will not help you learn information effectively. To be an effective learner, you will need to take regular breaks as you work. Try studying in 30 minutes intervals, and taking a 5-10 minute break at the end of each interval., Use flash cards, mock quizzes, and practice exams to more effectively learn information. Taking a test helps you learn information better than simply re-reading the information. Try creating flash cards to quiz yourself. You can also create, or ask your instructor for, a mock quiz or practice exam., Some people retain information better if multiple senses are engaged in the study process. One way to incorporate multiple senses while studying is by reading your notes out loud as you rewrite them. This approach uses multiple senses and might help you retain information more effectively., Try using a song, acronym, or mnemonic device to help you remember information. For example, if you need to memorize the notes of the treble scale, EGBDF, you can assign the letters a set of words or phrase that is easy to remember, like, “every good boy does fine.”"
"
Rewrite your own notes.,
Put other people’s notes or outlines in your own words.,
Outline the information you need to learn.",How to Study More Effectively3," When you rewrite your notes, you are reiterating information that you are already familiar with. This repetition can help you recall information from the notes more effectively. Try writing a copy of your notes before an exam or quiz to help you remember the information., It’s okay to copy someone else’s notes once in a while, but you should put them into words and phrases that make sense to you. Putting information into your own words can help you remember the important stuff later on., Creating an outline from class notes and materials is an active way to study your notes and other materials from the class. Try taking your lecture notes and making an outline of the information you took down in class. You can also incorporate information from your textbook in the outline."
"
Review your lecture notes strategically.,
Reduce your notes.,
Recite the information in your notes.,
Reflect upon your lecture notes.",How to Study Lecture Notes2," Though reading, and rereading, lectures in a short time frame (often the day before the exam) is common practice, research has shown it is a very ineffective study strategy. Your mind is not, after all, a video recorder. Nonetheless, reading each set of lecture notes more than once is still very helpful, if done correctly. There are two ways to get the most benefit from reviewing your notes: spacing the time between studying and mixing up study topics.


Space out the time between studying each set of lecture notes. For example, read over your notes within 24 hours of taking them. If you do this, you will retain approximately 50% of the material. If you wait longer than 24 hours, however, you will only retain about 20% of the material.Then wait another week or two to read that lecture's notes again and so forth.
While waiting to reread might sound counterintuitive (Won’t you forget a lot by waiting, after all?), cognitive psychologists have found that the closer you are to forgetting the material, the more you will cement the information to your long-term memory through the process of re-exposure and remembering.Additionally, read your notes aloud. This converts a passive activity into an active one and creates auditory links in your memory pathways.Mix up the topics you study. Let’s say you’ve set aside two hours of studying per day. Instead of spending an entire study session studying your notes from one class, spend a ½ hour studying one subject, a ½ hour studying another subject, and then repeat. Mixing up topics in this way (interleaving) requires a type of information reloading that forces your brain to notice similarities and differences – a higher order of information processing that leads to greater comprehension and long-term retention.Part of this study technique’s modus operandi is that as soon as you begin to feel like you really know the material, you need to switch it up and work on something else for awhile. So put away that blue notebook and pull out the red one.

, The same day as you take your notes, or shortly thereafter, summarize your notes. Identifying the key points, concepts, dates, names and examples provided in the lecture, write a summary of that lecture’s notes in your own words. Writing them in your own words will force you to flex those brain muscles. The more you flex them, the stronger they will become. (There really is truth to the adage, “If you don’t use it, you lose it!”) Finally, write down any questions you have related to the material so that you can seek further clarification.Another way to do this is by constructing a concept map, which is a diagram that encourages critical thinking by visually showing relationships between concepts that help you organize and evaluate both the main ideas and supporting details presented in your lecture notes. The more connections you make between concepts, the more likely you are to both remember the material and to understand the “bigger picture,” a particularly useful ability for essay questions, essay exams and finals.Of note: Recent research has found that, while students tend to record more of what the teacher says verbatim when using their laptops as typing is faster than writing, students who take written notes comprehend and retain more because taking notes by hand requires active listening and purposeful selection of what to write.Nonetheless, many students still try to hand write everything the teacher says. To promote retention and efficiency in studying your notes, create an outline from your notes. It will make your likely copious notes more manageable and help move the information more quickly down those neural pathways toward cementation through the process of repeated exposure.

, Review your notes, summary, concept map or outline for a few minutes. Then recite, aloud and in your own words, this information. Do this 2-3 times and then repeat at time intervals per the spacing effect guidelines.


Reciting is one of the most active means of studying and learning. It will help you discover the gaps in your memory and understanding, elaborate on the main ideas and concepts, test your overall comprehension and help you make connections between issues.
You can also create cue cards to use when reciting. Pick up a pack of unlined 3x5 or 4x6 notecards and write cue words (never full sentences) – or a main idea, date, diagram, formula or name – and begin discussing it aloud. If you’ve created them in order with, say your outline, shuffle them before reciting. This plays back to the idea that mixing up information forces your brain to work harder, thereby storing the information more securely.

, Reflection is the process of pondering or thinking deeply about content.Because we are more apt to remember things that we can personalize, reflecting upon what we’ve learned and how it relates to our experiences can be particularly helpful. Here are a few examples of questions you can ask yourself to enhance the reflective process. To get the most from reflection, record your answers in some way, whether that be through traditional writing, outlining, diagramming, audio recording or another means.


“Why are these facts important?”
“How can they be applied?”
“What else do I need to know to make the pieces all fit together?”
What experiences do I have that relate to this information?”
How does this all relate to what I already know or think about the world?”

"
"
Transform lecture notes into flash cards.,
Create concept cards from your lecture notes.,
Create practice self-tests from your lecture notes.",How to Study Lecture Notes3," Studies have shown that students who use flash cards to study for exams score significantly higher than those who do not, making this a cheap means of yielding high returns.You will need to buy either 3x5 or 4x6 unlined index cards, and a pencil, pen or marker that won’t show through on the other side after writing. Begin by writing a short question on one side of the card and the answer on the other side. Select the first card, read the question and answer it. Flip the card to see if you answered it correctly.


Keep all of your flash cards in one stack instead of separating them into smaller stacks. Doing this initiates the spacing effect, which enhances recall and retention.
After you have gone through them several times at spaced time intervals, separate the cards that you consistently get right and focus on those that you do not.

, Concept cards differ from flash cards in that the focus is not on individual facts but, instead, on the interconnectedness of facts and ideas, of concepts, and are particularly helpful when prepping for essay exams and finals.As with flash cards, buy either 3x5 or 4x6 unlined index cards and a pencil, pen or marker that won’t show through on the other side after you write. On one side, write a key idea, term, name, event or process from your notes. On the other, write the definition of that word, keeping it brief, and list 3-5 concepts related to it. Use your concept cards to quiz yourself on each identified word you wrote on the front of your cards.


Concepts related to the identified words might include examples, reasons why the identified word is important, related issues, sub-categories and so forth.
For both flash cards and concept cards, pick up a few index file boxes or cases/holders to store your cards. The cases/holders, particularly, come in a variety of colors and can be matched with the colors you chose for your subjects’ folders and notebooks, if you went that route in organizing your notes.
You can also carry one or both sets of cards with you and use them in your down time, such as when you’re waiting at the doctor’s office, while riding the bus or between classes.

, Self-testing is one of the most highly effective study strategies you can employ and should be done regularly. It forces your brain to retrieve information and strengthens the neural pathways to memory storage.Taking your lecture notes, create questions based upon the material in each lecture. You will want to create multiple choice questions, true/false questions, short answer questions, fill-in-the blank questions and essay questions. Set your practice test aside for a few days, then take it and repeat this process periodically throughout the term for each test.


After the first exam in a particular course, you often, though not always, will have a good idea of the test format your teacher prefers and uses. If the test was all multiple choice, for example, consider creating more multiple choice questions from your lecture notes for that course.
When constructing your practice test questions, try to anticipate and construct questions that might show up on the real exam. Look in your notes for cause/effect relationships, examples and hypotheticals, definitions, dates, lists and diagrams.
After your first exam, look at the questions you missed. Go back to your notes and see if that material was in your notes. Perhaps it was in your text, or perhaps it was in your notes but you didn’t consider it as important as your teacher obviously did. Use this insight to adjust not only your practice tests but also your note taking and studying in general.

"
"
Work with a study partner.,
Join a study group.,
Study notes via elaborative interrogation.",How to Study Lecture Notes4," Teaching someone requires you to rephrase and more deeply process information as you put it into your own words, which further commits it to your memory and takes studying to the next level!So, pick a lecture and briefly review your notes from that lecture. Present the lecture to your study partner and have him or her ask you questions directed at elaborating on points made in your presentation. Take turns doing this for each lecture throughout the term.


An additional benefit to this approach is that you will likely identify areas that you initially did not deem particularly important to study but later recognized were when your study partner presented them. It also helps fill in holes in your notes when your study partner presents something you don't have recorded.
You also could spend your time together (or apart) creating practice tests for each other.

, This is another opportunity not only to commit yourself to studying your notes but also to a) fill in gaps in your notes, b) view the material in your notes from other perspectives and c) gain insight into how others approach studying.Once you have formed your study group, designate a group leader to help keep the group on track and to send out email reminders. Decide when you will meet, for how long and how often. During your meetings, review your notes and other materials with your group members so you can share information and resolve any confusing issues. You also might take turns presenting material and creating practice test questions. Some schools have Web-based learning management systems that allow students to sign up for study groups within courses. If this is not an option, talk with your teacher about how to facilitate forming one. If you know others in the class, ask them if they would like to join.
A study group should have 3-4 committed members. Too many voices can create chaos and little work accomplished.
Your group should meet once per week. This will ensure that you do not try to cram in too much material in each meeting., Elaborative interrogation is a technique that a) encourages learning and remembering through asking the question “Why?” when reading material and that b) research has shown to be a more effective study method than those that students have employed religiously for decades, such as using mnemonic devices and highlighting.When reviewing your notes, periodically stop, ask yourself a “why” question and answer it. The questions can be general or specific.


General: “Why does this make sense?” “Why is this unexpected given what I already know about this topic?”
Specific: “Why do things only stay in our short-term memory for about 18 seconds without rehearsal or review?” “Why does cramming for tests so often result in lower grades?”
The technique is so effective because it forces you to draw upon prior knowledge, to think critically about the information, to make connections between the two and to respond in your own words. Simply put, these processes help to hardwire the information into your brain.

, Place a colon at the end of the sentence that leads up to the block quote. For example, Sam Dean longed for the wide open space of New Mexico: (your block quote will come next).

, After you’ve introduced your quote, begin the quote on a new line. , Moving from the left margin, you’ll want to indent the entire quote by ½ inch (1.27 cm). For most computers and writing applications, you can achieve this indent by hitting the “tab” button.If you are citing multiple paragraphs, indent the first line of the quotation by an additional ¼ inch (0.64 cm).
Indent the first line of each successive paragraph the same way.
Follow block quote formatting for two or more paragraphs, even if there are less than 4 lines in each paragraph., Because you are starting the block quote on a new line with indentation, you don’t need to add quotation marks to set it apart from the rest of the text., MLA format usually calls for double-spacing throughout the main body of the paper, but always have double-spacing for block quotes, even if the rest of your paper doesn’t require it.

Find a suitable studying environment.,
Collect revision materials before you begin studying.,
Find a study partner.,
Collect suitable revision snacks.,
Take short breaks.,
Get Motivated.,
Sit down and study.,
Don't panic!,
Minimize computer use.,
Don't listen to music unless it helps you study.,
Don't stray off-topic.,
Don't get discouraged.",How to Focus on Studying," Your bedroom or classroom isn't always the best possible place. Find a nice, quiet place with a large, comfortable chair, like your sitting room, preferably without a television, a computer or a cell phone within your reach. Don't over think about social media and try staying away from social media.


The library is usually a nice place to study because it's quiet. Perhaps your parents' office is another potential location, provided it's quiet and offers few distractions.;
, Do not plan to look for pens, highlighters, rulers, etc, in the middle of studying. It can be really distracting at times, so prepare everything you think you need.

, Pick someone who is sensible and focused like you are on the same task. Don't always pick your best friend, as you may ruin both your concentrations by chitchatting. Having a study partner is a great idea, as you can bounce ideas off each other, and see things form a different perspective as yourself.


Some people find study partners distracting. Chances are if you are an extrovert, meaning you really like other people and love talking, a study partner probably won't be the best option for you. If you are an introvert, meaning you generally keep to yourself and are a bit shier, a study partner might work great for you. However, if you are studying with a very extroverted partner, they will most likely try to talk to you while you are trying to study.
Choose someone who is smarter than you. It sounds basic to say, but a lot of people overlook this. If you want to learn, choose a study partner who is smart, dedicated, and doesn't mind teaching. Your study sessions will be a whole lot better.

, No energy drinks or coffee, because sooner or later, you will crash out. Granola bars, fruit, and water are good, because they are simple and effective at releasing carbohydrates.

, After 45 minutes of studying, take a 10 minute break and do something different. Try to get back to your studying after the break; the break shouldn't be longer than 20 minutes.


Plan your breaks out with alarms. If your breaks are planned, you're less likely to miss them in the first place, and more importantly, less likely to ""accidentally"" take more time than is needed.
Why take breaks? Your brain needs time to recharge after it processes a bunch of information. In some studies, taking a break and walking around improved memory recall and simple test scores in subjects., If you do your revision well and prepare for the exam, you will do fine. Get to a point with your revision so you can enjoy the exam when it happens. Do not think that the exam is a big deal, think of it as something to challenge your learning.


Set a goal for yourself, even if it's a bit unrealistic. Push yourself to do better than what you think you can do, and who knows, maybe you'll surprise yourself.
Motivate yourself with a reward. This takes a bit of self-control, so ask someone in a position of authority to help you out if you need help. Give yourself a reward if you study well, feel prepared, and do well on the test.
Tell yourself why studying is important. This is different for each person. Maybe you care about getting that perfect 4.0. Maybe you really care about the subject material. Maybe you made a bet with your dad and you can't stand losing. Whatever it is, remind yourself of why you're working hard and tell yourself it's worth it.

, You have everything you need in front of you and there's nothing left to procrastinate with. It's just you and the material. Well? What are you waiting for?


Use flash cards and notes to your advantage. Flash cards are helpful for some people, as they contain important information in very little space. Use them if you feel they are helpful for you. Lay them out sequentially, or order them according to a different scheme if you want to give them a little more meaning.
Make use of mnemonic tools. ""Mnemonic tools"" is a fancy word for memorization. Make some information into a funny song, or put the information into an acronym (remember VIBGYOR?) to help you remember what you're trying to remember.
Make sure you know the most important information first, and then move onto the rest. Study and understand key concepts before you branch out. This will give you a basic level of understanding to build on.
Ask yourself why you are studying, what will be the benefit of studying and write it down on a piece of paper. Every time you get distracted look at the paper and remind yourself why studying is important for you.

, When you panic, you make mistakes, so keep calm throughout. If you successfully planned your revision, you will have no need to panic when the exam comes. Take a deep breath, tell yourself ""I can do this,"" and calm down .

, Especially the internet. You learn better when you write things out yourself. Also refrain from using your cell phone as you will be replying to texts every minute, which is very distracting.


Turn your internet off if you know you'll be tempted. Turn your computer off or ask your friend to hold onto it. Basically, try to ensure that you're not whiling away your time on the Internet when you're supposed to be studying.

, Some people need music in order to help them study, but try not to give your brain anything else to focus on while you're studying. One more distraction, even if it's calming music, is another thing your brain has to process in addition to the information you're trying to learn.

, We all catch ourselves going off-topic from time to time. Sometimes it's because the information we're supposed to learn is boring; sometimes it's because the information we don't need to know is exciting. Whatever it is, wait until after you've studied to really dig deeper and explore different subjects.


Always ask yourself: How likely is it that this information will show up on my test? If you're really focused, you can rank the information from the most likely to the least likely, giving the most likely material the majority of your time and the least likely the rest of it.

, Studying for a test can be daunting, especially in the beginning. Take things in manageable chunks and don't worry about getting things perfect the first time around. Remember, you're here to learn, not necessarily ace a test. Try to understand the ""big picture"" if you're having trouble understanding the concept. This should make the details easier to understand.

Celebrate each accomplishment.",How to Focus on One Thing," If you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and unfocused, making a list is the easiest and quickest way to simplify and help you plan an attack. To learn what you need to focus on now and how to put everything else in the background, make a list of the things that are pressing on your mind.


Short-term tasks should be things that are urgent. What needs to be done today, or by the end of the week? You decide the time frame, but try to keep it as urgent as possible.
Long term goals are also important, but only if you translate them into a list of specific short-term things that you can do. If ""Become a doctor"" is on your list of long-term goals, and is stressing you out, it's not something that you're going to be able to make happen before lunch. But you can start researching med schools.;
, How you choose to assign importance to the tasks and prioritize them will depend on you and on your list, but there are several ways of going about it and making your job easier. Don't spend too much time tweaking the list, go with your gut instinct and get things in order so you can get started. One way is the A, B, C method, which breaks down tasks by:

A: Must-do, very important tasks that must be done today. Example: Finish the report today by the 4:30 deadline.
B: A task that may not be immediate, but will become an ""A"" priority eventually. Example: Get all tax documents together in order to file by next month.
C: Tasks of least importance, although needs to be done. Example: Shred duplicate file.






Organize according to importance. Identify the most important tasks on your list and put them at the top, ranking them according to how critical the task is to you. So, if you've got to write a term paper today, put away your laundry, and return a RedBox DVD, the tasks should probably be in that order.
Organize according to difficulty. For some people, putting the most difficult tasks up front and getting them out of the way is the best way to approach a to-do list, while others prefer to start small and progressively get bigger. It might be easier to focus more on reading a chapter for your history class if you get your math homework out of the way first.

, Next to each item, it can be helpful to draw up a brief estimate of how much time it'll take you to actually complete it. Again, don't spend a lot of time calculating, or stressing over this detail. You don't even need an actual number, just break each item into a category called ""Quick"" or ""Slow"" so you'll know when to assign each task.


If you know you won't be able to complete all your history research in the ten minutes you have to get something started, you can put it in the back of your mind and do something else instead with your time. Start the laundry, or write up a thank-you note to someone you've been meaning to get in touch with. That's using your time wisely.

, After giving some consideration to time and the importance of the tasks, you'll have to put something at the top of the list. Decide what it is that demands your attention right now at this instant and put it there. It might be the most important thing on the list, or the most timely, but whatever it is, it's something that you're going to do and work on until it's finished, or finished-enough for your purposes.

, Be confident and secure in knowing that you've made a to-do list and you can put it away and ignore it for a while. Once you know what task you're going to complete right now, having the list looming over you will just be distracting and will keep you scattered. Put the list away, in a drawer, or somewhere else you won't be able to see it. Nothing else matters right now but the thing on the top of your list.


Desktop stickies are great little reminder tools for a lot of people on their laptops, but consider hiding them when you've really got to focus on something. Don't be stressing about the party you've got to get organized for later if you're writing a term paper. Put the list out of your mind by putting it out of sight.

, Make a list of things that will not happen right now. Although counter-inuitive, removing tasks from your mental list helps you free yourself to do the things that you really need to do. For example:

You will have to work late. Therefore, you cannot make dinner tonight.
Your cross country meet conflicts with the yearbook meeting. You can't do both.

, Working somewhere you won't be distracted by TV, side-conversations, and other chatter is absolutely essential to learning how to focus. Sometimes, it's tempting to think that sitting in the living room with your roommates or your family is a better and less stressful way to work, but it'll end up taking twice as long and the work will be half as good. If you've got to do something that demands your attention, head to a quiet corner in your room, or head out to the library.


If you can't work somewhere quiet, consider investing in sound reduction headphones that'll help to cut out the chatter and center you into what you're doing, whatever it is. If you don't want fancy headphones, check out white noise generators on line, letting ambient music or background static overwhelm the distracting conversations happening around you.

, It's not just calls and texts anymore, now you've got to worry about social networking updates, emails coming through, and Words with Friends challenges popping up on your phone every five seconds. There's nothing more distracting than a cellphone. Turn it off and put it away when you need to focus.


Putting your phone on silent still makes it easy to check. It's better to physically put it somewhere it will be difficult to access. If you're working in your room, charge your phone in another room.
If your phone proves very distracting, consider eliminating certain time-suck apps from your phone. You don't actually need Facebook and Twitter on there.

, When you're about to get started, look at the clock. How much time do you have to work? How much time will you need to complete the project? How much time can you afford to give it today? Decide how long you're going to work on the task at hand and get cracking.


Schedule periodic breaks. It's common to work 50 minutes on, and then take 10 minutes off to get up, walk around, get a drink, and do something else for a while. It'll be less tempting to look at a funny YouTube video right now if you know you'll be able to in another 20 minutes, anyway and not feel guilty about it.

, Most people work on computers, which is a shaky proposition for a lot of people. Your term paper is right next door to Facebook, wikipedia, and Buzzfeed, meaning that no matter how deep you are into some good work, writing, research, or whatever demands your digital attention, a good YouTube downward spiral is never more than a click away. Learn to recognize your time-wasting habits and head them off at the pass.


The easiest way to make it difficult to screw around online is to turn the Internet off. Shut of your WiFi connection so you won't be able to log on and mess around.
StayFocused, Anti-Social, LeechBlock, and Cold Turkey are all blockers that you can install if you must use the Internet to complete your work. These will block specific websites, or your whole connection for certain periods of time that you can customize. If you struggle with this, it can be a good idea., Sometimes, you have the best intentions and still social media sucks you in. We say to ourselves, ""I've got five minutes, I'm just going to look at Facebook quickly,"" and an hour later you're elbow-deep in your roommate's high school frenemy's vacation pictures from six years ago. How does this happen?Mute or unsubscribe from all your friends on social media who don't enrich your experience. If you end up getting distracted because of your childhood friend's anti-government screeds on Facebook, don't waste time reading them. Block them, or better yet, unfriend all your imaginary social networking friends. Focus on more important things.
Set up your email so it won't alert you every time something new comes in, and organize work emails and personal emails into separate folders or separate accounts to help keep everything straight. You won't have to worry about getting sucked into a catch-up email from grandma while you're working if you don't see it until later. Emails shouldn't demand your immediate attention.

, Not all distractions are YouTube-related. Sometimes, you're focused entirely on reading that novel for English class and all of a sudden your ex pops into your head. Game over. If you find yourself distracted by feelings of anxiety, or common emotional ruts, learn to recognize your habits and better head them off at the pass.If you find yourself distracted by a wandering mind, don't try to tell yourself to stop, give yourself a break. Saying, ""Don't think about pink elephants"" will always put a pachyderm in your mind. Let yourself think about it for a minute, let yourself be distracted, and get it out of your system. Then put it away.

, Taking a few minutes out of your day to sit quietly and contemplatively can lower stress levels, help to center yourself, and quiet loud thoughts that can serve to distract you later while you're supposed to be working. If you struggle with a wandering mind, practice meditation a few times to get the hang of it, then develop a practice that works for you.


Meditation doesn’t need to involve corny chanting and incense. It's the opposite of complicated. Make a cup of coffee or tea and drink it on your porch and watch the sunrise every morning. Go for a quiet walk in the park and sit on a bench. Just sit. Don't use this time to think about everything you need to do. Use this time to just sit.

, For some people, developing a routine helps to channel productivity. If you always go to the same coffee shop, or always sit at the same place on the couch to do your work, you'll be more productive, more able to focus, and will be less distracted by the new environment you're experiencing every time you have to do something. Pick a place and make it your place.


Alternatively, if staying cooped up in the same old office keeps you feeling restless, go elsewhere. Find a different coffee shop every day and let the white noise of the side conversations and the new pastries invigorate you. Variety helps some people focus more.

, David Carr, a New York Times columnist, likes to keep writing and pushing through until he feels himself starting to slow down, until the work starts to bog down his focus. At this point, continuing to work would become unproductive.Instead of banging your head against the wall, put your project away for a minute. Go outside. Walk the dog. Take an aimless trip around the neighborhood for 10 minutes. Grab a coffee and think on the problem you’re encountering, but without the ability to fiddle with it. When your break’s over, head back refreshed.

, No one can or should sit at a computer for 10 hours straight. When you've gotten the chance to take a break, it's important to use that break to do something physical. Move around. Get up and go for a walk, even if you've got nowhere to go.


It might seem corny, but keeping some light hand weights in your office to use periodically while you're reading can help you remember what you're reading more. Studies show that light exercise aids memory retention.Have a snack. Low blood sugar keeps the mind from firing on all cylinders, meaning that a handful of nuts or a piece of fruit during the afternoon dip in energy will help you get back on track and focus.

, When you get something done from your list, celebrate that thing for a minute. Even if all you give yourself is a pat on the back and the chance to cross it off the list definitively, take a minute before you do something else to relax. You earned it.


Use small celebrations for every day things. When you finish your project for the work day, cross it off the list and pour a glass of wine. Or tear up the list entirely and burn the scraps. You're done!
Let yourself go big for big accomplishments. Head out to a nice restaurant when you finally get all your applications in for graduate schools, or treat yourself to something at the end of a long-term difficult project.

Are you arguing for a particular political position, a controversial viewpoint on history, or a particular interpretation of a piece of art or media? The possibilities are endless!;
, Start with some basic research on your topic, so that you can begin to form your opinion. At this stage, you're likely just to get a rough overview, rather than doing in-depth research.

, Start with a loose set of your own thoughts; build up some basic ideas about why you take the position you do. This is a good time to start brainstorming the counter-arguments, too, so that you can prepare rebuttals.

, Once you have some basic ideas about your position, you need to actually find supporting evidence. Dig into articles, studies, and any other source material to find evidence that can back up your position.

, This should explain a little background information about the topic at large. Depending on the topic, you might provide some legal or historical context, or dive into a captivating anecdote about the topic. Try to capture your reader's attention!


End the introduction with a strong thesis. This should sum up the position that your essay will seek to ""prove."" Avoid wording it as a question or hypothesis; try to be steadfast and persuasive from the get-go by stating your position as fact.

, Go point by point, ideally devoting a paragraph (or more) to every strong reason. Wherever possible, provide more than one piece of supporting evidence or research for each reason.

, Re-state what you are trying to convince your reader of is true, and remind them briefly of each reason. Bring it all together, and end on a strong note.

, If you want good grades on the essay, then check it for spelling and grammar. Proofread your own work, and have someone else review it, too. They're likely to see mistakes that you missed!

, With a fresh eye, it'll be easier for another person to spot any holes in your argument or point out any counter-arguments that you've missed. Encourage them to be constructively critical!

, You may need to add to and revise your arguments several times before you make the essay as persuasive as possible. Stick with it and keep getting more opinions until you're happy that it's the best it can be!

Consider what functional categories your assignment falls under.,
Search for different tools and technologies that support work in an online course.,
Use each tool to increase the quality of teaching and learning and/or support student success.,
Note that there are many other tools that are available for online support.",How to Find Online Technology Tools for School," It can fall under the following categories: group work and collaboration, communication tools, presentation tools, and task management tools. Once you know which classification it falls under, then you can search for online tools.;
, The list below is for 10 sites that promote online technology.



Turnitin is site that checks for plagiarism, reduces grading time, improves feedback to students and helps improve student writing. It is free to use and easily accessible as most online colleges use this as a way to proofread assignments before receiving a final grade. The great thing about this tool is that it is private and for the student and instructor's eyes only. In addition, this ""computer software scours billions of data to detect electronic plagiarism and students cutting and pasting their way through assignments"" (Turner, 2009).

Prezi is virtual arena for presentations so people can see your ideas and understand them. It allows up to ten people to co-edit presentations. Many people in addition to students, use this platform from bestselling authors to business leaders and entrepreneurs around the globe.

Determine if you are a visual learner.,
Determine if you are an auditory learner.,
Determine if you are a kinesthetic/tactile learner.,
Consider environmental factors.",How to Find out What Kind of Learner You Are2," Visual learners are good at remembering things through pictures, charts, graphs, notes, or other visual material. Visual learners often replace words with pictures and use mind maps to remember meanings, definitions, dates, and other material.Here are some questions you can ask yourself to determine if you are a visual learner:Do I learn best when I watch someone show me how to do something?
Do I verify the accuracy of spelling by looking at the word to see if it is spelled correctly?
When I need to remember a list of items, do I remember the list by writing it down?
Do I solve problems by writing or drawing diagrams?
When I am adding numbers, do I verify the answer by looking at the numbers to see if they are correct?

, Auditory learners learn best by hearing and listening. Auditory learners often use sound, like sound recordings, acoustics, rhyming, or music to help them remember and learn about things.Here are some questions to ask yourself to see if you are an auditory learner:Do I learn best when I hear someone tell me how to do something?
Do I verify the accuracy of spelling by sounding the word out in my head?
When I need to remember a list of items, do I remember the list by repeating it over and over to myself?
Do I solve problems by talking myself through the problem?
When I am adding numbers, do I verify the answer by counting the numbers in my head or out loud?

, Kinesthetic learners learn best through physical touch, movement, and interaction. These learners learn through physical sensations and physical objects. Similar to visual learners, writing and drawing diagrams are also very helpful for kinesthetic learners. Kinesthetic learners also often use role-playing, either singularly or with someone else, to practice skills and behaviors.Here are some questions to ask yourself to see if you are a kinesthetic learner:Do I learn how to do something best by trying to do it myself?
Do I verify the accuracy of spelling by getting a feeling about the correctness of the spelling?
When I need to remember a list of items, do I remember the list by moving around and using my fingers to name each item?
Do I solve problems by using and/or moving objects to help me think?
When I am adding numbers, do I verify the answer by using my fingers to get a feeling if it is correct?

, When determining your learning style also consider other factors like the time of day, the temperature of the room, the level of sound, and the size of grouping in which you learn best.Ask yourself:


Do I focus better in the morning or at night?
Do I focus better when the room is cold or slightly warmer?
Do I focus better when everything is quiet or can I focus with music playing?
Do I focus better when I am studying alone or with a group of people?

"
"
Draw graphs, pictures, or mind maps.,
Use recordings music.,
Use your sense of touch.",How to Find out What Kind of Learner You Are3," If you are more of a visual learner, focusing on or drawing graphs, pictures, and/or mind maps will help you understand and remember concepts and ideas better. For example, if you are trying to remember a definition, look up images of the word in your search engine.

, If you are more of an auditory learner, record lectures to help you remember concepts and ideas. This way you can go back to the recording to help you understand your material better. You can also use rhyming and/or music to help you remember words, ideas, and concepts. For example, if you are trying to remember a definition, come up with a musical rhyme to help you remember the word and definition.

, If you are more of a kinesthetic learner, use your body and hands or focus on sensations to remember concepts and ideas. Also use physical objects as much as possible to help you learn. For example, use flashcards to help you memorize information because you can touch and move them around.Keep in mind that writing and drawing graphs are physical activities.

Use your returned exam as guidance for future study.",How to Get a College Degree With Little Effort," The more fascinated you are by your course of study, the easier it will be to learn the material. Think carefully about your passions and interests, and try to find courses to match.If you are not sure what kinds of courses you like, consider taking a career aptitude test or a skills aptitude test. These might help you find where your strengths lie. If you're still in high school, your guidance counselor probably has one you can take. There are also many available for free on the internet.You can also visit your school's Career Center if you do not have a clear idea of what you want to get out of your college experience.A career counselor can help you find a clear direction to help you organize your workload in the most efficient way.;
, Having a balanced course load will help you manage your time effectively and not get overwhelmed.For example, you might love reading Victorian novels. However, taking 4 Victorian novel courses will leave you drained and exhausted. Find a balance between new subjects and old favorites.


Many colleges and universities have distribution requirements, which require that students have experience in multiple subjects.Use these distribution requirements to your advantage in order to explore new topics and to avoid exhaustion in your major.

, You will probably have to take some courses that you may not be all that interested in, such as chemistry or English. However, many colleges and universities also have a variety of unusual courses, from jewelry-making to culinary arts, that may fulfill elective hours. Schedule time for at least one fun course per semester.

, Many colleges and universities have policies about student conduct, behavior, and academic requirements.These policies should be printed in your student handbook. It is essential that you know and understand these policies so that you can graduate in the most efficient manner. Policies to pay attention to include:


How many courses do you have to take each semester to qualify as a full-time student or as a part-time student?
How many courses do you need to take in order to graduate from the university?
In which subjects do you need to take courses?
What are the course requirements for your major?
What is the minimum grade point average (or GPA) you need in order to graduate from the university?
What is the minimum GPA you need in order for a course in your major to count? Some majors might require that certain courses be passed with a C-average or better: merely passing a class might not count toward your major. Check this policy carefully.
Are there any attendance requirements or residency requirements?
What are the rules for academic honesty? Be sure that you adhere to these policies carefully to avoid failing classes or other negative consequences such as expulsion.
What does proper student conduct entail? You might have requirements for your personal behavior in addition to academic requirements. Make sure that you behave according to all honor codes and policies as outlined in your handbook.

, Some colleges will provide students with placement tests in certain subjects. These placement tests will allow you to be placed in a course of the proper difficulty level. In certain cases, a successful placement exam might even mean that you can skip over required courses. Be sure that you study carefully for all of your placement exams: a few hours of work now can save you many hours of work down the road.Common subjects that have placement exams include: foreign languages, rhetoric and composition, and mathematics.
Many high schools offer special courses called Advanced Placement (or AP) courses. If you do well on AP exams, you might receive college credits. There are currently 3,600 American colleges and universities that permit AP credits. If you are in high school, consider looking into AP course options to help cut down on the credits you need to take in college.The CLEP (College Level Exam Placement) program, run through the same organization as the AP exam, also allows you to earn college credit for subjects by taking exams.They offer 33 exams in five subject areas: History & Social Sciences, Composition & Literature, Science & Mathematics, Business, and World Languages.Check with your academic adviser to see how much CLEP credit you can apply toward your degree. You may be able to test out of many core subjects with these exams.

, A college course catalog will usually include course names, topics, and times. Many course catalogs will also clarify how each course will meet either a university or a major requirement. Highlight courses that seem interesting to you, that are run by professors you like, and that fulfill important requirements.


Many colleges and universities now offer online syllabus banks as well, where you can examine syllabi from previous semesters. Have a look at what the syllabus for your chosen courses looks like.

, Some college courses will be able to double-count toward graduation. For example, a statistics course might be necessary to your major and might also fulfill a distribution requirement at your university. Be on the lookout for courses that can pull double duty, and prioritize those in your schedule. It might cut down on the total number of courses you need in order to graduate, saving you time and energy.

, Depending on your college schedule, you might need to take anywhere between 2 and 5 courses in a given term. 4 courses (12 semester hours) is a fairly common full-time load for US colleges and universities. Fill out a tentative schedule with the relevant number of courses. Take a look at your tentative weekly schedule to see if it seems reasonable. Ask yourself:


Am I making reasonable progress toward graduation?
Am I making reasonable progress toward my major?
Are there any conflicts between courses? Remember to take discussion sections, lab meetings, or studio time in mind.
Do I have any days that are unreasonably busy? Having class from 8 AM to 8 PM could leave you worn out for a couple of days. However, if you are a commuter student, you might want to compress your schedule into 2-3 days of the week.
Will I have time to work at my job and engage in my favorite activities?
Am I taking too many difficult courses in one term? If you can, have a balanced mix of ""easy"" basic courses and the more advanced, difficult courses in your major.

, Your university might assign you an academic adviser. Or your college might have an academic counseling center. Run your tentative schedule past a knowledgeable adviser. Your adviser will be a significant resource to ensure that you are fulfilling your requirements.

, Many universities have an ""Add/Drop"" period early in the semester. This means that you can change your class schedule without penalty, even after classes have started. Before committing fully to your schedule, attend each class at least once. Perhaps you will discover that the class is more difficult than you expected and you will want to switch to an easier one.

, The person teaching a course is just as important as its topic. Some professors like to lecture; others like to run discussions. Some professors focus on exams; others prefer assigning large projects outside of class.Make sure your professor runs her class in a way that fits with your own learning style.


Don't discount a course just because it's different than what you're used to, however. For example, you may not usually enjoy large lectures, but one particular professor could be an amazing lecturer whose classes become your favorite. Don't be afraid to try new things!

, A syllabus is a contract between a student and a professor. It will lay out the course requirements and expectations, and it should provide a schedule of important assignments.The syllabus will clue you in about the course's difficulty and will also allow you to know in advance how you should spend your time.

, On a calendar, combine the information from all the syllabi for all your courses. Write down each exam, each major project, and each major essay assignment in the proper date. Ask yourself if there are any weeks that will be too difficult for you. For example, perhaps three of your classes have major projects all due on the same date. This might be too much work for you to handle.


Adjust your course schedule as necessary. Make sure you adhere to your school's add/drop policies. Ask an adviser if you are unsure about whether you can add or drop a class.

, Many universities are offering online courses and blended courses (which are both online and offline). Online courses can be easier to fit in a busy schedule and can sometimes provide more flexibility. Look into the possibility of taking an online course at your university.If your university accepts transfer credits, you might also be able to take an online course from another school and then get your credits counted at your own university. Make sure you get permission from your adviser in advance, however.
You may also be able to take some courses at a community college and transfer them to a four-year college later. Community college courses are sometimes (but not always) less difficult than their four-year counterparts, and they're often much cheaper.

, The syllabus is the single most important document you will receive in college. It will tell you everything you need to know about what your courses will ask of you for the entire semester.If a key piece of information--such as the date of an exam--is not included on the syllabus, ask your professor or teaching assistant.

, In order to manage time wisely you will have to know in advance what is required of you. Create a Master Calendar with every important date and time. Consult your Master Calendar whenever you add an event to your schedule to make sure there aren't any conflicts. Use the Master Calendar to figure out in advance which weeks are your ""easy weeks"" when you can do more fun things and which weeks are your ""hard weeks"" when you have to buckle down and study.

, In addition to your semester-length Master Calendar, keep a to-do list each week.This will include many of your smaller assignments such as readings or short homework assignments. Keep on task and be efficient in order to save yourself effort later on.

, Then move on to easier subjects.This is the most efficient and easy way to study effectively. Accomplish harder tasks before you move on to the easy ones. You will work more quickly and will retain information more easily.

, Plan your study times during your peak hours.If you need a nap in the afternoon, do not schedule homework for the afternoon hours. Let your body's natural rhythm determine how and when you schedule your homework.

, Procrastination can seem fun sometimes, but it can also lead to more stress and less free time in the long run.It is better to get tasks done quickly and take breaks after. You will feel calmer and more relaxed and will be able to accomplish more.

, Whenever you finish a major project or assignment, give yourself a treat. This will keep you energized and motivated, and it will make the process of earning a degree seem like less work.When you finish reading a textbook chapter, let yourself take a quick walk around the block.
When you write 2 pages of your essay, take a snack break.
When you study for an exam for 2 hours, meet a friend for coffee.

, Many college projects can seem large and overwhelming. For example, lengthy research essays, big exams, and long projects are routine in college courses. However, tell yourself that each large task is composed of smaller, more manageable tasks.A twenty-page essay might be five four-page sections.
Reading an 800-page novel can be accomplished in several 100-page chunks.
A long research project can be divided into several parts: reviewing literature, gathering data, analyzing data, and writing up results.

, Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Remember that your goal is to get through college and earn a degree: your goal is not necessarily to get straight A's or finish summa cum laude. If you are passing your classes and making progress toward your major, you will earn your degree., People learn better when they are able to take short breaks. Breaks also make studying more fun and pleasant.Don't become a monk: let yourself take rests. You will be more efficient in the long run.

, College often provides opportunities for recreation and social activities in addition to academic work. If extracurriculars or activities are important to you, make time for them and put them into your schedule. Whether you participate in an intramural sport or participate in a political organization, place important dates in your calendar along with your projects and assignments., Don't let studying get in the way of your sleep or your meals. Having good rest and eating healthy meals will help you keep your energy up and retain information more effectively.Exercise can also help you be more energized and optimistic, which will help major tasks seem less daunting.

, If you find yourself struggling, talk to your university about resources than can help you. Many schools have a team of tutors, counselors, advisers, and study experts who can help you get back on your feet.Depending on your school, you might consult your:


Academic adviser.
Residential Adviser (aka RA) or Dormitory Leader.
Teaching assistant.
Counselor or therapist.
Study center.
Librarian.
Tutoring Center or Writing Center.

, This will allow you to retain information and focus better. This will lead to shorter studying times in the long run. It is better to study effectively for 45 minutes than to study in a distracted way for 2 hours.Your ideal study space might be in a library, academic building, dorm hall, or coffee shop: just make sure that you can actually accomplish necessary tasks there.

, A study group can help you focus. You can also delegate activities across a study group to help ease everyone's load. For example, each member of the group might be responsible for teaching each other member about a particular topic. Studying will be made more fun and also more efficient with the help of a group., Taking good lecture notes is an important basis for studying and reviewing. You can take lecture notes on a computer or in a paper notebook. Taking good lecture notes involves several steps:


Be prepared for lecture. Look over the relevant readings and handouts to make sure that you understand what the lecture is discussing.
Sit where you can hear the lecture and see the chalkboard or screen.
Have your materials ready. Make sure your laptop's battery is charged or that you have enough pens and paper.
Listen actively in lecture. Stay awake and alert and avoid distractions.Digest information in lecture; do not transcribe it. Translate the lecture into your own words, using an organizational structure that makes the most sense to you.This will help you remember lecture material better: transcribing a lecture word-for-word will not help you remember it.
Be sure that you leave space in your notes to fill in extra information later. You might miss a fact from lecture or you might want to add more detail later. Give yourself room to edit and fill in gaps.
Ask questions. Write down any parts of lecture that confused you. Ask the professor, a teaching assistant, or a colleague about these confusing sections.Borrow lecture notes if you absolutely could not attend class. Do not just read them: translate them into your own words so that you remember them later., Whenever you encounter a page number, chapter number, or reference, jot it down. It is very difficult to remember citation information on your own. And it is very time-consuming to look up information when you do not have the specific page number. Taking a few seconds to jot down citation information will save you a great deal of time later., Pay particular attention to key terms, important dates, and important concepts. If you own the book, use a pen or a highlighter to call your attention to these key terms: they will help you review for exams more efficiently.

, Make sure that you save your work and back it up in more than one location. Use an external hard drive, the cloud, or physical hard copies to back up your assignments and notes.Doing college-level work is difficult: doing the same college-level work twice because you lost the first copy is much more difficult.

, Many colleges and universities provide a team of tutors to help students study effectively for their classes. If you find yourself struggling, consider asking your university to help you find a good tutor. They can teach you shortcuts and help you organize your time as you digest material., Each test is different. In order for you to study efficiently for an exam, you will have to know what you will be tested on. Ask your professor or teaching assistant about the test's length, the concepts it will cover, relevant reading materials, and skills that it will test.Tests might ask you to solve problems, interpret facts, recall and explain facts, or apply theories to other kinds of problems and questions.Knowing the test in advance will help you tailor your study time.

, Before you go in depth on any study topic, do a quick glance-through of everything the test will cover.This way you will be sure to have seen everything once, even if you run out of time later. Make sure you have a general notion of everything the exam will cover.

, After you do your quick glance-through, turn to the material that is brand-new to you.Whether you skipped a reading assignment or missed a lecture, you will have to review this material more closely to make sure that you pass the exam.


Don't get too caught up in making up this material, however. Skim the readings--do not read them in depth. Skim the major points of a friend's lecture notes--do not worry about nitpicky details.

, Rather than just reading your notes, build some activities into your study habits. For example, highlight your notes in different colors; quiz yourself on flashcards; or talk about important concepts with a study buddy.Active learning strategies will help you retain information more efficiently.


Study buddies are a particularly great way to build activities into your study habits. They can also be a great resource if you are confused by a particular topic., If you can, build yourself a ""pre-test"" that you can use to quiz yourself.This will help you be less anxious during the actual exam, and it will allow you to determine where your gaps might be.

, Some tests require that you memorize certain rules, concepts, or dates. Mnemonic devices can help you memorize these facts.Come up with a song or jingle that you cannot forget. Acronyms can also help you remember the correct order of certain processes or events.

, Arrive to the exam hall a few minutes early. Give yourself time to use the restroom, and make sure that you have eaten a nutritious meal that morning. If possible, have a bottle of water with you in the exam in case you develop a cough or a nagging thirst. Dress comfortably, and consider bringing an extra sweatshirt with you: exam halls can sometimes be very cold., If you have trouble keeping certain rules or processes in your mind, review them immediately before the exam. In the first few minutes of the test, perform a ""brain-dump"" where you write down these important facts in the margins, when they are still fresh in your mind., Before you launch into the test, take a look at the entire exam. How long should you spend on each section? Which sections will need the most time? Make a schedule for yourself that will allow you to complete the entire exam. Stick to this schedule, and keep careful track of your time., Don't try to save time by skipping the instructions: you might find yourself unfortunately surprised. Pay attention to the exam instructions and follow them closely.Ask yourself what the exam wants you to accomplish in each section.


Consider asking the exam proctor if instructions are unclear.
Do not over-analyze instructions or do more than the exam asks for. Just follow the directions.
Pay attention to the suggested lengths of essay questions and to the suggested timeframes for exam sections.

, Many exams are taken on Scantron sheets, where you fill in the bubble of the correct answer on a separate sheet of paper. Make sure that you fill out the Scantron sheet correctly: it can be easy to fill in the wrong line, so always make sure your Scantron numbers match the numbers on the exam itself., As you skim through the exam, underline or highlight key words. These words might be special instructions or they might be key terms in passages. Your notes to yourself will help you keep on track, follow directions, and pay attention to the most important concepts., Get comfortable by answering the questions you are most confident about first. Try to get through the easiest sections first. This is an easy way to gain points on an exam in an efficient way., Some sections of an exam are worth more than others.Pay more attention to these high-value exam questions, since they will give you more bang for your buck. If you do a high-value problem correctly, it is more likely that you will pass the exam, even if you have errors in other sections.

, Old exams are a great resource to help you organize your future study habits. Pay attention to sections where you made many errors and to any comments your grader made on the exam. This is a great source of information.If you are concerned about an exam performance, schedule an appointment with your professor or teaching assistant. Do not be frustrated in this meeting: look at it as an opportunity to make things better for next time.

Get rid of distractions.,
Play music without lyrics.,
Come prepared.,
Find a place where you can “unplug”.",How to Focus on Studies1," Choose the right spot. In order to concentrate, you must eliminate those things that you know will distract you. Put up mobile devices. Turn off the TV. Close other pages in your web browser. Sit away from people making loud noises.


Sit upright in a chair at a desk. Don’t lay on a bed or in a position that you know will lull you to sleep. Pick a space that is solely used for studying. Before long, your body will associate that space with that activity and it will be easier to concentrate.
Study in a brightly lit room. This will protect your eyes from straining too much at a book, your notes, or a computer screen. Bright lights will also keep you from dozing off.
You want a comfortable chair. There should be no strain on your back or neck. Pain is a terrible distraction.;
, Some people cannot stand silence. They need to have background noise to help keep themselves motivated. Consider playing classical music softly. For some people, music helps them concentrate. For some, it doesn't. Try it out and see what works best for you. A little something in the background can make you forget that you're studying instead of out having fun.


Keep in mind that study music might not be the music you listen to in the car for fun. You want to fill the room with sound, but not to the point that it becomes distracting or stressful. Experiment with different genres and figure out what helps you focus., Be sure to have all the materials needed to work. Have pencils, pens, highlighters, paper, textbooks, calculators, or whatever else will help you finish the task. Organize the area. A clean space will mean less distractions too. Your goal should be to take care of everything outside of studying before you sit down to focus. If not, you’ll just end up getting up repeatedly. Having to stop and start takes more time than continuously working.

, One of the biggest complaints that teachers have about their students is their inability to concentrate on a subject. Our constant use of social media and personal devices like cell phones divides our attention and makes it more difficult to concentrate.


Know what distracts you most on a computer, if you need to use one. There are websites and software blockers like SelfRestraint, SelfControl, and Think that can keep you away from the websites and software that are the hardest to resist.Find a place where there is no internet or your cell phone doesn’t work. Alternatively, you can choose to study in a place that doesn’t allow people to use cell phones, like in a quiet section of a library.

Learn when to say no.,
Make a schedule.,
Make lists.",How to Focus on Studies2," Often times, people find it difficult to concentrate on their studies because they are overextended with other obligations. If this is you, don’t be afraid to tell people no. Just explain that you need to study and won’t have the time or energy to do so, if you help them out., Aim to work for 30-60 minute periods with 5-10 minute breaks in between. It is a lot easier to push yourself for a set period of time, if you know you have a break coming up. Your brain needs the break to recharge and to process the information.Schedule yourself to study different subjects. Studying the same thing for too long is a recipe for boredom. Know yourself. Do you get bored easy? If so, schedule your time strategically.
When are you most productive? Working when you have a lot of energy makes the work easier. If you know that you get tired at a particular time of day, schedule tasks that require less attention then.
Some people are early birds. They wake up early before most people even begin their days. They take this peaceful time to catch up on their studies. Other people are night owls. They thrive after everyone else has gone to bed. Their home is quiet and they can concentrate easier. Some people don’t have the luxury of waking up early or staying up late. Maybe you are one of them. If so, find a time in the day that you can devote to studying that works for you.

, Write down your study goals for that day. What do you want or need to accomplish?


Make sure they're doable. If you need to write a 10 pages in a week, schedule yourself to write 2 pages a day for 5 days. The task will no longer seem daunting and discouraging. This works for any assignment, whether you need to read a book, study for a test, build something for science class, or whatever. Break the task into manageable parts.

"
"
Vary your study techniques.,
Make studying more active.,
Put your notes into your own words.,
Try the ""5 More"" rule.,
Do the least pleasant tasks first.",How to Focus on Studies3," Don’t limit yourself to one study method like reading a textbook. Make study cards. Quiz yourself. Watch informational videos if they are available. Rewrite your notes. Variety will keep you interested in your studies and make your time more efficient.


Your brain can process information in several different ways. By studying with different techniques, your brain will process the information differently, thus increasing the chance of retaining the information.

, To make your studying more effective and to make it easier to concentrate, use active reading techniques. Read your textbook aloud. Write your notes and read them aloud. Your brain will process the information differently and it will keep you on task.


Get others involved. One of the most effective ways to learn information is if you try to teach it to someone else. Have a significant other, roommate, friend, or family member play the student. See if you can explain the difficult material to them.

, School is not about rote memorization. It is about understanding meaning. Try to rewrite your notes from class or homework sections in your own words.

, Sometimes, it is necessary to play mind games with yourself to ensure that you’ll study. Tell yourself to do only five more things or five more minutes before quitting. Once you've finished those, “do another five”. Breaking tasks up into smaller chunks makes things easier for those with shorter concentration spans and it keeps your mind going longer.

, This sounds backwards, but if you complete the most difficult tasks first, then every subsequent activity will seem easier in comparison. Don’t let tough problems turn into time-wasters. Figure out quickly whether or not you will need additional help to learn something.

"
"
Take breaks.,
Reward yourself.,
Eat a snack.,
Exercise to decompress.,
Take a nap.",How to Focus on Studies4," Your brain is like a sponge, if it gets to much information, it ""leaks"" out information. Take breaks to rest your mind.

, Sometimes we need an incentive to keep ourselves going. If good grades aren't enough of a reward, create something else to keep you concentrated on your studies. Maybe some sweet treats and some time in front of the TV? A shopping spree? A massage or a nap? What would make studying worth your while?

, Nutrition is key to keeping you awake and motivated to study. Have a snack nearby. Try to keep it to something simple, like a handful of nuts, blueberries, or dark chocolate. Keep water nearby, too; don't drink too much coffee, caffeinated teas, or any energy drinks (you'll be up all night long). Eventually, you’ll build a tolerance to them and they won’t help as much.


Eat super foods. Research shows that blueberries, spinach, squash, broccoli, dark chocolate, and fish boost brain activity. Avoid eating junk and sweets with little to no nutritional value. Your body will expend energy breaking them down, but won’t benefit for them. A healthy diet will keep you more energized and make it easier to put your mind to the test., Exercising does wonders to the body and the brain. Exercise helps with memory, mood, alertness and feeling. Do stretches that work out areas of your body that might have grown stiff during your study session. Touch your toes. Lift small weights. Go for a jog.

, Sleep allows your brain to store information that you study. Without proper sleep, all that studying is for nothing. Getting ample sleep helps to regulate your hormones, which will keep your temper in check. "
"
Begin introducing ""academic"" activities to your children as early as 2 years old.,
When your children begin receiving homework from school -- most likely during Kindergarten -- instruct them to set aside time right arriving home from school to complete their work.,
When your children begin developing independence, pull back a little from your involvement in work time.,
When your children are in 8th grade or high school, reduce your reminders of work time, and see how your children respond.,
As your children are exposed to more and more difficult material, teach them effective study strategies for dealing with the new workload.,
Even when your children are in high school and should be managing their own work, ask about upcoming projects/tests and inquire about their plan for completing them.",How to Encourage Good Study Habits in a Child," Some suggestions include reading books, drawing/painting, learning simple arithmetic, engaging in basic grammar exercises, learning a foreign language, picking up an instrument, and learning new vocabulary words through drawing pictures.


Feel free to pick up toys, games, art supplies, workbooks, flash cards, and other commercial learning materials for your children. You can also create your own or make them with your children.
Make sure this is quality time that you are spending with your children, so sit down with them and watch as they complete the activity. Don't hand them a book and walk away. Even if they are capable of reading on their own, it's more fun for them if they have your company, so let them read aloud to you.






Children love spending time with and getting the attention of their parents. If you can let ""academic time"" be a regular and fun part of their routine, your children will associate learning and teaching others with satisfying feelings.;
, Tell them that the hour right after school must be set aside for homework time, but they are free to play earlier if they finish their work earlier.


Instead of making your kids work right after school, you can also designate a set amount of free time and then schedule the hour of work time. It's usually easier to get the kids inside to do homework before they've begun to romp around outside, however.
Scheduling a routine ""work period"" for each day of the week at an early age is important because their homework is relatively easy and enjoyable. As young children are malleable, they will gladly follow your guidance and complete their homework right after school. If you continue to enforce this as they age, they will begin to want to set aside this time on their own in the future.
On weekends, you should also set aside an hour (e.g., 3 p.m. - 4 p.m.) for your kids to complete homework assigned by the school or academic work prepared by you. This would be a great time to continue activities mentioned in step 1.

, Late elementary school or early middle school (5th - 7th grade) is a good time to do this, depending on how quickly your children mature.


Start by reminding them to start their homework right after school, but don't micromanage the process of how they choose to complete it. You don't necessarily need to know what all their homework is before they do it. However, you may want to continue checking their assignment sheets and knowing the due dates to ensure that your children are completing the work.
In middle school, your children will begin to have homework from multiple classes with various due dates. Discourage them from starting an assignment the night before it's due. Instead, make sure that they do a little bit of work every day. This way, they will be forced to start their assignments early.

, Do they continue to complete their homework after school without your prompting? If so, congratulations: you have successfully instilled effective study habits! If not, punish them for their irresponsibility and continue to monitor their work time as necessary.


Tell your children that if they show self-initiative in completing their work and therefore can earn your trust to manage their work independently, you will reward them by backing off.

, Suggestions include:


Writing down every task in a to-do list or agenda booklet with the due date
For long-term projects, setting due dates for certain stages of the projects before the actual final due date






Making flash cards for memorizing vocabulary words, key figures, dates, foreign language concepts, etc.






Starting to study for tests at least three days before the actual day of the test to maximize retention of the material
When studying for midterms or final exams, dividing up the studying into units and deciding when you want to study each unit beforehand
Finding classmates to create study groups
Taking meticulous notes in class and reviewing them after school to reinforce the material early on (so that when the night before the test arrives, absorbing everything will be much easier)

, Even if you don't ask your children to divulge the details of their planning, your question will remind them to start ahead of time, create a plan, and finish early. You should continue to show that you care about their academic success and that you will reward them for their good study habits.

Read books released in the public domain.,
Listen to audiobooks.,
Expand your music horizons.,
Check out films and documentaries.",How to Expand Your Knowledge Using the Internet1," Every year, new books are available to read for free once their copyright has expired. In most European countries and the United States, books are released into the public domain approximately 70 years after the author's death. After this point, you can read e-books at no cost.Project Gutenberg is a prominent volunteer effort to digitize books released into the public domain. They are an excellent source of free e-books.You can also purchase e-books, if you'd prefer to read contemporary novels.;
, Most books released into the public domain are available as a free audiobook. If you'd prefer a popular novel, you could purchase an audiobook instead. Audiobooks are a great way to absorb a novel when you're busy. If you work online, you can turn one on and enjoy the storyline while multi-tasking.

Similar to Project Gutenberg, LibriVox is a volunteer organization that makes public domain audiobooks available for free., Most any song you can think of is available online with the click of a button. Now's the time to explore new genres, or learn to appreciate one at a greater depth. If you've always wanted to know more about jazz or appreciate classical music, now is your chance.

Although you can listen to most music for free, downloading music legally will cost money. Don't download unauthorized music copies, as piracy is considered theft., Thanks to the internet, you have an unlimited movie resource. Some may claim that movies cannot be educational, but watching the right film can be an enlightening experience.Watch classic movies, foreign films, and documentaries. Look for movies that increase your understanding of the world and challenge your current perspective.

Respect copyright rules. Make sure you get your movies from legal, authorized sources.Although less movies are available in the public domain, you can watch many early films (like silent movies) for free."

Find your learning style.,
Study with your friends.,
Ask for help.,
Create goals.,
Choose topics you enjoy.,
Participate in activities.",How to Enjoy Learning1," Whether you are in junior high or college, you might be looking for ways to make learning more enjoyable. At times it can feel like your entire life revolves around classes and studying. If you are able to find your best learning style, you can make this experience more enjoyable.Everyone learns differently. Some people are visual learners, which means they learn best with images.
If you think you are a visual learner, try to use that to your advantage. For example, in History class, rely heavily on the maps and timelines to help you retain and enjoy the information.
You might be an aural learner. Do you enjoy listening to music and hearing people talk? Try setting the poems in your English class to a beat.
If you are a verbal learner, you enjoy speaking out loud. Try practicing your Latin vocabulary by quizzing a friend.;
, Maybe you don't enjoy learning because it feels like a solitary activity. One way to make it more enjoyable is to turn it into a group activity. Ask your friends to form a study group.You and your friends can quiz each other for your mid-terms. You'll still be studying, but at least you will have company.
Choose study partners who you enjoy being around. Just make sure that you will also focus on your work.
Take turns choosing a location. Maybe you could ask some friends to meet you at a coffee shop for a study session. Next time, let your friend think of somewhere fun to go.

, It makes sense that you will enjoy things that you are good at. Everyone likes feeling successful. If you are struggling in school, learning might feel less fun than it could be.Ask a teacher for help. If you cannot comprehend your Chemistry class, ask your instructor for some additional materials. Once you understand the material, learning will feel less like a chore.
Talk to the guidance counselor. Explain your likes and dislikes and find out if there are other classes you could be taking.
Your parents can also be a great resource. Ask your mom to spend some time with you studying your Spanish homework. This might be a good way for you to bond with your family, which can be fun.

, Getting an education can help you to succeed later in life. Try thinking about school as a way to help you find a career that you love. Take some time to reflect on what you would like to do when you are done with school. Write down things that you like to do. For example, do you love being around animals? Maybe you want to pursue a career as a veterinarian.
Ask your counselor to help you figure out which classes will help you prepare for your future goals. You will enjoy learning more if you view it as helping you to achieve your dream job.
Make small goals and large goals. For example, you could write down ""Get an A in Biology"" as a short-term goal. ""Get a scholarship to vet school"" could be a longer-term goal.

, If you are studying information that interests you, you will naturally enjoy learning more. When you are in high school and college, you will have some flexibility in choosing which classes to take. Take advantage of this opportunity to spend time doing what you enjoy.Maybe you enjoy writing. If so, try to take some additional composition classes.
Do you like art? Consider taking an Art History course.
Have you always been fascinated by the Civil War? Look for a history class that focuses on that era.

, Learning does not have to occur only in the classroom. Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people and learn new things. Consider joining a new club.If you enjoy writing, consider joining the staff of the school paper. This is a great way to hone your skills.
Maybe you have always loved to sing. Try out for choir or the school musical.
You might find that you have a knack for critical thinking. You might really enjoy being on the debate team.
Joining activities will also help you meet new people. These people can then become your study partners.

Acknowledge your surroundings.,
To start, after assessing your environment, is to figure out which methods will be the best to learn/study in this environment.,
Next, you must prepare yourself for the learning ahead by getting trivial disturbances out of your way.,
Now that your important and trivial, bodily, disturbances have been taken care of, it's time to begin the process of readying your brain for learning.,
PREPARATION PHASE: To begin focusing in on these snapshots, you must remove all disturbances from your area of study.,
You need to blank out your mind and body of concerns.,
Now onto the learning.,
LEARNING PHASE: Now, gather your learning materials in front of you, and begin reading/learning.,
RE-ITERATION PHASE: Every 15 minutes, stop and practice what you've just learned (or if this is impossible, go back and re-read only the most important parts of the article/topic).

,
RETAINMENT PHASE: Then, once you have done the re-iteration step, get up and take a quick jog or a fast walk, or anything that will make your mind remember the information.,
RE-DO PHASE: Once you have finished the ""retainment"" phase, relax yourself and repeat the processes starting at the ""LEARNING PHASE"".,
If you follow these steps to the line, and use your best judgement, you will succeed in learning your topic.",How to Enhance Your Learning Ability," If you are going to be learning in a school environment, you will have to prepare yourself differently than if you are going to be learning by yourself.


These steps are the general guide to how to learn and study better, but apply specifically to self-learning in your own home or in a quiet place without disturbances. If you come across a situation where some of the steps need to be changed or altered, try bringing the use of these steps back to the home/quiet area environment they were originally intended for.
Use your best judgement and try to stick as close to these guidelines as possible. If you do, you will ensure your success while learning!;
, This can be achieved by understanding where you will be learning, and using past experiences to guide you along the process.

,


Start off by assessing your body. Are you too cold/warm? Are you tired, stressed, irritated, angry, bored? Take a piece of paper and quickly write down everything that is bothering you or anything that might be a disturbance for you when you are about to learn. If this is in preparation for a school day, try to do this BEFORE you go to school.
Once you have your list written up, start at the most important problems and fix them, working your way from your biggest problems to your smallest. This should include ANYTHING that might be bothering you because anything, even the smallest of disturbances will affect how well your brain processes information. Your disturbances should fully be taken care of (as in, if you have to go to the bathroom, DO IT!
If you need sleep and can afford to get more rest, SLEEP! If you have bad breath and that bothers you, BRUSH! If you have little pet peeves that are bothering you, FIX THEM. The more that you have to keep your brain from wandering to the better!!!)

, Now your brain is like a giant camera. Every time you do something, it takes tiny snapshots of the information for later.


Most of the time your brain is spent processing EVERYTHING equally and taking millions of snapshots per second, by closing what is called synapses, of everything consistently at the same rate.
What you need to achieve is making your brain focus all, or most, of its snapshots onto your topic of study! If this can be done correctly, you will increase your learning potential by 60%!

, Find a quiet area and remove all disturbances from it.


If you have a computer on, and it's not the source of learning, turn it off. Make the room as quiet as possible.
Close the shades and windows so as little light as possible enters the room and then turn on lights to a level that allows you to study your material without squinting or straining AT ALL but while still being dimmer than normal.
This step is critical to keeping your brain from focusing on your environment.
When choosing a room, try a place with a comfortable armchair or bed/coach to lie down on.

A good location is your own bedroom, as long as it is empty of any people and completely quiet.



, A wise monk once said that this was his secret to his studies.


You must do something calming yet slightly active for exactly 10 minutes.
Use a stopwatch if it helps to time it right. This calming activity can be anything from taking a shower {don't actually wash yourself, just let the water calm and soothe you), to taking a leisurely stroll around your quiet room, to reading a soothing childrens' book.
Anything that is slightly active (requires slight concentration) and calming at the same time. Once you have your activity of choice, you will find that doing it over and over will help.

, After your 10 minutes in the shower or some other similar activity, you need to completely relax.


You can do this by lying down on a bed/coach and concentrating on every muscles and tense point in your body and letting control of that area slip completely away.
Start at your head and work your way down to your feet. Relax everything, allow yourself to sink into the bed, pretend you have died if that helps. You shouldn't move at all or use any muscle (besides breathing/living of course!).
Allow all of your senses to become alert, and listen for everything as you slowly find your muscles to be itching as they relax fully for the first time.
Do this for five minutes and then stop, slowly allowing your muscles to begin working again. Now it's time to drink some water. Your brain may be different but try 32 oz. to begin with. Drink it slowly and calmly and then you will be ready to begin learning.

, Take deep, even, non-conscious breathing and pay no attention to anything around you BUT what you are learning. Read EVERY line, and every important piece of information. You will remember it if you follow these instructions!

,,


Remember, it's a simple concept that your brain is more likely to remember something big and loud than something dull and boring.

For instance a tiger escapes from the zoo and chooses to chase you. You will most likely remember that event more than the cereal you ate for breakfast less than a week ago. This tiger attack will cause your brain to snap pictures twice as fast and all at once focusing in on the one event. This, by accident, takes all other information in your brain, and saves it along with the memory of the tiger. Without even meaning to, you will probably find, had you really been attacked by a tiger and survived, that you will probably have noticed EVERY detail.


The trick now is to make your brain think learning your dull and boring topic is as important as remembering how you escaped from that tiger! Don't worry, it's easier done than said in this case!
Allow yourself to think of important events, or listen to music. Both will allow you to associate yourself with the topic when you hear or think of those things.
Another good method is to play an action packed video game for 5 minutes. Anything that makes you jumpy, or causes your brain to pick up in speed will cause you to remember better.
Also, the more you study, the more streamlined you will find your behavior becomes. You will feel more like a machine than a person as you crunch through your work.

, Do this for about 1-2 hours per session, breaking every 15 minutes. After your desired session length if over, don't start the process again for at least 4 hours!!! Your brain needs this time to sort, organize, process, and store this new information!

, You will notice immediately that this will become an easy and efficient routine for you and you should also find that your brain remembers far better than you had ever thought it could. So away with you, and happy learning!

Make the words pertain to something personal to you.,
Begin by changing all of the numbers or dates to words.,
Create a humorous word game.,
Make an acronym to help remember items in a list.,
Use rhymes to make them stick in your memory.,
Create a road map.,
Use object associations.,
Sing it to remember it.,
Describe it.",How to Use Word Games to Remember Things,"


Most people can remember details that are important to them. Their own birthday, children's birthdays and amount of income are all things few people forget. This is because they have a personal interest in the date or amount.
When using word games to recall information, make the words relate to, and revolve around, things you never forget.;
, Words are much easier to remember than numerals.


Change numbers to words. Use words such as none, twice as many, dozen, half dozen, my age plus one and baker's dozen.

, You are more likely to remember the words if they are funny to you. The crazier they are, the more memorable they will be.


Consider creating jokes to help remind you of the information.

,


Assign a letter to each word to create a new word or phrase.

, People remember songs and poems, because rhymes are more easily remembered.


Create rhymes to remember names such as Hannah banana, silly Billy and Ella bella.

, This works especially well with a lot of information that needs to be remembered in order, such as a speech.


Associate each step of your speech with a route or path that you travel often. Make the path and the order of the speech correlate.
Group the information to be remembered into smaller chunks.
Instead of trying to remember long pieces of information, use word games to group smaller pieces. This technique is often used with Social Security numbers by memorizing three numbers together in a group.

,


Associate shapes, sizes and even names with items. Remember twins in that one has an ""oval shaped"" face or recall the name Mike by associating him with a microphone.

, Songs are often easier for people to remember than paragraphs of information, even though they may have the same number of words.


Turn the information into a fun song to sing. One great example of remembering information is the song ""The funny bone is connected to the ..."".

, This works well when remembering how to spell words. Describing how the letters look is often a helpful way to remember. Consider the spelling of Mississippi which uses crooked letters and hump backs.

Enroll in an online language course.,
Find an online tutor.,
Turn to the internet for study resources.,
Listen to foreign music or watch foreign films for practice.,
Try a programming language instead.",How to Expand Your Knowledge Using the Internet2," Some online educational resources offer basic language classes for free. Other websites, like universities, offer comprehensive language courses at a low price. Find a language course that best fits your need and begin studying to increase your comprehension.

Most people learn best when hearing or speaking the language aloud. Supplement your language learning with audio clips, or practice your skills with a native speaker., You may feel unsure how your skills are progressing if you're learning a language alone. By hiring a tutor, you can practice your language skills and receive comprehensive feedback. Depending on your needs, you can communicate with your tutor by email, phone, or video conference. Many tutors offer language classes at an affordable price.Choose a native speaker for your tutor if possible. They will be best at teaching you grammar, pronunciation, and conversational skills.

, Online, you can access flashcards, practice sentences, and worksheets at little-to-no cost. You can also interact with other language learners via forums. Use study resources to further cement your knowledge of the language, especially if you're struggling in your online course.

Improve your language skills with apps. Language-learning apps can turn practice time into a fun and educational game.

, Few activities are as beneficial for language-learning as listening to a native speaker. You may not be able to travel to your country of choice, but you can listen to native speakers. Watch a foreign film and analyze the language. Look up the lyrics to a foreign song beforehand and listen to it several times. With every repetition, you'll recognize more words.When watching a foreign movie, try one without subtitles. You may find yourself relying too much on the text instead of the audio.

, If foreign languages aren't your cup of tea, try learning Python, C++, Java, or another programming language. Like second languages, online courses and tutoring programs are available for potential code learners

Start with a simple program (like Python or Ruby) before you move on to more complex languages.Programming is best learned through practice. Take your knowledge learned in courses and experiment with making programs. Even if your program has bugs, you'll learn a lot from the experience.

Try a MOOC (massive open online course).",How to Expand Your Knowledge Using the Internet3," Email a local university to see if they offer independent study courses, where you learn at your own pace online. Most colleges will let you take their courses without applying for a program. Independent study can be a great option if you're too busy for scheduled classes.

How much you learn in an independent study course is up to you. You will benefit the most from the course if you maintain strong motivation., Plenty of online resources offer free study materials in mathematics, sciences, humanities, and other subjects. An educational resource site might have practice exercises, videos, and other coursework to help you learn. You can use educational resources as a supplement to your courses or as a primary source of learning.

To further their mission in building and growing small businesses, they offer free online business classes like ""Understanding Your Customer,"" ""Establishing Values for Your Business,"" and ""Introduction to Pricing.""You can access free courses through their online Learning Center.


, Many respected universities (like Stanford, Yale, UC Berkeley, and Harvard) offer free online courses or lecture series. You can watch videos, complete assignments, and even receive a certificate for your portfolio. Some courses even let you interact with the professor as you learn., MOOCs offer educational courses to anyone who wants to learn, with no limit on class attendance or geographical location. Most MOOCs are structured similarly to university courses, though they don't usually offer academic credit. Through MOOCs, you can receive free distance learning at little-to-no cost.MOOC professors are usually established in their field and provide accurate, enriching content for students.One downside of MOOCs is that, because of the large class size, you don't typically get to interact with the professor. Messages or questions are usually addressed by other students, and grading is often automatic."

Use any down time.,
Keep a homework planner.,
Start with items that are due first.,
Stick to a study schedule.,
Take short breaks.,
Set study goals.",How to Stay on Top of Homework1," Carry around at least some of your homework with you. Whenever you find yourself doing something that doesn’t use your total concentration, pull out your homework and spend some time on it. This is particularly easy to do with reading assignments. If your assignment is more complex, just scribble down a few notes to get the brainstorming process started.Lunchtime is a great opportunity to work on an assignment and so is the commute home, as long as someone else is driving. If you have a part-time job, take advantage of the slow moments.
If your instructor gives you time during the class period to study, take advantage of it. It is especially important to make good use of study halls if you are an athlete.;
, Log in all of your assignment details in one specific location. You can use a paper planner (sometimes given out for free at schools), the calendar function on your phone, or even a downloadable app. The point is to get a realistic idea of what your work week should look like.This system only works if you keep up with it. Spend time each Sunday evening looking over your planner and making sure that all dates and assignments are entered in correctly. Estimate if you’ve allowed for ample time for each activity.
Some people prefer to schedule their week down to the hour. Others prefer to create a basic “to-do” list for each day. Try a few different approaches to see what works the best for you.Consider using an app, such as iHomework, to keep track of your assignments and deadlines. This one, in particular, will alert you when an assignments is almost due. Many homework apps are free with some available for a small fee., As you consider planning or when you sit down for work, jump in to the most critical items at first. The deadlines for these assignments will only get closer and you don’t want to procrastinate. Keeping them in the forefront of your mind will help you to complete them quickly and efficiently.For example, if a paper is due tomorrow it gets priority over a worksheet that you must complete by next week. Don’t get distracted by the idea of multitasking, try to focus your attention on one project at a time.

, Make homework time a part of your everyday routine. If you plan to study while out, determine exactly when that is possible and maintain that schedule. If you plan to study at home, assess your workload when you first walk into your door and decide how much time is needed to complete everything. You can also simply set aside 1-3 hours a night allowing you to possibly get ahead as well.When creating your schedule consider when you work the best. Some people prefer to work late into the night while others enjoy working in the morning. There is nothing wrong with getting up early to get a jump on homework as long as you can stick to that schedule.

, Divide up your homework time with quick pre-planned breaks. Depending on the project that you are working on, it is a good idea to aim for a 5 minute break each 30 minutes or one 15 minute break per hour. Set a timer on your phone to make sure that you don’t work through your breaks.Get up and move around during your breaks. You’re probably sitting while working so now is the time to get the blood flowing and re-energize. Take a quick walk. Eat a healthy snack, like some almonds, and drink a bit of water too., As you look over your planner and daily schedule, think about what you would like to accomplish each day, each week, and even each month. Be realistic as you set these goals and understand that you cannot possibly do an excellent job at everything all of the time.When a major research project is due a good goal would be to complete the research part of the process well in advance of the final deadline, giving you time to write. This is a realistic goal and it breaks up a larger project, making it seem more doable.
Part of setting goals is keeping your priorities in order. Recognize those activities that can wait until the weekend, such as shopping, and do them then. Also, keep an eye on your extracurricular activities to make sure that you can still achieve your academic goals while participating."
"
Identify what you intend to research.Ideally, you will have a specific idea, notion, or proposal ready for research before you find a PhD advisor.,
Check faculty bios.,
Contact potential advisors.Send potential advisors an email to bounce some ideas off them.,
Look more closely at individual publications.Check Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) and Academia (https://www.academia.edu/) for recent publications of individuals you’re interested in working with on your PhD.,
Contact other graduate students.Universities often list their graduate students -- both Master’s and PhD students -- on the corresponding department’s web page along with an indication as to who their advisor is.If you wish to get more information about a specific advisor, contact one of these students about their experience working with the advisor you’re considering.,
Evaluate each potential advisor’s character.,
Narrow down your list.,
Know what you want in an advisor.,
Set specific expectations for your relationship with your advisor.You should expect that they credit you when presenting research projects you contributed to, or when publishing papers that you assisted with in some way.,
Develop your relationship with your advisor.Take a class with your advisor to see how they explain and understand their subject.,
Have a backup plan (or two) in place.",How to Find a PhD Advisor," Use this research topic to guide you when selecting an advisor.


If you are interested in French military history and you apply to study with a historian specializing in Chinese literature, you will probably not be accepted as a student. Even if you are accepted, your advisor will be of little use in your PhD career because they will not have the background you need to investigate and think carefully about the topic you’re interested in.
It’s often difficult to find out what you really want to research before you’ve had at least some graduate school education. It might help if you get your Master’s degree first.
If you are having a hard time coming up with a good research topic, make a list of less-specific topics you’re interested in, then think of ways to gradually zero in on your area of specialty. For instance, you might go from history, to U.S. history, to history of the Civil War, to the history of medical service during the Civil War. You could then look specifically for a medical historian or a Civil War historian as your advisor.;
, Once you have at least a rough idea of what you want to research, look for a professor with knowledge of the topic. Universities offer brief biographies and CVs of staff on each department’s page. These biographies usually state what the professor’s research interests are. Check a few of these in the order to find a faculty member who has interests that align roughly with yours. Look for someone whose area of research specialization could help you develop a topic of your own.This step is especially useful if you’re limiting yourself to a certain geographical region or a particular school (in order to, for instance, stay close to your family).
If you’re unsure of what universities to check, look for relevant faculty positions. Do an online search for your topic followed by “PhD.” Look for professor biographies and CVs in the search results.

, Introduce yourself as a PhD student (or potential PhD student, as the case may be) and indicate that you’re looking for research topics and problems in their field.


Ask, for instance, “I was thinking about conducting research on the Roman roots of English architecture. Do you think that would be a a good research topic?”
If the professor responds enthusiastically to your proposal, you’re in business. If they do not, they might suggest alternate topics that you might be interested in exploring.If possible, meet the faculty member face-to-face to ask your questions and discuss your ideas. Professors are generally happy to dispense advice.

, Alternately, you could visit a university library to access additional online academic publications or view their printed versions.


If you aren’t enrolled at a university, you can usually access their database of scholarly publications with a guest pass.
Don’t pretend to have read a potential advisor’s publications if you have not.
Be sure to distinguish between actual research papers and research or book reviews.A good advisor will publish a steady stream of original research, along with some reviews as well.

,


If the graduate students don’t have their email listed, you could look them up on social media and shoot them a message.
Alternately, or in addition to the above, you could contact previous students who have gone on to an academic career of their own. Professors sometimes mention in their brief online biographies who they studied with.
Keep in mind that students are human beings and have their own biases. An advisor that seemed impossible to one student can seem perfect for another.

, The relationship between the PhD advisor and student is very important for student success.If the professor you meet with is brusque, rude, or seems to be otherwise deficient in character, you might have a difficult experience working with them. Look elsewhere for an advisor if your interaction with a potential advisor is negative.


If you’ve already met the potential advisor to discuss research topics, you could reflect on that meeting to judge their character, too.
Meeting the potential advisor is also a good idea because it lets you find out more about the school. You can often find out only so much online. You could ask questions about the other faculty, graduate students, funding opportunities and grants, and campus life.

, After looking into several potential advisors, zero in on the ones you think you’d do well with. Some of this work will be done for you as you investigate professors who are retiring or not taking on new graduate students. Depending on your research area, you might have only a few choices. If you don’t like them, think about revising your research topic. However, once you’ve assembled a list of several potential advisors, weigh the pros and cons of each. Besides the factors you already considered (their area of specialty, quality of publications, and personality), you should think about thelocation (Where will you have to move to?)
expense (How expensive is your PhD tuition? Does the school offer a stipend?)
long-term opportunities (Does the school offer research grants and funds?)
necessary commitment (How many hours are you expected to put in? How long is the PhD expected to take?)

, In order to select the right kind of mentor, you need to know what kind of student you are. If you are someone who is very independent and comfortable working with minimal guidance, then you would do well to choose an advisor who is generally hands-off. On the other hand, if you like getting a lot of feedback and interaction with your advisor, you might choose a junior faculty member, or pursue your PhD at a less notable university.


You might get more independence if you’re working with a highly esteemed professor, someone who is at the top of their field. Advisors that are well-established in a given field are usually comfortable with this kind of relationship.Don’t select an advisor simply because they are a renowned expert in their field.

, You should also expect that they will help you prepare for conferences or other talks as needed. The advisor should not pit you and another PhD student in competition with each other on the same problem or project. Finally, the advisor should help you edit your papers or thesis chapters, and encourage you to develop professionally.


You do not need to enunciate these expectations to your advisor explicitly, but you should keep them in mind as you proceed in your PhD career.
If your advisor does not meed your expectations, they might be thinking more of their own career than about their role as a mentor. However, it might also be a simple case of misunderstanding your needs and expectations. Academics are busy and imperfect people, like everyone else. Talk to your advisor about how you wish they would help you more in whatever area you feel they are lacking.
If your advisor continues to fail you, you might want to look for another advisor. Don’t be afraid to switch advisors.

, Interact with them in class by asking appropriate questions to show your interest. If possible, apply to become their research assistant.


Always be polite and professional in conversation with your advisor.
Schedule meetings ahead of time and call to cancel if you can’t make it.
Solicit his or her advice on your research projects and coursework.
During meetings pertaining to your research project, take notes.
Know what your advisor expects of you and ask questions if you are confused or need guidance.

, Lots of things can go wrong in the relationship between you and your PhD advisor. Hold on to your narrowed-down list of potential advisors, and think about other faculty members at your university who you think might make a good advisor if things don’t work out with the advisor you selected. If you misjudged their character, or if they do not meet your expectations, do not hesitate to switch to another advisor.


Alternately, you could think about switching from a PhD to a Master’s degree if you are too deep into your research project and just want to end it.If your advisor becomes ill or dies, or moves on to a different university (and you are unable to follow), you might have no choice but to go with plan B.

Pay attention in class.,
Take note of the assignment details.,
Try to complete every assignment.,
Check your final work.,
Encourage yourself.,
Never cheat.,
Check that you have your finished homework.",How to Stay on Top of Homework2," Take a seat at the front of the class. Create a steady stream of notes. Ask questions and participate as often as you can. The information that you will receive in class usually serves as the foundation for your homework, so make an effort to actively listen and learn.Try to find something interesting within the subjects that you might consider ‘boring.’ For example, if you dislike history but enjoy fashion, you might find the history of fashion and dress really exciting. Ask your teacher about it and see if you can use this interest in your homework.

, Write down everything your teacher says if they announce the assignment in class. If they give out a hand-out read over it closely to see if there is anything that you are missing. If you sit down to work on the project and are unsure about something reach out to a classmate for a second opinion., Give every piece of homework your best effort, even if you don’t feel particularly confident in the final product. When in doubt make an educated guess using the information that you do understand. Homework is, in part, about developing a skill set so your instructor will most likely appreciate your attempt.


This is a good practice to follow as it will help you on most tests as well. It is usually better to leaving nothing blank on an exam as your instructor may be able to award you partial credit for the attempt.

, As soon as you finish an assignment set it aside for a few moments. Then, come back to it and look it over for any mistakes. You can also ask your friend, roommate, classmate, or parent to take a quick glance over the assignment as well. This is especially helpful with essays as they may catch an error that you may have overlooked., Repeat aloud or in your head, “I can do this,” if you get frustrated. Take a few deep breaths and then jump back in to the assignment. Remind yourself that homework isn’t intended to be easy, it should challenge you. Think about your long-term goals and remember that all of your hard work will pay off in the end., No matter how stressed out you are it is important that you turn in your own work. Don’t ask your friends to give you the answers or to help you when they are not supposed to. If you do this you may get caught but you will definitely be less prepared for the quiz or test later.

, After a long day and night it is really easy to walk out the door and forget your homework on the table. To prevent this as soon as you finish a piece of homework put it in your backpack or bag. Then, take a quick glance inside your bag before heading out in the morning just to make sure everything is there.Have a designated area where you put projects that are ‘in progress’ so you don’t confuse them with homework that needs to be turned in.

"
"
Ask your teacher questions.,
Request extra help from your teacher.,
Get your parents involved.,
Study in a group or in pairs.,
Hire a tutor.",How to Stay on Top of Homework3," Raise your hand or approach your teacher as soon as you find something that you are confused or concerned about. Never feel shy or stupid for asking a question. Odds are someone else in the class is wondering about the same thing and will appreciate you stepping up. If you have multiple questions you can always wait until after class too.


For example, if your teacher normally assigns five chapters to read over the weekend and she didn’t say anything about it this time you might want to ask her. You could say, “Do we need to do our usual chapter reading this weekend?” This way you can relax and not worry about missing something.
If your teacher is okay with it you could also ask how long a certain assignment will take to finish. This will help you to better schedule your time for the week., If you are confused about the material covered in class or if you are unsure about your approach to the homework, it might be best to make an appointment with your teacher after class. This will allow them to concentrate all of their attention on helping you succeed. If they are unavailable to meet consider approaching another teacher in a similar subject or even a school counselor.You might approach your teacher and say, “I’m just not getting that math worksheet. Is there a time this week when we can sit down and look it over together?”
If you ask for help in this way make sure that you’ve started the work yourself. Don’t expect your teacher to do the work for you.

, It is not your parent’s responsibility to police your homework (and you probably don’t want them to). However, if you are really stumped or just want a second opinion, you can always ask for their help. They could read over your essay and suggest new approaches. Or, they could test out your answers to a worksheet.If you live and study at home your parents could also help to create a good study space by keeping the area quiet and preventing other family members from interrupting you., Talk with your fellow students and organize a study group. Your group can focus on a particular subject or project or you could cover all types of homework together. You can agree to keep each other accountable by banning phone time, etc. Just make sure that you stay on task and actually get your homework done or this extra time could put you behind.Make sure that you are only working together on projects that given the “okay” for group work by your teacher. Otherwise, you could be committing a version of academic dishonesty by not following the rules of the assignment.
You can also meet with your group virtually thanks to various programs, such as Google Hangout, which allows you to video chat with numerous people at once., If you continue to struggle with the homework for a certain subject or if you just want another perspective, you should consider working with a tutor. Some tutors charge a per hour fee whereas others volunteer and work for free. Talk to your teacher or school counselor for additional information.Libraries are a great source of information about tutoring and other resources. Just call your local library and ask what programs they have in place to help students."

Tackle the most enjoyable parts first.,
Start working for five minutes.,
Break up your time.,
Get started.,
Be sure you understand your assignment.,
Make sure your goals are manageable.",How to Start an Assignment1," Look over your assignment and discover the steps it will require you to take in order to complete it. Find the most appealing and personally interesting steps and work on those first. By doing the parts of your assignment that you like the most, you will be more inclined to get started and see the rewards of working rather than procrastinating.

For example, you might research areas of a report that you find most interesting before moving on to other areas.
If your math assignment has different types of questions, try doing those that you enjoy the most before moving on to the others.
You might also try tackling smaller or easier tasks first so you can cross a few items off your list. Seeing that you've already made progress may help you feel motivated to continue.;
, The biggest challenge in overcoming procrastination is often taking the first step. To help you get started make it a goal to start working and only work for five minutes. Doing this will help you take the first and most difficult step, allowing you to build momentum and view the assignment as a much easier task than you may have originally thought.

Promise yourself that you will meet your goal of working for five minutes on the assignment.
Once you get started, you may find that you don't want to stop working. Otherwise, you can take a break and come back to the assignment, knowing you're at least five minutes closer to finishing than you were before.

, Looking at your assignment as one large task can make it seem more intimidating. The same thing occurs when you look at the time it will take as one solid block. Instead, try breaking your work up into manageable blocks that seem more easy to tackle.Try to set reasonable periods of time that you know you can meet. For example, you might set aside two hours on a Friday to dedicate to your assignment. If you don't have that much time all at once, try to carve out a few 20- or 30-minute blocks.
You may or may not wish to continue working after your time limit has gone by.
Have a realistic understanding of how fast you can write and plan your schedule accordingly.

, Again, just getting started can often be the most difficult part of the process, but you can't get anything done until you sit down and do it. So stop cleaning, stop emailing, stop making lists, stop worrying or thinking about the assignment or feeling bad that you haven't gotten started. Just start working on it. Now.

, To successfully restructure your assignment, you should fully read and understand it. While it might seem simple, properly understanding your assignment will allow you to effectively break the assignment down and meet it's requirements. It can also be an easy step to get you started on your assignment and overcome procrastination.It can help to read the assignment as soon as you get it and then ask any questions you might have.
If you're not sure if you understand the assignment, try rewriting it in your own words or explaining it to someone else. If you find you can't or have a lot of questions, you may need more information.
You should have an overview of the assignment, understand the main task, and understand the technical and stylistic requirements.
Look for important words in the instructions to understand the assignment. These words might include define, explain, compare, relate, or prove.
Keep your audience in mind and write a paper that would best deliver information to them.

, Most assignments can seem like a lot of work when viewed as a whole. Viewing your assignment in this way can make it seem daunting and difficult to complete, resulting in procrastination. Try breaking the assignment down into smaller goals that you know you can achieve to make it seem more manageable right now.


Goals that are too big or not well defined can be difficult to start working towards.
Smaller and well defined goals can seem easier to achieve than larger ones.
For example, you could break a research paper down into several smaller tasks: 1) do preliminary research, 2) write an outline, 3) draft an introduction, 4) draft body paragraphs, 5) write conclusion, 6) revise. Each of these is much more do-able on its own.

Change your mood.,
Stay positive.,
Avoid procrastination while working.,
Create some consequences for procrastination.,
Don't worry about perfection.",How to Start an Assignment2," Bad moods tend to make procrastination seem much more appealing. Procrastinating seems to offer an escape from the work that will likely only make your mood worse. Instead, set positive rewards for yourself to look forward to after you have done your work.You might want to go for a quick walk after working for a set amount of time.
Try reading a website or book that you enjoy for a few minutes after working.
Alternatively, try a quick burst of exercise before setting to work. Exercise releases feel-good chemicals called endorphins and can also help boost your memory., Procrastinating often results when the focus is on how negative the assignment seems. This negative focus causes us to avoid it, delaying the perceived discomfort and doing something we enjoy instead. It can be useful to focus on the positive aspects of getting your assignment done to make it seem like the more appealing option.


Instead of dreading your work, focus on how good it will feel to make progress. You won't have it hanging over your head. You can actually enjoy the weekend instead of feeling guilty.
Keeping your eye on long-term rewards can help you stay motivated to finish your assignment.

, Even though you may have started your assignment it is still possible to procrastinate while working on it. Pay careful attention to how you are working on your assignment and avoid some of the following examples of procrastination:

Avoid moving your workspace constantly.
Don't get lost on tangential research.
Don't take constant breaks to get a snack.

, Procrastinating focuses your attention on short-term rewards while neglecting the long-term consequences of putting off your assignment. Creating some immediate consequences for yourself can help you focus on the immediate benefits of starting your assignment..For every hour you waste procrastinating, you can limit how much television you watch that night.
If you waste too much time procrastinating, you might deny yourself a favorite snack later on.

, When you are setting out to start your assignment you needn't worry about a perfect first draft. Producing a perfect assignment on the first draft can make the assignment feel more overwhelming than it needs to be. The goal when starting your assignment is to simply begin the process. You can always come back later on after you begin and refine your assignment."

Turn the name into a picture.,
Visualize the spelling.,
Connect the person with another person.,
Focus on an odd feature.,
Create a crazy visualization.,
Combine techniques.,
Put them in your memory palace.",How to Use Visualization to Remember Names1," When you hear a name, try to associate it with a visual image in your mind. For example, with someone named ""Misty, "" picture a misty mountain or stream or the mist in the early morning. These types of associations can go a long way to helping your memorization., If you don't have time to write a name down, imagining the spelling can be helpful. You need to say and sound out the letters of the name, if possible. Of course, you don't want to just start spelling, as that will make you look a little weird. Rather, ask about the spelling, and repeat the spelling back to the person.As you say each letter, see it in your mind as well.
Try to make each letter dance or move a little as you visualize it, which can also help with recall.
Another tactic is to visualize it written out somewhere familiar, like a dry erase board., If you know someone with the same name as the person you're being introduced to, take a moment to connect those two people in your mind, so you are better able to remember the new person's name.Say you're meeting someone named ""Mary,"" and you already a know a Mary. Picture the Mary you know in your head (just her face), maybe even dancing around a bit.
Add the new person's head next to the one you know. You can even have the new person's head bounce in time with the person you know.

, As you begin talking to a new person, try to pick out something unusual about the person's appearance. You could love the person's abundantly curly hair or associate the person with their dimples. Maybe you notice the person's brilliantly blue eyes. Try to help the person's name stick by focusing on an unusual feature., Another visual technique to help your memory is to create a picture of the person in your mind with something they're associated with. For instance, if you meet Mike who enjoys mountain climbing, picture him standing on top of a mountain (in his suit, to make it more ridiculous), speaking into a microphone (mic) like it's an open-mic night at the coffee shop.The sillier the image you create, the better. Out-of-the-ordinary situations will help it stick better.

, It's also helpful to combine techniques, such as making a visual association and using an unusual feature. Once you latch onto an unusual feature and figure out a visual associate with the name, try to connect the two through an action.For example, if you meet a Vicky, that you associate with Vick's Vapor Rub, visualize someone smearing it over the unusual feature, such as her curly hair.
Once again, the wackier the association is, the more likely you are to remember it.
Don't forget to go over it more than once to really solidify it.

, Some people use what's sometimes known as a ""memory palace"" to remember things, including names. To create a memory palace, use somewhere you are familiar with in the real world that has multiple rooms or defined spaces, such as your house. Start by visualizing just 5 of those rooms or spaces. In each space, pick 5 pieces of furniture or items, and number them off in a logical way. When you want to remember something, place it in the memory palace.For example, maybe you want to remember Jon who enjoys trampolines. Visualize him jumping up and down on your bed in your memory palace.

Check the presentation.,
Pay heed to “transition”.,
Check sentences and phrases.,
Improve vocabulary, wherever needed.,
Check for originality.",How to Revise Your Writing Assignment," This means that your assignment should be submitted in a presentable form so that it creates a good first impression. Frame the first sentence of your assignment in such a way that it captures the attention of your reader and motivates them to read further. Make sure to introduce your idea and goals clearly. Present your graphs and tables neatly. If your assignment lacks these points, edit it to make it suitable.
, Do your paragraphs connect to each other? Is the relationship between your paragraphs clear? Are the paragraphs in a logical order? If your paragraphs do not follow a proper sequence, it is time to modify them and link them to each other properly so that the entire assignment is meaningful. Eliminate any redundant paragraph and shorten them if you can., Check that your sentences are short and to the point. They should not carry any irrelevant data. The tone should be consistent across the sentences. They should flow properly and be clear and logical, too. Avoid sentence fragments and dangling modifiers., Use the right set of words in your assignment. Select the word terminology according to your study area and use it in a consistent manner. Make sure that there are no spelling errors. Good writing involves using the correct grammar, spelling and punctuation. You can’t entirely rely on grammar software programs, since the words are checked in isolation and are not viewed in context with each other., You can, of course, take ideas from other writers' work but it is necessary to cite them as references in your assignment; otherwise your work can be labelled as plagiarized. If that happens, your assignment may receive a heavy deduction of marks. Be sure to frame your entire assignment originally."

Take organization seriously.,
Label each pocket or sleeve.,
At the end of the school day, double check your bag.",How to Remember to Turn in Homework1," Use folders to help you stay organized. The more sleeves or pockets the better. Ideally, use a binder or accordion folder to help you organize materials for multiple classes in one place. Keep everything together to help you keep track of the materials you need to complete your homework, and to help ensure you bring your completed homework to class.


There are the classic two pocket, side-folding folder in any color you can imagine, or adorned by the comic book hero, cartoon character, or sports team of your choice. One option is to get a few of these and use one for each of your classes.
If you have separate folders for each class, keep all of them with you throughout the school day, perhaps in a three-ring binder.
Alternatively, get yourself an accordion folder. These multi-pocketed wonders, usually equipped with a flap or other mechanism to ensure your materials stay where you put them, can immediately improve your organization.;
, Whether in a binder with multiple folders or in an accordion folder, make sure each of your classes has a spot designated to hold assignments. You may even want to assign two slots to each class, one for the actual assignment you’re working on and another for supporting materials.


Put any notes, handouts, worksheets, or assignment materials into the proper folder location as soon as you receive them, and keep them there whenever you’re not using them.
Keep your organizing materials with you. Bring your binder or accordion with you to every single class. This ensures you always have all of your assignments with you for every class.
For some extra tips, check out How to Be Organized in School.

, Make sure you have the materials you will need to work on any homework that you need to work on. Don’t forget the textbooks that you don’t always bring to class, as they are more likely to have found their way to the bottom of your locker.


Before school every morning, triple check your bag! There’s nothing worse than simply forgetting completed homework at home. Make sure you have your organizing materials with you, and that you placed you completed assignments in them.

Jot the person's name down.,
Write down some notes about the person.,
Request a business card.,
Type the name in your phone.",How to Use Visualization to Remember Names2," Writing a person's name down is a visual cue that can help increase your recall. When someone tells you their name, immediately take the time to write it down. You can jot it down in a notepad, for instance, or even just a napkin.You may not have time to write the name down right away. Just be sure to stop and take a moment as soon as you can to write down names.

, Another visual cue that can help you remember later is to make notes about the person under the person's name. Maybe the mentioned their family or where they like to go for coffee. Maybe they mentioned a pastime or a hobby. Jotting these things down can help clue you in later, and serve as a visual reminder., While just looking at a name won't help you remember as well as writing the name, seeing the name can help. When they hand you the card, be sure to study the name for a second to cement it in your brain. Plus, a business card can serve as a reminder later if you forget., Another visual cue you can use is to type their name and number into your phone. Ask them to spell out their name. That way, you're getting the exact spelling, as well as stomping it into your memory. Another option is to have them type it in, so that you get the exact spelling. Then you can look the person up on social media later."

Remember to actually turn in your homework.,
Keep and actively maintain a weekly day planner.,
Commit to a paper day planner.,
Set alarms to remind you about assignments.",How to Remember to Turn in Homework2," One way to make sure you always turn in your homework is to do so right when you walk into each of your classes. Of course, your teachers may have certain rules or preferences that prevent you from doing so.


As soon as you sit down, take your completed assignment out of its folder and place in on your desk in front of you. Keep it there until you are able to turn it in.
Get an extra folder exclusively for completed assignments and keep it in the very front of your binder. This way, you’ll be reminded of your completed assignments whenever you access any of your class materials.

, Update your planner frequently. As due dates approach, be aware ahead of time by always knowing what’s due a week in advance.


Always write down all of your homework assignments as soon as you are made aware of them. Be extremely detailed with the information you include. For example, jot down the chapters or page numbers of the textbooks or other materials associated with each assignment.
If your class has a syllabus or course schedule, enter all of the included due dates into your personal planner.
Include information regarding time slots you will not be able to work on homework, such as music or sports team practices, a babysitting gig, or family meals.

, Lots of people use electronic calendars these days, which have their benefits. Maintaining a calendar on your phone ensures that it’s always with you, but you can easily get in the habit of keeping your day planner with you as well, especially on school days. Further, there are important advantages to paper planners.Tangible planners are easier to update with quick additions or edits.
It’s always satisfying to cross a completed assignment off with an actual writing utensil.
Day planners are more appropriate for in-class use. Since you’ll often be assigned homework in class, and want to enter new assignments immediately, this is a particularly important factor.

, Your phone can be a good secondary reminder of due dates, even if you don’t update its calendar as often. Set an alarm the night before an assignment is due, at a time you know you’ll be at home. When it goes off, check to make sure the homework is completed, in the proper folder, and in your bag.


Another great source of reminders is your teacher. If you struggle to remember to bring your homework to class, talk to your teacher about it. Your teachers will likely have some helpful advice, and can even remind you the day before homework assignments are due.
Your teachers will likely remind the whole class if you ask them to start reminding you, which may help your classmates remember their homework too!

Schedule blocks of time to work on your homework.,
Get up earlier.,
Use study hall, a free hour, or homeroom to do homework.,
Get a head start on your assignments.",How to Remember to Turn in Homework3," Recognize the timeslots you have available to work on homework. You will have different amounts of time to work on homework different days of the week. This will require you to plan accordingly. If you’re involved in extracurricular activities on certain days of the week, get in the practice of working on conflicting homework assignments ahead of time.


Think about how long it will take you to complete assignments and plan accordingly.
Schedule specific portions of larger projects separately.If you struggle with finding large enough time slots to complete your homework, recognize that you need to make the time to do so. For instance, if you spend a good portion of each evening socializing with friends (online or in person), do all of your homework before you go out or get online.

, Getting up earlier will almost immediately improve your ability to get more done on a typical day. Even if you only get up a half an hour earlier every day, you can use this extra time to get ahead on reading and other responsibilities.


Kick starting your day will increase your productivity generally and prepare you for more efficient homework sessions.Stick with it. If you get in the habit of getting up a bit earlier, you’ll likely start going to bed earlier as well.
Don’t fall into the trap of staying up late working on homework, as your focus and productivity is greatly diminished late at night.

, This may seem obvious, but it will likely take more effort than you think. It’s easy to get distracted by friends or others’ activities.


Wear headphones and sit facing a wall if you’re prone to visual distraction.
Remind yourself that getting your homework done during school hours allows you to do whatever you want in your free time, including hang out with friends.

, One of the reasons you should start thinking about assignments as soon as they are assigned is to ensure you understand what will be necessary to complete your homework before you sit down to really work on it (in terms of both time and materials).


If you are ever unsure of an assignment, ask your teacher about it as soon as you have a question.
Get a jumpstart on weekend homework on Thursday or Friday. If you know you’re going to need to do some homework over the weekend, try to get it done earlier so you can relax and enjoy yourself over the weekend as well.
Do not leave all of your weekend homework for Sunday.
Try to plan weekend social activities for Saturday, and dedicate at least a few hours of Friday evening to schoolwork. If you do end up with plans on a Friday night, make sure you set aside a few hours on Saturday to work on homework.

Find the study environment that works best for you.,
Study with friends.,
Make sure you have everything you need before you go somewhere to study.,
Take advantage of technology.,
Take breaks.",How to Remember to Turn in Homework4," While quiet, private places may be ideal for some people, human productivity varies for everyone in different settings. In fact, some people focus better with lots of people around and a bit of noise.


Try studying in different environments to find the one that allows you to focus the best.
Avoid screens, especially TVs. This includes your phone. Put your phone in your bag and leave it there. Only check it during scheduled breaks.Wear headphones (or earplugs). Whether in a library or coffee shop, headphones will help reduce the frequency of auditory distractions. Choose music that does not have lyrics, and is more ambient than bass-driven. Think “background music” when you’re making your selection, but know that you can still listen to music you enjoy.
If you’re studying at home, try to use a room in which you won’t be interrupted by family members or roommates. Let others know you intend to work on homework for a certain amount of time, and ask them to let you be.

, If you have another friend that needs to get work done – perhaps even the same assignment – work alongside one another. Working beside someone else may actually increase your ability to focus on your homework.


The company of a friend can keep you from wondering what everybody else is up to, and can even make doing your homework feel like hanging out.
Avoid studying with friends who tend to interrupt a lot, or who have trouble focusing themselves. You can hang with whoever you want once your work is done!

, This includes your organizational materials, any textbooks or resources, and the equipment you’ll need to complete an assignment – even if it’s only a writing utensil and some paper or your computer and charger.


Include a healthy snack, as well as a water bottle. Not having to get up for sustenance will keep you grinding through your homework for a longer period of time.
Don’t forget sticky notes. They’re weirdly helpful. Use them as visual reminders of important things to remember, and to keep pages in books you’re studying or otherwise referencing frequently.

, Computers have increased human productivity immensely. You can research, write, and edit much faster by using a computer. However, don’t allow all of the non-productive stuff you can do on a computer to distract you from your homework.


Computers can also help you organize. Familiarize yourself with web-based storage systems like Google Drive and Dropbox. These will allow you to save and access files from anywhere you have internet access.Use a flash drive too. Save all electronic files to both a web-based storage system and a thumbdrive. Keep the drive with you at all times. (Get a thumb drive with a keychain attachment!) This way, even if you forget your hard copy, you can print another at school and eliminate the unfortunate “I forgot my homework” scenario.

, When you sit down to work on homework, commit to working for a certain length of time, and schedule yourself a short break. This will keep you from getting overwhelmed or burnt out during long study days. It will also help keep your mind focused.


Try a 10 minute break after every 50 minutes of focused work.Use these breaks to go for a short walk, use the washroom, do a brief physical exercise (like stretching, push-ups, or jumping jacks), or to get a simple chore out of the way.
Do not allow yourself to get distracted by activities that will prevent you from going back to work or will get your mind out of study mode. For instance, don’t call someone you haven’t spoken with in a while or sit down with friends who are hanging out but not studying.
Reward yourself when completing assignments – but not before. If you’ve been itching for a bowl of ice cream, don’t dive into the freezer during a break. Instead, enjoy the ice cream once your homework is done for the evening and you can focus all of your attention – or none at all – on every bite.

Take good notes.,
Mix different styles of note-taking.,
Figure out which note-taking method works best for you.,
Store your notes in one place.,
Keep track of your hand-outs and syllabi.,
Have a separate notebook or binder for each class.,
On a computer have separate folders for each class.,
Create a master outline of notes for each class.,
Stay consistent.",How to Organize Notes1," One of the keys to having your notes organized is to make sure you're taking good notes. This means that you only write down the really important things and don't take down every single thing your instructor says (unless it's really funny, of course).Note down things that the instructor says more than once. Reiterating points is a way of highlighting what the most important material is going to be. Anything that's repeating is probably going to end up on a test or at least be important to understanding the class.
Be selective (don’t take down every single note): take down the main points of the lecture or discussion; write down examples or hypotheticals, especially in math and science classes.
A piece of information usually has a main idea and supportive details, which can also be very important, but the main idea is definitely something worth noting. In paragraphs, the main idea is usually either the first or the last sentence. In good presentations, the bullet points on the slides are often main ideas.;
, There are lots of different ways of recording information. You can use one style or a mix of a few. The mix is best, because usually you can acquire more information and in different ways.Handwritten notes work best for classes that have to do with: numbers, equations, and formulas–calculus, chemistry, physics, economics, symbolic logic, also language classes because helps you memorize/remember more effectively.
You can also record the lecture or discussion, if your instructor allows you to do so. This is great for allowing you to go back and listen to very specific parts of the lecture, although it can be harder to make information stick in your memory.
Make sure you collect any lecture notes and power-point slides that your instructor makes available. These can be valuable notes for essays and exams.

, There are different ways to take down notes, some of which are more effective than others at helping you to stay organized or get organized later. You'll need to experiment to see which methods work best for you.An effective method is the Cornell method of note-taking. On the left-hand side of the paper mark a two and one half inch column (6.35 cm). On the right side have a column six inches across (15.24 cm). You'll use the right-hand column to take notes during your class or lecture. After the lecture, you'll summarize your notes, designate keywords, and create questions about the material in the left-hand column.
A lot of people use the rough outline method. This basically means writing down the main points of the lecture or class (you can format them as a list of bullet points, for example). After class, write your summary of the notes in a different colored pen, or highlight it.
Mind mapping is a more visual and creative form of taking notes. You draw your notes, rather than writing down sentences in a linear format. Write the main topic of the lecture or class in the center of a piece of paper. Each time the instructor makes a new point, write those around the central topic. Draw lines to connect different ideas. You can also draw images rather than writing words.
Another method, known as Split Page Method, is more space-consuming than Cornell notes, but easier to study later. A page is divided into two columns: one for main and the other for secondary ideas.

, If you're storing your notes all over the place it's going to make it very difficult to organize them for exams and essays when the time comes. Don't just write your notes down in whatever notebook you happen to have nearby or you're never going to find those notes again.


On your computer, make sure that you have one folder for your notes from each different class. If you put them all together it's going to be difficult to find them again.
It's usually easier to store any handwritten notes in a binder, because you can add and subtract pages as needed without having to tear them out.

, A lot of people (especially freshman university students) don't realize how important syllabi and hand-outs are going to be. These have information you're going to need to know (like homework assignments, the purpose of the class, and so on).


These will also usually detail information about the types of essays and information you're going to need to know which can be useful for what kinds of notes you take in class.
Keep all the syllabi and hand-outs for each class in the same place as your notes so that they are easily accessible, especially when your instructor brings up information on them in class.

, You really do need to keep everything in the same place. This makes it easier for you to locate it when you need it. If you have a distinct folder for each class you will know exactly where your notes are.


Make sure you keep these different notebooks and binders handy. It isn’t much use to you if you don’t keep putting class notes in the right place.
The more specific you are, the better. This means that for one class you might create different folders for the different parts of the class. As an example: if you had a film class split into four parts, you might have a different notebook for each part of the class.
As another example: you have different folders for each section of the class (for Latin class you have a different folder for each different part of speech ).

, If you keep all your notes on your computer, make sure that even there you have separate spaces for your notes. You don't want to have to back through and dig through your computer files.


Have folders in those folders for particular information. For example: you have the main folder that's for your Ancient Astronomy class, but inside you have specific folders for the different sections of the class, as well as for the two essays you have to write.
As another example, you might have a folder for your research paper, a folder for your information about gender identity politics in your gender studies class.

, This may sound like overkill, but it can be really helpful for you to know what notes you have. You only need to cover the most basic ideas that each group of notes has (the very main ideas) but it'll make it easier to go back through it.


Combine lecture and reading notes into coherent whole. Figure out main ideas and how they relate. For example: if your class is about Medieval women, the main ideas might be about formation of self, types of writings, notions of autonomy and gender, and so on. You might show how these ideas relate to one another.
Make sure that you've covered the most important points, as well as the sub-points that support the main points.

, You don't want to have to keep trying to figure out how and where you recorded certain information. This will make your organization more difficult in the long run. If you keep to one way of recording notes and specific places for each class, you'll be much more prepared than otherwise.


Giving yourself some slack on organization will mean that you won’t maintain your organization and it will be more difficult come exam time or essay time.

Set a goal.,
Add attractive rewards.,
Sign your name.,
Post it in view while studying.,
Persist with your plan even if you get discouraged.",How to Stay Motivated to Study1," To generate lasting motivations, clearly define your goals for studying. If you are clear on what you’re trying to get done, you’re more likely to actually do it. Take a moment to write out your study goals. Be as specific as possible.Use the SMART goals method of establishing goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. With this in mind, you might set a goal to read, take notes, and build a study guide for a chapter over the weekend.
Think about setting up a study schedule which can include your goals and also include scheduled breaks. You might keep to this schedule by setting alarms on your phone or getting a family member or study buddy to check in on you.
Another possibility for goal-setting might be creating a plan for a longer-term goal, such as studying to get into graduate school or med school. Such a goal may involve more time, but still has the same basic components.;
, Once your goals are defined, set up rewards to incentivize your study time. This works best by breaking your larger goals down into feasible parts. Then, reward yourself with something you find motivating.For example, using the above example, you might reward yourself with an hour break to spend with friends after completing the reading portion of your goal.

, The simple act of signing your name on a contract empowers you to fulfill it. This happens because your signature is associated with your identity as a person. Sign your contract to demonstrate that you understand the terms and plan to honor them., Further stimulate yourself to uphold your contract by placing it in view of your study area. You might merely place it in a pocket of a folder or binder, or pin it on a bulletin board above your desk. Having this visual reminder will likely entice you to see your goals through., Once you have developed your study contract, do your best to stick with it. When you're studying difficult subjects, you may get discouraged if you don't understand the concepts or if it seems like too much to take in.At these times, take a break and do something enjoyable like watching a movie. Then, pick up where you left off in your study plan.
It may also help to get assistance from an instructor, a peer, or a tutor, if needed.

Incorporate writing into your revision.,
Use active forms of studying.,
Stimulate more than one sense to reinforce important knowledge.,
Set yourself reasonable goals.,
Take frequent breaks.",How to Revise for an Exam While Sick1," You have limited waking time when you’re sick, so use the most effective and efficient revision techniques to maximize the use of your time and boost your chances of success. Writing is a wise use of your time. If you rewrite key notes and concepts in your own words, it is more effective than simply reading them or saying them aloud.It’s best to do so with a pen or pencil. Research shows that writing notes out by hand (versus typing them on a laptop or other device) can boost your comprehension and memory.;
, Studies suggest that using practice testing, like flashcards or mock exams, is more productive than simply reviewing your textbook or notes. Besides more closely approximating the format of your test, these activities force you to recall, synthesize, and utilize information instead of just passively reading or repeating it., We all learn differently and favor different senses in our learning. Engage as many senses as you can in your study process and methods to boost your cognition and recall of information.For example, read your notes, rewrite your notes, and then quiz yourself aloud on your notes. If you follow those steps, you will have processed the information you’re revising in visual, tactile, and auditory ways, which can help ensure that you’re covering the learning styles that work best for you while bolstering your grasp of a concept.

, Your revising will seem more manageable if you divide it up into a series of sessions and set yourself a specific task for each. Since you’re ill, be realistic about how much you can accomplish.For example, you could break up sessions chronologically by studying a week or two of lectures at a time or thematically by studying a particular formula or concept.
Remember to only focus on one thing at a time for each session. Multitasking is not only stressful, it’s less effective than honing in on a single subject or goal., It’s easy to get tired when you’re sick. Exhaustion will seriously compromise your ability to study effectively, so be sure to pause regularly for rest and relaxation. Doing so will ensure that you’re taking care of and listening to your body. It will also help you maintain your focus when you are studying.


Even when you’re healthy, it’s best to take breaks every 25 to 50 minutes in order to recharge your concentration. Take at least 5 to 15 minutes between sessions to give your body and brain the respite they need to function at their best.If you’re sick, remember that brief but focused studying sessions will be more useful than trying to sustain your attention for hours at a time. Revising in short intervals is actually proven to be more effective than prolonged study sessions."

Take effective notes during meetings.,
Make sure you’ve recorded the appropriate information.,
Summarize your notes/the meeting afterwards.,
Make sure you’re organizing with the most important information.,
Have separate folders for each meeting.,
Organize in chronological order.,
Keep your notes in the same place.",How to Organize Notes2," You don't want to write down every single thing that people say, unless you're taking very specific minutes. When you're in a meeting, you want to make sure you only have the most important things that come up.Especially, make sure that you note down to-do items, decisions that are made, and anything that needs to be followed up on.
Take notes on paper and copy them onto the computer later on, this will help you remember what was said.
An effective method is the Cornell method of note-taking. On the left-hand side of the paper mark a two and one half inch column (6.35 cm). On the right side have a column six inches across (15.24 cm). You'll use the right-hand column to take notes during your meeting. After the lecture, you'll summarize your notes, designate keywords, and create questions about the material in the left-hand column.

, There are some very specific things you'll need to mark down, along with what was said in the meeting. This is particularly important if you're going to have to send these notes out to everyone at the meeting afterwards.Make sure you've noted down the date, the name of the organization, the purpose of the meeting, and the people attending (as well as any people who were absent who should have been there).

, You will need to synthesize the most important material to make sure you know what needs to happen and what was decided.


Put a different colored box around the summary so that it is easily readable.
Summarize don’t transcribe. You do not need every single detail of what was said. For example: you only need to say that it was decided to order a new type of stationary, rather than the long discussion about the best types of stationary.

, You don't want to try to organize all the different types of stationary (according to the above example), you only want to say that a new stationary is needed and perhaps what kind has been decided on.


The most important things you need to make sure you have are: actions, decisions, and reference information.
Highlight the most important information or leave a margin for keywords and most important ideas.
Avoid trying to organize during the meeting. Doing that later will help you remember things and will make sure you don’t miss important material.

, You want to make sure that the material doesn’t get all bundled up together and subsequently lost in the shuffle. Do this by making sure each meeting is separately marked, or designated.


Or you can have all the same types of meetings together. For example: if you keep notes on your weekly meeting with your supervisor, you would keep those separate from the notes you keep on the weekly meeting with your entire group.

, In keeping your meeting notes together you want to make it easy to go back through and see when certain decisions were made, who wasn't at a certain meeting and therefore needs the information, and so on.

, This way you won't have to be skittering about the office after your meeting trying to find your notes. Or you won't have to worry about getting the notes out on time to the whole group because you couldn't locate them.

Act it out.,
Draw pictures.,
Create a song.,
Watch relevant YouTube videos on the subject.",How to Stay Motivated to Study2," Role-playing your study content may motivate you to keep studying. Plus, role-playing may offer a richer understanding of the subject matter as opposed to simply reading or memorizing key dates or terms.Exercise your creativity and devise a way to act out your studies. Invite some peers to join you—just remember to stay on task.
For instance, if you are learning about war in history, you might act out one of the key battles.

, Your instructor might advise against doodling during class, but this activity might help you outside of the classroom. Drawing out your subject matter may actually lead to retaining more information. Plus, doodling as you read makes the task more enjoyable., Another way to add interest to your study time is by singing about the subject matter. You might generate a sing-song rhyme to explain the rules of language arts or mathematics. Or, you might take your studies further and develop a jingle when learning about persuasive arguments in speech., You probably watch YouTube videos to learn new skills or to have a laugh. You can also take advantage of this sort of media for your study time. Doing so can make your learning more engaging. Plus, you might even find a new way of viewing the subject matter."

Put yourself in the right frame of mind.,
Set limits with friends.,
Place your phone on “do not disturb” mode.,
Go to a study-based environment.",How to Stay Motivated to Study3," Before you get started do whatever you need to do to help yourself relax and clear your head. You might try some stretches or light exercise, breathing techniques, meditate for a few minutes, or just queue up a playlist of music that helps you study. During this time you might also go over in your head what your intentions are for this study session., If your friends are hassling you about hanging out, it will be hard to stick to your study plans. Set firm boundaries with your pals about when and for how long you’ll be studying, and don’t let up.For instance, you might say, “Sorry, guys, but I really have to study my French words tonight. I won’t be able to talk or hang out. I will make time for you on tomorrow.
If they try to persuade you to skip out on studying, say, “Studying is my top priority right now. I hope you understand.”

, If your phone has a “do not disturb” mode, set it during your study time. This helps you stay motivated in your studies by silencing any non-emergency calls and select notifications.


If your phone doesn’t need to be on to take important calls, turn it off. The less distractions you have, the better., If your dorm room or bedroom doesn’t lend to effective study habits due to distractions, it may be a good idea to move to a new environment. Being in the right environment means you’ll have less distractions and will be more motivated to stick to your study regimen.Try a local library or coffee shop. Bring along headphones and tune into a classical music station to sound out others around you.

Determine whether you’re too sick to study.,
Start with a positive attitude.,
Create a good study environment.,
Eat a healthy, balanced diet.,
Drink lots of clear fluids, especially water.,
Take caffeine in moderation.,
Take medication.,
Get enough rest.",How to Revise for an Exam While Sick2," Some illnesses and/or their associate remedies will prevent you from studying due to extreme symptoms like pain or intense drowsiness. In these cases, prioritize getting better over getting a good exam score and be realistic about what, if anything, is achievable. In other cases, although you feel rotten and can't get much further from your bed than the bathroom, you may still be able to read, do online test questions, or use other revision strategies to keep learning.


If you are seriously ill, most schools will offer alternate arrangements for exams. Go to the doctor immediately to seek help and get an official note that can verify your illness to school officials.

, Being sick can make studying feel like a hopeless endeavor and increase your anxiety about exams. Adopting an optimistic mindset (for instance, by reminding yourself that you’re doing your best in spite of the circumstances) and avoiding destructive thoughts (such as, “I’m so sick, I’ll never be able to pass this exam”) will help you pull through a tough time.Keep in mind that any revision that you’re able to do is going to be useful, no matter how minimal. It’s better to study as best as you’re able, than to give up or not study at all.

, To study effectively, you need an environment with minimal distractions; this is even more true when you’re sick and distracted by all your symptoms. Take some time to prepare an appropriate space that’s conducive to studying and has everything you need at your fingertips.Minimize your distractions. Find a quiet place with no other people. Turn off your phone, television, or other electronic devices that you don’t need for studying.
Make sure that you’re comfortable. Avoid studying in bed since it’s likely to make you sleepy, but do pick a seating arrangement and position that will be relaxing for the length of your study session. You don’t want back pain to add to your other bodily woes when you’re sick.
Study in a well-lit room. Even when you’re not ill, poorly lit spaces can cause headaches and eyestrain. When you are sick, you’ll want to avoid exacerbating these symptoms or risk falling asleep.
Keep the means to quickly address your symptoms at hand. For instance, be sure to have a box of tissues and a waste bin to catch all those sniffled-in tissues. You may also want to have cough drops, medicine, water, and snacks with you so that you don’t need to interrupt your revising to get them.

, It’s tempting when you’re revising to go for quick meals and snacks of take-out and junk food. When you’re sick, food in general may seem like a dismal or distasteful prospect. But, the best way to keep yourself going is to eat fresh, healthy food that will give you much needed energy and nutrients.Avoid greasy and sugary foods that can zap your energy. Make sure fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich in healing vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, are a key part of your diet.
If your sickness allows, be sure to eat fiber-rich carbs, like oatmeal and whole grains. They’re not only an important part of a healthy diet, they’re also vital to keeping your mind sharp since your brain uses up glucose when you study., Doing so will help you stay hydrated, bolstering your immune system and replacing any fluids lost through coughing or runny noses.Avoid alcohol since it makes you dehydrated and will certainly not help you to study.

, Being sick with a cold or the flu is proven to make your brain less sharp. It negatively affects your mood, reaction time, thought processes, and memory. You can help counter these side effects of sickness with small doses of caffeine, such as drinking a coffee, tea, or other caffeinated beverage.Caffeine causes dehydration, so be sure to drink plenty of clear, non-caffeinated fluids to address its dehydrating effects. For instance, if you have a cup of tea, drink an equal amount of water with it., Being sick often leaves you with fever and pains that can distract from your studying. Using over-the-counter or prescribed medicines can help relieve distracting symptoms.For instance, try acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen or paracetamol for aches and fevers. Cold and flu medicines can also help with congestion and sore throats. Look for non-drowsy varieties to avoid any sleep-inducing side effects.
Always pay attention to any medical warnings on medication labels, and stick to the recommended doses. Avoid taking more than one medication at a time.

, You might be tempted to stay up all night when you’re cramming for an exam, but this will only make you more sick and less likely to perform well on your test. Your body needs sleep to help itself recover and to strengthen your immune system.Not getting sleep will likely make your symptoms worse. Missing a night’s shut eye decreases your ability to think and retain information for as much as four days, which could negatively impact your revision and lower your exam results."
"
Inform your parents when you’re ill. It’s a good idea to tell your parents, guardians, or other supportive loved ones that you have a particular test or exam but are not well.,
Go to the doctor.,
Notify your teacher.,
Check out your school’s policy on illness.",How to Revise for an Exam While Sick3," These people can provide a useful source of support for you in a difficult situation.


For example, parents might be able to help ensure that your home study environment is as comfortable as possible. They can also help get you to a doctor or liaise with teachers or school administrators if you feel that you need additional support.

, This is always a good idea when you’re sick. But, if you do need to make special provisions for an exam, you will also need an official medical statement from a doctor. Seeing a medical professional can help you determine if your illness is likely to seriously affect your performance on exams or if you should take them as planned.Many schools have campus health services that make it easy to see a doctor in a timely fashion and provide verification of your visit to teachers or administrators. They also have academic advisors who can assist you in making an necessary arrangements to accommodate your illness.

, If your doctor thinks your illness may affect your performance, communicate that to the person overseeing your exam as soon as possible. They may not excuse you from the exam, but it’s a good idea to keep them informed of anything that might affect your performance and see if they have any suggestions or offer any alternative testing dates.The sooner you do it, the better. If you wait until the last minute before an exam, it will seem like an excuse. If you notify your teacher in advance, it’s more likely that they will have time to respond to your concerns and offer support.
A simple email will suffice. Write something like, “Dear Professor Chan, My doctor recently diagnosed me with pneumonia. I am worried that the illness will affect my performance on Tuesday’s exam. Is it possible to delay my exam if I’m not better by then, or do you have any other advice? Thank you.”

, If you feel that being sick is going to seriously impact your test results or grades, contact an administrator to see if there is an established policy for addressing student sickness during exams. Sometimes administrators will have more direct knowledge of a school’s specific rules surrounding the issue than individual teachers will. Even if they can’t answer your question directly, they will know who to forward it to.

Select a spot that's free of loud noises or commotion.
Make sure the spot has good seating. If you're slouching or feel strained, you'll struggle to focus on your homework.
Find a space with a big desk or table you can use to spread out your supplies.
An office in your home, a desk in your bedroom, or the kitchen table can work great as a study space.;
, You want to make sure you leave distractions out of your study space. Unless you need them for an assignment, keep electronic devices like laptops, phones, and iPads/iPods out of your study space. Make sure the space where you work is quiet. Do not study in front of the television, for example., A home study kit can be placed near your work station. It should include all the items you need to get your work done. You can keep these items in a small container, like a shoebox. Fill it with some of the following, and anything else you need for homework on a daily basis:Pens and pencils
Scrap paper
A calculator
Ruler
Crayons or pens
A dictionary

, You need to keep your study space neat. After it's set up, it will start to fall apart quickly if you don't clean it regularly. At the end of each week, give you study space a quick cleaning.Remove any old tests and papers. Place them in a separate area, or throw them out if you no longer need them.
If you were eating or drinking anything in your study space, remove it from the area.

, It's vital to remember deadlines in order to stay organized. Each time something is assigned, write down the deadline somewhere. This will help you keep track of what needs to be worked on immediately and what can wait a few days.Keep a list of deadlines on a sheet of paper. Pin it up somewhere in your study space.
If you have a planner, write down when an assignment is due there.
Mark due dates on calendars. Use both electronic calendars and any paper calendars in your home. It may be helpful to have a calendar hung up in your workspace.

, You want to get on a schedule. This will help you stay organized and on top of assignments. Try to choose a specific time each day to do homework. Strive to stick to the schedule, even on the days you are busy or feel stressed.While you may want to get your homework over with, studying right after school may not be the best idea. Give yourself an hour or so to unwind before attempting your homework.
Find a time that works each day. You could try to do your homework about an hour after school, shortly before dinner, for example.

, Do not try to work through all your homework at once, especially if you have a lot of homework that week. When you start to feel stressed, take a break.You can do something fun for a few minutes, like returning some text messages, watching a video online, or reading for fun.
You can also simply get up and move around. Light physical activity, such as stretching or walking around, can really help you regain your focus.

, Checklists can help you keep track of everything you need to get done. Have a to-do list for each day where you write down all your homework assignments.In addition to writing down homework assignments, a to-do list can also help you break down big tasks. You can, for example, decide to write one page of a five page paper every day leading up to the due date. You can write something on your checklist like, ""Write 1 page of research paper.""
When you finish an assignment, cross it off your list. This can help you feel accomplished.

, A planner is an important tool when it comes to organization. Go to a department store or office supply store and choose a nice planner. Use it to keep track of assignments and upcoming tests and quizzes.Write down homework assignments as they're assigned. You should also flip ahead in the planner and mark when something is due.
If you have a syllabus with the dates of tests, quizzes, and due dates, go ahead and write down these dates in your planner.
Carry your planner to each class and refer to it at home when doing your homework.

, Color coding is a classics means of organization. If you color code your class supplies, you'll be able to quickly find the right materials when doing homework.You should try to color code all your course materials. For example, have a pink textbook cover, pink folder, and pink notebook for your math class. For your English class, have a red textbook cover, red folder, and red notebook.

, It's a good idea to have each folder for your separate classes follow a specific organization structure. This way, you'll be able to better keep track of papers between classes.You can have one side of your folder store new assignments, while the other stores completed assignments and in-class activities.
You can also have separate sections for things like syllabi and assignment sheets. In addition to having a folder for each class, keep a folder where you store these types of papers.
You should also have an electronic storage system in place. You should, for example, have separate folders on your desktop for each class.

, You should have all your study materials in once place in your home. You should also have a small pencil box or other small container to carry to school. Keep things like a pair of scissors, a calculator, pens, pencils and other items you need in this box.You can even organize how you store your supplies. If you, say, have a lot of materials you need for math class, have a separate container for math class.

, As with your study space, backpacks and folders benefit from regular cleaning. Clean them out once every couple of weeks. Remove any papers you no longer need, and any other garbage that has built up.Be careful when throwing out papers, however. You never know when you may need to refer back to a homework assignment. It may be a good idea to store all your old papers in one place and only throw them out at the end of the semester.

Change your physical work environment.",How to Not Procrastinate With Homework1," We are all plugged into the matrix today, whether it be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or another way to connect. Regardless of the form of social media or game, turn off updates. If you can't resist temptation, there are software tools and router settings to limit internet usage., Email automatically delivered to you based on receipt or software timeline is pushed, because it's sent without your interaction. When you must look or check for new email, it's called pulling email. Every email client has a setting to stop automatic email push and notification. Remove the distraction by seeing emails only when you deem necessary., The allure of TV and radio is stronger than homework.

Give the speaker consistent reactions to show you're attentive.,
Follow up.",How to Develop Listening Skills," Inviting body language means positioning yourself in a way that makes it inviting and easier for people to come talk to you. This means facing the person who is speaking to you and standing with an open posture with your arms at your side for example, rather than crossing your arms in front of your chest. Crossing your arms in from of your chest might imply that you don't want to have a conversation. Or, if you are in the middle of a conversation and you keep yawning and looking around as someone is talking to you, they might assume that you aren't listening and don't care what they have to say. Conversely, to show that are listening and do care what they have to say, here are some engaging body language cues you can try:Raising your eyebrows every once in while.
Moving slightly closer toward the person speaking to you.
Smiling and laughing when it is appropriate.
Tilting your head when hearing new or interesting information.
Nodding your head if you agree or understand what someone is saying.;
, In Western culture, making eye contact is a non-verbal way of letting someone know that they have your attention and respect -- two important factors involved in having a productive conversation.Making and keeping eye contact lets the other person know that they can proceed with what they want to say, knowing that you are ready to listen.

, An important part of listening is being able to zone out background noise, thoughts, and conversations so you focus on the conversation in front of you. Being distracted by other things takes your attention away from the speaker and lessen your ability to fully listen.Turning off communication devices like cell phones is a polite and easy way to get rid of further distractions.

, Someone's body language can communicate a lot more than the actual words they are saying. For example, if your partner keeps looking down at the floor, that might be an indication that they are shy, embarrassed, or sad.


Since words only convey a fraction of the message, ""listening"" to body language cues can help you further understand what the speaker is trying to communicate besides what their words convey., Some people focus on how they are going to reply when someone is talking to them, rather than absorbing and understanding what their partner is trying to communicate.That isn't a habit of someone who is a good listener. Instead of thinking of your response, try to fully absorb what your partner is trying to say to you, and view every conversation you have as a learning opportunity.


You might not be knowledgeable or fascinated with every topic of discussion, but listening with the intent to learn offers other points of view different from your own, and a chance for you to grow as a listener.

, A basic rule of listening, is to judge only after you've heard and evaluated what someone has to say.You must wait to form your opinions, because once you deem someone to be ignorant, ill-informed, or shallow, you immediately shut them out and stop listening to what they have to say. You might disagree with someone, but you will never find out until you listen to their ideas and opinions.


Be open to the idea that your scope of seeing things may not be the only, or necessarily the best way of seeing the world.

, Empathizing is trying to feel yourself, what the speaker is feeling at that moment.Identifying with the speaker in this way allows for better understanding of what they are trying to communicate, and where their feelings are coming from. You don't always have to agree with what they say, but by empathizing with them, you listen to their point of view and you might be better suited to assess what they are trying to express. To empathize, you might try to reiterate in a simple way what they have told you, and voice your interpretation of how they seem to be feeling.


For example, after someone has told you about a fight they had with their sister, you might empathize and say something like, ""I get the sense that you are really angry about what was said, and I can see how her calling you those names would make you feel hurt at the same time.""

, Sometimes, when people explain a problem they are experiencing, it might feel instinctual to offer a solution to their problem. Instead, just listen what they have to say. Most people ask for advice when they want it. Also, someone might simply be trying to talk through a problem to figure out how to solve it themselves, rather than asking you to figure out the answer for them.


If someone seems to be really struggling to figure out what to do, and you have a suggestion that you think might genuinely help them, you should at least get the speaker's permission and ask something like, ""I might have an idea about how you can handle that. Do you want to hear it?"", Using an active-listening attitude can help reinforce positive listening practices and encourage respectful listening tendencies. Exercising an active-listening attitude means:



Acknowledging that listening is just as important speaking in a conversation. Hearing what somebody has to say to is is equally important as voicing your opinion to them.

Being aware that listening is necessary for productive exchanges of information. Those who remember to prioritize listening create less confusion in a conversation, cause fewer misunderstandings, and misspeak less frequently.

Understanding that listening to others is not only necessary, but all around beneficial for the betterment of the conversation. Always try to absorb some piece of new information when you encounter and interact with new people., Using a top down strategy means you, as a listener, calling on information you already know (about the subject you and your partner are discussing, your partner, the context of your conversation, and the specific language being used to create the conversation), in order to plan what you will say next. Using this kind of strategy allows you, as a listener, to process what you have already heard, and gauge where the conversation is headed.For example, you can show that you've been paying attention by explaining and giving a short summary of how you yourself understand the situation the speaker is explaining. Some other components of this strategy involve:


Anticipating.
Paraphrasing.
Differentiating fact from opinion.
Interpreting tone.Drawing conclusions.

, Using a bottom-up strategy means using specific lingual signifiers to draw meaning from what the speaker you're listening to is saying. These signifiers include the actual language the speaker uses to express themselves, the grammar used to create their message, and the sounds used to create the message. Some other components of this strategy include:


Picking out individual words.
Noting words of similar origin.
Identifying placement patterns of words.
""Identifying prefixes, roots, and suffixes""., Interrupting someone while they are speaking is the exact opposite of listening to what they have to say, and it sends a lot of bad messages like:


“What I have to say is more interesting and meaningful than what you have to say.”
“You and your opinion is less important than me and my opinion.”
“I don’t have time to hear how you think or feel.”
“What you have to say isn't worth listening to.”
“I'm going to do whatever I can so I get to speak, regardless if you get your turn.”, Rather than interrupting the speaker to ask a question, wait for a natural break, and then ask your question. It engages the speaker to hear your thoughts and areas of confusion, shows that your interested enough to want clarification, and it follows the natural pattern of a back and forth conversation, rather than someone merely talking at you.Sometimes, the speaker mentions something that relates to ourselves, and we ask a question that leads the speaker to go off on a tangent. When you notice that you inadvertently caused your conversation partner to stray away from your original topic of conversation, get the conversation back on topic by saying something like, “I love hearing about your dog, but I want to hear more about what you were saying earlier with Kate starting high school. How is she liking it so far?”, You want to insert phrases or snippets of feedback that show that you are reflective on what the speaker is saying. You could do things like:

Show your comprehension of what they're saying by using expressive reactions like an understanding head nod, or looking concerned if the speaker says something alarming. , or asking questions if they talk about a new development in their lives.
Provide verbal cues of encouragement to the speaker as they talk such as asking further questions, or saying something like, ""Wow that's so interesting. Tell me all about it."" , After some time has passed from your original conversation, it might be beneficial to send a text, email, or call and see if there have been any developments from the last time you spoke.

This does not apply to all cases of conversations, but this added effort shows that you were listening intently to your original conversation, and cared enough to check in."

Learn to write with the “5W’s”: who, what, where, when, why and how.,
Organize the story: Get busy and organize the story after you write the lead.,

Understand open versus closed-ended questions: Get familiar with open ended questions, they are often the best.,
Understand active vs. passive voice: Active voice is the way most people talk.,
Detach yourself as a writer by using third person in most of your articles.,
Don't attempt plagiarism!,
Avoid ""reporter's opinion.""",How to Develop Basic Journalism Skills," They are the building blocks of every news story.;
, This includes adding the interview quotes, writing the story in the inverted pyramid, along with the other items mentioned here.

, This is where the most important news appears at the top and less important points follow in descending order. This is the format used for most news articles since the least important part of the story can be cut if necessary (usually if there is a timelier story or a new advertisement is sold).

, Leads are typically one or two sentences and 30-50 words total. The lead should summarize the entire article so the reader can decide if they want to read the entire contents.

, Immediacy is how recently the event happened. Impact is the effect a story will have on reader's lives. The bigger the impact, the bigger the story. News judgment is the ability to determine which stories are most interesting and important to that publications' readers.

, This is where you get word-for-word information from a good source who you can cite. A partial quote is where you just use part of a direct quote. A paraphrase is the reporter’s summation of source’s words.


Problems to avoid in using quotes include dull, obvious quotes and quotes that echo a previous statement; quotes used as leads; a string of quotes run in sentence after sentence; curse words in quotes; and distortion of quotes.

, This is on the record. Off the record is where the source knows about the subject but does not want his or her name used.


An example would be during the Watergate scandal, “deep throat” was a high ranking government official who did not want to lose his job (or worse).
Using an off-the-record source is not acceptable in many newsrooms. If that is all you can get, try to get another person who is familiar with the story to confirm the information (and who will let you cite them).

, They are designed to get the source to talk freely and reveal thoughts and feelings. Examples include: what is your philosophy of sports? What thoughts were going through your head the first time you rescued a drowning swimmer?


Closed-ended questions can be answered either “yes” or “no” without further explanation; used to confirm information, but not very effective for many interviews. Softball questions: Easy, non-controversial queries aimed at developing a rapport with the source and helping them to relax.

, Active and passive voices refer to the relationship between the subject and the verb. In an active sentence, the subject is doing something.


In a passive sentence, the subject does nothing; it is acted upon. The active voice makes your writing stronger and livelier, and is the style that is used in most news articles. Examples: The girls ate the pizza. (active) vs. The pizza was eaten by the girls.

, An example of third person writing: ""this reporter conducted the research."" A first person phrase would be: ""I conducted the research."" Try writing in the third person as much as possible in journalistic writing.

, This is where someone tries to pass off the words or ideas of others as their own (without attribution). The main danger for many reporters is when they copy directly from the Internet (even if they cite the Internet source, they should re-write in their own words).

, Don't pick favorites (or complain about something without explaining the good points also). Report the story honestly and accurately and let the readers decide. Sometimes bias includes the failure to present both sides of an issue fairly; or by manipulating facts to sway readers’ opinions. Avoid this.

, A fun way to reward yourself for doing homework is getting a snack/food you love, and then each time you finish a problem or pass a certain point you can take a bite!

, Make sure your room is a temperature you're comfortable in.

, Pretend you are a teacher, and you're asking the students questions. If you're doing Math, it may be helpful to get a dry-erase board and write the problems on there. This will make your work very productive, if you're a visual/color learner.

, Set a timer so when it goes off, you're back and ready to work some more! Don't get yourself burned out. It is VITAL to take breaks, but don't forget about your homework!

, Study partners can be really good, or really bad. Make sure your friend is willing to buckle down and do the homework. If you and your partner talk too much, then your homework will never get done!

, If you don't understand the homework, don't just put it away and give up.


Stay before or after school to get extra help from teachers. It may not seem fun, but it will make the homework much easier. Your grades will suffer if you don't understand what's going on!
If you have a study partner, as mentioned above, you can ask them if they understand it.
Another option is to look up how-to videos online, if it is something like Science or Math.

, Unless of course you're using the internet for help. However, beware of ads! They will suck you in and get you very distracted.

Keep track of assignments in the moment.,
Reassure yourself!,
Reward yourself for any progress.",How to Not Procrastinate With Homework2," Tell anyone who will listen you intend on finishing your homework by a specific time and ensure they hold you accountable. Assign a consequence (for you) and reward (for them) if the deadline is not met.


Tell friends to post an embarrassing story of you online if you don't finish on time.
Ask your mother to create a fair punishment for delaying.
Ask your father to concoct something even more devious if you don't finish after your mother's punishment.

, Write down on a piece of paper (or in a planner) what homework you have or what project needs to be finished while you are still in class. When you get home, start on it immediately! Touch the pencil to the paper or get your fingers on the home-keys. Getting started is the most difficult step.

, The homework would not be assigned if not applicable to your class. If second-guessing or a negative thought pops into your head, it's important to focus on the positive. Imagine your future self engaging in your favorite activity, feet kicked in the air, completely relaxed because of how quickly and correctly homework was finished!

, Write a title for the report? High five yourself. Finish the first paragraph? Maybe some candy is in order. Solve a complicated math problem after several failed attempts? Pat yourself on the back and take a quick break. Positive reinforcement can be very effective if used properly.

Plan ahead and separate your task into smaller, identifiable tasks.,
Do the small tasks first.,
Associate a timeline with your tasks.",How to Not Procrastinate With Homework3," Lists are a great way create structure and order to goals that appear chaotic or impossible.Think of your list as an assembly line where each step reinforces your ability to complete the list, to focus on the importance of each task, and commit yourself to finishing the homework.
If procrastination persists, make the tasks even smaller. Remember, every waterfall starts with a drop of water, and every marathon starts with the first step. If motivation eludes you, keep breaking things down until the first step is so simple you can't help but to succeed.

, Accomplishing even the most simple, mundane task is important. If you do a small task as you awaken, it's more likely to encourage further accomplishments. The same applies to homework. Writing your name or a title, highlighting something important, creating an outline, whatever it is, doing a small portion will instill pride and lead to lead to other tasks.

, Without a timeline, procrastination is possible until the homework is due, or until you are forced to cram. Put the timeline requirements on your list. Integrate a calendar into your timeline and assign specific work for each day remaining before the deadline.


A 1000-word essay due at the end of the week could be 100 words every hour if you have a lot of time, or 500 words per hour if your homework is due sooner.
Determine the number of days left on the homework and divide it into equal parts. For instance, five days means you have five equal parts on which to work.
Math homework with 25 questions could easily be completed in an hour if each question were given two minutes.

Ask yourself why you’re having trouble with this subject or class. Is it because you don’t understand a particular concept? Do you dislike the instructor or your classmates? Are you bored?
If you dislike the instructor or your classmates, understand that classes do have time limits. Even if you dislike the class now, you may have a different instructor or classmates next semester or year.;
, If you are bored with the class, look for ways to enhance your understanding of the topic. You might, for example, ask the instructor for books or materials that you can read and use outside of the classroom.


If you are bored in class because you already understand the material, inquire with your teacher about moving to a more advanced course on the subject.
Try studying with a friend who is interested in the subject and enjoys learning about the concepts that you may struggle with.

, School curriculums are designed to teach a broad scope of subjects but every subject you learn is important in some way.


When we identify the importance of a subject, we are more likely to devote time to learning the subject and its concepts. Look for key concepts that are important to the course to understand why it is important.
For example, if you dislike English as a subject, understanding that English classes are a great way to learn communication skills and to relate to others.

, Translatable skills are concepts that one subject teaches that can be applied to another subject or situation.


Identifying translatable skills helps you to understand how the subject fits in with the big picture. While you may not need to know the noble gases outside of chemistry class, studying chemistry will teach you how to identify reactions and to understand how substances interact with each other. This is important when you’re cooking or mixing cleaning products. Translatable skills that you learn in one subject can help you to succeed in other subjects or in your everyday life.

, By focusing on the positive aspects of the subject, you can change your approach to learning and studying the subject. And while great teachers can make even subjects you find dull more interesting, even if you do not enjoy the teacher's style, you can change your own perspective on the subject.


For example, if you are struggling with English, look for books and papers to read and write reports on that are dedicated to subjects that you do enjoy, like history or art.

, Often, we dislike a certain subject because we struggle to learn the subject or certain key concepts. When we try to cope with disliking a subject, we can’t ignore the fact that we still have to learn the subject. An action plan is essentially a plan to ensure that you will pass the course and complete all of your work. While changing your feelings about the subject may take time, you need to continue to follow the class syllabus and to complete your assigned work.
Work with your instructor to create a schedule that you will follow to make up any missed work and to complete future assignments.
Set a study schedule that uses incentives to positively reinforce your studying habits. Follow this study schedule and ask the instructor for outside sources to enhance your understanding of the topic, like online lectures or interesting articles.

, Incentivizing the subject goes hand in hand with identifying your motivators. When you incentivize doing tasks that you dislike, you motivate yourself to complete them.


Economists argue that higher incentives lead to more effort and higher performance levels. Incentives do not need to be material or monetary. Intrinsic incentives, or incentives that come from within the student, are also motivating. An example of an intrinsic incentive would be a positive feeling you get when you receive a good grade on a paper that encourages you to work as hard on the next assignment. , If you’re struggling to incentivize yourself to study the subject, try to draw positive associations with the subject that you dislike with something that you do like.


A positive mood can help your brain to think more creatively and helps with your ability to recall facts.When you consistently incentivize yourself and motivate yourself to learn a subject you dislike, you begin to associate studying the subject with positive things you do like. For example, if you treat yourself to your favorite snack after you study your disliked subject, eventually you may associate studying with the happy feelings you get when you have your favorite food., If you dislike the subject because you are struggling to learn a concept, ask the instructor for extra help or consider hiring a tutor.


If your school offers tutoring services or if there is a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course, take advantage of these resources.
A tutor can help to explain complicated concepts if you're having trouble grasping them and can help you work through your homework.
Teaching Assistants are usually found in advanced college courses. They often hold office hours where students are able to come by and ask them questions about the course material. Take advantage of this resource if it is available to you. Professors may also hold office hours for their students.

, Your learning style refers to the ways that you learn things the best, and you can use your style to try different studying methods for the best results. Once you've identified what your learning style is, you can experiment with it.


There are a number of different learning styles, and people can have different learning styles for different subjects. Work with an instructor or a school counselor to identify your learning style, if you do not know what your learning style already is.If you find that you are struggling to learn the subject the way that the instructor teaches it, your learning style may be different than the way the instructor teaches.It may be difficult to completely change your learning style to adapt to the instructor’s style. However, you can work around this issue by using different learning styles to approach a subject outside of the classroom. For example, if you are a verbal learner, and you learn best by listening to lectures, you can use the Internet to find recorded lectures on a subject that you are struggling to learn.
If you are a social learner, and you learn best in groups and working with others, form a study group with other social learners to study for a particular subject.

, When you feel motivated to learn a subject or concept, you are more likely to devote time to it. You should determine whether you are more motivated by long-term successes or if you prefer short-term gratification.


If you’re more motivated by long-term successes, remember that your grade in this course has an impact on your overall GPA. Your GPA will influence the higher education programs you’re accepted to, internship opportunities, job opportunities, and your graduation.
If you’re more motivated by immediate, or short-term, gratification use small items to reward yourself. For example, if you spend one hour studying the subject you dislike you can reward yourself with fifteen minutes of Internet browsing.
When you begin to feel frustrated with the subject, it is helpful to remind yourself that your success in this course will have positive consequences later on. , When we dislike a subject, it can be tempting to ignore the problem and to avoid working on the subject. Prioritize learning the subject that you dislike or are having difficulty with over subjects that come naturally to you.


Always complete your homework. Homework is a great way to test your knowledge on a topic and to gauge your ability to use certain concepts.
Participate in the class discussions and during lessons. Actively engaging with the subject can help you confront your dislike and to understand what concepts you are having trouble with.

Find out what your learning style is.,
Learn through seeing.,
Learn through listening.,
Learn through doing.,
Learn through reading and writing.,
Switch your learning styles around now and then.,
Choose a quiet place to study.,
Listen to music.,
Take regular breaks when studying.,
Create a study group of people who learn the same way you do.,
Make a memory prompt from your studying.,
Use rewards.",How to Make Studying Easy," People have different ways of learning that make the information easier to understand and retain. Some people find visual aids are the most useful, while others need to hear the content of the learning before it makes complete sense. Others again need to be moving about, touching and making things in order to be able to learn. Once you have worked out which style best suits your learning, you can put it to good use in developing key ways of studying that work for you. There are generally 4 types of learners:


Visual learners: these are people who prefer to see some sort of illustration to further explain a subject.
Auditory learners: these are people who rely on hearing and speaking to understand information and instructions. They may struggle with understanding written instructions.
Kinesthetic learners: these are the ""do-ers"". They prefer completing hands-on activities and experiments to understand what they are learning. These people excel in science related subjects because of the hands-on atmosphere they present.
Reading or writing-preference learners: these, as the name suggests, prefer reading or writing the information repeatedly to understand it.;
, If you are a visual learner, watch educational videos about the subject instead of reading the textbook. You may also use graphic organizers and other illustrations to understand a specific topic.


Visual may make charts, flow maps and make information visual.

, If you are an auditory learner, try purchasing an audio version of the textbook being used, or simply read it aloud. As opposed to writing notes, record them with a tape recorder and play them back to study.


Auditory can tape lectures, read info aloud, tape notes/textbook readings and talk to others about it.

, If you are a kinesthetic learner, think of some creative activities and/or experiments to review information.


Tactile can make flap books, become the teacher, and ask on ways to make your info hands on.

, If you are a reading or writing-preference learner, all you have to do is read whatever information you are required to know. It might also help to paraphrase the information and write it down, just so you're sure you understand it.

, Even if you decide that you are definitely a certain style of learner, try learning techniques from other styles of learners. Apply these to your studying, to broaden the interest and to help round out the ways in which you learn best. It's not a good idea to be too strict about only using one style, or you risk being bored and missing out on a great tool meant for another learning style. Mix it up in ways that work best for you., Removing noise and distractions can help you to focus better and get on with the studying within a set block of time. That said, some people actually do study better with hubbub and people around, so just as with learning styles, if this latter approach better suits you, use it to your advantage and study in a cafe, a work-group space or similar less quiet zone.

If you go to a public place or a friend's house, bring all that you need with you and keep an eye on electronics in public areas.

, This doesn't work for everyone but some people find that it can help to listen to music, especially classical music or instrumental music. This tends to be a ""now and then"" thing though––some days you may find the music soothing and helpful, while other days it's annoying and distracting. Don't treat music as an always must-have, as your use for it will vary., Study in 15 minute chunks and take 5 minute breaks. Or study for half an hour to 55 minutes, then take a break. Get into this habit and stick to it, as it's good for your body and brain both to have a stretch, a walk around and a change of scenery for a few minutes., It's easier to study with people who learn the same way you do.

, The following exercise will help you to develop a quick prompt for recalling lots of text:

Start reading the text, with the aim of trying to understand it. If you don't understand anything, then pause and read again.






Pick up important and catchy words in the text. Consider these your ""keywords.""






Write the keywords down on paper.






Take the first letter of each word. Write down that letter on the next line of the paper.






After you get all the letters, make words out of them.






You can make a single word or a sentence too.






The trick in making these words is that you can make words which you use daily e.g, your friends name or a joke which makes you and your friends laugh,or a strict teacher etc.






By doing this, you can easily get a hold of the important words which were listed in the text.







, A reward system can help you to get through large or challenging learning stages. Set goals for completing sections of learning, followed by such rewards as a night off from studying, a movie with a friend, a piece of chocolate cake, whatever. Keep the rewards realistic, affordable and small. Leave any large reward for completion of everything, tests and exams included."

Adhere to the dress code for the competition.",How to Compete in Forensics," Check with your teachers about whether there is an existing forensics team at your school and look into joining the team. Most schools will publicize their forensics team and solicit students to join.Your teacher may also be able to put you in contact with the local forensics league in your area. You can then get in touch with the local forensics league and look into the joining the league.Keep in mind there are many non-NSDA leagues that put on their own forensics competitions. There are also forensics leagues for home schooled students as well as religiously affiliated forensics leagues.;
, If you do not want to join a forensics team, you can apply to compete in the forensics competition on your own as a solo applicant. Your parents can sign you up or you can do this yourself.


You can also create your own forensics team with peers and friends in your grade or at the same educational level as you. You can apply online to create your own forensics team or to create your own forensics league., The enrollment process will depend on the level you are applying to compete in (middle school, high school, or college) and whether you are enrolling as a team or as a solo participant. The NSDA allows all state recognized home schools and virtual schools to participate in the competition.Your school as well as your team will likely need to pay a small fee to enroll in the competition.Find out more about the enrollment process by talking to the head coach of your forensics team or by asking your teachers at school. You can also search online for the website of your local forensics league and look for any specified fees for enrolling in the competition.
If your school would like to enroll in the NSDA to compete, they will need to pay a $150 yearly fee and complete a membership form.

, Once you have enrolled in the competition, you should determine your competition dates. These dates will function as a good deadline around which you can prepare and practice for the competition.


Leading up to the competition date, you may want to try to schedule at least one to two hours a week where you focus on your forensics presentation. Scheduling this in will allow you to also get your school work done and maintain any other extracurricular commitments you may have.

, The NSDA tournament for middle school students and high school students are broken into two categories: Main Events and Supplemental Events. Each category is broken into topics for competition. The categories and topics the Main Events are:


Declamation: You will select a speech written by a writer or thinker and perform an excerpt of the speech for up to 10 minutes. You need to present an oration that delivers the message of the speech in an original and engaging way.
Dramatic Interpretation: You will use a play, short story, or another published work and perform a selection for up to 10 minutes. You will need to convey emotion using a dramatic text with no props or costumes.
Duo Interpretation: You and one other competitor will perform a published play or story within 10 minutes. Your duo will need to convey emotion and set the scene by interacting with each other, using no props or costumes.
Expository Speaking: You will introduce a topic and perform an informative speech about your selected topic within five minutes. You may use a topic like a specific organization, a specific product, a process, or a concept.
Extemporaneous Speaking: You are given three questions to choose from that relate to current events. You then have 30 minutes to prepare a seven minute speech that answers the selected question. You can use articles and other print evidence but you cannot use the internet and must perform the speech from memory.
Humorous Interpretation: You will use a play, short story, or other published work to perform a selection of the piece for up to 10 minutes. You will need to show off your comedic skills as well as your ability to do script analysis, comedic delivery and timing, and character development. You can portray one or multiple characters but cannot use props or costumes.
Impromptu: You will have seven minutes total to choose a topic, brainstorm an idea, outline your speech, and deliver the speech. You must give the speech from memory and you can take a serious or light hearted tone.
Original Oratory: You will give a 10 minute speech on the topic of your choice from memory. Your speech should be supported by evidence, logic, and emotional elements.
Lincoln-Douglas Debate: You will debate one-on-one on a topic provided by the NSDA. You can consult evidence or research you gathered prior to the debate but you cannot use the Internet during the debate. The debate will run about 45 minutes long.
Policy Debate: You will work with another participant in a two-on-two debate. You will discuss a policy question and show off your research, analytical, and delivery skills. You can cross examine the other team and your performance will be judged by a panel.
Public Forum Debate: You will compete in a team of two and debate a topic based on a current event. You will present your position, engage in rebuttal, and do “crossfire”, similar to cross-examination.
Congressional Debate: You will work in teams to generate a series or bills and resolutions for debate as part of a simulation of the U.S. legislative process in the Senate and the House. As a Debater, you will deliver speeches for and against a topic in a group setting.

, As a competitor in a NSDA competition, you can also participate in Supplemental Events. There are several other topics available for competitors in Supplemental Events but they will vary based on the league you are competing in. The topics in the NSDA competition are:


Poetry: You will interpret a selection or several selections of poetry to interpret it within seven minutes. You can use traditional or nontraditional poetry.
Prose: You can use a short story, parts of a novel, or other published works of prose and interpret it within seven minutes. You can use works of fiction or non-fiction, but you cannot use poetry or plays.
Storytelling: You will select a published story that fits a certain theme and perform it within five minutes. You can use a chair as a prop but you cannot bring a manuscript with you to read from.
Extemporaneous Debate: You will compete one-on-one on several different topic and present your arguments as well as engage in rebuttals. You have 30 minutes to prepare for each round of debate., Once you have read over the categories, you should think about whether you would prefer to compete solo or with a group. Some forensic competitions allow participants to enter into solo and duo or group topics.Think about whether you would like to gain better teamwork and communication skills by working in a group, or if you’d prefer to focus on your own presentation on your own. It may be useful to try both a solo category and a group category to ensure you get a well-rounded experience of the competition.
You may also want to consider if you can sufficiently prepare for two different categories within a certain period of time, as you will likely be balancing school work and extracurricular activities in addition to preparing for the forensics competition.

, You should also think about playing to your strengths as a competitor, as this can help to increase your chances of doing well. This does not necessarily mean limiting yourself to only subjects or categories you feel you would be good at, as you may want to challenge yourself by trying something new. But identifying your strengths will give you a good sense of how you can use your talents and skills to do well in the competition.


For example, if you are skilled in acting, you may go for a subject like “Humorous Solo Acting”, where you have three to eight minutes to present a humorous monologue using only voice, gestures, movement and facial expression.If you are more comfortable doing an oral presentation, where you interpret and present content rather than act it out, you may go for a subject like “Farrago”. In the “Farrago” challenge, you will have four to eight minutes to interpret a theme or emotion in a literary genre and present it to the judges. You can choose from a variety of genres, including poetry, short stories, essays, dramas, novels, and speeches., If you are looking to make the forensics competition more challenging for you, personally, you may go for a category that you find difficult or intimidating. This can help you to expand your existing skills and get you out of your comfort zone. Selecting a more challenging category or subject can also allow you to gain more self confidence and self esteem, especially if you do well in the competition.


For example, maybe you find group presentations and group work intimidating or challenging. You may decide to try a partner category or a group category in forensics to work through your fears. Perhaps you try the “Infomercial” subject, where you and a partner have two to five minutes to emulate or parody a television infomercial. You can sell a real or imaginary product or service and use props and costumes, if needed.If you really want to challenge yourself with group work, you may select a subject in the group category, such as “Group Improvisation”. In this subject, you will work in groups of two to four students to create an “off the cuff” presentation about a topic or a situation. You will draw the topic (a word, phrase, statement, or non-specific question) at random right before the presentation. Your group cannot use props, costumes, or make up and will have four to five minutes to present., If you are struggling to identify a category or subject you might be good at, reach out to parents or mentors for advice. Ask them what they think your strengths are as a performer or presenter and which categories they think might play to your strengths. You may also ask for advice on categories that they think may help you expand your existing skills and allow you to feel challenged during the competition.


Keep in mind if you join an existing forensics team at your school or university, the coach of the team may also be able to suggest a few categories and subjects you might be good at. You may also be given a few options based on the needs of the team and/or to fulfill a needed role in the team.

, Make sure you include a thesis statement, or a main point. You should also check that your speech follows the guidelines for your chosen category or subject. If you are doing a “Farrago”, for example, you should make sure you discuss a key theme or emotion in a literary work.

, If you are part of a forensics team, you may take turns practicing your presentations. As you take turns being the audience and then being the speaker, you can critique each other and offer feedback. These drills can help your team get more comfortable with public speaking and support each other as you all learn your strengths and weaknesses as speakers.


You can also do these drills on your own, practice in front of a mirror or to an audience of family or friends.
You should time yourself to ensure your speech is not too long or too short. All the forensics categories have strict time limits so make sure your presentation does not go under or over the time limit.
Another option is to record your speech as you practice it. You may have someone on your team record you or record yourself on your own. You can then play back the tape and listen to your voice, noting any moments where you are speaking too fast or mispronouncing any words.

, Open body language can be a great way to keep your audience engaged and display a sense of confidence during your speech. You should maintain eye contact with your audience and keep your arms relaxed at your sides. You should also stand straight, with your shoulders rolled back and your chin facing straight ahead.Avoid shifting around on your feet nervously or fiddling with your clothing as these can be signs of a lack of confidence. If you do need to move around as you speak, do so in a controlled and contained way. Pace around slowly and in a relaxed manner. Fast pacing can be distracting and take away from your presentation.

, Though you are not required to memorize every detail of your speech for the forensics competition, you will be docked points if you read too much from your cue cards or index cards. Practice memorizing your speech so you appear well prepared and confident to the judges.You may want to write key points of your speech down on cue cards and then try to memorize your speech, using the key points as a guide. You can also write down key words or phrases. The idea is to use the cue cards as a tool to remind yourself of the details of your speech.

, Many of the categories in the forensics competition emphasize creativity and entertainment. You should keep this in mind when preparing for the competition, especially if you are doing a group category. The judges will expect your presentation to be informative, persuasive, and engaging.You may try to amp up the creativity in your presentation by trying a different approach to a familiar topic. If you are doing a “Humorous Solo Acting” presentation, you may try using facial gestures and body movements to full effect or use a funny voice to do the presentation.
If your group is preparing for a “Group Improvisation”, you may want to look at ways to get better at doing improv. You may also do team building exercises so you become more comfortable working together as a time.

, To compete in the NSDA and in many forensics competitions, you will need to dress “business casual”. This means a pressed suit with a tie as well as dress shoes for men and a dress or a blouse and a skirt with conservative dress shoes for women. You should look professional, put together, and confident.You should also do proper grooming by doing your hair so it looks professional and clean. Avoid bright, dramatic makeup or bold jewelry as they can distract from your performance.

Acknowledge your own biases.,
Research community problems.,
Research school funding.,
Expand your horizons.",How to Close the Achievement Gap1," Everyone brings their own prejudices and biases to their perceptions of others. Take some time to determine your own blind spots to help you overcome your own prejudices. Pay attention to your behavior and see what you notice about judgments and subsequent reactions.


Think about your behavior with others. For example, do you let boys in your classroom be noisier than girls, because boys are typically known to be rowdier? Are you surprised when you have an Asian student underperforming, because they are always supposed to be good students? These are implicit biases. You may believe everyone is equal and deserving of equality, yet there may be exceptions to your beliefs.Pay attention to your language and body language when speaking to others. Do you cross your arms in front of you when you are talking to certain types of people, for example? Does your tone of voice change, or do you use different words than you would normally use, when you are speaking to someone with a different background than you?;
, Talk to community members in your school district, read the local paper, or attend local government meetings to understand the issues facing families in your community. Learning about the issues facing the community will help you better understand the issues that your students may be dealing with.Look at your school’s socioeconomic makeup and determine if it is a school in a high-need area. You may have many students in your school whose families are financially struggling, and therefore not able to give their children adequate educational support.Widespread substance abuse in your community could impact student performance.
Your community may have a large transient population. Moving from place to place frequently can cause student stress, which you may be dealing with if you have a large military family or migrant worker population.

, In the United States, schools are funded through federal and state funds, but are also funded largely by local property taxes. As a result, wealthier areas pay more in property taxes, while poorer areas pay less. This creates a funding gapPoorer schools face larger class sizes, struggles in retaining staff, and less parental involvement (both in volunteering their time and contributing financially).Students in poverty, as well as students of non-white ethnicities, are overwhelmingly concentrated in the lowest-achieving schools., Learn about the cultures of students at your school, especially if they are different from your own. Our cultural backgrounds have a tremendous impact on who we are and how we see the world.Read books written by authors from your students’ cultures.
Ask your students to tell you about their cultural and/or religious traditions. Find out if there is a local cultural event you can attend. You could say, “If any of you know of any cultural events in the community, I’d love an invitation! I want to learn more about your background!”
Talk to your students’ families. For example, if your students are first-generation Americans from immigrant families, you could ask their parents, “What was your home country like? How is it different from here? What do you miss about it?”

Do your homework.,
Participate and do your best to answer the question correctly by studying at home.,
Be organized.,
Make a study schedule.,
Take good notes.,
Study effectively.,
Ask for help.",How to Become a Straight A+ Student," Always do your homework every day and try not to miss any assignments. Turn in your homework on time no matter what activities come to you. If you don't do your homework, you will have consequences with your teacher. Your teacher doesn't give you homework for no reason, they give you homework so that they can see if you really understood the lesson they taught you. Remember to do your homework neatly, and understandable, not when you are in a rush.;
, When you participate, you will give the teacher a feeling that you study at home and do your homework correctly.

, Get a planner you can bring to school in your backpack and write your homework. Write down when your tests are to remind you to study for it and when some of your assignments are due. You can get a calender and write what you need to do before the due date, as well as what is in the horizon for the next few days.

, You have a calendar, but you also need a weekly schedule, too. Map out your week and see what time your studying can get done. With this schedule, you will know just how much time you can devote to each class and see when you can study for each subject.

, For some classes in middle school, high school, and some junior/community colleges, most of the notes you write will be on tests and in homework. Everything your teacher writes down, make sure you copy it and read it over so you can understand what the teacher is discussing about. Write good and legible notes, you may also use a highlighter when something is really important, so that your eyes can see it easily flipping through your notes.

, Nobody wants to stay all night studying for an upcoming test. Well there's something else you can try: make a study guide and review it over. Look in any of your subject textbooks and grab any important information you need and add it to your study guide. Read the information in the study guide as many times as you need to. Memorize it or at least remember it. Make someone test you in the study guide you made. Talking about the information, and reading it aloud helps too, and makes it easier to remember it. When you explain it to someone, you will not only memorize it, but understand it. Create different ways to study such as making flash cards, joining an after school club, or making a board game to make studying easy and fun. You could also type your notes so it can be easier to read. Do whatever you can to understand what you are studying about.

, If your not sure what is required from a teacher or to get good grades, just go at the end of the day or during class and ask the teacher that you don't understand what was going on in class.The teacher will appreciate your efforts and he/she will start to like you because you tried to ask him/her something that you didn't understand. That's why teachers are teachers, their job is to teach you what you don't understand. A teacher that likes you can be very handy sometimes.

Never use words like It's, They'll, etc.,
Put examples whenever you can.,
Elongate sentences by putting BS in it.,
Use introductions when you can.",How to BS Your Way Through Class and Get a Good Grade1," Always lengthen them to It is, They will, etc. This will increase the word count and length.;
, Look like you put a lot of thought in it and researched it. This will also increase the length of it.

, For example, instead of saying Martin Luther King, Jr. fought for no more segregation put: ""Martin Luther King, Jr. was a great man who spent many hours putting stuff together; for example, speeches and protests, among other things, and it is very great that he did this, for without it, there would be segregation, which he fought against constantly"". Basically, that small sentence was turned into a long, smart-sounding paragraph using the techniques stated.

, For example, if you're writing about computers, or anything that involves technology really, write some intro about how much technology has changed and give examples and a time line (you can do this without even doing research by just putting stuff you've already learned in the past about technology. For example, if you're a video game nut, put a bunch of crap about video game history). This will make it look like you spent a bunch of time researching, when in reality you were just putting stuff you already knew, but making it sound smart.

Examine the gaps in your own school or district.",How to Close the Achievement Gap2," Learn more about your local school district’s commitment to closing the achievement gap by attending school board meetings. Consider finding out what is happening at your school or your child’s school by connecting with parent-teacher organizations or speaking to school administration.Attend a school board meeting and address your concerns about the achievement gap at the district level. You could say, “I’m concerned about the recent low standardized test scores from our students of color. What is the board doing to address the needs of this population?”
Communicate your concerns to the principal of your child’s school and ask what the principal thinks are some steps they could take at the school level to help close the gap.
Consider joining a committee of interest, or even running for the school board, to make a greater impact on local policy.

, Donate your time to organizations who work for educational change. These opportunities can be in or out of school environments. Some opportunities you may wish to consider include:


Volunteering in a classroom (this may require you to be the parent/guardian of a student currently in the classroom; check with your school district).
Offering to come speak to a school/classroom about your work or skill set. For example, if you were a nurse, you could offer to speak to a class about first aid.
Volunteering in afterschool programs.
Becoming a mentor for a child in your community who requires extra support.
Tutoring at a community center or library.
Working with adult literacy, ESL, or parenting programs. Teaching adults skills can benefit their children as well.

, Find professional development trainings that address achievement gap issues, such as student poverty or cultural sensitivity training. Consider approaching your school’s administration to suggest trainings that may benefit your school or district.If you are a teacher, consider taking additional classes on student achievement for graduate or postgraduate coursework.

, Look for ways you could make positive changes to close the gap by understanding the concerns at the local level. Collaborate with other teachers, school administration, parents, and community members to address some of the concern. Some problems you may wish to address include:


Class size
Rigor of curriculum
School safety
Insensitivity to cultural concernsLack of bilingual staff"

Keep your expectations high.,
Get to know your students.,
Keep connected to students’ families.,
Ask your students to teach you.,
Advocate for student screening and intervention.,
Encourage mentoring relationships.",How to Close the Achievement Gap3," Expect great things out of your students. Be clear in what you expect out of your students’ performance, and set the bar high for challenging, high quality work.Tell yourself that your students are intelligent, capable, accomplished, and resilient. Studies have shown that teachers who are given positive messages about their students get their students to be more successful. Give yourself these positive pep talks about your students.Develop a mantra to say to yourself to help you stay positive about your students. It could be something like, “My students are smart! My students are powerful! My students will change the world!” or whatever inspires you.
Actively engage students in instruction, utilizing different styles of learning. Keep your classroom organized and efficient to maximize learning time., Develop a good rapport with your students and take an interest in their lives. As relationships develop, you may find your students more willing to open up to you about what is going on in their lives. Listen to what they say, and see if you can transform what they tell you into a more productive learning environment for them.For example, if you have a student who is consistently absent because they have to take care of a sick parent, you could contact your school’s social worker or administration to connect the student with social services or arrange alternative learning opportunities.

Empathize with your students. Listen to their stories and struggles, and try to imagine what it would be like to be in their shoes. Reflect back what you hear to build empathy, for example: “I can understand why you say you’re so tired, Marisol. It must be hard having to wake up so early with your baby sister every morning.”
Maintain professional boundaries and ensure that any connections you form with your students maintain a teacher-student relationship., Developing a good relationship with parents can help you all be on the same page with a student’s performance. You may also be better able to understand some of the issues a student is facing through conversations or interactions with their parents.Through conversations with the parents, you may learn about family stressors like divorce, unemployment, addiction, or legal troubles. You could ask a student’s parents, “I’ve noticed that your son is struggling to pay attention in my class these days. Is everything okay at home right now? What can I do to help?”
Your students may also have additional responsibilities in their household that keep them away from the classroom. They may be late for school every day because they have to take their younger sibling to school, for example. Building a good rapport with the parents may help you be able to work together to find a solution to some out-of-school problems that affect academic performance.

, Have your students teach you about their cultural heritage or background. Ask them to tell stories or write essays about their lives. Have them share with you and their classmates things they care about. Storytelling and sharing about each other’s lives helps build empathy and understanding.For example, if you have a variety of ethnicities represented in your class, you could develop an assignment that emphasizes students’ cultural heritage: a show-and-tell with an important family tradition or relic, or a report on an important custom or holiday within a student’s community.
You could say, “I want everyone to understand your own heritage and be proud of where you came from. I want you to help me, and the rest of our class, learn about your background. That’s why, with this next assignment….”

, If you notice behavioral, learning, or medical concerns within your classroom, take steps to get the student assessed. Reach out to the students’ parents and school administration with your concerns.Encourage your school to form partnerships with community agencies to connect with students and families in need.

, Look for role models in the students’ community, perhaps people of the same cultural background or those who came from similar circumstances, and work to foster relationships between citizens and students. Community mentors who successfully emerged from challenging circumstances may inspire students to work toward their own goals.You could look for people who are willing to be mentors through the local chamber of commerce or through community clubs, like the Lions Club or Rotary International. Ask them to come to your class and give a presentation.
You could tell your students, “I want you to keep an eye open for adults in our community who are successful at what they do and are people you admire. Find out who they are and let me know how I can get in touch with them. I’d like to have people you admire come to speak to our class.”

After you change into your gym clothes, NEVER get out of the locker room first.,
If you have warm ups, wait until the more fit kids get done, then go a few seconds after.,
Only do the warm ups when the teacher is looking that way.,
If you can, pick sports where you can stand there and look like you're doing something.,
If you're playing baseball or something where you will be standing in line to wait for your turn to bat or what not, use politeness to your advantage.",How to BS Your Way Through Class and Get a Good Grade2," If you get out first, it will be harder to do the next step. Same goes for if you get out last. You want to get out in the middle so you can blend in easier.

, The teacher will pay attention to them when they get done with a set of exercises which will allow you enough time to look like you're done.

, He can't say you never did them when he didn't see you not doing them.

, For example: volleyball, capture the flag (just stand there and say you're playing defence), soccer (stand by the goal and, like in capture the flag, say you're playing defence.)

Have a morning routine.,
Begin projects as soon as you get the assignment.,
Color code your materials by subject.,
Buy a large backpack.,
Have an agenda.,
Purchase other supplies.,
Make a supply list for each class.,
Know when projects are due.,
Prioritize your to-do list.,
Ask your teachers for help with your study schedule.",How to Become an Organized Student," A great way to stay organized is to have the same routine every morning. This way, you’ll be able to remember things that you’re missing because you will have your routine memorized. It is harder to forget things at home or come to school unprepared if you do the same routine each morning.In addition to showering and getting dressed, your morning routine should include a healthy breakfast and a quick check of the contents of your backpack to make sure you have everything you need.;
, Rather than waiting until the night before an assignment is due, try to begin working on homework and other projects as soon as you know what the assignment will be. Waiting until the last minute to complete homework assignments will make you feel less organized and will make it harder to organize other aspects of your student life.Organizing your life to include time for homework every night will help you stay on top of your schoolwork more effectively.

, This means for Math, you might want to have a blue book cover, blue folder, and blue notebook. For History, you might want to have a pink book cover, pink folder, and pink notebook. That way, you'll look in your locker or backpack and easily be able to get what you need for each class.

Organizing your school supplies by color coding will help save you time and help you keep all of the things you need grouped together in a way that makes sense to you.

, A backpack is a necessity for any organized student. You are probably not going to be able to fit everything into your locker, especially once you are out of elementary school. Having a big backpack will ensure that everything you need is with you at all times.A large backpack will help you bring all of the things you need to class every day. A big part of being organized is having the supplies you need at each class every day.

, Most schools provide these, but don't worry if your school doesn't. They are really cheap to buy on your own and fairly easy to find. After each class, write down every piece of homework for that class. At the end of the day, you should have all of your homework written down in the agenda.You should be able to find a school agenda book at any office supply store. Most grocery stores and supermarkets sell them as well.

, You’ll need to buy some other things to help you become an organized student. There are products and school supplies specifically designed for making organization more manageable. Purchase some folders, binder clips, pens, pencils, and a big trapper keeper.Try to get supplies that are various colors so that all of your things don’t look the same. This will help you pick out what you need in the short periods between classes when you don’t have much time.

, You need to come to class prepared every day. This means that you need to keep track of the things you’ll need to bring with you every day. Make a list the night before and write every single thing you need to bring to each class the next day. Talk to your friends and teachers to know what you need for each class.This is especially helpful for students who have A/B schedules with different classes on different days. You don’t want to leave some necessary supplies at home just because you forgot which classes you had that day.
Figure out how to lighten your load. Don't bring nonsense things – like a calculator to History or an eraser to P.E.

, Keeping due dates in mind is essential if you want to be an organized, successful student. You may want to purchase a white board or cork-board to write or pin on when projects are due. This will help you create a visual aid for yourself to help you remember deadlines.A fun way to get the project done easier and faster is to work with friends, if your teacher and parents allow that.

, In order to be an organized student, you need to prioritize the things you need to get done on a daily basis. Make a list of the things you need to do each day, with the most important items at the top of the list so that you know to work on these items first.As you work down the list, you’ll still be accomplishing your goals. But you’ll be doing it in a methodical, organized manner.
Figure out when you are naturally the most productive and try to do the bulk of your work during that time. If you are more alert and engaged in the mornings, then try to get up before school and spend some time on homework then. If late at night is your thing, try to create a schedule that allows you to stay up later to work on school assignments.

, Don't be afraid to ask teachers for help setting up a study schedule, or even if you don't understand what to do in class. They are there to help you and offer you advice. If you are struggling with completing or organizing your schoolwork, stay after class and discuss it with a teacher you are comfortable talking to.


Your teachers can be your best ally and source of knowledge when it comes to academic matters. Don’t be shy about discussing your struggles with them.

Set a deadline for individual work well before the final due date.,
Compile the work.,
Go through final editing.,
Submit the project.,
Address any technological problems.,
Fix any problems between group members.",How to Complete Online Group Projects," Your group members may be assigned by your professor or you may be able to pick your group members. If your group members are assigned, locate your group members and find their emails. If you are to pick your group members, find classmates who you would like to ask along with their emails and suggest working in a group with them via email.;
, Start off by sending an email to your fellow group members. Introduce yourself and suggest a topic to approach the assignment followed with a suggestion of how to split the workload and approach doing so.

, Make sure all group members agree on a topic and each member had a say in deciding on topic in order to set up for proper contribution from each group member. Determine a topic by discussing with your members through online forms of communication, i.e. email, Skype, etc.

, Be sure each group member has an equal workload. Once each member is assigned a task, he/she will begin their part. Although each member is required to complete his/her part, working together and utilizing all forms of online communication will encourage the group to work together to complete the assignment.

, Once each individual group member begins working on his/her specific tasks for the assignment, create a document on a platform that all group members can access and work on simultaneously. For example, a Google document works much like a Microsoft Word document; however, this program allows for all group members to edit the same document at the same time. By using this platform or one similar, all group members can work on their specific individual parts while contributing their thoughts and ideas towards the other group members’ work and contributions.

, Create a time-line for your project that can help keep everyone focused on deadlines for their individual parts while also being able to finish the project without any problems. This time-line should include who will do what, what the format of each part should be, when each individual should complete their part by, space for time to assemble all the parts into a final draft, and a date to examine the final draft and turn it in, preferably before the deadline.

, Allow enough time for any errors to be resolved without pushing past the submission date. Errors could range from not understanding the task of the project, submitting your portion without it reaching a group member/leader, or a personal sick day delaying your work.

, A single group member can be assigned to compile the individual portions as part of their tasks. This group member usually has less work upfront to create an even split of contributions between members. This member has the option of taking the entire task of compiling under their wing and submitting without consent of the group or compiling it and seeking consent from the group. It is recommended and very common that the group member seeks consent from other group members before submitting as it can ease the feelings of other members. This member can in no way need to take the comments seriously and can choose to ignore any and all comments. If they choose, each member will go in one at a time and edit the document, creating an organized flow to the pieces. When editing on Google Docs, an icon to all members will show that they are editing, allowing each member to work one at a time

, It is best not to remove too much information from another person’s section. If you find that a member has redundant portion of writing that repeats something already said in the document, simply highlight the portion you think should be removed and add in a note. Each member can go in and agree or disagree and a simple majority can be used to decide how to edit a large portion. This last step helps remove any surprise from the final product as each member can see it come to be in real time.

, Once all group members are satisfied with the output of the project, assign one group member preferably the compiler to submit the project online.

, How is the internet quality in your workplace? Is it too slow to be a quality member of the online group? Do you even have a signal? Before you decide to work online, the first thing you should do is ensure the router and signal is up to the task. If you purchase a wireless router with a smaller capacity for speed than your internet signal is capable of you will be capping yourself. If you do not mind working in a single place in your work space, a simple choice would be to directly connect your computer to the internet with an Ethernet cord. This will provide you with the fastest and most stable internet connection.

, It is hard in any sense to ensure that each member of the team is doing all that they are assigned to be doing, making this problem even more apparent virtually. To overcome this is why all tasks should be broken down as evenly as possible among the members presented in an easily readable and obtainable list as far in advance as possible. This will ensure that each member knows all of their responsibilities as far ahead of the completion date as possible, allowing any necessary changes to be made to ensure completion.

Organize your cards.,
Flip over one card.,
Set aside pairs.",How to Study Using a Game Method1," Make small cards using paper or something sturdier such as cardstock. Cut small squares out and be sure to make each piece the same size. Since this is a memory game, it is important that each card looks the same so you are unable to differentiate one card from the next. , Work in pairs when writing out your review information on these cards. Write down a vocabulary word on the first card in the pair and its definition on the second. Continue writing on your cards until each review item has been covered.


This game words best when reviewing things like definitions, spelling, examples, etc. , Flip over all your cards so that the writing is underneath. Place your cards face down and organize them into rows and columns until every game piece is situated.

, Begin the game by choosing just one card to turn over. Read the definition or vocabulary word and choose one more card to turn over. If you flipped over the correct card, you should have a pair in which both cards are a match.


When first starting out, this game is sheer luck, but after a few tries you will be able to remember where each card lies and can do your best to find its correct match.

, When you have found two cards that are a match, set that pair aside so that your game board becomes smaller. Continue playing until every card has been turned over and you have created matches for each game piece. When you are finished playing, you can simply shuffle your cards and redistribute them to create your game board and play again.

Be sure you aren’t missing any because it will affect how you play the game. , Using your study materials, create a list of items you want to review. This list must be numbered and can be anything from definitions to vocabulary.

, You want to eliminate any face cards from your deck because the only cards needed are those with numbers. You may set the face cards aside until you have finished playing.


An alternative to pulling out face cards is using them to play the game. Treat these cards like wild cards and whenever you draw one you can choose to review any item from your list that you wish to review.

, It is very important to shuffle your deck. By doing this, you will ensure that each review item gets chosen by mixing up the numbers within the deck.

, Place your cards in a pile after shuffling them and draw the first card off the top. You may set aside all the cards you have already drawn.

, Look at the number on the card you drew and find the corresponding number on your list of review items. Review the information for that particular number. Continue to draw cards and review the information corresponding to those cards until you have gone through the entire deck.

Use card stock or heavy-duty paper for sturdy game pieces.
Use sticky notes as another option to quickly create piece.

, You created your main game pieces so now you must number them according to how many questions you developed. , Place all of your numbered game pieces into the container and be careful not to forget any. Be sure to shake the container once you’ve put all your game pieces inside to ensure the pieces are mixed sufficiently.

, Keep your list of questions next to you as you pull pieces out of the container. Choose randomly from the container and read the number on the piece of paper. , Find the number on your question list that corresponds to the number on your game piece and read that question.

, After answering each question, put the used game pieces aside so as not to repeat any.


If you are unable to recall the correct answers to any questions you can make two piles designating one for challenging questions and one for easy questions.
When you play the game for again, you can just put the challenging questions inside the container and spend less time reviewing the questions you already know.

Take the exam.",How to Study So You Can Remember Everything," Before studying, head outside to enjoy the weather for at least twenty minutes. Research has shown that exercising before an exam or a study session will help your memory and brain. Save enough energy for studying so that you do not feel fatigued.;
, The exercise sparks a mind/body memory connection that typing and printing doesn't replicate as well. Writing is also a longer process that provides adequate time for the information to sink in and stick to your head. Afterwards, gather all the flash cards in a neat stack and shuffle them. A good idea is to attribute a different colour to each school subject. This means that for example, all your English flashcards will be blue, and the ones dedicated to math, red. Put your flashcards into envelopes that you can stick in your notebook.

, When studying, using different study methods will help the information stick to your head. For example, speaking the facts out loud rather than reading them will boost your chances of later recalling it. As you study, highlight the points that you remember before focusing on the ones that you don't.

, At the end of each study session, prepare questions about the material that you have just studied. Write each answer on a piece of paper. Repeat this method a few times if some facts are particularly elusive. At the end, type out the questions that you have trouble answering.

, Using the correct type of music during your study sessions can improve memory skills. Keep the volume at an appropriate level to avoid becoming distracted. Be sure that the songs you play do not contain words or loud melodies. If you find that the music proves to be a distraction, turn it off or change the song.

, Although you may be tempted to plow through the information, taking breaks allows your brain to absorb and process the information. Giving yourself time to relax will also boost your motivation and focus. Participate in relaxing activities for short periods of time before returning to the books.

, Spray an unfamiliar smell during your study sessions. When the exam comes, using the same scent will improve your ability in recalling information. This method can also apply to chewing gum. However, be sure that you have permission to chew it during the test; otherwise, it may be confiscated and you'll find yourself in trouble. Another way to use smells to boost your memory is to spray perfume on your lessons (a different one for every subject). Before your test use that bottle on yourself.


For example: for math you used vanilla during the studying, and when you inhale that odour again, you will remember the important math equation you were supposed to know.

, Information is better retained when you have a change of scenery. Locate the best rooms that are free of distractions, such as the library or your room. Be sure to remove any electronic devices that might hinder you from studying. Avoid locations with noisy people or distracting sounds. With each study session, change your surroundings.

, You should keep your attention on important facts while avoiding the unnecessary ones. Avoid over-studying and filling your brain with useless information. Many people have a tendency to focus on unnecessary facts, resulting in them forgetting the essential material reviewed before. Memorization is made difficult because of this.

, Research has shown that your mind retains information easier when you are in the same position that you take your exam in. Adjust your surroundings and seating position so that you are in the same one when you take your test. For example, if you are going to be tested at a desk, study at a desk.

, The week before the exam, be sure you receive adequate amounts of rest. Six to eight hours of sleep per night is essential for energy and good health. Getting enough rest on the night before the exam is even more important. Although you may be tempted to stay up and cram, your brain will not be able to retain the information properly. You'll also be depriving yourself of rest, which leads to a lack of energy and focus. Ensuring that you have enough sleep will guarantee a better performance on your test.

, Maintaining a balanced diet is essential for good health and an adequate level of energy. You can improve your focus by eating well-balanced meals that contain good amounts of calories and carbohydrates. Snacking on healthy foods, such as nuts or fruits, during your study breaks will help your body remain at its best.


On the day of the exam, ensure that you have a healthy breakfast. You should satisfy your stomach so that it does not feel empty during the test. Also, eating will provide an energy boost.

, Before you take your test, give yourself a quick review. Write down the facts that you are having trouble remembering. Go over the questions that you feel uncertain about. However, avoid cramming, as it does little good for your brain.

, Do your best on it while keeping a positive attitude. Answer the easy questions before returning to the harder ones. Circle the ones that you are uncertain about, and move onto the others to save time. Answer essay questions with clear points, and support them with an adequate amount of information. You should manage your time well throughout the exam, making sure that you spend enough time on each question.


Double-check your answers. You may be able to catch small mistakes or careless answers.
Avoid spending too much time on one question. It is important to distribute your time well throughout the exam.

Start studying as soon as possible.",How to Remember Things You Study Better," The first thing you should do is make sure that you’re sleeping properly. When you don’t get enough sleep, your brain doesn’t work as well and all the studying in the world isn’t going to make a difference. You’ll have to put the parties and hanging out aside for awhile until you feel better about your studying.


New scientific studies have shown that when we sleep, our body goes through a sort of cleaning cycle where our brains get flushed of all the bad stuff that shouldn’t be there. When you don’t get enough sleep, this bad stuff builds up and makes your brain work a lot worse.
Some people need eight hours of sleep, but some people only need six while others may need nine or more. Everyone’s body is different, so experiment to see how you feel.;
, Eating a healthy, balanced diet is also important. Your body needs lots of different nutrients in order to work right and when you don’t have those nutrients, it can be hard to focus and absorb information. Eating balanced meals doesn’t just mean eating a lot of kale (although kale is really good for you). It mostly means making sure that you’re eating a lot of different foods in healthy proportions. You have to adjust for your particular lifestyle, but a good balance to start with is:


30% vegetables. Lean towards dark greens like kale, chard, spinach, and broccoli, since these have more nutrients in them.
20% fruits. Try to choose nutrient-rich fruits, like citrus fruits and kiwi, or fruits which are high in fiber, like apples, pears, and bananas.
30% whole grains. Choose nutrient-rich grains like brown rice, quinoa, and oatmeal, and look for whole grain products whenever you do eat any grain.
20% protein. Try to choose lean proteins when you eat meat (turkey, chicken, and fish) and complete proteins when you eat other protein-rich foods (you’ll need to mix foods like nuts, lentils, and beans to get a complete protein, or eat whole soybeans like soy nuts and edamame).
Limit your dairy intake. Most nutrients that you get from dairy products you can get just as easily from other sources. Dairy products tend to be very fatty, so when you do eat them, choose low-fat versions. You’ll want to be sure you get enough calcium, though, so eat calcium rich foods like kale, collard greens, and sardines.

, You probably know that your body is made up mostly of water, so you’re probably not surprised to hear that getting enough water will be very important for helping you focus. Dehydration will give you problems focusing and if you can’t focus, then you’re going to have a really hard time remembering.


A good rule of thumb is that you’ll know you’ve had enough water when your urine comes out pale or occasionally clear. Eight 8 oz glasses a day is a good starting point, but different people need different amounts of water.

, When you study, do what you can to wear clothes that are comfortable. This will let you focus all of your attention on your work, rather than breaking your focus to worry about heat, cold, or your pants pinching you in that spot you don’t want to talk about.

, Coffee, 5 Hour Energy, Red Bull….whatever your poison is, be careful when you pick it. Caffeine does help you study...but only if you drink it after studying.If taken before you study, it can make you too jittery to focus properly. Caffeine also has lots of other downsides, so try not to rely on caffeine in general.


Negative side effects of caffeine include caffeine addiction, headaches, dehydration, fatigue, anxiety, and disruption of your sleep cycle.

, There is a theory that different people learn better in different ways and that by exposing yourself more to the method that works best for you, you’ll have an easier time studying. Now, there are studies which show that learning styles might not work, but many people feel like this does make a difference in their learning. You should feel free to experiment because as long as it works for you, that’s all that matters.


You can find a number of tests online that can help you figure out your learning style. Any one of them is about as reliable as any other and they may give lots of different results. The best route is to pay attention to how you feel and what things feel like they work for you.

, Have you ever noticed that you learn better by looking at charts or graphs? When you think back to lectures in class, do you remember what the Powerpoint slides looked like better than the actual words your teacher said? These might be indications that you’re strongly drawn towards visual learning. Try to find ways to make the information you study into a visual representation, in order to help yourself remember it better.For example, try using different color highlighters and tabs to color code the important information in your textbook.

, Have you ever noticed that you have an easier time remembering what your teacher said, rather than what information was written in your textbook? Do you feel like you absorb information better when you listen to music while you study (sometimes even being able to recall the information simply by “replaying” the song in your head)? These might be indications that you’re strongly drawn towards auditory learning. Try to find ways to make the information you study into an auditory representation, in order to help yourself remember it better.


Try recording your lectures and playing them back while you drive or before or after you study.

, Have you ever noticed that you’re happiest when working with your hands? Maybe you tap your foot or fidget with your hands while you’re in class. These might be signs of a kinesthetic learner, or someone who learns best when they’re physically moving. This learning style is more rare than the other two but important to work with if you have it. Try taking breaks to run around the block or get other brief exercise while you study. This may help you process the information better and keep you from getting too wound up.

, You’ll have an easier time remembering the information you study if it’s something that you care about or can get excited about. Now, some stuff in school will be naturally interesting for you, but other stuff may seem really boring on the surface. When this happens, you’ll have to find a way to get yourself interested in the material. There are lots of different ways to go about this, but you can try:


Finding a reason why the information will be useful to you later in life. For example, the math you’re learning can help you calculate how much money you’ll need to save in order to retire. Be smart, and you might even be able to figure out how to retire early.
Make the information into a story. For example, if you’re studying history, find a way to adapt what you’re learning into your own episode of Game of Thrones. If you’re studying science, think of a way that the science could be used to make your superhero origin story.

, If you pay very close attention during the original lectures, not only will you have an easier time remembering the information but you’ll also be able to study more efficiently because your brain will have an easier time recalling the information. Really work to listen when you’re in class and keep yourself engaged with the conversation of learning by asking questions and really getting involved with the lessons.

 ;), Another good way to “listen” to the lecture is to take notes. This will help keep you on track for paying attention, but it will also give you great material to study from later. Remember, when you take notes, the idea isn’t to write down everything that your teacher says. Instead, write down the important stuff. Write down the outline of the lecture and fill it in with facts, and explanations for the tough concepts that you know you’ll struggle with.


For example, if you were taking notes on each article, you’d probably break your notes down for each section of the article, and write one or two takeaways for each step.

, You can help yourself remember what you learn and also help yourself get more interested in what you’re studying by taking ownership of your education and looking for more information outside of what your teacher talks about. This can help you better understand the concepts but also give you a more solid framework on which you can build with the information covered in class. You might even find interesting things that you think are really cool!


For example, let’s say you’re studying chemistry and your teacher is talking about the discovery of all sorts of new compounds around the late 1800s and early 1900s. You might stop and think to yourself, “What did people do with all this new stuff?” If you did some research, you’d find out that all those new compounds were used to make new, brightly colored paints. These new colors were responsible for an artistic revolution which gave us painters like Van Gogh and Monet.

, If you’re having a hard time following along with what your teacher is saying, try giving yourself a bit more context for the information. Sometimes, when you can more clearly visualize what’s being discussed, you’ll have an easier time understanding what’s happening and keep track of new information as it comes in.


For example, if you’re studying history but you find you just can’t keep track of everything that’s happening, try going to a museum or watching a documentary that deals with that subject. This will give you something to imagine as you learn and it might even explain some ideas in a different and better way than your teacher.

, A mind map is a great way to help yourself remember information better. To make a mind map, break down the information that you need to learn into categories, and then into individual ideas. Write down all of these ideas on note cards and then pin or tape them to a large wall, with the ideas grouped by category. You can then connect similar ideas with string or color code the cards to convey even more information.


This means that (if you learn your mind map) when you go to take a test, all you have to do is bring up the map in your mind and you’ll have a much easier time “finding” the information you need.

, Mnemonics are songs, phrases, or words which act like a shorthand for much more complicated information. You can learn common ones for more standard information, or you can make up your own that are specific to what you’re trying to remember.


For example, the phrase “Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge” is commonly used to remember the notes on a staff. Another example is the name “Pvt. Tim Hall”, which can be used to remember the list of the essential amino acids. , When you study, try studying with other people. This works really well for a lot of different reasons. Mainly, it can engage many different learning styles and most people will find that they understand information better when they have to explain it to someone else. Studying in groups also means that if one of you doesn’t understand something very well or if you were gone on an important day, there are other people there who can help you get back on track.


Talk to your classmates about studying in groups, but remember that it’s not really a time to be social. You shouldn’t choose study mates based on who you’re friends with. You should try to study with people that take the class seriously and put in as much effort as you do.

, When we break our focus, it can often take 20 minutes or more before we can properly regain our focus, according to studies.Our brains also have a limit on how much attention can be paid at any given time, never mind our basic physical limits. This is why it’s best to sit down in a place with as few distractions as possible and just study until you’re done studying.


Avoid music or TV too. Focusing on one task means it’s also a good idea to skip on watching TV or listening to lyric-heavy music while you study. Studies have shown that these almost universally do more harm than good, because it takes too much brain power to both hear the music and intensely focus on your task., When you’re studying, try to make connections between the material you’re trying to learn and the material you already know. By making connections you’ll not only understand the material better (making it more useful to you in your everyday life), you’ll also have an easier time remembering it. You shouldn’t feel limited by subject matter either: if you see a connection between your favorite subject in history and your new assignment in math, then by all means make that connection solidly in your mind.


For example, you might notice that there are some weird words and sentence structures in English. This can be connected to the various cultures that have conquered in England (and the colonies) over the course of history.

, The best, least complicated thing that you can do to help yourself remember what you study better is to just start studying as early as possible. The earlier you start studying, the more chances you have to go over the information repeatedly and really lock those facts away in your brain. Studying the night before really won’t do you any favors, maybe earning you two or three correct questions on a test. Studying for just a short time every other day for a month leading up to a test will probably earn you a perfect score, or at least that “A” you’re hoping for.

Buy or make some cards.,
Make your own flashcards using a pack of index cards and a black marker pen.,
Take the first index card and write the subject you are studying for in big letters.,
Write the keyword on the first card.,
Write the answer on the other side.,
Make up several - or dozens - of such cards.,
Increase the complexity for essay exams.,
Put the flashcards in order.,
Begin studying using the flashcards.,
Test yourself.,
Do this for all the cards.,
Complete the process.",How to Review Using Flash Cards," Make sure that they are approximately A6 size (half of an A5 piece of paper). Don't try to save money by getting paper, as you can see through it, which allows you to unwittingly cheat. It must be lightweight card.;
, Colored cards work best, so you can categorize your flash cards. Plus, they're easier to look at and study from.

, For example, write ""SCIENCE"" in block letters. Write the test name smaller in the card's margin (or the top). For example, ""Trimester 1 final exam."" This becomes the top of the pile card that tells you which set of flashcards you're using.

, On one side of the card, write a very brief cue, key word or phrase, or possible exam question. For example ""Solar system planets (in order of closest to sun)"".

, On the other side, write ""Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune"".

, You could color code them for different subjects - for example, have all blue cards for biology, and pink cards for physics.


If you want to categorize the cards by color, you could write each category's questions on a different color than the answer card. For example, blue cards could be multiple choice questions and pink could be written response. Or, pink is questions about fractions and blue is graphing questions.

, If you are reviewing for an essay-based exam, make the information on the back side of the cards more complex, so that you can see the word (for example, ""Romeo"") and be able to recall several points showing his love for Juliet, several points showing the complexity of his character, advantages and disadvantages of Shakespeare's portrayal of him, what the moral is, etc.

, Or, randomly stack them, anyway you like. It can be helpful to put all the questions in each category together. Put the title card at the top of the pile before putting a rubber band around them all for safe keeping.

, Surprise! You've already been studying. By writing down the questions and answers on your flashcards, you've studied already. But you will need to study some more by using the cards to test yourself.


Read all the questions and answers either silently or aloud. Next, read the questions and try to answer them, then check your answers. Finally, ask a parent, sibling or friend to quiz you. And repeat!

, When you have made multiple cards, it's time to test yourself. Here's how you do it:


Pick up the first card and read the keywords/phrase.
Try to recall as much of the information as you can.
Flip over the card and see if you got the answer(s) right.
If you're happy you got the information right, put that card on the 'right' pile. If you got the information wrong or incomplete, put it on the 'wrong' pile.

, When you've gone through all the cards, go back to the 'wrong' pile, and repeat the process. Keep going through the 'wrong' pile until you get the information right, and there are no cards left in the 'wrong' pile.

, Then go through the whole lot again for good measure.

Be mindful about creating memories.,
Engage your visual memory.,
Use your imagination.,
Chunk information.,
Link information.",How to Remember Things1," It is easy to forget things when you don't take the time to engage with them – when your mind is already slipping off of the surface of the memory, and leaping to the next thing. Take a moment to breathe. Be exactly where you are. If you make this moment a significant and conscious act of storing a memory, you may find it much easier to recall the memory later.


Listen. If you meet someone and she tells you her name: take a moment to fully engage with this person. You still might not remember everything, but it should be easier to link the name with a face if you are absolutely present when you store the memory.If you want to remember where you left an object: take a moment to be aware of where you are leaving it. If you're setting your keys down, visualize the keys as they rest on the wood grain of the table, surrounded by books, and cups, and other things. Capture the image in your mind so that you can recall it later.;
, It can be hard to remember everything that you hear, especially when you hear multiple pieces of information at once. Memory is a primarily visual function. If you link new information to things that you can see and imagine, you may find it much easier to recall the ""linked"" memories.If you meet four new people, and they all introduce themselves to you at once, try linking each name to one major physical characteristic of each person. For instance, Bill might have a large bill on his baseball cap, and Sandra might have light, sandy hair.

, If you are leaving something somewhere, imagine that it explodes, or grows, or comes to life as soon as you set it down. Picture every detail. Conjure a vivid mental image that links your memory of the object to a specific time and place. Try to make ""memory spots"" by linking your mental images to a room that you frequent, or to an object that you use every day., It is well-documented that we remember things best when they are grouped with other things.Try to put things into categories or chains. Break up large bits pieces of information into smaller bits of information.


Try chunking verbal information into poetic sound and metrical structures – songs, or verses, or just simple rhymes. For thousands of years, humans passed down stories and information between spans of generations without any formal writing system. Rhyming is one way of chunking verbal information, but so are stanzas; paragraphs; and even sentences.If you need to remember a long chain of numbers, break it up into smaller bits. For instance, remember 459012476390 as ""459 012 476 390"" or ""4590 1247 6390."" There is a reason that phone numbers, social security numbers, and other important chains of information are broken up into sections.

, When you learn something new, find a way to tie it into what you already know. Make it relevant to your life and your knowledge base. Try using mnemonics to create more mental connections around a given bit of information.Come up with a handy acronym, or try to remember the new thing as a subset of something you already know.

#*If you are trying to remember how to find a physical location, try to tie it into your existing mental map. Memorize each twist and turn that led you to the place. Link the spot in your mind to another place that you know."

Choose paper or electronic flash cards.,
Create the cards.,
Color code the cards (optional).,
Sort the cards as you test yourself.,
Keep testing yourself.,
Wait 30–60 minutes and test yourself again.",How to Study Vocabulary Words1," Paper flash cards are easy to carry around, and writing by hand may help you memorize the words more than typing. On the other hand, you can't lose a phone app or online tool. Some flash card software even lets you speak the words aloud, then writes the cards for you.


If using paper cards, try to find something small that you can carry in your pocket. Cutting index cards in half works well.;
, Write the vocabulary word on one side of the card. On the other side, write the definition. Optionally, write out how to pronounce the word, and an example sentence using the word.


You can find example sentences by searching for the word online. Try to find an online news article or book, since those are more likely to use the word correctly.

, Color coding can help you sort cards if you're studying a large number at once. Pull out your highlighters and color the word side of the card. Here are a few systems you could use:


One color for each vocabulary lesson or chapter.
One color for each topic (food words, traveling words, etc.).
One color for each part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).

, To test yourself, shuffle the cards and look at the top one. Read the word aloud, then say what you think the definition is. Turn it over and check yourself. Put cards you got right in one pile, and cards you got wrong in another pile.


If you're testing yourself on the go, bring along rubber bands to hold the two piles.
Most electronic apps have the option to test yourself like this. They may also have games and alternate tests you can use.

, Reread the pile of cards you got wrong, on both sides. Shuffle them and test yourself in the same way. Keep setting aside the cards you get wrong, so you can repeat this until there are no cards left. The length of time to do this will vary depending on how many cards you have.

, Shuffle all the cards again, but wait a while before testing yourself again. You might be surprised how many you forget. Waiting a short time between tests can help commit the words to your long-term memory.

Write notes to yourself.,
Make a list.,
Keep an address book.,
Use a planner or calendar.",How to Remember Things2," Set down the details while they are fresh in your mind, and leave the note in a place where you'll see it again. Put notes on your fridge, or tape them to your mirror, or use a bulletin board in a prominent part of your home or office. Consider using a note-saving app on your phone or computer.If you need to remember an event, write the details on a small piece of paper or post-it note. Then, stick it on your fridge with a magnet. Include the date, the time, and the place.
In a pinch, try texting or emailing yourself. Send a quick text to your own number: ""Meeting with Peter: Wednesday at 2pm."" Later, when you check your messages, you can move the note to a more visible location.
Write in on your hand or your arm. If the note is particularly urgent, place it somewhere that you cannot ignore it.

, If you need to remember a whole range of things, group them all together into a progression or a flowchart. Organize the items in an order and scheme that makes logical sense to you. Try listing things in order of when they need to be done. Try ranking tasks by their importance, or by their relevance to your goals for a given day. Check off items on the list as you complete them.


Make day-to-day lists to keep yourself accountable. Write a shopping list before you go to the grocery store, or write a list of your goals at the beginning of each work day. Try making a list before you go to sleep each night: set your goals and intentions for the next day, and chart out when you'll complete each task.

, Try writing addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, and other information into a physical or digital book so that you can recall them easily. You can even save much of this information to a person's ""Contact"" page in your phone or email account. Most apps and devices will automatically save your contact information for you. However, it might help you to store all of these various things in one place.

, If you have trouble remember appointments, plans, and important days, you can mark them ahead of time on a calendar. For day-to-day tasks, there are pre-made planners—essentially, productivity journals—with dates and times marked out on each page. You can chart your days, your tasks, your appointments, your assignments out in these pages. If you're diligent, you might dramatically reduce the amount of things that you miss.


Try using a planner or task-setting app. There are various applications and websites that help you chart out your days, weeks, and months. Consider automating parts of your memory so that your devices remind you of important things.Don't worry if the planner-or-calendar strategy doesn't appeal to you. This sort of rigorous planning isn't for everyone, and it certainly isn't the only way to remember things.
You can buy a planner in most paper and office-supply stores. Consider using a planning app to integrate your intentions with your devices.

Consider your learning style.,
Use flashcards.,
Be persistent.",How to Remember Things3," Auditory learners retain information best when they hear it. Visual learners remember things that they see. Kinesthetic (tactile) learners often need to physically interact with things in order to understand them well. There are various other ways of breaking up the types of learning style. Think about which categories of information—and types of information—hold your attention best, and then build your learning strategy around those things., Write down each bit of information onto a separate post-it, index card, or other small sheet. Link each thing to a keyword: for instance, if you are studying anatomy, link the name of a body part to its definition and its function in the body. Then, test yourself. Read the keyword and try to recall the linked definition. Through repetition, cultivate these associations in your head until they are second nature.


You can download a flashcard app for easy access. These programs will also save you the trouble of manually writing out each piece of information.

, If you're going to memorize a lot of information at once, you'll need to keep practicing until you've hammered it into your brain. Repetition makes for lasting memories. Read over these things every day—even several times a day—until you can recall them on cue.Try memorizing things in blocks. Read over a chunk of text or a short list of terms. Keep reading it and recalling it until you know it by heart. Then, move on to the next chunk – but return to earlier chunks at intervals.
If you need to remember your locker combination, practice opening your lock over and over until you can do it without thinking. For a few days, open the lock five times in the morning and five times before you go to sleep. Make sure to supplement this method by writing the locker combination down somewhere safe!

Test yourself with a list.,
Memorize by writing or typing.,
Label everything in your house.,
Make connections between the words and definitions.,
Write in shaving cream.,
Create new sentences.",How to Study Vocabulary Words2," If you're only studying a small number of words, write them down in a vertical list. Write the definition on the same line as each word, on the opposite side of the page. Test yourself by covering the definitions with a folder or book. Read each word aloud and say the definition, then slide the folder down to see whether you got it right.

, Write or type the word and the definition as many times as you can. The muscle memory will help this stick, but keep in mind that this won't help your pronunciation or ability to use the word in a sentence.

, If you're learning a foreign language, write the name of household objects on a sticky note, in that language. Over the next few days or weeks, say the name aloud each time you see or use that object.


Every once in a while, take down the labels you no longer need and put more labels on other objects.

, You'll find it easier to remember a word if you connect it to something else in your mind. It doesn't matter how silly it is; you can use anything that will make you think of the definition.


For example, the word ""thespian"" means ""actor."" Think of an actor asked to play a spy, doing ""the spying'.""
This works for foreign languages as well, especially ones closely related to your own language. For example, the Spanish word ""cine"" means ""movie theater,"" just like ""cinema"" in English.

, Write the word and definition on a chalk board by dragging your finger through a layer of shaving cream. Wipe the surface flat again and try to write it from memory. Repeat many times.


This is mostly useful for teaching someone else, but the physical sensation may help some people learn.

, Write five sentences for each vocabulary word you're having trouble with. You'll get used to using it in a sentence and thus will be more likely to remember the word.


If you need to memorize words in a certain order, write a story that uses the words in that order.

Understand the stages of remembering something.,
Retrace your steps.,
Reconstruct your train of thought.,
Recreate the original environmental cues.,
Think and/or talk about something else that's not related.,
Relax.",How to Remember Something That You Forgot1," In order for you to be able to remember something, your brain needs to go through three stages: acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval (sometimes known as recall).If something goes wrong in one of these stages, it will be difficult to remember what you want to remember.


In the acquisition stage, information that you’ve just learned is stored in your short-term memory before either being discarded or encoded as long-term memory. If you’re not paying attention to something, such as where you put your glasses down before leaving the room, you’re very likely to forget their location when you come back.
In the consolidation stage, information that you’ve learned is transferred into long-term memory. This is more likely to happen if this information relates to other long-term memories of yours, is meaningful in some way (related to historical or important events), or has a strong sensory impression connected to it.
In the retrieval stage, information stored in your memory is retrieved by activating the neuronal pattern used to store it. This stage is often where the feeling of having something “on the tip of your tongue” occurs, and there are some things you can do to prompt this stage.;
, Research has found that a lot of memory is “context-dependent,” meaning people are better at remembering information in an environment that matches the environment in which that information was learned.For example, if you thought of something in the living room and forgot it by the time you got to the kitchen, try going back to the living room. It’s likely the return to a familiar context will help you retrieve the forgotten information.

, If you can’t physically go back to the place you were when you had the thought you’ve now forgotten, try imagining where you were, what you were doing, and how your thoughts connected to each other. Because many memories are stored along overlapping neuronal patterns, reconstructing your train of thought may help retrieve the forgotten thought by stimulating related ideas., For example, if you were listening to a particular song or browsing a particular webpage when you had the thought you’ve forgotten, bringing up that information again will likely help you retrieve the information you forgot., Because your brain stores so much information along overlapping neuronal patterns, it can be easy to get stuck retrieving related but “wrong” information, such as all of the other actors who played Batman, but not the one you’re thinking of. Thinking about something else can help “reset” your retrieval., Anxiety can make it difficult to remember even simple information. If you are having a hard time remembering something, don’t get worked up over it; try taking a few deep breaths to calm yourself and then try to think of the information."

Download two versions of the song.,
Sing a section with the artist.,
Sing along with the musical track.",How to Remember Song Lyrics1," When you sing along with an artist, you rely on their vocal cues to lead you from one verse to the next. This crutch prevents you from learning and retaining the lyrics.This becomes problematic when you perform live and the cues are gone. One way to overcome this obstacle and memorize the lyrics is to sing along with the original track (on which the artist is singing) and the backing (instrumental) track. Ideally, the two tracks you download will be the same version of the song., While you’re driving around town or working around the house, turn on the original track. Sing the first section of the song with the artist. Press pause.

, Switch to the backing track. Sing the same section of the song without the artist’s cues. Press pause. Take a moment to assess how well you know the lyrics. If you nailed every word, move on to the next section. If you fumbled your way through the section, continue switching back and forth between the two tracks until you have learned and retained the lyrics. Once you are comfortable with a section, move on to the next. Continue this process until you have learned the entire song."

Create “distinctive cues” when you want to remember something.,
Connect memories to a specific place.,
Repeat the information immediately.,
Create a “memory palace.” Memory palaces are a common mnemonic technique used to create connections between information and environmental contexts -- in this case, though, those contexts are all in your imagination.,
Avoid learning in high-stress situations.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Drink water.",How to Remember Something That You Forgot2," You’re more likely to encode information it into long-term memory if it is associated with distinctive information that can serve as a “cue,” or starting place. Anything can serve as a cue, but actively relating new information to things you already remember is a good strategy.For example, if you have a conversation with a friend at the coffee shop and she tells you about her upcoming birthday, try connecting the memory of the conversation to something you already remember well: “Melissa told me her birthday was on June 7. That’s just a week after my mom’s birthday.”
These cues can also be sensory information. For example, smells can trigger vivid memories in many people, like the smell of baking cookies reminding you of days spent at your grandmother’s house.If the memory is possibly connected to a smell -- in this example, maybe the smell of coffee or cinnamon rolls from the coffee shop -- try stimulating your memory with a whiff of the familiar odor.

, Memory is strongly tied to the environmental contexts in which the information is originally learned.You can purposefully use this connection to help you encode information for retrieval later.


For example, verbally connect the information you want to remember to the place: “When we met at that new coffee shop on Main Street, Melissa told me her birthday was on June 7.”

, If, like many people, you forget names almost as soon as you’ve been introduced to someone new, try verbally repeating that information as soon as you get it. Connecting it to as many cues as possible -- what they look like, what they were wearing, where you are -- will also help you remember it later.For example, if you’re at a party and a friend introduces you to someone named Masako, look directly at them as you smile, shake their hand, and say, “It’s nice to meet you, Masako. That shirt is such a pretty shade of blue!” Reinforcing all of this sensory information at once may help you encode the memory for later.

, Even the famed (if fictional) detective Sherlock Holmes uses this technique!This technique takes some practice to perfect, but it can be very helpful for storing information that you want to remember because it emphasizes forming creative, even absurd connections between places and memories.

, This isn’t always an option, but if you can avoid learning new information under high-stress conditions -- for example, the wee hours of the morning before a huge exam -- your ability to recall those memories later will likely be improved., Sleep -- especially REM (“rapid-eye-movement”) sleep -- is crucial in processing, consolidating, and storing information. Sleep deprivation affects the firing of your neurons, making it harder to encode and retrieve information., Do something different, believe you are helping yourself and you will remember it.

Interpret the song’s meaning.,
Associate the lyrics with images or memories.,
Define any unknown words.",How to Remember Song Lyrics2," While you’re learning a song, devote time to analyzing the lyrics. Do your best to understand the meaning behind the words and phrases. This will not only improve your performance, but it will also enhance your connection to the song and increase the likelihood that you will remember the lyrics. As you sing, you will be able to visualize yourself in the situation the artist is describing.


For example, analyze the song “Bad Blood” by Taylor Swift. The song is about a friend’s betrayal. In the song, Taylor experiences a wide range of emotions including anger, spite, loss, nostalgia., As you study the lyrics, search for a personal connection to the song. Your mind may wander to times you were in a similar situation to what the artist is describing. Perhaps a phrase brings a comical image to your mind. Use these personal memories and images to create a mental map of the song. While you sing the song, use this mental map to guide you from one line to the next.For example, the song “Bad Blood” may conjure up memories of an irreconcilable friendship.

, As you learn the song, you may come across words that are unfamiliar to you. Take the time to look up the definition of these words. Understanding a word’s meaning may unlock the meaning of the song.


For example, in the song “My Shot” by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hercules Mulligan raps: “And I got y’all knuckleheads in loco parentis.” The phrase “in loco parentis” is Latin. It means “in the place of a parent.”
If the song is in a foreign language, consider looking up the correct pronunciation of a word too."
"
Write down the lyrics as you listen to the song.,
Copy the lyrics off of a sheet of paper.,
Write or type the lyrics as you sing them.",How to Remember Song Lyrics3," Sit down with a piece of paper, a pen, and the listening device of your choice. As you listen to the artist’s original track, write down the lyrics. You may wish to pause the song every so often so you can keep up., Print out the lyrics or pull them up on a tablet, computer, or phone. Copy the lyrics onto a separate piece of paper. As you feel more confident, flip the lyrics over and try to write them down from memory.


You could add doodles and drawings too. Connecting the lyrics to drawings may help you remember the words better., After you’ve practiced the song for a while, remove the prompts and test your memory. While you sing or hum the song, try to write out the lyrics. Again, you may need to take pauses to catch up or slow down the song to keep up."
"
Train your brain.,
Exercise regularly.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Remember Song Lyrics4," Throughout your life, your brain has the potential to develop new neurological pathways. When your brain grows, your ability to comprehend and retain new information, like song lyrics, improves. This growth occurs when you challenge yourself.


Pick-up a new activity, hobby, or game.
Choose to complete tasks that will challenge you.
Find a skill that you can master over time.
Increase the likelihood of continuing to challenge yourself by rewarding yourself as you learn new skills., Physical activity is extremely beneficial to your brain. When you work out, your brain receives more oxygen, reducing your risk of memory loss disorders. As you physically exert yourself, your body releases endorphins, riding the bran of hazardous stress hormones. Lastly, exercise is also mentally stimulating and generates new neurological pathways.


Try a sport that requires hand-eye coordination, like tennis.
Use exercise as your afternoon pick-me-up instead of caffeine., As you sleep, your brain consolidates memories. When you cut your sleep short, you shortchange these memory consolidation process. A lack of sleep can also reduce your ability to think critically, solve problems, and remember information. You can improve your sleep (and your memory) by:


Sticking to a regular sleep schedule
Stop looking at screens one hour before bed
Reduce your caffeine intake"

Try Roy G Biv.,
Use the Richard of York Device.,
Invent your own mnemonic device.",How to Remember the Colors of the Rainbow1," Try to remember the name of an imaginary person called Roy G. Biv. The letters in this name correspond to the order of the colors of the rainbow. The letters break down like this:R stands for Red

O stands for Orange

Y stands for Yellow

G stands for Green

B stands for Blue

I stands for Indigo

V stands for Violet.;
, If you struggle to remember Roy G. Biv, try remembering the sentence ""Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain."" The first letter of each word in the sentence corresponds to a color of a rainbow. Try repeating this sentence to yourself if you're struggling to remember the rainbow's colors., If you have trouble remembering established mnemonic devices, try inventing your own. A mnemonic device that's reflects your personal interests may be more meaningful to you than other devices. Pick a sentence that where the first words starts with R, the second starts with O, the third starts with Y, and so on.


For example, if you're interested in video games you can use the phrase ""Really Offensive YouTube Games Built Into Videos.""

Be calm.,
Recreate the environment you were in when you first had the thought, learned the information, or last had the item you lost.,
Close your eyes.",How to Remember Something1," Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and relax. Your anxiety about being unable to remember something might actually prevent you from remembering it.Frustration, panic, or beating yourself up over your ""bad"" memory diverts mental energy from your goal.


Sometimes calming down requires you to walk away and do something else. Take a five-minute break to talk to someone, watch tv, or work on another task.;
, When you had that great idea in the shower, the idea was recorded in your brain along with the context, or environment (in this case, the shower). That idea is now connected to your memories of the shower--the smell of your shampoo, the feel and sound of the water--and putting yourself back in that same environment might also lead you to the forgotten piece of information., A recent study suggests that closing your eyes can enhance your ability to recall information.This may be because you are eliminating distractions and can better focus on the memory and its details.

Pay attention.,
Confirm a new contact's name.,
Repeat the name frequently during your conversation.,
Create a mental image of the name.,
Use a prominent physical feature to help remember the name.,
Associate the name with the things you learn about the new contact during your conversation.,
Create a play on words.,
Visualize the contact's name written on his forehead.,
Write down the name as soon as possible.,
Believe you can remember names during networking events.",How to Remember Names During Networking Events," Listen carefully to the new contact's name. If you don't focus on the other person, it is likely you won't remember his or her name. Pay attention, listen for the name, blank out other distractions and concentrate on the person to whom you are being introduced.


Avoid planning or thinking about what you are going to say next during introductions. Often times, people don't remember names because they are too distracted by their own role in the conversation, rather than focusing on the person with whom they are conversing.;
, After hearing the new contact's name, confirm that you have heard it correctly. Verify the name by saying it back to the person. If it is an unusual name, ask the contact to spell it for you or inquire about the name's history or significance.


Ask for the contact to repeat his or her name if you didn't catch it the first time. This shows a new contact that you are truly interested in learning her name and desire to address her correctly.
Ask the person what name he prefers to be called. Only ask this of contacts who did not introduce themselves directly to you. For example, you may meet someone at a networking event who is wearing a name tag. If so, read the name tag and inquire about what name he prefers to be called. A name tag may say ""Matthew Smith,"" but the contact may actually prefer to be called Matt.

, Repeating a name helps you to remember it. Cement the name into your memory by using it 3 to 5 times during the conversation. Repeat the name to yourself as soon as you have been introduced. Repeat the name back to the new contact using a phrase like ""So nice to meet you, Scott."" Be sure to repeat the name again when you depart from the conversation with a phrase like ""Scott, it was great talking with you. Look forward to seeing you again.""

, Convert the name into an image that helps you remember it.


Connect the person's name with a famous person. If a contact's name is Fred, think of Fred Flintstone or Fred Astaire. If the contact's name is Barbara, picture Barbara Walters conducting an interview.
Connect the person's name to a visual object that helps you remember it. For example, the name Jack might conjure up images of a Jack in a Box. Images like this are not only entertaining, but they help you to remember names.

, Associate the name with a physical feature, preferably on their face. For example, a woman named Lisa may be wearing a dark shade of lipstick. Associate Lisa with lips, and exaggerate the image in your mind to help you remember it.

, As you talk to the new contact, listen for triggers about work, interests or hobbies that will help you remember the name. Perhaps a man named Frank sells flashlights or a woman named Sarah enjoys soccer.


Connect the name to feelings or character observations made during the conversation. If the contact has a loud voice, associate the name with the word loud. If the contact is pushy or insistent about a topic, associate the name with the word pushy. If the contact has a hard time making eye contact, associate the name with the word shy. For example, the shy girl named Penny is now cemented as Shy Penny in your memory.

, Mnemonic devices and alliteration are effective tools used to remember names during networking events.


Associate a rhyme with the new contact. For example, you might remember Bill, who works in the pharmaceutical industry, with a mnemonic device like Bill sells pills. Or perhaps you meet a woman named Trish who enjoys fishing, so you remember her name with the phrase Trish likes to fish.
Use alliteration to help remember a new contact's name. Create alliteration cues like Mary from Mississippi or Ingrid who sells insurance to help you recall and remember names.

, By imaging the name written on the contact's forehead, you see the name in your mind, which helps you to remember it. Take the memory exercise one step further and imagine the name written in a colored marker on the forehead.

, It is not always practical to write down someone's name immediately after meeting them. If you can't write the name on a piece of paper, mimic the writing movement by moving your fingers as if you are writing the name. In this way, you can ""write"" the name on the inside of your hand or along the outside of your leg as you are speaking to a new contact to help you memorize the name.

, The ability to remember names is a conscious decision. If you think you can remember names, you will. If you don't think you can, you won't. Think positively about your ability to remember names and don't allow yourself to make excuses for forgetting names.

Use your visual memory.,
Write out the colors.,
Memorize the colors in chunks.",How to Remember the Colors of the Rainbow2," If you establish a visual memory linked to the colors of the rainbow, this can help. If you're a more visual learner by nature, a visual memory may help you remember the colors of the rainbow. Try to think of a distinct image associated with each color.For example, as red is the first color of the rainbow, try imaging a group of runners in a race. The runner with red hair can be finishing first.
If you need to remember orange is followed by yellow, you can imagine an orange cat being followed by a lighter, yellow cat.
Keep going through the colors of the rainbow, creating visual associations for each color.

, Simple repetition is often key to memory. Try getting a pen and paper and writing down the colors of the rainbow over and over again. This will help you commit the colors to memory.Pay attention while you're writing as this will be most effective. As you write down the colors of the rainbow, say the colors to yourself and be aware of what you're writing.

, It can be hard to memorize information all at once. If you're struggling to remember all the colors of the rainbow, break it into chunks. For example, you can remember red, orange, yellow. From there, try to remember blue, green, indigo, and violet.If you prefer, you can also do smaller chunks. For example, remember red and orange, then blue and indigo, and so on.
You can use other memory techniques to remember your chunks. For example, you can think of a mnemonic device for ""red, orange, yellow"" or try writing these words down over and over again.

"
"
Try to foster an interest in the colors of the rainbow.,
Study the colors in the afternoon.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Remember the Colors of the Rainbow3," You're likely to better remember information that interests you. If you're trying to remember the colors of a rainbow for a test, try reading up on rainbows. Learn about how a rainbow is formed, how long they last, what conditions can cause a rainbow, and so forth. If you're interested in rainbows, it may be more interesting to remember the colors of the rainbow., Some studies suggest people study more effectively in the afternoon. Even if you see yourself as strictly a morning or night person, try studying in the afternoon if you're struggling. You may find you will recall the colors better., If you're memorizing the colors of the rainbow for a test, get enough sleep in the days leading up to the test. Quality sleep can affect your memory and concentration. In addition to helping you remember the colors of the rainbow, solid sleep can help you recall other information for your test as well."
"
Stop and listen.,
Repeat the person's name at least twice.,
Make a visual association.",How to Remember Something2," The reason you forget names isn't because you are ""bad with names,"" it's because you aren't fully listening. You may be so excited or nervous about meeting the person or worried about making a good impression that your brain isn't processing the important information: their name.Push aside any other thoughts, face the person squarely, look them in the eye, and listen. Make remembering this person's name your number one priority in the moment., Repetition will help cement this information in your memory, as it strengthens the neural connections in your brain.After the person says his name, repeat it back to him, confirming you heard it correctly. This can be especially helpful with names that are difficult to pronounce.
Repeat the person's name once more, saying something like ""It's nice to meet you, Bob.""
As you walk away, repeat the person's name in your head.

, Your brain has an incredible capacity for storing visual information, and creating a link between a person's name and a visual cue will make it much easier to remember.For example, if you meet someone named Bill and he has very blue eyes, visualize a blue dollar bill."
"
Set a reminder in your smart phone.,
Create an unusual association.,
Repeat yourself.,
Write yourself a sticky note and place it somewhere obvious.",How to Remember Something3," As soon as you make your doctor's appointment, take out your phone and put it in the calendar. Most phones will allow you to set up an alarm reminding you that your appointment is coming up--five minutes, an hour, even a day or a week ahead of time. They key is to set the reminder the moment you make the appointment (or learn someone's birthday).


You can set up recurring reminders, too. So if you have to pick up your little sister after tennis practice every Tuesday, you can set up a reminder that will go off every week.

, Have you ever heard of someone tying a piece of string around their finger so they won't forget something? The idea is that the string around their finger is so odd that it will remind the person of what they are trying to remember.You can make associations in all kinds of ways--the more out of the ordinary, the better. If you need to do something on your computer, place something unusual on the keyboard (like a toy boat or banana) so you remember you're going online to pay your bills, not to look at cute cat pictures.

, If you are going into the bedroom to get your medication, quietly chant ""medication"" to yourself as you head toward the bedroom. Repeating the thought or idea keeps it active in your short-term memory (which normally holds information for only 10-15 seconds). This will help you avoid the problem of walking into a room and then wondering, ""now, why did I come in here?""The more you access a thought or ""use"" it, more likely it will end up in your long-term memory, which can store information indefinitely.Singing about your task can also help you remember. Pick a simple tune like ""Twinkle, Twinkle"" or one of your favorite songs, and sing about how you're going to take your medication.

, Always forgetting your wallet? Write ""WALLET"" on a sticky note and place it square in the middle of your door.Try this method when you need to accomplish something on your computer--the distractions on a computer are so numerous, it's easy to get side-tracked. Put the sticky note on your computer screen, and then move it to the edge as a reminder to stay on-task.

Create a study environment similar the one in which you will have to recall the information later.,
Try chunking information.,
Use a mnemonic device to memorize information.,
Break up your study sessions.,
Summarize each paragraph in the margin of your book.",How to Remember Something4," If you are studying for a test that will be held in a quiet room with a ticking clock, it will be easier to recall the information if you study in a similar environment, like a library or study-hall.Try not to study on the couch or sitting on your bed, since you will probably be taking the test at a desk.

, This means you break a piece of information, like the number 8374668809, into smaller chunks: 834 466 8809. You can better remember the information in smaller groups than as one long sequence, or by each individual piece of information.Identify the larger similarities in the information you are trying to memorize--like a significant date or location--and categorize the remaining information under these headings., Mnemonic devices are tricks used to organize information into easy to remember statements, images, or words. A common mnemonic device is Every Good Boy Does Fine, which presents the musical notes on a treble clef (EGBDF) in a simple statement.


There are almost limitless ways to come up with mnemonic devices. Try making up rhymes, creating acronyms, or an easy to recall visual image.

, Instead of a single marathon cramming session, which can exhaust your brain, schedule yourself for two study sessions with a break in between. You can learn twice as much information in two three-hour study sessions than you can in one six-hour study session., Just reading the information isn't always enough--you need to make sense of it, too.Summarizing requires you to think about what you've just read, distill it to the essentials, and re-learn it.When you've finished reading, try to look at the subject from the broadest perspective (this is a book about history) and then keep narrowing it down (this a chapter about World War II; this is a section about the Battle of the Bulge) until you are examining the important lessons, themes, and facts you should take away (this was the last great German offensive, the massive casualties destroyed the German Army).If you don't want to mark your text book, summarize each paragraph in a notebook. You can even rip this page out and carry it in your pocket to study on-the-go.

Exercise your body with aerobic (cardiovascular) activity.,
Be social.,
Seek out new experiences.,
Get some sleep.,
Create a striking mental image.",How to Remember Something5," Walking, running, jumping on a trampoline--whatever gets your heart rate up will also get your brain in top form. One reason is that the exercise brings nutrient-rich oxygen to your brain, which helps your brain work better.Studies show that the effects of exercise on the brain are cumulative. That is, if you work out regularly, you will see better results than if you work out only occasionally., People usually immediately think of doing Sudoku or Crossword puzzles to keep their brains sharp, but these ""brain exercises"" are actually less efficient at challenging your brain than carrying on a conversation. A conversation forces you to listen, absorb information, and process it in order to form a response., The more often you do something, the less challenging it becomes. If you can decorate a cake without even thinking about it, it is requiring very little from your brain. To exercise and grow your mental abilities, you must push your brain.Make sure you are genuinely interested in these new activities. Faking interest isn't going to challenge your brain., Our brains are encoding (or forming memories) during our waking hours and are vulnerable to all sorts of distractions. Until your brain turns that new information into a long-term memory, those everyday distractions can lead to the loss of the information. Sleep is the perfect environment for your brain to process and turn your new memories into long-term information.Napping between study sessions is a good way to let your brain absorb everything you just learned.

, If you are always forgetting where you put your keys, try this trick: the next time you set them down, notice where you have placed them, and then picture them exploding.This trick takes advantage of our brain's ability to retain tons of visual information.

Create a mnemonic.,
Put the list to a song.,
Create a linking system.,
Put the list into chunks.",How to Remember Long Lists1," A mnemonic is a device used to remember lists in a creative and catchy way. One of the most common forms is by creating a word mnemonic. To create a word mnemonic, you use the first letter of each word on your list and create a new separate word or phrase. The aim of creating a mnemonic is to make it memorable so you can have an easier time at recalling the list when you need it. Mnemonics can be used for any type of list, ranging from remembering the order of the planets of the solar system to recalling the order of the operations of math, as other common lists we need to know. Here are some common examples that are used:


For the order of math operations, the common approach is the mnemonic, Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiply, Divide, Addition, and Subtraction.For remembering the bones in the wrist, a common mnemonic is, Never Lick Tilly’s Popsicle, Mother Might Come Home. Navicular, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Multongular, Multongular, Capitate, Hamate. Another form of mnemonic is called an expression mnemonic. It works similar to the word mnemonic only you arrange the letters to remember the order of the list. For example to remember the order of the solar system from the sun outward, we use: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.;
, Creating a catchy jingle is an effective way to recall information. Maybe you have a favorite song or tune that goes perfectly with a list that you need to remember.


Popular lists that are connected to a song are the ABC’s and the “50 Nifty United States” song to recall the order of states., Using visuals to link different objects in a list helps you connect each item as you recall them. If you can think of powerful, creative visuals to associate with each image, you have a better chance at remembering your list.


For example, take four items you need to remember. The list is as follows: a pencil, a wallet, a candle, and a bracelet. Next, link each object to the next in a creative and visual way.
Link the pencil to the wallet. Think of the pencil looking in a wallet.
Link the wallet to the candle. Think of the wallet sitting on top of the candle.
Link the candle to the bracelet. Think of the candle wearing a bracelet.
Link the bracelet to the flower. Think of a bracelet holding a flower.
This type of strategy may be used for longer lists as well. Just keep thinking of different images to help you remember each item on the list.

, Creating smaller groups of information is a good way to remember a long list, especially with numbers. This is generally referred to as “chunking” which means taking a long list and trying to remember the list by thinking about it in smaller bits. By breaking the list up into smaller chunks, you can have an easier time at committing the list to memory instead of trying to memorize the entire list at one time.One common form of chunking is with telephone numbers. A new telephone number is often provided in a group of seven or ten numbers (depending on if you need to recall the area code). For example, if the telephone number is 1237894563, breaking it up in chunks will allow you to recall it more easily than trying to recall the numbers in a long sequence. Grouping it in a chunk, 123-789-4563, will help you remember it better."

Listen to a fifty states song.,
Make a list of states to help you learn the song.,
Use a phrase instead.,
Find someone else to test you.,
Use an online quiz.,
Use similar sounds to remember difficult names.",How to Remember All 50 States of USA1," You can find many songs online that sing all fifty states in alphabetical order. This video uses a rhyming song, which might be easier to learn. Try this song instead if you just want a song without a video, or if you like the tune more. Listen to the song several times and try to sing along.;
, Find a list of states online, or print out a copy. Look away from the list and try to sing the song yourself. Whenever you get stuck, look back at the list and find the name of the next state. Look away again and try to sing the next part of the song.


Listen to the song again if you get completely stuck.

, If the songs aren't helping, try a phrase that helps your memory instead. Here's a phrase that lists the first letter of each state: US PVC WOK MACHINING DATA 7M5N FAILS WW I TV WORK CON. Look at the full list of states in this order. Repeat this phrase to yourself many times, then try to write down the states in this order.


In this phrase, ""7M5N"" means ""list 7 states starting with M and 5 states starting with N"".
PVC is a kind of plastic, and WWI is short for ""World War One."" (If you know what the words mean, you're more likely to remember the phrase.)
These are called ""mnemonic devices"" (pronounced ""neh-mawn-ick""), meaning ""memory helpers.""

, Hand the list of states to a family member or friend. Sing the song or recite the state names while the other person looks at the list. Ask the other person to stop you if you miss a state.

, An online quiz will teach you to spell all fifty states to, since you have to type the name in correctly for it to count. Try naming as many as you can in ten minutes. Once you can do that, try it in five minutes.

, Once you can name most of the states, use this trick to remember the names you keep getting stuck at. Find a phrase you know that sounds like part of the state name. For instance, ""Swing-and-a-Miss-issippi"" or ""I-ow-a- dollar to my brother"" (""I owe a dollar""). Chant these phrases, or include the whole phrase in your song or spoken list of states to help you remember them.

Don't multitask.,
Avoid external distractions.,
Avoid internal distractions.,
Study in the afternoon.,
Summarize each paragraph in the margins.,
Write things over and over.",How to Remember Anything1," Concentration is incredibly important for retaining your memory.You need to keep things simple. This is why you enter a room and forget why you came in. It's because you were probably planning your party at the same time, or thinking about the TV episode that you just watched and you weren't concentrating.


When you're studying and trying to remember things for school, then focus on that one task.Don't think about that friend's party from the weekend. Don't try to do a bunch of different tasks at the same time, or you won't get the full benefit from any of them.;
, Get away from your typical surroundings that make demands on your time, when you need to study. This means leaving your house, your family, your friends, your pets, your TV while you're studying.


Find a specific place to study and don't do other things while you're there (like pay your bills, do leisure activities, etc.). Make sure that you only study when you're in that place, as it will help your brain get into the studying mode.
Choose an area that has good ventilation and light so that you are more likely to stay awake and not get distracted.
If you do find that you can't work and that you're not retaining anything, take a short break (not too long and don't do anything that will start consuming your time like going on the internet). Go for a short walk, or get a drink.

, Sometimes the distractions don't come from your friends or family, but come from your own brain. Often when you're reading something for school you find that your brain hasn't been on the material, but instead has been thinking about that party you're going to or wondering whether you've paid your electricity bill.Keep a specific notebook for these distracting thoughts. If it's a thought that requires later attention (like paying your electricity bill), jot that thought down and dismiss it from your mind so you can work.
Make the distraction a reward. Tell yourself that once you have finished reading (and understanding and remembering) this next section, you'll take a break to deal with the thoughts, or daydreams.

, Studies have shown that the time of day correlates strongly to how well people remember things when they're studying. Even if you think of yourself as a morning person or a night person, try to do the most important of your studying in the afternoon. You'll recall the information better.

, If you're reading something that you need to remember, write a short summary of each paragraph in the margins. Writing things over again not only helps keep things in your memory better, but it will also serve as a memory jog when you're looking over your notes and readings for that test (or even for class).


Write down the main points from each things you're reading, so that you can jog your memory when you need to and to show that you read and comprehended what you were reading/studying.

, Writing things down a bunch of times helps cement things in your memory, especially those peskier ones like dates and vocabulary words for foreign languages. The more you write them down the more they'll stick in your brain.

Look for shapes within your number.,
Choose related images for difficult digits.,
Create a mental picture using all the images.,
Decode the images when you need the number.",How to Remember Long Numbers1," Part of what makes numbers difficult to remember is that they are symbols that don't actually correspond in any way with the quantity of things they represent. You can get around this by trying to create mental images based on the shapes of the digits.


For example, you might decide that the shape of the number 2 reminds you of a duck. You can then remember 2 as ""duck."" Number 10 might look like a knife next to a plate, so you could remember 10 as ""knife and plate.""It doesn't actually matter which images you choose to associate with which numbers, as long as they are memorable for you.;
, Some numbers might not translate well into pictures for you. In such cases, associate an image with the number that relates to the number in some other way.For example, maybe you've decided that the number 21 just doesn't look like anything to you. The number 21, however, is notable as the age at which one can legally purchase alcohol. So you might imagine a bottle of wine or beer.

, Next, put all these images together to form a single mental picture. Set the images up in your mind so you can read them from left to right like you would an ordinary number.


Using the examples above, if you wanted to memorize the number 21021, you might imagine a duck (2), pecking food off of plate with a knife laying to the left of it (10) and a bottle of beer on the right (21). Alternatively, you could imagine a plate of food with bottles of beer on each side: 21, 0, 21.

, When you need to use the number, simply call the mental picture to mind, and decode your image back into numbers.

Try making a little notice board (perhaps better in your own room).
Sometimes things like email programs will have a calendar that you can mark important dates in, like birthdays. They will send you an email notice within 10 days so you can get a present.;
, Choose people you know are good at remembering things.


If it's something like a release date of an album, then ask a friend or relative who just happens to be a fan of that certain thing.

, If it's vital you shouldn't really forget, (it's probably impossible to forget exciting things) but if you do, have many backup plans. If it's minor, then have one or two reminders.

, Action or movement can help you to recall things, as your body remembers, even if your mind is a little rusty.

, Write a song to help you remember important information! This works great with locker combinations, passwords, PINs, etc. If you learn a song, you'll tend to sing it, and thereby be reminded whilst singing!

, If you are trying to remember a specific maths formula, write it down! Taking notes in class will help you to better remember the material because you're using both your body and your mind in unison. It's also easier to recall where you were when you first learned the concept, making it easier to recall the concept too.

, Using your other senses can help you to better remember, recreating a full picture in your mind. For some people, the other senses may be more reliable than just using sight, reading or writing.

, If you are trying to remember the names of people, a good strategy really is writing their names in small script on your palm. As long as you aren't constantly looking down, this should work.

, During this short period of time, you will get bored and since you have nothing better to do you will look around and read the note. This is particularly effective since people go to the bathroom several times a day.

, Use it to record things you need to remember and ideas you've had. All you need to remember then is your phone.

, If you happen to remember something, like if you have to put a book in your backpack, then do it at that moment, because you will forget later.

Write down your list, repeatedly.,
Try the memory palace technique.,
Become interested in your list.",How to Remember Long Lists2," Doing things in a repetitive manner can help you recall information.Writing things down not only helps you learn the material, but you can remember the things you write if you do so in an organized and effective manner.A common method of organized writing is by the use of note cards. For example, if you are being tested on the list of elements on the Periodic Table, you could write the element symbol on the front of the card, and its name on the back. After you’ve written each element down, go back and write them again. Once you feel like you have a good grasp of the list, start flipping through the cards as many times as you need to help you memorize the list.

, A fun and creative way to remember a long list is picturing the items in a familiar building. You can picture your house, school, office, or any other physical building with separate rooms. Depending on the number of items you want to remember, you can imagine a one-room apartment (with few rooms) or a castle (with multiple rooms).If you have a long list to remember, such as a shopping list, picturing your home would be fine. For example, imagine that you live in a house. You have five rooms. There are two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen.
You have a shopping list composed of: shoes, pants, socks, shirts, and a jacket. Picture your list of items in each of your rooms. Once you think of the rooms in your house, start visually placing all the items from your list in a different room.
You walk in the front door and stand in the entrance. To your left is the living room where you see dirty shoes on the couch.
You turn to your right and there is the dining room. Draped across the chandelier is your nice pair of pants.
You walk through the dining room and enter the kitchen. There lying on the toaster is a pair of socks.
You leave the kitchen and walk down the hallway to the first bedroom. As you peek into the bedroom, you notice your sweater hanging from the fan.
You decide to keep exploring. Next is the bathroom. You see a jacket taking a bath in the tub.
You keep walking and come to the second room. You see a jacket hanging out the window, as though trying to make an escape.
Try it out. After you’ve imagined going through the house a couple times, picturing the different items scattered about the house, check your memory and see if you can remember everything on your list.

, While some lists are fun, such as a shopping list for a party, some lists can be kind or boring or mundane. The more interested you are in your list, the better chance you have at recalling the information when you need to.For example, a list of chores can be pretty boring. Make it interesting by rewarding yourself at completion. You not only will remember the list of things you have to get done, but you will become interested in completing them as quickly as possible.

Give your brain a workout.,
Exercise.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Remember Long Lists3," As you get older, your brain's capacity to remember things decreases over time. Your brain stays intact, it just has a difficult time at recalling easy information.One way you can improve your brain's ability to recall and build your memory is by exercising your brain muscles through challenges and stimulation.


Word games such as Sudoku and cross word puzzles are a good way to challenge your brain muscles. They require you to think critically and keep you engaged in the activity.Always aim to do something new and exciting. Doing activities that you are used to doing, will not help with building memory. If you play a musical instrument, try to learn a new piece, instead of always playing the one you know from memory., Getting physical exercise improves your memory skills because it helps boost the oxygen intake that your brain gets. Exercise not only aids with keeping your brain sharp, it also reduces your risks of memory loss disorders, such as diabetes and heart disease.Exercises that implement focus to detail or complex motor skills are beneficial to improving your memory, such as planks or burpees.Doing cardiovascular exercises, such as running and biking, for 20 to 30 minutes a day can help your brain remember things more often.Taking little exercise breaks while studying or working is also an effective way to give your brain a jumpstart if you’re feeling tired and unable to focus., Sleeping helps your brain with memory conciliation. Aim to get your required number of hours of sleep every night, as the most vital time your brain is working on memory enhancement is during the deep stage of the sleep cycle."

Watch a video listing all the states on a map.,
Test yourself on a blank map.,
Use an online quiz.,
Invent ""links"" between states when you're having trouble.,
Focus on a specific section of the map.",How to Remember All 50 States of USA2," Try out this video for a short song version. If you like learning through pictures or stories as well as song, watch this video instead.

, Find a map of the United States that has the borders of the states drawn in, but not the names. Print out several copies from an online map if you don't have a paper handout. Try to write all the state names in order of their location on the map, or using the order you learned from a video or your teacher. Check how many you got right using an atlas or an online picture. Cross out the names you got wrong, and write in the correct ones.

, An online quiz can be great for helping you remember the position of each state separately, without having to repeat a long list every time. Try this quiz, which lets you choose the difficulty (""study"", ""test"", or ""strict test""). Read the question, then click on the part of the picture where you think that state is.

, If you keep forgetting the name of a state, try linking it to a state you do remember next to it. The more creative and ridiculous the ""link"" you invent, the more likely you are to remember it.For example:


Think of ""Washing dishes with oregano"" to remember that Washington is next to Oregon.
Repeat ""The O.K. Llama pokes the textbook"" to remember that Oklahoma looks like a finger jutting out to poke Texas.

, If there are groups of states you keep having trouble with, ignore the parts of the map you already know. Print out several copies of the blank map, and try to label only that difficult section of the map. Keep checking and correcting yourself, and repeat the task until you've got it. Do this for every difficult section, practice with the whole map a few more times, and you can get a great score on your geography test.

Use mnemonic devices.,
Use word association.,
Visualize.,
Make up stories.,
Change the position of a household object.",How to Remember Anything2," Certain things are hard to do through an association or visualization technique and so you have to use a different memory technique, called mnemonic devices. There are a variety of different devices that you can use. Some work better for certain types of information than others.Make acronyms for things you're trying to remember. Take the first letter of each word and turn it into an acronym that makes sense to you. For example you might do H.O.M.E.S. for the Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).
Mnemonics can be useful for remembering spelling. Make up a little rhyme/nonsense phrase using a word for each letter. For example to remember necessary you might remember 'Never Eat Cake; Eat Salad Sandwiches And Remain Young'.
Make acoustics. This basically is a nonsense phrase that helps you remember the first letter of a sequence of information (this is used a lot for mathematical formulas). For example Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally is used to remember the order of operations: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiply, Divide, Add, Subtract.
You can also make up little poems or rhymes to help you remember important information. For example: ""I before e except after c/ or when sounding like a/ in neighbor and weigh"" helps you remember where e and i go when they're together.

, There are a couple different types of association, but the importance of all the different association methods is that you associate something you already know with something you're trying to remember and what you already knows helps you recall the second part.


Use a funny or odd image to recall a fact that you need to remember. For example, if you're trying to remember JFK's involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion, you might visualize the president swimming in the ocean with a bunch of pigs. While it may seem silly, the association of ocean and pigs will lead you back to JFK and you won't forget.
Number association is associating certain numbers with a mental image. This is partly why so many passwords and codes that people come up with have some sort of meaning to them (like birthday, cat's birthday, anniversary date, etc). So if you're trying to remember your library number (say it's 52190661), you could say May 21, 1990 is your brother's birthday (that takes care of 52190). You could then say that your mother is 66 years old and you've only got one of her (which takes care of the 661). When you're trying to recall the number, visualize your brother and a birthday cake and then visualize your mother.

, If you want to fix something in your memory, make sure that you put a lot of effort into visualization of it. You want to focus on the details. For example, if you're trying to remember a novel, focus on imagining the characters and the scenery in great detail and make sure you have a visual aid that recalls each character, some specific characteristic.

, When you need to remember a string of images (or words, as in a shopping list) come up with a silly little story to remember them. The story fixes the images in your mind, so you can recall them later.For example if you need to remember to get a bananas, bread, eggs, milk, and lettuce from the store, you might make up a story where a banana, a slice of bread, and an egg have to rescue a head of lettuce from a lake of milk. It's a super silly story, but it has all the elements of your list linked together and will help you remember them.

, A great way to help remind yourself to do something is to put something in your house somewhere obvious and out of place. For example, you could put a heavy book in front of your front door to help you remember to turn in your take-home final. When you see the out of place item it will jog your memory.

Exercise your body.,
Exercise your mind.,
Get enough sleep.,
Say things aloud.,
Be observant.,
Eat the right foods.",How to Remember Anything3," There's a huge correlation between mental health and bodily health, so maintaining your body's health and exercising it, will help you maintain your mental health and improve your memory.Walk every day for about 30 minutes. It's a gentle way to get some exercise (and you can do some exploring too!). The benefits of exercise on your mental health will last for a long time.
It's not just walking, there are lots of different ways to exercise and have fun! Try doing yoga, or put on some music and dance.

, Working the mind can help prevent memory loss and can help improve your overall memory. Things that work your brain are the things that make you tired after you've done them, and make you need to take a break. These include: solving math problems, learning to knit, reading dense material.Change things up. You want your brain to keep from getting complacent, so keep learning and trying new things. This will force your brain to keep from going stagnant and will help improve your memory.For example: You could learn a new word everyday, or learn about your countries history. These improve memory and make you more intelligent.
You can also memorize a poem every couple of weeks. It makes for a good (if nerdy) party trick and it will help improve your memory. So get memorizing Beowulf!

, Sleep is incredibly important to improving and maintaining your memory. It's why you shouldn't stay up all night studying for a big test, but do a chunk of studying in the afternoon and then get enough sleep that your brain can process all the information you just shoved into it.


Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, so that your brain can go through all the important stages of sleep and you feel well-rested.
Shut down any electronic devices at least 30 minutes before you go to bed, so that you give your brain time to calm down and prepare for sleep. This means all electronic devices: phone, computer, kindle, etc.

, Saying things aloud that you're trying to remember will help you remember them. If you tend to forget things like whether you've turned the oven off, when you do turn the oven off say out loud ""I turned the oven off."" You'll find that later you'll be better able to remember that you turned the oven off.


Repeat a person's name after you've been introduced to them (although do it in a natural manner). Say ""Hi Anna, it's great to meet you."" This will solidify the connection between the person and their name so it's easier for you to recall later.
You can also do this to remember dates and times and places. For example, if you're invited to something repeat the invitation back to the person who gave it, like ""The Blue Mouse Theater at 6? I can't wait!""

, Of course, even with work, you're not going to be Sherlock Holmes, but training your observational skills will help you a lot in remembering things (people, faces, names, where you put your car keys). It takes to time to build this skill, but it's well worth it in the long run.


Practice this skill by looking closely at a scene (you can do this anywhere: your home, on the bus, at work) and, closing your eyes, trying to recall as many details about the scene as you can.
You can also do this with a photograph, as long as it's an unfamiliar one. Look at it for a for a second or two and then flip it over. try to recall as many of the details as you can remember. Repeat the exercise with a different photograph.

, There are foods that can help boost your memory in the long term. You should be eating them anyway as a part of a healthy diet, but you should definitely be eating them if you want to keep and maintain your memory. You want to go for foods that containing antioxidants (like broccoli, blueberries, or spinach), as well as those with Omega-3 fatty acid (like salmon or almonds).Try to eat 5-6 small meals during the day, instead of three big meals. This will help you avoid dips in blood sugar, which make your brain not function as well. Make sure that you're eating healthy foods.

Associate digits with sounds.,
Memorize your mnemonic system.,
Create words using the sounds.,
Associate images with the words.,
Decode the words when you need the number.",How to Remember Long Numbers2," The number/shape method works fine with shorter numbers, but as numbers start to get longer, it can be difficult to remember what each image was supposed to represent. The phonetic method works by encoding numbers as sounds.


To start, assign a consonant sound or sounds to every digit, zero through nine. For example, you might assign the ""R"" sound to the number 4, since a capital ""R"" looks a bit like a backwards 4.You can assign whichever sounds you want to each digit, as long as you use the same sounds for the same digit every time.
If you don't want to take the time to create your own system, you can use one that's already been created. The Major Memory System has pre-assigned sounds for each digit.Do not assign vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, or u) to any digit. Vowels have no ""value"" in a system like this, as that makes it easier to create words later. ""W,"" ""h,"" and ""y"" are also usually left without a numerical value., This collection of sound associations is called a mnemonic system. Take some time and memorize which sounds correspond to which digits. This will make it easy to encode and decode numbers using this system later.


This may seem daunting, but most people mind they can memorize a mnemonic system in as little as 20 minutes., Next, create words using the sounds assigned to each digit in the number you want to remember. Since vowels have no value, you can add whichever vowels you need to form words.


For example, imagine you need to remember the number 4918217. In the Major Memory System, this would translate to r-b-d/t/th-v/f-n-d/t/th-k/c/g. There are lots of word sequences you could potentially make with these sounds, such as robot (491) fan (82) dog (17).
Choose words that will be easy to visualize. Concrete nouns usually work best.Note that numbers are converted into sounds and not actual letters. The number 95, for example, translates into ""bl"" in the Major Memory System. You could make the words ""ball"" or ""bull"" with those letters, since the double-L sounds the same as a single L.

, Words are typically easier to remember than numbers. You'd probably find ""robot fan dog"" easier to recall than 4918217. But many people find it easier still to create a mental picture using these images.In the case of our example, you could imagine a robot fanning a panting dog on a hot day.

, When you need to use the number, simply decode the words you have created from your numbers.


Early on in using this system, it might be helpful to carry a chart with the numbers and sounds, just until you have it completely memorized.

"
"
Visualize your images in a place.,
Create a story or path with the images.,
Make it vivid and memorable.,
Decode your story when you need the numbers.",How to Remember Long Numbers3," Whether you use the shape method or the phonetic one, many people find it easiest to remember images if they are placed in a story, or spatially in an imagined ""mind palace.""To begin, imagine all your images in one place.


This can be especially helpful with very long numbers.
Any place will do--a house, a park, a sailing ship, whatever you like.

, Create some memorable sequence using these images. This can be done either by making up a story in which each of the images appears, or by imagining walking through the space you have imagined your images in, seeing each image one at a time.


For example, you could come up with a short story like this: ""It was a sweltering hot day. A robot (32) picked up a fan(82). He began to wave it at a panting dog(17) to cool him off."" Note that every concrete noun (man, fan, and dog) corresponds to digits in our number.
Another approach is imagine yourself walking through a space (a ""mind palace"" or ""memory palace"") and seeing each image in sequence.Using this technique, you might imagine a robot opening the door into a hallway where you a greeted by your favorite type of dog. You turn the corner in the hallway and feel the breeze from a large fan spinning on the ceiling above you.

, Make your story or memory palace journey as memorable as possible. Picture details, and make them vivid so they'll stick in your mind. Some people find it helpful to make their story dramatic or even gross.Sticking with our simple example, imagine what the robot looks like. Is it short? Tall? is it metallic or has it been painted some color? Is it boxy and awkward like in an old sci-fi film, or sleek and futuristic? What type of dog is it? What color? What does the fan look like? Imagine the cool breeze of the fan on a hot afternoon.

, Finally, you'll decode your story or journey by breaking it down into words and then breaking those words down into numbers.

Draw a vertical line on a piece of paper.,
Draw a horizontal line.,
Label the top left and top right quadrant.,
Fill out the bottom left and bottom right quadrants.,
Use line tools in computer programs.,
Label two top row, or horizontal, cells on your Excel sheet.,
Begin filling in the column, or vertical, cells underneath each row heading.,
Make a graph.","How to Make a ""T"" Chart"," The first line you will draw is a vertical line. The vertical line of a T chart should be the longest line of the T chart. Use your ruler to measure the width of the page and find the middle. Place your ruler vertically in the center of the page and draw a line from the top to the bottom of the page. If you would like a margin around your T chart simply erase parts of the top and bottom of the line until you’ve reached your desired margin.


If you are not using a ruler, use your eye to roughly guess where the vertical centerline of the chart should go.
Use your preferred writing utensil, like a pen or pencil. If you are using a permanent pen or marker then measure and mark your margin before drawing your line.;
, The horizontal line should be drawn near the top of the page, leaving a small margin for you to label once finished. The size of your margin will depend on the size of your chart. A general rule is the larger the chart, the larger the margin. Place your ruler, leaving enough space for labeling, and draw your line from left to right. If you would like a margin, simply erase as you did with your vertical line.


Make another visual guess as to where the horizontal line should be placed if you are not using a ruler.
Be sure to measure and mark the margin of the horizontal line before using permanent pens or markers.

, The top quadrants should be labeled with content or subjects you are going to compare or analyze. You could be making a pros and cons list, in which case pros would go in one quadrant and cons in the other., The bottom quadrants should be reflective of their corresponding vertical quadrant subject. For example, if you are making a pros and cons list, and you’ve placed pros in the top left quadrant, the pros of your subject should be listed in the bottom left quadrant., Use line tools in programs like Microsoft Word to draw digital T charts for presentations, emails, or personal use. Follow the same method as you would with drawing a T chart by hand; the vertical line first followed by the horizontal line. Use text boxes or text insertion tools to label and fill in your T chart.

, Begin by taking the two subjects you would like to compare and filling them into two different cells in the top row of your excel spreadsheet. These top two cells will be the headings of your T chart.


Consider making these two top cells bold so that you can distinguish them from the bulk of your data.
If you choose to make this T chart into a graph, these two labels will be the labels of your axes.
T charts can also be used to make T accounts as well as visualized graphs., Once you have labelled your row cells you will be able to begin filling out the column cells. Be sure that you are filling in column cells that correspond with their row cell heading.


Just like when making a T chart on paper, you can use this Excel chart to list separate views on a given subject, strengths and weaknesses, or pros and cons.

, Once you have finished entering your data points you have the option of making a graph. Graphs in Excel allow you to visualize your T chart in ways that might make the information more appealing or understandable.

Pay attention to the name.,
Repeat the person's name.,
Decide you will remember.,
Make an association.,
Ask for more information about the name.,
Connect the person with someone else.,
Ask the person to spell it.,
Look closely at the person.,
Attach a visual image to their name.,
Put them in your contacts.,
Quiz yourself later.",How to Remember Names and Faces," One of the best ways to learn a person's name is to really concentrate when you first hear the name. When you're meeting someone, you may get caught up in the moment and not pay as much attention to the person's name as you should. It's important to try to make sure the person's name actually enters your brain, instead of going in one ear and out the other.If you realize a person's name flew by you, ask for it again. Most people are very understanding and will repeat their name for you.;
, After someone introduces themselves, try to repeat their name immediately. One way you can repeat the person's name is to say, ""Hello, Robert, nice to meet you."" Repeating it helps solidify it in your brain because you've both heard it, and said it.You can also say it as a way of confirming it. For instance, you could say, ""Was that Robert you said?"" Confirming the name has the added benefit of making sure you pronounce it correctly.
You could even repeat the name again later, such as saying, ""So, Robert, where are you from?""

, This step may seem a bit silly, but, deciding that you will be better at remembering names can actually help you to be better at memorizing names. It's like making a conscious decision flips a switch in your brain and helps you start caring more and therefore, remembering more.Tell yourself, ""The next time I meet a person, I will be sure to remember that person's name because it is important.""

, It can help you remember a name if you make an alliterative association with the name. For instance, if you meet Joe, who is originally from Jonesville, you could say something in your head like, ""Joe joins us from Jonesville,"" where you repeat the ""Js"" at the beginning. The alliteration can help you remember the name.Rhyming can also help, if you can come up with something that rhymes. For example, you could use ""Joe knows how to tow,"" if he owns a towing company, or just use the name, such as ""Witty Kitty.""
If nothing comes up in the conversation, use a visual cue with alliteration, such as ""Joe has jumping jugulars.""

, You can also ask if the name has a meaning or if it's important culturally. The more information you get, more likely you are to store the name in your memory. You could also ask the person if they know where their name originated., It can help you to retain a name if you connect the person you're meeting with someone else who has the same first name. You can either pick a famous person who looks vaguely like the person you're meeting, or try to pick something about the new person that reminds you of someone you know with the same name.For instance, maybe the person you're meeting is named Tom, and he looks a little like Tom Hanks.
Alternatively, maybe the person you're meeting is named Debra, and she reminds you of your friend Debra, who also has curly hair.

, If you need to see something to remember it, this technique can help. When someone spells something out, it usually creates a picture in your mind of the name, which connects it to your visual memory. You'll have a better chance of remembering it that way.You can also ask for a visual cue, such as a business card.
If you're really having a hard time getting someone's name, ask them to write it down for you.

, When you're meeting someone for the first time, you may just glance at the person's face before moving on. If you do that, you'll have a harder time remember that person's face later. It's important to take a minute to really look at the person's face, and be sure to note any distinguishing features, such as remarkably blue eyes.If it's appropriate, it doesn't hurt to compliment a person on the feature you notice. For instance, if the person does have remarkable eyes, you could say, ""You have striking eyes.""
Not only will the compliment endear you to the person, it will also help solidify that feature in your mind.

, To help your visual memory, you need to create a hook that sticks in your mind. Start by picking out a physical feature that stands out, such as prominent eyebrows. Next, create a visual image of the person's name, such as a robber's mask for Robert. Finally, place the prominent feature and the image together, such as placing the robber's mask over the person's eyebrows in your mind.Remember to make it as silly or crazy as you possibly can. The more out-of-the-ordinary it is, the more likely you are to remember it.

, One way to help you remember the person the next time you see them is to write down traits and details about the person. In a technological world, that means putting them in your contact list on your phone.You don't need their contact information to put them in your contacts. Just use their name, and add any details you can remember, from hair color to the number of cats they said they had.
Of course, it doesn't hurt to ask for the person's contact information, too.
In addition, putting the information will help solidify it in your memory.

, If you've met a bunch of people in a day and you need to solidify them in your memory, try quizzing yourself. Look at the name and the information you've collected and try to recall the person's face, so you'll remember them better when you meet them again.


This trick works especially well if you must memorize a large number of names quickly, such as if you're a teacher.
It can help if you can take a picture of the person because then you can quiz yourself the opposite way, too, by looking at the picture and trying to recall the person's name. Just be sure to ask the person first before you take a picture.

, If you have family members that distract you, politely ask them to leave so you can continue with your assignments. If you have kids, this might not be possible. Make sure the TV and radio are off. If you need background noise, classical music might be of interest.

, Be calm and patient with yourself. Nobody learns anything straight away.

, Staying up late studying is not a good idea. Lack of sleep prevents you from concentrating and reduces your ability to remember what you have learned .

, All students should keep a schedule of classes, assignments and other key dates. As part of that schedule, they should set aside specific time for studying and project work. That way, they're less likely to find themselves scrambling to complete a project at the last minute or cramming the night before a big test. The schedule should also set aside time for non-school activities like sports. In fact, the more comprehensive the schedule, the more efficient most students will be in completing their schoolwork.

, You can even take notes at work. It may be easier to use abbreviations for common words, only record important information (and/or key words), use clear headers to organize information and use pictures/diagrams to demonstrate. Highlight or underline key points in your material.

, This way you can quiz each other and learn things from each other.

, Go for a walk, ride your bike, or be with family. When you take frequent breaks, you find that you aren't boggled with the stress of homework and you can't wait to get back to your assignments later.Hear music it helps your brain to relax

, For example, if you're taking chemistry, math, English, and Spanish. Start with Chemistry and end with English. If you start with the hardest subject, your brain will be fresh.

, (formulae). Flash cards are good for memorizing large amounts of grouped information.

, As students move into higher grades, they're assigned larger and more complex reading assignments. Poor reading skills or an inability to read for important information will make these assignments a burden and undermine overall academic success. Students need to deliberately learn to read for key information. If reading skills are weak, it's important for the student to seek help improving them; otherwise performance in many subjects would be impacted.

, Study things more if you have a hard time doing them.

, A poor test result doesn't always mean that the student doesn't have a good grasp of the academic material or skill gaps. It's possible that the student understands the material, but doesn't take tests well. An effective test-taking strategy includes: learning how to prioritize material when studying for a test; preparing for a test over a number of days and not just the night before; coping with stress during the test; and managing time during a test so that all sections or areas are completed.

, Asking questions should lead to emphasis on the what, why, how, when, who and where of study content. Ask yourself questions while you read or study. Answering them will help to make sense of the material, and aid you in remembering it, because the process will make an impression on you. Those things that make impressions are more meaningful, and therefore more easily remembered.

, When you don't know what to do when you have to study for something. Don't give up––go and talk to someone about it; don't just keep it to yourself."

Figure out which learning styles work best for you.,
Benefit by doing.,
Rid yourself of distractions while learning.,
Establish good relationships with your teachers.,
Set small goals for yourself.,
Make things more interesting by figuring out a way to make classes more pleasant.,
See if you can summarize what you learned into a little notebook after class.,
Ask for help if you're struggling.",How to Learn Effectively," The basics are learning by seeing, doing, and hearing. Think back on something you remember well from class; was it a hands-on activity? Did the teacher give you a detailed essay? Were you given a handout? Once you know how you learn it can be done better. Though it's important to note that most people react better to a combination of learning styles. There are tests available on the internet to determine your learning style.;
, Hands-on activities are great, as they stick in your memory and help you more:


When you perform experiments in class, make sure that you concentrate.
Actually write down notes, even when they're not required during a lecture. The more open your mind is, the faster information will stick.
Alternatively, instead of taking notes, record the lecture on a mini-recorder and devote your attention to listening; use the recording to create notes afterwards. This extra step takes time, but makes use of what psychologists call the ""dual-coding hypothesis"", where you are more likely to learn something if you experience it in two different ways (i.e. listening and writing, in this case).

, Cell phones, music, and your chatty partner distract you from your instructor. Sit in a suitable place, as classes are for concentrating, not talking to your friends. Keep valuables in a bag, or far away enough for them not to attract your attention.

, If you hate your teachers, then you will have a lot of trouble learning. Be polite and show respect, and put in some effort, and your teachers will hold a liking for you that will make classes more pleasant.

, For example, take notes during class, and at the end of the week, see if you can write a short essay based on the material you've been learning. Before you begin a new unit, write down some questions on the topic, and at the end of each lesson, see how many of them you can answer. Each time you accomplish a goal, reward yourself by buying a CD or item of clothing, going out and having fun, or just taking a break.

, Find ways to motivate yourself:


Find something about the topic you are learning that interests you and focus on learning as much as you can about it. The more you want to learn, the more you will learn.
Find a ""study buddy"" - that is, a friend or classmate to study with. Hold small tests/quizzes for each other, discuss things you don't understand or that interest you, or take notes together. Having someone's company can motivate you more.

, Jot down a sentence or two that you can look back and recall the day with.

, Many people don't do this. If you find you are struggling, know that almost all teachers want to help you catch up. See if your school has a resource room you could use during study halls or go directly to your teacher. Don't be shy to ask .

"
Figure out your learning style.,
Understand the differences.",How to Learn1," In order to start learning effectively, it's imperative that you know how you learn. There are three types of learning styles and most people fall clearly into one category. Even if you are about evenly split between two, it's advantageous to know what doesn't work as well.


Visual learners learn primarily by seeing and watching. They tend to sit in front of the class, are neat and clean, and often close their eyes to remember or visualize something. They benefit from images, illustrations, videos, colors, and prefer to see the content they are learning.
Aural learners are more successful in learning by hearing and listening. They often sit where they can hear, but not necessarily where they can see, hum or talk to themselves when bored, find themselves reading aloud and remembering by verbalizing lessons or information. They'd rather talk than write and relish the opportunity to discuss what they've learned.
Kinesthetic learners learn best by touching and doing. They need to be active, take frequent breaks, and are often caught using their hands and gesturing while talking. They enjoy activities that manipulate materials, like cooking, construction, and engineering and will tinker or move around when bored.

Which of these describes you? If you can't tell, do some research online, consult your professors, or read up on learning styles.

;
, Each learner needs different things to adequately conceptualize and retain the information they are given. If a visual learner is told to remember something, they most likely won't. If a kinesthetic learner watches a movie on how to do something, they might not be able to do it. Neither is less intelligent than the other--they just aren't tuned into their optimal learning style.


Learning abilities don't stop in the classroom. Styles even invade the way we talk! Look for key examples found in dialogue: A visual learner might say, ""This looks good."" His or her aural counterpart would say, ""This sounds good."" ""I hear you,"" versus ""I see what you're saying."" If you are conflicted as to what your style is, tune into your words--or ask others to keep an ear (an eye?) out for you!

, Neatly copy down your homework on the correct dates, making sure to emphasize when each assignment is due. Be sure to leave enough room for other notes. If you have an important project or test, highlight it.

, In every class, keep it within reach in order to avoid the trouble of searching for it. As soon as your teacher announces an assignment or test, immediately jot it down in order to avoid forgetting it.

, If there are specific instructions provided, copy all of them down. Always look at the chalkboard for homework or projects written on it. If you need additional help, don't hesitate to ask a teacher for guidance.

, Use it for additional notes that won't fit into your planner. Also, keep your information and facts for tests in it.

, Jot down your classmates' names and their phone numbers. If you missed an assignment or need class notes, you can contact them and ask them for help.

, Place it in a certain spot to make sure it stands out. On it, write down all your assignments, projects, and tests, along with their due dates. This method will help remind you of any upcoming assignments so that you won't forget them.

, Although a planner and a whiteboard may be useful, you may occasionally need to carry around a constant reminder with you. However, don't rely too heavily upon this method.

, You can have your parents act as your coaches when it comes to completing your assignments. By nicely asking them to remind you about your homework, you will decrease your chances of forgetting about your school assignments. Every evening, make it a habit to check in with them in order to ensure that you remembered all your projects.

, By getting the small tasks out of the way, you will be able to focus on completing the harder objectives. Clearing the simpler duties off of your plate will help lower your stress.

, Once you complete an assignment, erase your whiteboard and check it off of your planner. This method will help you avoid missing homework.

, Although it may be difficult to keep a schedule, maintain this habit until it becomes natural. Keeping track of your assignments will help you receive the best grades. It will also set up good habits that will benefit you in the future.

Prepare for the journey.,
Be prepared.,
Look around.,
Know that there will always be culture shock.,
Enjoy: Now that you are at college in America, it is time to settle in to your new life.,
Relish the new experience: If the opportunity to participate in a college exchange ever arises, do not let it pass.",How to Survive a College Exchange Between the US and Australia1," An Anxious Departure: It is natural to be nervous when embarking on a big adventure, especially if you are traveling by yourself for the first time. Goodbyes are also going to be hard if you are going to be away from home for a while.


Leaving for a college exchange is a bittersweet experience; you are probably going to be very excited and can’t wait to get there but you could also experience feelings of anxiousness and sadness when leaving behind loved ones.
The important thing to remember is that, thanks to amazing technology these days, people on the other side of the world are only a phone call or one click of the mouse away.
You also need to remember that you will be meeting some amazing people and making many new friends at your destination.
Depending on where you are departing from, the length of the journey is going to be different. However, it is likely that it could involve more than one flight and many hours of sitting around airports hoping your flight has not been delayed or canceled. In the case of a canceled flight, the best thing to do is to stay calm and not panic. You may feel the urge to breakdown and cry because you just want to get to college, but this is not the answer. Get as much information from the airline as you can about the next available flight, get in contact with the host university to let them know your new arrival time then enjoy the free meals and hotels the airline has to provide. Hopefully, though, there won't be a canceled or delayed flight and you can continue your journey normally.
During a long flight try to relax and just make the most of having some ‘you-time.' Granted, some seats on a plane are more comfortable than others, but regardless of where you are sitting, make the most of your personal entertainment system and catch up on those movies and TV shows you keep meaning to watch.
Just sit back and relax while the air hosts bring you a never ending supply of food and drink. After landing, be sure to explore the airport. There are many amazing and fun things to see and do at airports so definitely go for a wander.;
, Make sure you have all the required documents on hand to show at immigration. Once you have successfully proceeded through customs, you are officially in the exciting land of America!


By this time you may be very tired, hungry, and grumpy, but don't let it ruin your first impression of whichever country you have traveled to. Be happy that you are in a new country and are about to have an amazing adventure!

, Landing in America can be quite an exciting but stressful experience.

, You aren't alone.


Even when coming from a country such as Australia which is not overly different from America, there is still going to be culture shock. The tiniest differences could become quite distressing, simply for the fact that it is different to home and what you have known your whole life.
The currency will be different, the food will be different and even the people will be different.
Remember, you are a guest in someone else's country so be sure to respect their culture and abide by their rules.
One of the hardest things to get used to is different food. It will take a while to get used to it but be optimistic and don't be scared to try a new dish, it may just become your new favorite food!
Also, make an effort to be polite to everyone and you will find that they are generally friendly and very helpful.

, Again depending on where you are from college may be a lot different to what you experience at home. See the 'tips' section for some tips on making the most of college life!

, It is such an amazing experience which helps you discover the world and yourself. It is often said that people should take risks and try something new. Well going to study in another country certainly falls under this category. Don’t let fear of the unknown stop you from having the time of your life. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!

Use written materials and exercises.,
Use boards, models, and flip charts.,
Take good notes.",How to Learn2," Now that you know you learn by seeing and watching, utilize this knowledge. Write down what you hear, translating the aural into the visual.


If your teacher shows you a movie or is talking about specific points on a test, write it down. After you write it down, look over it twice. Start speaking your brain's preferred language.
If your teacher uses slides while lecturing, it's important to concentrate on the slides. You'll be less likely to remember what he/she said, but you will remember what you saw on the screen.

, Take what you're trying to learn and let your eyes use it. This may involve an extra step, but your test scores will certainly lap it up.


Did your professor just say English was 30% French, 30% Latin, 25% Germanic, and 15% other? Great! Pie chart it is! Now, what color do you associate with each?
Hone your artsy side. Need to know when the Model T was introduced? Draw a license plate on the back of a car. The number reads 1011908, for October 1st, 1908. Get creative.

, Every teacher will stress, ""Don't write down everything I say! You'll get so far behind!"" Well, you're not an aural learner anyway, so why would you remember what they said?


If your teacher goes much too fast for you to write anything legible, ask them for notes or an outline on their materials. They will love your enthusiasm.
You could always write what you learned on wikiHow!

"
"
Tape record lectures.,
Ask questions.,
Participate in small groups.",How to Learn3," Fortunately for you, this does not mean carrying around a large dark box anymore. Whip out your smart phone, press a few buttons, and voila. It's aural history whenever you need it.


It may be best to warn your teachers or professors of the methods you're employing. Otherwise you risk your phone (or other device) being taken away. Explain that this is the best way you learn and they will be highly unlikely to say no.

, As you listen to your teacher discuss the topic at hand, engage. Listening to them speak is one thing, but listening to yourself speak is another. You know how it's always so easy to remember the dumb things we've said? Well, it's easier to remember the questions we asked in Biology class, too.


If you're a little crowd shy, do this after class! Your teacher will love the 5 minutes you took out of your day to express interest in their topic of expertise. The one-on-one time may even be more in-depth and interesting to boot.

, Whatever it takes, get yourself (and others) talking. Small groups force the topic at hand to be discussed instead of seen or written down and ignored.


If your teachers aren't keen on pair or group work, join a study group. There are always students looking to improve their grades and get the information down pat. Not only will you get a chance to talk about the material, you'll be able to bounce ideas off of each other and meet new people as well.
If the two options above don't seem feasible, talk about your schoolwork at home. Grab your mom and teach her about exothermic reactions or grab your roommate and see how much they actually know about WWII. When it's test time, you won't wonder what Professor Feeny said about The Catcher in the Rye, you'll remember your little sister asking you how the book was about baseball and how her soon-to-come loss of innocence reminded you of Phoebe and...there it is. You knew it all along! Just had to jog your memory.

Demonstrate a concept.,
Underline and highlight.,
Get involved physically.",How to Learn4," Take to using your hands. Whether it's at home or in the classroom, get involved. Be the first to light the Bunsen burner and volunteer to dissect that cow's eyeball.


Take any concept and make it concrete and malleable. Learning about DNA? Grab your legos and make a replica of the double helix.
It doesn't have to stop at math and science. Take an excerpt from any book and act it out. Don't necessarily don a scarlet ""A"" to school, but do make the book come alive. Heck, grab your conch shell and vote someone off the school lunch table--everyone will remember that.

, A lot of teachers love to see their students take notes. While this isn't the best way for you to learn, make it work with underlining and highlighting.


Work with different colors. Keep a code that means something to you. For dates, purple. For beliefs, green. For theories, yellow. Get a system to make your notes more memorable.

, Join an after school science club or develop your own learning habits. You don't have to wait to do it in class, disassemble and reassemble that computer on your own time!


Take your own field trips. Some schools don't utilize the resources of their community. If yours doesn't, visit your local art, history, or science museums, live theatres, and display exhibits. Educational tools are often free or offered at a reduced price for students. Most things will be hands-on and more kinesthetic than your average classroom.

Study in the testing room.,
Keep your physiological states constant.,
Be patient.,
Find what you enjoy.,
Watch TV.,
Go online.,
Go above and beyond.,
Take time to internalize what you learn.",How to Learn5," Though it may seem far-fetched, students often do better on a test when a test is taken in the room they received the information. This is called context-dependent memory.


A study at Iowa State University (one of many) garnered results that matched this theory across the board. And get this: their conditions were silent and noisy. Those who received the information in a silent context recalled the information quicker and more accurately in a silent context; those who received the information in a noisy context recalled easier in a noisy context. No matter what your conditions, keep them constant. Study in the testing room to get the closest context possible.

, Now that we've covered context-dependent learning, let's venture to state-dependent learning. You guessed it, you'll recall better if you're in the same state (of mind, body, etc.) than if you're not. Take a look:


A recent study at Bonaventure University found that congruent (the same) states heightened recall and incongruent states heightened false memories. That is, in the same state, you're likely to recall things that are more accurate. In different states, you're more likely to recall things that are just plain not true
Funnily enough, alcohol works the same way. In an old issue of Science Magazine, an article studied sobriety and recall. Those (men) who were drunk during the learning session performed better at the recall session if they ingested similar levels of alcohol .

It is not advocated to go drunk to class. What is advocated is to develop a routine and stick to it. If you learned the information while wearing purple and on a coffee high, take the test while wearing purple and on a coffee high.



, Changing how you learn doesn't come overnight. What's more, certain topics are going to come easier to you than others. Keeping an open mind will make it easier to persevere in the face of difficulty.


Don't be ashamed to ask for help. If you know someone who's an expert on a topic you're studying, hit them up! They'd love to bestow their knowledge on someone else. Whether it's friends, family, or mentors, tap into the resources you have around you.

, No one is good at absolutely everything. Finding what you enjoy and sticking to that will make your academic outlook more positive.


Take what you love and make it applicable to what you're studying. Super into billiards and film but not so into geometry? For a school project, shoot a video using the diamonds on the table and sink shots from ridiculous angles. Love music but can't stand Shakespeare? Take the opening monologue from Romeo and Juliet and put it to Beyoncé's Bootylicious. Do whatever you have to do to make it memorable and fun.

, That's right, TV. There are tons of channels that are educational ""edutainment."" Discovery, National Geographic, and the History Channel (just to name a few) are great resources to tap into.


Do you have Netflix? Ever taken time to scroll down that main page just a bit? Documentaries abound! And if you don't have Netflix, there are many websites that offer high-quality documentaries for free. All you have to do is surf the internet to find them.

, Just because your professor speaks in a monotone, coughs, or adjusts his mustache every 7th word doesn't necessarily mean the material is boring. Go online to find the same information put in a way you can understand and appreciate.


KhanAcademy, Memrise, and AcademicEarthare all great starting points.
Let's not forget YouTube and wikiHow! Cough, cough...

, Learning doesn't have to stop at 3 pm on Friday. If you find something that ignites a fire in you, keep with it! With technology nowadays, you don't even have to pay for it.


iTunesU, Coursera, and many university websites offer audio and/or video lectures. With Coursera, you even get a certificate upon completion! And it's all free!

, Taking gaps while learning a new thing or skill helps one have a deeper grasp over it. Its cause mind(sub-conscious) and body(muscle memory) have enough time to absorb or adapt or align to the new skill you are trying to learn.

Try this experiment. To learn a new habit or skill quickly and efficiently, consciously practice it and then follow up with a gap or break, before consciously practicing it again. Follow this cycle and see for yourself how it improves your learning curve. For example: To learn how to drive a car, practice on the wheel for sometime (let's say an hour) and then take a gap (let's say, 1-24 hours) before coming back to practice again. The gaps like this could be called as micro gaps as they are being used in shorter scheme of events.
Since some skills like martial arts, programming, movie making etc, require years of practice so in longer scheme of events taking 'macro gaps' can be quite fruitful. Suppose you want to learn a particular style of martial arts so take advantage of macro gaps for better learning. For example: Go to class for few days a week followed by a gap of 2-3 days(to internalize), and follow the same cycle again. Of course you can take micro gaps in these macro gaps, like taking breaks during the class, time between two classes etc. You can use Macro gaps for even longer scheme of events. For example: going to classes for 3 weeks in a row and then taking a week off from the practice. Again, of course, you can take micro gaps in between these macro gaps.
The numbers above are just to give an idea and could vary for different people. Its cause everyone's different, have different learning curves, personalities, openness to new things and so on. So don't compare yourself with anyone and accept your personality, learning curve etc. Also the usage of the terms 'macro gaps' and 'micro gaps' is just for explanation purposes, so don't get stuck on them and make it a structure. Instead look beyond them as true intelligence is structure-less. Read Become Mentally Flexible for more depth.
Keep a balance. Don't make the gaps too small or too long. As small gaps wouldn't give body and mind enough time to internalize while too long gaps could lead you to forget about the concepts of new skill. So calibrate and iterate to get a better idea of personality and learning curve.

You want to choose something more distinct than simply “study abroad blog” but not overly detailed. An overly detailed blog name might be, “study abroad blog for Australians living in Chicago with a passion for craft beer.” Find a name that is detailed enough that people will find an interest in it but also broad enough that you won’t be turning away viewers. Try to come up with three or four possible names, since some of them may be already taken.


An example of a great blog title is “The Pin the Map Project.” This blog title grabs your attention and evokes the image of a world traveler. Created by a former advertising and marketing professional in her twenties, the travel blog documents travel experiences around the world, focusing on budget options and a younger audience.;
, Once you have decided upon a blog name, check to see if it is appropriate and original. To see if it is appropriate, spell it out as one word to make sure it doesn’t spell out anything silly or otherwise inappropriate. To figure out if it is original, search the blog names you have brainstormed to see if the URL is taken or not. Look around on social media to see if the name is already in use., There are many choices for blogging platforms such as Wordpress, Tumblr, Squarespace and Posthaven. You can find blogging platforms that are free, as well as paid sites that are tailored for your needs. Some platforms only offer hosted options, whereas others only offer self-hosting. Some of the popular platforms include the following:WordPress is a popular choice for bloggers. It is a stable platform that is easy to use. You can choose between hosted or self-hosted options. This is considered the best choice for new bloggers.
Squarespace is very easy to set up but you need to pay for it. If you want something that looks great and is easy to set up and don’t mind paying a monthly fee, this is a great option. You cannot self-host on this platform, so you will have to be fine with Squarespace as your host.
Posthaven is a simple blogging platform that is potentially more stable than competitors. A lot of blogging platforms come and go, whereas Posthaven has been around for a while and plans to stay in the game.
Kirby is a wonderful choice if you want customized themes and have some basic coding skills including PHP. You will have to self-host your blog.
Svbtle is popular for having a straightforward interface. If you want to focus on writing and limiting distractions, this is a really nice option. You can use a sub-domain or host your blog on Svbtle.

, The domain name allows people to find you online. With your memorable and original name, you can now obtain the domain name that allows your readers to find you online. If you use a sub-domain name, you won’t need to spend money. However, if you want a domain name, you will have to purchase one. You can purchase and register domain names at sites such as GoDaddy, Hostwinds and SnapNames.If you are using a blogging platform that has sub-domains such as Wordpress or Tumblr, you won’t need to purchase a domain name.

, You will need to decide whether you want to self-host your blog or have your blog hosted on an existing platform. The easiest way to go is to start your blog on a hosted platform, which means you won’t have to worry about setting up a server or learning to code. If you want to self-host your blog, you will have to pay for a server company to host your blog. There are many reputable hosts such as the following:Bluehost hosts two million websites and offers great support.
DreamHost offers great performance and a lot of choices.
Flywheel is a well-respected host.
SiteGround has a great support team.

These documents are very crucial in ensuring that you travel from one point to another using buses, subways, air, or ports. Transportation in the US is always coupled by delays since extensive document verification is always mandatory therefore as a student you should be prepared to such inconveniences.
Be sure that you always know where these documents are.;
, Maintaining your health in the U.S. is normally the responsibility of the students (University of Washington 1). Since payment of health services is usually expensive, international students are advised to purchase medical insurance. The premiums of the common U.S. insurances range from quarterly to annual payments. However, certain universities cover the health of their international students.

, Checking accounts are necessary for a student’s need of managing finances for daily up-keep. To have a bank account, a passport, I-94, address, and contact information is mandatory. Therefore, international students should apply for address at the WEBSIS portal so as to have one. The U.S. authorities mainly use the address for sending parcels, shopping and even paying bills. The university usually organizes accommodation for the new students but after a year students can freely choose where to live. Further acquire of electronics such as a computer and phone is crucial. Certain universities issue computers to the international students. Phones help in management of mails which help in contacting with family.

, In order for a student to be issued with social security number is, they must be eligible to work in the United States of America. In addition, students with J-1 and F-1 holdings can work within America whereas the dependent F-2 cannot be issued with social security since they do not have the right to work in US. Employment is defined by the offer of services in exchange of compensation such as: finance, rooms, or other favors as agreed (Lipson 23). Self-employment for students is forbidden. Therefore, employment in form of giving services such as baby-sitting is recognized.

, To drive in the U.S requires one to possess an international passport and pass driving test. With the address and bank ATM one can buy food in the stores and the supermarkets anytime. Moreover, housing is very necessary. The housing can be college dorms, off campus apartments or houses or living with an American family.


To live outside campus which is commuting needs transportation. Some universities have buses and subways and other requires to a car, which the student might consider to buy. In my opinion, the international student should try to get his personal transportation like buying a car or a motorcycle. In that way, he can transport from one place do many other different places.

, Furthermore, education wise, the international student should always try to reach for help in education wise such as, if the student does not understand the material in class and need some help since English is his second language. The student should go to the tutoring center to get help or meet the instructor of the class revise whatever was discussed in class from topics to achieve the academic requirements as being an international student. In addition, international student should always try to make new friends in college to get a diverse knowledge and to strengthen the language. The student should never be shy to ask about something he does not understand because in this way he will never get the help that he or she needs.

, On the other hand, the international student should always explore new places in America, therefore, it is interesting to travel across the country to meet new people and learn the country’s culture also nature and other interesting attractions. Searching the web is a good idea to find those places and also a good way to find out how to reach a certain destination.

, It is very common that the international student usually gets the feeling of homesick and anxiety. Being away from the family, relatives and friends back home is hard and stressful. The best advice for that is, the student should try communicating with other students. Moreover, the international student should try to join groups with other students from their country, which in this way they will not be feeling left out, alone and sad.


Participate in extracurricular activities such as, going to the university gym to work out which is a good way to meet new people. Joining other sports likewise, soccer, American football, hockey and other different sports that the university has. These kinds of activities are very beneficial for staying sharp, healthy and creating optimism. This is how the international student should cope and settle in the United States of America by interpreting how to make his life much easier and less stressful to maintain a successful academic future. Education is a great notion for the human being thus the international student has so much potentials of getting the right education, experience and a bright knowledge. The world is changing and education is a must have and it is also a way of fulfilling the expectations of future career.

Keep an Open Mind.,
Appreciate the History and Culture.,
Be a Local, Not a Tourist!,
Take Advantage of Your Study Abroad Program.,
Travel Within Italy as Much as You Can.,
Pasta, Pizza, Vino, & Gelato.,
Enjoy Your Time in Italy.",How to Have a Positive Study Abroad Experience in Italy,"


The Italian culture is definitely different than American culture. In order to appreciate, learn about, and immerse yourself in Italian life, keep an open mind about your first experiences with the people and the cities. Here are a few things to know about the Italian culture before you go to Italy:
The people are loud, bold, and have little awareness of personal space. Don't be shocked if you hear people yelling or if you are heckled on the street. It is just the way they communicate.
While Italy is a modern country, they do not have many of the common luxuries that the United States feels are essential. Be prepared for the lack of functional restrooms, clothes dryers, electrical plugs, and internet connection. Life is just a little bit simpler!
Everyone and everything runs late. The Italians have a lack of regard for time. Their attitude is to simply enjoy the moment, and everything else will have to wait. So enjoy it! Take your time relishing the little things in life and learn to relax like an Italian.
It's nap time in Italy from about 3-5pm. Life stops - stores close, people take a break from work, and children go home from school. This is completely different from American society. We live to work, but Italians work to live.
Italy is relatively a very safe country, but always be aware of pickpockets and petty thieves. Check out some safe travel gear to protect your belongings and never bring attention to your electronics or jewelry.
With all this in mind, try to accept the differences as they come. It may be difficult and frustrating at times, but part of the reason why you're there is to learn how to adapt to a new culture!;
,


Italy has a rich and vast history, and they have done an excellent job preserving their culture. While you are there, take the time to explore and learn as much as you can.
Visit the museums. Italy has an amazing collection of paintings, sculptures, religious and historical artifacts, and much more. A few to make sure you don't miss are the Academia and the Uffizi in Florence; the Vatican Museum, Capitoline Museum, and Galleria Borghese in Rome; the Museum of Modern Art in Bologna; and the Leonardo da Vinci Science and Technology Museum in Milan.
Each city in Italy will have a vast number of churches and cathedrals, as well as monuments dedicated to past leaders and events. Each one has something interesting to offer, not to mention how beautiful they are!
Italy also has a rich past in music and theater. Try to go to an opera or musical performance. Most have student ticket pricing!
Italians are huge soccer fans (or in Italian ""calcio""). Seeing a home game for the team in your city would be an exciting culture experience.
Good thing to note: Since you are studying abroad and have a student visa, you will receive discounts on many of the tourist attractions, like museums, monuments, events, etc. Make sure to check those out and use your visa to your advantage!

,


Since this is your home base for the semester, make sure you know it well! These few tips will help you to feel like a local instead of a tourist, making you more comfortable in your location and feel less homesick.
Learn some of the language (especially the correct pronunciation). Many Italians in the larger cities now speak English, but if you attempt to speak Italian to them, you will usually get a friendly response and a lesson in the language. Have your host family help you too!
Know how to get around. Whether that be by foot, bus, car (not likely), or bike, make sure you become familiar with your Italian town. And always keep a map on you! It is extremely easy to get lost in the winding, unmarked streets, especially in the smaller medieval towns.
Be involved in the community. Whether that be the local soccer games, a volunteer project through your school, becoming a regular at a bar (which is their version of an American coffee shop), or talking with other locals in the town, meeting and interacting with the local community will make you feel comfortable and connected to your new home.
Another good idea is to find a blogger who details many of the local events and attractions - they will have some very good suggestions on what to do in your city.

,


Your program in Italy will most likely have many events, trips, museum visits, etc. that are pre-paid or pre-planned. These are convenient and easy, as you have the transportation and tour guide planned for you.
Your professors will know much about your city - ask them for help or suggestions.
Meet and travel with people in your program. Italy is full of American students, so you have the opportunity to meet people from all around the country. They will also understand the frustrations and homesickness that comes with studying abroad.
Remember to take your classes seriously. You are still in Italy to learn!

,


Italy is blessed with having a variety of different cultures and landscapes within the same country. While you may be tempted to jet off to another country each weekend, make sure you spend some time exploring all the different areas of Italy as well.
Research what cities are interesting and affordable to travel to for you and make a list of about 10 places you want to visit. Day trips by the trains or buses are extremely doable!
Check out different cities and regions: Rome, Venice, Florence, Milan, Pisa, Assisi, Lucca, Palermo, the Alps, Cinque Terre, Tuscany... the list goes on!
You should also try to travel outside of Italy too. It's great to be able to compare the Italian culture with other cultures and to experience something not-Italian every once in a while.

,


Food is a central part of the Italian lifestyle. While you are in Italy, make sure you never pass up on a meal, specially if it is from an Italian mama.
Each region and city in Italy has many signature dishes. The Naples region is famous for its pizza, Tuscany is famous for its bistecca and wine, and the southern region is famous for its sweet desserts. Inquire what they are when you are visiting different cities and try them!

,


You only get to be a study abroad student for so long, so make sure you make the most of it!
Keep these tips and suggestions in mind as you travel and learn to make your transition to Italian lifestyle smoother. See as much as you can while still enjoying the simplicity and treasures of the Italian culture.

Advance in your career.",How to Become a Security Guard," In order to be a security guard, you must be at least 18 years old in in the United States. However, the age requirement may be different depending on the country where you’re looking for work. For example, you must be only 17 to apply to be a security guard in Hong Kong, China, but you have to be at least 19 to find work as a security guard in British Columbia. If you’d like a position where you’ll be armed, then you typically need to be at least 21 years old in the United States., When you put in your application to be a security guard, you will have to pass a background check to more forward in the process. You’ll need to take a drug test and have your fingerprints scanned. If you choose a position where you’ll need to be armed, then an even more thorough check may be done. The thoroughness of the background check also depends on the state; for example, in Texas, you’ll need to prepare for an “FBI style” background check., Though all you’ll need to be a security guard in most places is a high school diploma or its equivalent, some companies prefer to hire guards with a two or even a four-year degree in criminal justice or police science. Though getting this degree just for the purpose of being a security guard may not be necessary, having a background in these fields will make you a more desirable candidate.


You may also need a bachelor’s degree to work at a high-class facility such as a casino., Though this isn’t mandatory and may not apply to you if the work you choose doesn’t require you to drive as part of your commute or while on the job, having a driver’s license can make you a more desirable candidate and will make you open to more types of positions. Consider procuring a driver’s license before you begin the application process, if it’s not too much of a challenge.


For example, having a driver’s license is essential for being an armored car guard.
If the workplace where you’re seeking employment knows you have a car and a license, you’ll be a more desirable candidate because you’ll have an easy time getting there with your car.

, The particulars of the requirements to be a security guard are different in different countries, and even in different states. Before you apply for this position, you’ll need to look into what your country or state require of you before you move forward. Here are some differences to keep in mind:


In the United States, for example, you’ll need to complete state certified training in Delaware, training at an approved training center in Texas, and on-the-job training in New York. Each state has different requirements, so it’s important to know what you’re signing up for.
For example, to be a security guard in the United Kingdom, you’ll need to complete your training to receive a Security Industry Authority License.

, Once you turn in your application and are approved to begin training, you can move forward. You’ll have to undergo a background check before you can be approved to begin training. You’ll have to pay an application fee; the cost varies, but it hovers around $50, which is what you’ll have to pay to apply in California.

, Each state and country has its own training requirements, but it’s likely that you’ll be training in how to detain suspects, property rights, and emergency procedures. Some states have state-mandated training while others allow training from a third-party company, so it depends on the laws of your particular state. Some will even focus on on-the-job training. In general, training takes about 40 hours, and you’ll complete the first 8 hours before starting work, and will complete the 16 more hours after a month of training and the rest after around six months of training.It’s typical for employees to provide instruction for newly-hired guards, though the amount of training you’ll get on the job will vary.
Your training may even include learning about protection, public relations, report writing, and first aid.
In many states, you’ll also continue to do 8 hours of yearly training so you stay up-to-date.

, Some guard duties require you to carry a firearm, baton, or even tear gas. With power comes responsibility, so if this sounds like the right path for you, you’ll need to complete additional training — typically at an additional cost — to get licensed to carry these additional weapons. Jobs that require you to carry these weapons tend to offer higher pay. Remember that this license will allow you to carry a weapon on the job, but not to carry a concealed weapon in your daily life.


For example, the permit for carrying a firearm as a guard in California costs $80 dollars and you’ll need 14 additional hours of training.
One career choice can be to be an armored car guard, which is a guard who protects money and other valuables during transit. You’ll work with a team of guards to pick up money from businesses and move them to another location. You’ll need a firearm and will wear a bulletproof vest, because this can be dangerous work. That said, the pay is higher than it is in other types of guard work.Just know that being an armed guard is not possible in every country. In fact, it’s illegal in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or the Netherlands. However, in some other countries, such as Israel, it is mandatory for security guards to be armed.

, After you’ve completed your licensing requirements and application, you’ll be issued a fingerprint card that you’ll need to take to an agency-approved fingerprinting site in order to have your fingerprints registered. You’ll have to pay a fee, somewhere in the neighborhood of $50, to have them processed. This is an important step that will make your job as a security guard official.Registering your fingerprints will also ensure that it’ll be known if you commit any future offenses.

, The options are almost endless when it comes to finding a place where you can work as a security guard. However, the type of place where you choose to work will greatly affect what your work days will look like, so it’s important to consider this when making a choice. Be aware that it can take a while to find a full-time security guard position; however, there are many additional part-time jobs available around the holidays, and some of them can turn into full-time jobs.Still, it will take determination and perseverance to find work. Here are some places where you can seek employment:Retail stores. Security guards in retail stores protect people, records, merchandise, money, and equipment. They may also work as undercover detectives to prevent customers and employees from shoplifting.
'Office buildings, banks, hotels, and hospitals. Security guards in these locations work to keep the customers, staff, and property safe.


Museums and art galleries. Security guards in these locations work to protect the paintings and exhibits from the people at the museums. They may also work at a security line near the entrances and may have to look through handbags of patrons.

Factories, government buildings, and military bases. Here, the security guards not only protect the workers and the equipment, but they also check the credentials of the people and the vehicles that enter and leave the premises to make sure that no unauthorized people enter these locations.

Schools and universities. Here, guards patrol the buildings and the grounds and keep the students safe. They may also work at school events and keep the campuses safe at night.

Parks and sports stadiums. The security guards at parks and stadiums control crowds, direct traffic, and help people find their seats.

Bars and nightclubs. The guards here make sure people are old enough to enter, turn away rowdy or drunk patrons, and keep people in order.

, Of course, your job description will vary significantly depending on the place where you work. However, there are some duties that many security guards have to fulfill during their time on the job. To be successful at what you do, you have to perform them rigorously while making sure never to take your eyes off the people and property under your protection. Here are the duties you may typically have to do:


Monitor alarms and closed-circuit TV cameras
Control access for employees and visitors by checking their credentials
Conduct security checks at the entrance of a building
Write daily or weekly reports of what you observed
Detain violators
Interview witnesses for court testimony

, One thing you’ll need to succeed as a security guard is patience and lots of it. Much of your job will lie in standing around and looking out for trouble. You may go days, or even weeks, without finding something to act on. Of course, this depends on the line of work — if you have to help people go through security, then you’ll have less down time. Either way, you’ll have to have the patience to stand around and focus on your job without letting your mind drift.


Even if something out of the ordinary or dangerous only happens for five minutes a day, you need to have the patience to stay alert to stop trouble before it gets out of control.

, Whether you work with a partner, patrol a store with several other guards, or have to instruct people who go through security at the front of a building, it’s important to have people skills to do your job well. You want to be firm without coming off as gruff to help people quickly get through security, and you want to have a good working relationship with any colleagues so you can keep each other in the loop about any potential problems that you’ve come across.


Though much of your job may not require you to talk much, when you do communicate with others, it has to count. If you see a suspicious customer at the other end of the store, you have to make it clear that the other guards should be alert to it.

, A security guard needs to be extremely observant. You have to be able to watch the world and people around you and to be on the lookout for anything out of the ordinary. You may spot a shoplifter, a brewing fight, or a customer who is obviously drunk and needs to be escorted from the store. If you’re an armoured car guard, then you may spot something much worse — a criminal who wants to rob your cash-filled car. You need to have your eyes and ears open at all times and never stop being on watch, no matter how seemingly ordinary your day seems.


There’s a reason why security guards were formerly called “watchmen.” Your job is to keep watch over the people and property you’re responsible for, and not to let your mind drift for a second.

, Security guards need to be physically fit. Not only will your job most likely require standing on your feet all day, but you may also have to move property if your job calls for it. Most importantly, you’ll need your strength in case you need to detain a person; you have to be quick and strong so you don’t let any criminals slip through your fingers. You should also have physical stamina in order to endure the many hours you will spend standing up; if you’re a guard in a museum or another place where you are required to sit, you will also need stamina to stay in this same position, too.


Make sure to have at least a few days of cardio training and strength-building exercises each week.

, When you find yourself in a dangerous situation, you’ll need to quickly decide how you should proceed. You may see that a criminal is getting away and will need to determine how he can be most efficiently detained. You’ll need to know shortcuts and hiding spots, and you’ll need to know when to quickly ask for help from the other guards. You can’t dilly dally or you’ll be letting a dangerous person get out of your hands, or worse, you could cause harm to yourself, others, and the property you’re supposed to be protecting.It’s important to be alert during all points of your job, so your mind can quickly come up with a solution when the job calls for it. If you find yourself nodding off while standing up, you won’t be able to make a snap decision when you awake to find that a customer is stealing a valuable piece of property.

, If you are an exceptional security guard, you may be able to move up in your career in the future. If you gain many years of experience, you may even become a supervisor of other guards, or even a security manager. If you’re armed, then you have a greater chance of moving forward in your career and will also make a higher salary in the process.


You may also work at an organization that contains higher levels of security, which will raise your salary.
Some guards who have a lot of experience as well as management skills even open up their own security guard businesses.

Remember information.",How to Be Clever," If you wait during a conversation and listen to the different participants, before you jump into the fray, you'll appear more clever, simply because you've had more time to listen to different opinions and sides and evaluate these opinions before giving your own.For example: say you're conversation with your cousin Bob, your aunt Milly, and your sister, Sarah, about the best way to baste a turkey. Let the other three hash it out for a bit while you listen, and evaluate the effectiveness of each side of the argument. Then, slip in your own idea for basting the turkey, once the argument is winding down. Make sure that it's different than the other three; if you do agree with one of the others, possibly Aunt Milly, offer up a more convincing argument than she has, or give a reason for that option that the others might not have considered.
This is also a great way to avoid looking the opposite of clever, by not just opening your mouth first and saying whatever comes into your head.
Often the person who speaks last is less likely to simply point out the obvious, or regurgitate facts. Instead they usually come up with something more creative, or more original, which people are more likely to remember.;
, These are the types of facts that you can whip out during an argument that support whatever claim you're making. Chances are you're not going to be able to have facts for every single argument you might potentially get into, so pick the ones that are most important to you.


For example: if you're really passionate about global climate change, you might make sure to have statistics memorized that look at the difference between weather and climate, that show what has changed so swiftly in the past few years (and how that is linked to things like carbon dioxide), and how this is different than the slower, more long-term climate change that happens without the help of human practices.
It's really good to gather some facts (real facts) for things that everyone assumes are true. Blowing assumptions out of the water can make you appear very clever.

, Every single group or workplace has lingo that goes along with it. This can come in the form of acronyms, or abbreviations, or even nicknames for certain things. Learning these for the places that you are, and the places that you visit, will help make you seem knowledgeable.


For example: in fly-fishing there are tons of different words and phrases that you have to learn when you're a beginner. Not knowing terms like ""cast"" (the motion you make when you throw the rod, reel, and line back and forth) or a ""lie"" (the areas in a river or lake where the fish tend to be) will make you seem like you don't know what you're doing, the opposite of clever.If you don't know the lingo someone is using, pay attention to the context of the word or words. You can usually figure out the basic meaning from that. Otherwise, ask someone in private, so that everyone doesn't end up knowing that you don't understand everything they're saying.

, Oftentimes persuasiveness and cleverness are linked in people's minds. Doing the one will make people correlate it with the other. Having your ""pocket"" facts and speaking last can help you be persuasive, but so can a few other things. Remember that persuasion is basically getting people to do something that is in their best interest (unlike manipulation) while also benefiting you.Context and timing are very important parts of being persuasive. As an example: don't try to ask your sister for money help with your parents right when she's lost her job. She'll be more concerned about money and needing money. Instead, wait until she's found a new job, or if she's just gotten a raise.
Speak clearly and concisely. The more clearly and quickly you put a problem to someone, the more likely they are to understand exactly what it is you're asking them to do and the more likely they are to help you out. People tend to prefer a straightforward tactic rather than beating about the bush.
Avoid jargon (special words and expressions used by a particular group that make it difficult for others to understand them; i.e. law jargon). People won't listen to you if they can't understand what you're saying and it won't make you look clever, if you can't get your point across. Unless you're speaking to people who understand the same technical terms as you, don't use them.

, So many times a problem doesn't need a complex solution. While this may seem counter-intuitive, the simplest solution is often the most useful one, as well as the one that others tend not to think of. Humans seem bent on finding the most difficult and complex way to do things. Not falling into that trap will make you stand out.


Often a good question to ask when looking for a solution is: What can you do less of? Usually that can help weed on some of the less productive options.
Also, ask yourself and others specific questions. If you're trying to build better time management, don't ask ""how can we build better time management?"" The question is too big, and you'll usually get answers that are too big, as well. A better question might be ""What tools might help make us work more quickly"" or ""If we spent 2 hours on a particular project instead of 4 hours, how might we work more quickly to achieve the same results?""

, By being confident about yourself and your work, you'll present as cleverer than someone who is very smart and intelligent, but not confident. People tend to believe in confidence, even when there isn't that much to back it up. Present as confident and the cleverness will follow.Use your body language to trick your brain into thinking it is confident, even if you aren't actually feeling that way. Stand tall and upright. Walk with a confident stride, like you belong wherever you are. Maintain open body language. Don't cross your arms across your chest, or refuse to look people in the eye.
Think positively or neutrally about yourself. If a thought like ""I am a loser"" or ""I am stupid"" comes into your head, acknowledge the thought and think ""I am thinking I am a loser, but just last week I got the coveted worker of the year award, or I have a really good job.""
Don't compare yourself to other people. For example: don't get into a cleverness competition with other people and start comparing your cleverness with their cleverness. Intelligence isn't a competition and by turning it into one, you're only going to feel worse about yourself as you irritate and drive away other people with your need to be ""the best.""

, It's good to know how to do things in the typical ways, especially so then you can subvert that thinking. By doing things in a way other people don't expect you'll demonstrate that you can think on your feet. That is one way people seem to judge cleverness.For example: if your professor gives you an essay assignment, ask them if you could do a creative option. Demonstrate how your option fulfills the requirements while going above and beyond. (If you're taking a class on short stories, ask if you could try your hand at writing a short story of your own using what you've learned in class, and write a follow-up piece examining your own work.)
This is also about doing the unexpected. If you always go by the rules or do things exactly as you learned them it doesn't mean you're not smart, it simply means that people aren't going to see you as clever. So, don't rely on your particular intelligence and typical ways of doing things.

, This step ties into not always going by the book, because a lot times you'll need to think outside the box to do that. To be clever you will need to come up with creative solutions to problems.


Re-conceptualize the problem. One thing that people who use creative solutions do effectively, is to re-imagine a problem. To practice this skill, take an obvious choice (like writing a plain old essay) and re-imagine how else you might approach the essay so that you still get the same information across, but in a different, more engaging way (telling a story orally, creating a collage or painting).Daydream. It turns out that daydreaming is actually incredibly beneficial to boosting creative problem-solving. The process of daydreaming helps you to form connections and recall information. This is why a lot of your best ideas may come out during the shower or right before you go to bed. If you're having difficulty with something, take a little time out to daydream. Chances are, by relaxing and letting your brain roam free, you'll come up with something creative that works.Brainstorming is another great way to foster creativity, especially in a group. Present the problem and have people give whatever ideas come into their head without passing judgement on these ideas. Have people add to the ideas as they come. You can do this on your own too, as long as you make sure to keep judgment out of the process., Fear is one of the biggest obstacles to creative thinking, which is one big aspect of cleverness. The more creative and workable your solutions and ideas, the more people will believe in your abilities.


Ask yourself things like: what happens if you lose your job? what if you lose your best customer? what if you fail your class? what if the publisher doesn't buy your book? The answer to any of these questions can either free you up from fear, or it can show where you need to work on your solutions, which in turn will open up opportunities and further ideas.
When you're coming up with ideas and potential solutions, don't open them up for criticism until they're more formed. Criticism and the fear of criticism can be a big creativity killer, which can kill your cleverness, too. When you're out of the brainstorming stage and better able to evaluate the ideas, that's when you get feedback and take criticism.

, Having problems and opportunities that are ill-defined and super vague can make it incredibly difficult to come up with punchy or creative solutions and ideas. Even if issues and things you need to deal with come to you without parameters, set some for yourself.Setting ""imaginary"" or ""pretend"" parameters can foster your ideas. For example, if you're working on a project for work pretend that you're out of money, how do you accomplish your task without it? Pretend you can't follow the rules, written or unwritten, how would you do things different? Pretend there's a fast time limit on coming up with your solution (say a 5 minute time limit)? What can you come up with in that short period of time?
For example, Dr. Seuss wrote Green Eggs and Ham because of a challenge from his editor to come up with a full book in under 50 different words. That restriction helped him come up with one of the best known Dr. Seuss books.

, Don't assume that you've reached a pinnacle of cleverness. There is no such thing. You'll need to constantly be learning, and a good way to do that is to study people who you or others find to be clever.


Ask yourself what makes them seem clever: do they have a pithy comment about everything? Are they able to come up with facts and figures on the spot? Do they present creative solutions?
Pick out some of the biggest traits of the clever people you know or observe and incorporate them into your own work and life.

, A lot of people who are considered to be clever, are good at keeping abreast of the latest developments in the world. They pay attention to what's happening and can talk knowledgeably (or appear to talk knowledgeably) about news and current affairs.


try to get multiple points of view, so you aren't just getting information from one source. For example: instead of only getting news from Fox news, check out other news stations, as well. Research the information, statistics, and ""facts"" that each news station (on the internet, on the radio, on the t.v., in print) presents. This will give a better, more balanced view, and help you to discuss the news in a more knowledgeable way.

, Words and the way they act together can make you sound more clever, because words are so important to communication. Wordplay includes things like puns, cryptograms, and simply using language in a way that opens up sensory details that other people might not have noticed.Practice describing things in unusual ways, and focus on the aspects that people might normally ignore. For example: describing fire as like silk, or coming up with a way to describe the sound of the waves on the shore.
Slip the occasional alliteration or pun into your words. Practice noticing them in other people's speech and pointing them out.

, One way to seem clever is to practice memorizing facts and information (like the ""pocket facts""), so that you're able to recall them with ease. Fortunately there are techniques you can learn to make fact recall easier.Pay attention to information the first time around. Make sure that you're getting the right information. You never actually lose information (except in cases of illness or injury), so you want to make sure that the information you're putting in is actually correct.
Write things down several times. Writing down facts or information you want to remember helps you to recall it more easily and makes it stick in your brain, in a manner of speaking. The more you practice writing something down, the easier it will be to remember.
Choose carefully. Sherlock Holmes once said that his mind was like an attic. Instead of storing everything you come across, right or wrong, pick the facts and information that interest you and will serve you well.
Try to put your hand up in class.

Fulfill your graduation requirements.,
Fulfill requirements to get into the university of your choice.,
Think about your parents.,
Remember that it’s almost over.,
Surround yourself with good influences.",How to Beat Senioritis1," Once your college or graduate school applications are in, it can be hard to stay motivated to keep your grades up. However, you still need to make sure you graduate. If you stop doing your homework or attending class, you could fail.Failing a class often means you’ll need to attend summer school. And that’s the last way you want to have to spend your summer vacation.;
, A university may have already accepted you, but that’s based on the GPA they saw on your transcripts. Many universities include a clause in their acceptance letters that stipulates that you must keep your grades up as a condition of admission.If a school accepted you partly based on your performance on a sports team or in another extracurricular activity, you’ll need to stay active in that through the end of the year or season.
Even if you don't plan to go to a university right now, you may one day. Keep your grades up until the end of the year to ensure a good GPA on your transcript.

, This might be a difficult one, but it’s important. For many students, parents will be footing at least part of the bill for college. They’ve supported you until now, and will hopefully continue to be a source of support. One way to show your gratitude is to show dedication to your studies.You and your parents will likely disagree on how you should balance your time as a senior.
You can say something like, “I know that me keeping my grades up is important to you. It’s important to me, too. I am really grateful for how much you have supported me through my education. I’m definitely going to keep up with my studies until graduation, but I’m sure you’ll understand that I want to have a little bit of freedom and fun, too. This is the last year that I’ll be able to spend time with my friends all together.”

, The time between now and graduation may seem like forever, but it’s not. Keep your eye on the prize and remember that the year will be over before you know it. It might be surprising, but actually focusing on your work and deciding to care about it can make it more pleasurable and can make the time pass more quickly.Throw mini parties with your friends to mark each month or quarter that passes. You’re now that much closer to graduation day.
Think about it this way: you made it through three other years. This one has to end eventually, too.

, The people you surround yourself with have a big influence on how you spend your time. Make sure that the friends you spend the most time with are good influences on you. That way, you can support each other in staying on task.


Plan work parties with your friends, or make plans to go celebrate or relax once you've finished a big assignment.
Friends who aren't good influences can be fun, too. However, don't get sucked into their bad habits.

Keep a “done list.” “To-do” lists can help you keep track of what you need to accomplish, but creating a “done” list can be just as important.,
Participate in class.",How to Be Happy on School Days1," Each Sunday, before school begins for the week, take some time to plan your schedule. Start by penciling in your classes and anything else you are required to do (such as a job, sports practice, or other specific obligations). Then in the space remaining, pencil in times for homework, exercise, and leisure. Look ahead to any big assignments and break them down over a few weeks. Following a schedule takes away the stress of not knowing how to get everything done, and makes for smoother and happier school days. Use a planner. Find a design with enough space to schedule everything you need.
Use different colors to designate different kinds of activities: such as yellow for class, blue for homework, green for exercise, and pink for leisure time.
An app or online planner can be an option too.;
, Schoolwork always turns out the best, and causes the least amount of stress, when it is completed in manageable chunks. It can be tempting, however, to put work off until the last moment. Work on avoiding procrastination, as putting things off will only induce stress and cause your school work to suffer.When you get a big assignment, break it up into small chunks, and give yourself mini-deadlines.
Try to remove any distractions. Go to a quiet place where you can work. Turn off notifications from your phone, email, or social media.
Try to work a little bit each day instead of thinking you can do it all at once.

, Trying to figure out what to wear every day can be a big source of stress and unhappiness, especially so early in the morning. Make it easy on yourself by planning your wardrobe for the week each Sunday. By spending this time prepping for your week, you will feel confident, comfortable, and happy each day.

Start by checking the weather.
Select an outfit for all five school days.
It may help to use a hanging storage rack in your closet, where you can store each outfit for the week.

, It is easy to keep yourself constantly busy with academic and extracurricular pursuits, but it is just as essential to your health and happiness to do something fun every day! School days can be packed with obligations, but carve out at least a little bit of time for something you really enjoy.Listen to fun music.
Spend some time joking around with a friend.
Work on a craft project like crocheting or collage.

, Whenever you feel overwhelmed by all that you need to do, stop and make a list of all the things you have already completed! Keeping a list of what you’ve done (instead of focusing solely on what you still need to do) reminds you of all your hard work, helps keep things in perspective, and makes for happier days at school., A big part of staying organized involves paying attention and participating while you are actually in class. Believe it or not, staying engaged in class discussion is the most effective way to make the time pass quickly! Additionally, if you are prepared to participate in class, you are less likely to dread attending.Set yourself up for success by reviewing what you will be covering in class ahead of time.
Be sure you have done any reading or other homework.
Come up with a couple of comments or questions so that you can easily get involved in the dialog.

If you're interested in becoming an exchange student, the first thing you should do is research programs that offer exchange trips to the country you want to live in.,
Make sure you meet any admissions requirements the program may have.,
Decide if you want to go for a trimester, a semester, or a full school year.,
Once you've found an agency that looks promising, look into the dates they offer for departures, their pricing and financial aid, and most importantly, how they select host families and how they will place you.

,
Find the application on the site, fill it out, and send it in at least 6 months before the deadline for the date you want to leave.,
If you can't afford the whole cost of tuition, apply for a scholarship or financial aid.,
Once all the dates are in order, your flight is booked, your records are transferred, and your host family has been selected, do a little more research.,
Talk to your school guidance office about what mandatory classes you need to take before/after your trip.,
Get some background knowledge on your host family through papers or letters the agency may have sent you, or by writing a letter or email to them.,
Start packing at least two weeks in advance.,
Bring a good amount of spending money.,
Look into getting your cell phone and your parents' cell phones programmed so you can make regular phone calls across continents.,
Have fun!",How to Be an Exchange Student," Google something like ""high school exchange programs to China"", and hopefully you'll get a few hits of agencies that place students from the US in other countries, or the other way around.;
, Most exchange program agencies require students to be a minimum age of 15, and some require you to have a GPA of at least 2.8 to be able to apply.

, Trimesters are often much cheaper, and you can get a good ""gist"" of a culture by being there a few months (usually 2 to 3.) Semesters are usually the best, because you're not away from home from too long and you usually have enough time to get a great experience of the culture, take some interesting classes, and they're cheaper than full school years. Full school years would definitely be the most culturally stimulating of the options, and you'd definitely get an amazing experience, but it comes at a considerable cost, and you'd be away from home for a good while (usually 9-10 months.)
,, Usually you'll hear back whether you're accepted or not accepted.

, Scholarships are usually given based on how high your GPA is, and financial aid is based on need. You could also do your part by getting a job (with reasonable hours) or fund raising.

, If you know the name of the school you'll be going to, research it online. Look into their classes, extracurriculars, and the surrounding city. This background knowledge will make you a little less nervous when it's time to leave.

, Usually you can get credit for the classes you take overseas, but if there's still a class you need to take that the school in your program country doesn't offer, take it before or after you leave.

, This will make it a lot easier to talk to them in person once you get there, and they won't seem like such strangers if you've had prior communication.
, Make a thorough check list of everything you'll need, and check it off as you go. As you'll be leaving for 3-10 months, you'll need to pack a LOT of stuff. Find the biggest suitcase in your house (if you don't have one, it might be a good idea to get one), and pack as much in it as you can. Be aware of any weight restrictions your airline has for baggage, and pack accordingly. Only pack things you really need (but of course things like books, magazines, iPods, and a few things that remind you of home are fine). If there is a weight restriction, try packing most of your things in a large suitcase you'll check at the airport, and packing the rest in a lighter bag you'll carry on the plane.

, You'll need a lot while you're there, and as it's a whole new country, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to money. Your host family will probably only provide you with food and a place to stay, and anything else you may need will be your responsibility to get. You will want to get a few hundred US dollars worth of your host country's currency to start out, and also bring a credit card (for larger purchases) and an ATM card to withdraw bills monthly.

, This will also provide you with a way to make calls and communicate with people while staying in your exchange country, and it will help you feel not so far away from home. You can also communicate through email and letters.

, This is very likely a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so be sure to make the most of it!

Practice working hard to prepare for next year.",How to Beat Senioritis2," If you feel sluggish and unhealthy, time can seem to drag on very slowly. Dedicate this year to staying (or getting) healthy. Eat healthy food full of protein to give you energy, and exercise to burn off excess energy when you’re feeling anxious about school.When summer comes, you’ll be glad you spent the year getting healthy. You’ll have plenty of energy and will feel good about yourself while having plenty of free time for adventures.

, Even if school seems like no fun right now, it does afford you access to certain things that you won’t have after graduation. Take advantage of these things while you can.If your school has a gym or a track, use it.
Spend quality time with a favorite teacher or mentor. Ask if you can help them with anything after school or ask their advice about colleges or careers.
Take out books from the school library.
Make an appointment with the school counselor to talk about your plans for next year or your career path.

, Spending time with friends is important. If most of the people in your friend group plan to move away or study elsewhere next year, this is the last time you’ll all be together for a while. Make time to be together in ways that are healthy and fun.Organize a graduation party with your friends.
You can put together a fundraiser, such as a car wash or a dance to raise money for a class trip.
Study for final exams together.

, If you’re going off to college or graduate school, or if you plan to join the military or another demanding profession, you’ll have your work cut out for you next year. Take this as an opportunity to practice dedication and hard work.Working hard is like anything else, it gets easier to do as you practice it.
Don’t overdo it. Remember that it’s okay to take breaks and have some fun when it’s appropriate.

Plan electives and extracurriculars in advance.,
Keep a daily checklist.,
Keep your goals manageable.,
Build in time for fun.",How to Beat Senioritis3," As a senior, you may have a very heavy course load or a very light one. Taking electives and signing up for extracurricular activities is what makes senior life fun. However, make sure you don’t pile on too many things. Leave yourself some time and space for relaxation.Before signing up for anything, make a calendar. Pencil in your classes and activities. Look hard at the calendar and consider how busy you actually want to be.
Try not to over commit. It’s better to not sign up for something than to sign up and have to quit. People may be relying on you once you’ve signed up.

, Each day, make a to-do list, or a schedule for your free time. The checklist can consist of things you have to do and also things that you want to do. When you complete a task, check it off. It will feel good. Your list can include things such as:Swim practice
Volunteer for one hour at ASPCA
Hang out with Angela
Help mom with yard work
Catch up on favorite TV show

, Getting to senior year is a big deal in itself. Reward yourself by not expecting this year to be the most challenging one yet. It’s great to have goals, but make sure they’re reasonable given how much time you’d like to spend relaxing or spending time with friends.If you have a specific goal, such as running a half marathon or being the editor of the year book, that's great. Make that your central goal for the year and keep other obligations or goals to a minimum.
You can also set smaller goals to accomplish each week or month. For example, maybe this month you’re going to volunteer 5 hours per week at the food pantry, and then next month you’re going to exercise everyday.

, Senioritis is sure to get worse if you don’t let yourself have some fun. While you don’t want to completely abandon your responsibilities and schoolwork, you do need to blow off some steam and enjoy the company of your friends.Schedule the fun into your calendar. Make weekend plans at the beginning of the week so that you have something clear to look forward to.
Make specific plans, rather than just planning to ""hang out.” Decide with friends that you’re going to see the local premiere of a cool movie, or go on a weekend camping trip.

Think of the big picture.,
Avoid drama.,
Talk about things that are bothering you.,
Cut other people some slack.,
Don’t take everything so seriously.,
Remember that classes will end eventually.",How to Be Happy on School Days2," You may have heard the phrase “don’t sweat the small stuff.” This notion can be the key to staying happy while you’re in school. When something upsets you (like a bad grade, an argument with a friend, or not making a sports team) stop, and try to put it in a bigger context. Chances are this one bad grade, argument, or rejection will not have a major long-term impact on your life. Think of your long-term goals.
Ask yourself if this one upsetting thing have any effect on them.
Chances are, the answer will be no. So don’t sweat it!

, A huge source of stress during school days is interpersonal drama. You can work to avoid this problem and stay happy if you make an effort to mind your own business.When conflicts arise that don’t necessarily involve you, try to stay out of it.
Don’t gossip! It may be tempting, but try not to talk about people behind their backs.
Don’t allow yourself to get pulled into arguments. Don’t let anyone pressure you to take sides.

, If something is on your mind, don’t bottle it up. If you are stressed about an upcoming assignment, you are upset with someone in your life, or you are disappointed about a bad grade you received, you can help yourself feel better by talking about it with a friend. A friend can help you come up with solutions, or just be a shoulder to cry on. Talking about the problem will always make you feel better, plus, talking through a problem helps you make a plan.If you are stressing about an assignment, talk about how to break the assignment down into parts over time.
If you are upset with a friend, go to that person directly and talk to them about what happened.
If you are disappointed about a grade, focus on the next assignment. Talk to your friend about ideas for how to improve.

, Nobody is perfect. You can improve the quality of your days at school if you do not spend them judging other people. The more you try to accept others, the more you will accept yourself, and the happier you will be. If you find yourself making a judgment about the actions or choices of somebody else, try to let it go. Remember that it’s not your problem., School days can be nothing but a series of obstacles, obligations, and important decisions. Or, you can make the choice to not take every little thing so seriously. When you look from a different perspective, life is pretty ridiculous! When you let go of the seriousness, school days can be happy and fun.When something stressful happens to you, try to find the humor in it.
Think of yourself ten years from now. What will that older version of you remember? How will they feel about the little things that are bothering you today?

, If you are stuck taking a course that you really don't like, remember that it's only temporary! Each semester is only a matter of weeks. You can stick it out for that long! You can track the number of weeks that remain in the semester in your school planner. This will have the added benefit of reminding you how close you are to mid-terms or finals.

Start the day with something you like.,
Look forward to an activity you enjoy.,
Go outside.,
Practice visualization.,
Listen to music.,
Journal your thoughts.,
Reinforce a positive attitude.",How to Be Happy on School Days3," The way you begin your day has a huge impact on the rest of your day. Get a good start by doing something that you like! Of course mornings are busy and rushed as it is, but carve out just a few minutes for something nice.Eat a yummy breakfast.
Listen to a great playlist while you get dressed.
Sit and enjoy a cup of tea.

, If you find yourself stuck in an unpleasant part of your day, think about another part of school that you actually like! This might be an after-school sports team or club, a class that happens later in the afternoon, or even your lunch break. Remember that all you need to do is be patient and make it through the tough moments, and later you'll be rewarded with the activity you enjoy. , Spending even just a little bit of time outside has been shown to reduce stress and help you feel happy. If you have the option to go outdoors during your school day, take it! If this isn’t an option for you, consider walking to school in the morning, or spend a little time outside in the afternoon. You can sit in a chair and read, go for a walk, or visit a favorite outdoor spot., If you find yourself getting overwhelmed or stressed out during your school day, you can do a visualization exercise in order to calm down.Close your eyes.
Relax your muscles.
Imagine a place that makes you feel happy. (Maybe this is a beach, or driving in a car with all the windows open, or even snuggled into your bed.)
Observe as many details as possible: What does it sounds like? What things do you see? Can you smell anything? How does the sand, blanket, or wind feel against your skin?
Spend a few minutes here.
Repeat this anytime you want to.

, Music is tied to our emotions. Sad music can makes us feel sad, and happy music can help us feel happy. Listen to some upbeat music as you get ready for school, on your way to school, or during a school break. This will lift your mood and give you a boost to make it through your day.

, One of the best ways to process negative thoughts (and promote positive ones) is to keep a journal. The therapeutic benefits to writing in a journal include helping you organize your knowledge, reduce your stress, and understand your emotions.Journaling can also be a good way to pass the time at school.


Find a notebook that you like.
Try to write in it once or twice during your school day.
Don’t shy away from negative emotions, but try to write down one thing you are grateful for each day.

, When you take on a positive attitude toward your teachers and classmates, they are more likely to display a positive attitude in return. Making an effort to be nice and pleasant can help your school day go by smoothly and quickly! Even you don't feel positive, faking it a little bit can have profound benefits for your health.Show gratitude. Thank your instructor for a nice lesson, or thank a friend for listening.
Compliment someone. Do you love a classmate's skirt? Tell her.

Remember to have fun.",How to Be a Successful Student," Successful students know how to succeed because they’ve made their studies their top priority. Though it’s important to make time for friends, family, extracurricular activities, and even some solo down time, you should never neglect the time you need to spend studying. If you have a big exam coming up and don’t feel prepared, then you should probably skip the big party two days before it. If you’re really behind on your French, then you may need to skip that new episode of Criminal Minds for the time being. This doesn’t mean that you can never do the things you want to do, but that you should recognize when studying should be at the top of your list.That said, you can’t ignore everything in the world just so you can study. If a friend or family member is having a crisis, you can’t ditch him or her just to study, either.;
, Develop the habit of judging time and learn how to arrive where you need to be on time. In fact, you should plan to be a bit early anywhere you go so you have time to get situated, focused, and ready to learn when you get there. Whether you have to take a test or have a study date with a friend, it’s important to be on time if you want to be a successful student., This means you should do your own work, avoid copying, and avoid cheating at all costs. Cheating won’t get you anywhere, and what may seem like a shortcut one day can actually get you into a lot of trouble the next. It’s never worth it to cheat on a test, and you’re far better off not doing well on an exam you’re not prepared for than getting caught cheating. And even if you’re not caught, cheating makes you think it’s okay to take shortcuts when it comes to life and studying, and it can lead to some bad habits down the line.


Don’t fall into peer pressure, either. In some schools, cheating is considered the norm, and it seems like so many kids are doing it that you might as well join in. This kind of group thinking is very dangerous and can keep you from reaching your potential.

, Successful students stay focused on the task at hand. If you have to study one chapter of your history book for an hour, you need to commit to doing so instead of letting your mind wander. If you need a break, take a short 10 minute one, but don’t let it run over into an hour long break with only 10 minutes of studying. You can actually train your mind to concentrate for longer and longer periods of time, so even if you feel like you can’t focus for more than 15 minutes straight, just work on building up to 20 minutes, and then building to 30 minutes and so on.That said, most people really shouldn’t focus or do one task for more than 60 or 90 minutes. Getting a 10-15 minute break in between those times can help you regenerate your energy and commit to focusing again.

, Successful students succeed on their own terms. They don’t care what their brother, neighbor, or lab partner does in school because they know that in the end, all that matters is their own success. If you get too bogged down in what other people are doing, then you’re bound to be disappointed in yourself or to become so competitive that your mind gets poisoned. Learn to brush the others aside and to focus on doing the best that you can do.

, If you want to be a successful student, then you shouldn’t aim to go from a “C” to an “A” average. Instead, you should work on going to a “C+” and then a “B-,” and so on, so your progress is manageable and so you don’t get disappointed. Successful students know that it’s hard to improve by leaps and bounds and focus on the details instead of jumping ahead to the final product. If you want to be a successful student, then you have to be okay with improving little by little.

, Successful students aren’t just machines who work to get “A”s no matter what. They actually care and are interested in the material that they study, and their passion for knowledge helps them improve. Of course, you can’t get excited about every little thing you’re learning, from photosynthesis to linear equations, but you can try to find something that you care about in every class. This will keep you focused and will make it more fun for you to learn.


If you really find something you’re passionate about in class, then you should do some outside reading to get even more excited about the topic. For example, if you loved reading The Sun Also Rises in class, try reading A Movable Feast or some of Hemingway’s other works on your own, too.

, If you want to be a successful student, then paying attention in class is absolutely crucial to your success. While you don’t have to love every single subject that comes your way, you should be motivated enough to listen to your teachers, to avoid texting your friends, and to be focused enough to really hear what your teacher is telling you, and to be able to pick up on the most important aspects of each lesson.


In order to pay attention, it’s important to keep your eye on the teacher.
If you’re confused about something, you can quickly ask for clarification. If the lesson goes on and you feel yourself getting more and more lost, it’ll be hard to pay attention.

, Taking notes is also crucial to your success as a student. Not only will taking notes help you study later, but doing so will also keep you engaged in the classroom, and will help you learn the material because you’ll have to jot it down in your own words. Some people even use different highlighters or pens to organize their notes as they take them to really help them absorb the material. Taking notes will make you feel more accountable in the classroom and will help you listen to your teachers.

, If you really want to succeed in the classroom, then it’s important that you ask your teachers questions, when it’s appropriate, in order to get a stronger understanding of the material. You shouldn’t interrupt the lessons, but you should ask questions if you really have them in order to avoid being confused and to prepare for your exams. Asking questions will also keep you active in the discussion and will help you learn the material, too.


At the end of each class, you can also review your notes and prepare questions to ask the next time if anything is unclear. Some teachers want you to wait until the end of the lecture to ask questions. If this is the case with your teacher, be respectful of that.

, If you want to succeed as a student, then it’s important for you to participate in class. You should not only ask questions when you have them, but you should also answer your teacher’s questions, be an active member of group activities, volunteer to help your teacher during class, and make sure to be as active as possible in the classroom so you can really get the most out of the learning experience. Participating will also help you develop a good relationship with your teachers, which will also help you in the classroom.


You don’t have to raise your hand after every question, but you should make an effort to talk when you have something to say.
Participation is important in group work, too. Successful students work well by themselves and with others.

, If you want to make the most of your learning experience, then you should try to focus as much as you can. Avoid sitting next to your friends or chatty students, and put away your food, your magazines, your phone, or anything else that is keeping you from your studies. You can reward yourself by talking to your friends, reading your magazines, or doing whatever else you do for fun later, but you can’t let it get in the way of your study habits.


If other students are an easy distraction or you feel like you might just talk to them because you're bored of the current topic, ask the teacher if you could move seats. If not, try your best to ignore the distraction and if they continue, ask them politely to stop.
Try not to think about one class when you’re sitting in another. Be present in the room you’re in and worry about the next class when you get there.

, Another way to really succeed in the classroom is to develop strong connections with your teachers. While you don’t want to suck up or attempt to become best friends with them, building a strong rapport with your teachers can help you when you need to ask them for extra help and can also make you gain a stronger interest in the material. Work on showing up to class on time and following your teacher’s rules so that you can make the most of your studies.


Don’t worry about people thinking you’re the teacher’s pet if you’re nice to your teachers. You’re just making an effort to be a better student.
If your teachers like you more, they’ll be more willing to help you and to answer your questions, and will be more understanding if something comes up.

, If you’re in a classroom where you can choose your own seats, then you should think about sitting toward the front of the room, near the teacher. This will help you focus since it’ll be harder to get distracted or to do something other than pay attention when the teacher is right there. It’ll also help you build a stronger bond with your teacher, especially if you’re in a large lecture hall, because teachers tend to engage more with the people who are sitting in front.


Don’t worry about people thinking you’re a brown noser. You’re just doing the best you can to absorb the material you need to know.

, Take the opportunity to gain extra credit whenever possible. A lot of schools especially as you get older don't offer a lot of extra credit so grab it whenever possible., One way to succeed when you study is to have a solid game plan before each study session. This will ensure that you’re focused, that you meet your goals, and that your sessions are productive. Block off your studying in 15 or 30-minute chunks of time and write a list of what you will do during each time period, whether you’re studying flashcards, reviewing your notes, or taking practice tests. This will keep you from feeling overwhelmed or unmotivated.


Having a list that you can check off will make you more motivated. You’ll feel accomplished and focused as you check each item off your list.

, Another important method for succeeding in your studies is to make sure that you have a planner and that you block off study time in advance. You should make sure to make time for studying most weekdays and even on the weekends, when it’s necessary. Though you don’t want to bite off more than you can chew, you want to avoid filling your calendar with social events and extracurricular activities and ending up with no time to study.


If you make a point of blocking off time to study, then you won’t end up planning social events during that time, which will keep you from studying. You may not even realize that your social calendar is booked until you try to make time for your studies.
You can even set a monthly schedule to make sure you take your material week by week, especially if you have to review for a big exam.

, There are different types of learners out there, and not every type of learning, such as using flashcards or taking thorough notes, is best for every type of learner. It’s important to be aware of your learning style so that you can best tailor your studying to suit your needs. Many people are actually a combination of different learners, so multiple styles may appeal to you. Here are some of the most common learning styles and some tips for studying:


Visual learners. If you’re a visual learner, then you learn by using images, pictures, and spatial understanding. Charts, diagrams, and color-coded notes may work best for you. When you take notes, flow charts or even some relevant drawings may be more effective than large blocks of words.
Auditory learners. These types of learners learn best by listening. Try recording your lectures and repeating them, or really honing in on your teachers words and taking some notes later. You can also repeat your notes or the course materials to yourself or talk to experts or participate in group discussion to study more effectively.
Physical or kinesthetic learners. These learners learn best when they use their bodies, their hands, and their senses of touch. You can learn by tracing words to reinforce the subject matter, memorizing notes by walking, or by using any activities that make you move around or touch things while learning.

, You may be surprised to find that breaks may be the key to your success. No one can study for eight hours straight, not even that person is super driven or has an IV of coffee steadily pumping in his veins. In fact, breaks are crucial for successful studying because they’ll allow your mind to rest so that you can return to your studies feeling motivated and energized. Plan to take a break every 60 or 90 minutes, and do something that will allow you to rest your eyes, have some nourishment, or get some fresh air.


Successful students know when they need to rest. They can sense when they’re getting tired or when studying is no longer productive. Don’t think it’s lazy for you to take a break and remember that it’s really the best you can do for your studies.

, If you want to study as successfully as possible, then you need to be able to avoid distractions when you get ready to study. This can mean avoiding studying with an unproductive friend, turning off your phone, or making sure you only use the Internet to help you study, not to check up on your celebrity gossip. Though it can be impossible to avoid distractions entirely, you can make an effort to minimize them before you even sit down to study, which will help you focus and not get off-track.


You can even disable your Internet if you don’t need it to study to keep yourself from being distracted. If you really don’t need your phone, you can turn it off, too.
If something is worrying you, then devote time to figuring it out and then get back to your studies if you can. If you feel bothered all day, then you won’t be able to get your work done.

, Your study environment can be crucial to your success as a student. However, everyone is different. Some people like to study in their rooms, with absolute silence. Others like to study on a blanket outdoors, blasting their favorite music. Some people like to study in the library or in a coffee shop, where they are surrounded by other people doing the same. Try a variety of different studying environments to see what works best for you.


If working in a loud coffee shop hasn’t been going well lately, then try studying in the quiet of your room or even at a park where you can feel alone.

, Another way to get the most out of your study sessions is to make sure you use the resources that are available to you. Talk to your teachers, your librarians, and your knowledgeable friends to get help on any materials you don’t understand. Use your library and your online resources to supplement your studies; check out the extra problems in the back of your textbook to get a deeper understanding of the material. Do what you need to do to take advantage of all of your resources to succeed.


Successful students are also creative. When they can’t get all the answers they need from a textbook, they look for other people, places, or online sites that can help them.

, Some people do even better in school when they have a study buddy or a study group. Working with other people can help you feel motivated and like you’re not so alone in your studying efforts. You can also learn from other people, and can even learn by teaching others what you know. Though working with a partner or a group doesn’t work for everyone, you should give it a try to make the most of your studies.Not everyone is a social learner. You can test the water by studying with a friend and then inviting more students to join in.
Make sure your study group is directed and organized, so you don’t end up getting off-topic too much. If you feel the group getting off-topic, don’t be afraid to kindly say something.

, Though it may sound like fun is beside the point when it comes to being a successful student, it can actually be the key to your achievements. Just as taking breaks during a study session can help you focus more on your studies, taking breaks from studying completely to do yoga, hang out with your friends, watch a movie by yourself, or just to relax can help you regain the energy you’ll need to really succeed in school.


Having fun doesn’t keep you from being a successful student. In fact, making time for fun allows you to study better when the time comes.
Making time for your friendships will also let you relax a bit more about getting an imperfect grade. If your studies are your only interest, then you’ll be putting too much pressure on yourself.

Establish goals.,
Identify your next career move.,
Make a plan.",How to Be Successful in Your Career1," It is always better to have a destination before you begin a trip. Lay out your career goals by differentiating between short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. Your short-term goals should support and lead to your medium term goals, which then do the same for your long-term ones. When writing your goals, remember to be as specific as possible, including time limits and measurable levels of success, like a certain position or annual salary. You might consider some of the following questions when working up your plan:What is your passion, and does your current job feed it?
Does your current lifestyle and job make you happy, or do you find yourself wanting something different?
What does success look like to you?
For example, ""In three years, I want to be an assistant manager, foreman, etc."" might be a medium-term goal on the way to the long term goal, ""In ten years, I want to be a Vice President."";
, Since you’re building your career, where do you want to go? You’ll need to determine if you want to stay at the same institution or company, or if you will need to find somewhere else. Decide what kind of change you want to make, whether it is a lateral move at a bigger company, a move up at a similar company, or a switch to nonprofits, and start doing research. How often do the kinds of jobs you want come up? This can often be key in planning a next move, if the kind of job you want is rare. When one comes up, you will need to pursue it strongly.

, You can start with where you want to be in the next year or few years, and then craft a plan for your career as a whole. Discuss your career with your mentor and family. Figuring out how you want your career to turn out on your own is one thing, but a mentor and your own family can often have different perspectives. Talk to others to see how feasible your ideas seem to them. Create a timeline for your plan with goal milestones and planned actions at certain points.

Think about what you're good at and what you're not so good at.,
Show your interest in the subject matter.,
Stay organized and neat.,
Be timely.,
Remember to take time for yourself.,
Treat your peers with kindness and compassion.",How to Become a Star Pupil," Think about the areas that you need to work on. Is it your organisation? Do you need to hand your essays in on time? Figure out your weak points, and brainstorm strategies for overcoming or getting around them.;
, Raise your hand often, and participate in class discussions. Consider taking initiative to learn more outside of class. Your teacher will appreciate your effort.


Study regularly, so you stay on top of the material.
Teachers also like pupils who try to find out more about the subject, not just what you're learning. Find something that particularly interests you about the subject matter: for example, if you're discussing civil rights in history class, maybe you'd love to read about the disability rights movement. You can then use your improved knowledge in class discussions and essays.
At the end of the semester, if you are close to specific grade but not quite there, your teacher may decide to bump you up if you participated a lot. For example, a B+ could turn into an A- for effort.

, Keep your books and assignments organized, and maintain a clean desk that is comfortable for studying.


Come up with a clear organization system for your books and papers, so that you don't lose anything. (For example, science is the pink folder, history is the blue folder, homework is the red folder...)
Make sure that your handwriting is large and neat enough to read.
Take good care of your books and papers. Try to avoid bending or scuffing them.
Develop good study habits, so you stay prepared.
Look neat—shower regularly, use deodorant, tuck in your shirt, and wear clothes that are comfortable and the correct size.

, Set your alarm early, so that you can take your time getting ready for school, and don't be late. Turn in your homework on (or before) the due date, and if there is an emergency, explain and ask for an extension. Teachers tend to be understanding, especially if you have a health situation or family emergency that is interfering with your work.

, School is important, but not all-consuming, and it's important to maintain balance in your life. Engage in your hobbies, hang out with your friends, and give yourself plenty of time to relax.


Don't worry about one bad test score, missed assignment, or snag in your quest for academic greatness. You are human, not a knowledge-gathering machine, and bad days happen to everyone. It's important not to let your desire for achievement ruin your mental health.

, If you act like others are beneath you, people will quickly stop liking you. However, if your teachers see you treating others with respect, they'll recognize what a good person you are.

Keep notes for each subject in one place so you can find everything easily when it comes time for a test.,
Use a Colour coding technique.",How to Become a Great Notetaker," Having the right stationary e.g. notebooks, highlighters, sticky notes, pens, pencils...etc. Can help you take notes as each writing implement can offer a different technique. For example: highlighting a particular word or phrase emphasizes it making it stand out from the rest, therefore giving it meaning. (The meaning can depend on you, it could be: a word you need to know the definition of, a formula, feature... whatever you like.);
, It is an absolute necessity that you actively engage in class lectures. Your role as a note taker is to record all the information you deem crucial, regardless of where that information came from. This means the questions and concerns brought up by your instructor, as well as your classmates, should be recorded to ensure your success as a note taker.

, Considering how fast-paced learning environments tend to be, it may be difficult for you as a student to record all the information presented by your professor. The information you are bypassing can sometimes be crucial and hold severe repercussions towards your success. As a note taker it is imperative towards your success that you do not leave out any essential information, regardless of how small it is. Similar to slang, shorthand allows you to abbreviate words and phrases to make it easier for you to record. Not only is this type of writing faster, but it can also be a lot easier as well. While this may be grammatically incorrect, the point of note taker is to record information in the most effective manner, regardless of grammar.

, If you do not know what your notes are about when you come to revise from them it will not make sense at all, thereby being pointless as it could be talking about anything at all. So, before your teacher/ professor begins teaching, write down the topic and title. It's a bonus if you decide to give sub-headings throughout. This will help for when surprise tests come along.

, Instead of trying to write down everything that's on the board or what the teacher is saying, try to find the really important facts. So, try skim reading the board or listen carefully to what is being said. If you have a teacher who writes notes on the board, that's a bonus: You can copy them down. If not, Does your history teacher mention the date of a key conference? Does your English teacher give examples of Shakespeare's use of dramatic irony and techniques? Does your math teacher go over a particular formula? Write it down straight away!

, As previously mentioned do not right down everything as most of it will be useless and your unfortunate and will be cramping terribly. A little tip is to come up with an abbreviation system, for instance 'respiration' will be 'resp.' for short. However, make sure you know it because if not, you'll be trying to crack the De Vinci Code.

, Don't be afraid to ask the teacher to repeat something you missed. Chances are your classmates will be relieved to hear the information again if your teacher is covering a difficult topic or just going to fast. However, if you don't like the idea of asking within class-time, see your teacher afterward. It's much easier than wondering if you got the notes right as you study. Also this will help you get a stronger bond with your teacher.

, Going over your notes with a friend and comparing what the two of you put down can help reinforce what you're learning alongside, seeing if they have any key information that you missed. It also can help you remember information when it's time for the test. And going over your notes will alert you and your friend to any errors.

, Depending on how neat your handwriting is you may want to recopy your notes when you get home. If you've taken notes in a hurry, you're more likely to figure out an unreadable word or sentence on the day of the lesson than you are weeks later when you look back over your notes in preparation for a test. This may be either in another notebook or on the computer. Just in case of any computer troubles, always back it up!

, This may be in a drawer, binder or shelf. Some people combine the copying technique with organization by using just one notebook for class notes and then copying these notes into a notebook for each subject when they get back home. Make sure you do it regularly if you don't your notes will be all over the place and things will get totally crazed when it's time to study for the test.

, This is a method in which you would write and/or underline particular words or phrases in another colour to represent either: a date, formula, case study...etc.

Learn your job.,
Develop good habits.,
Take initiative.,
Present solutions, not just problems.,
Assess your progress.,
Change your course.",How to Be Successful in Your Career2," Any new job requires a training and adjustment period. Ask as many questions as you need to in order to really understand what you’re doing and what is expected of you. If possible, talk to the person who did your job before and ask for suggestions. Take notes if it’s difficult to keep everything straight. Figure out how your co-workers’ jobs fit into the company so that you know who to ask about what.


Does your job change based on the time of year? If so, figure out how it’s going to change before it gets crazy.
What are the specific duties of your job, and are they written down? If so, it can be useful to refer back to what is required of you as you’re getting a handle on what your work entails. If they aren’t written down already, write them down yourself.
Who do you report to? Do you go through the same person each time?

, Start off well and show your boss and co-workers that you are a good and reliable worker. Show that you are invested in your work and work well as part of a team.Be punctual, in both arriving at work and hitting deadlines.
Complete your tasks so that others can complete theirs.
Listen carefully and respectfully to coworkers and your boss. Incorporate their suggestions into your work where required or appropriate.
Keep your personal and work life separate.

, Identify tasks and skills you want to acquire to move further in your career. Talk to your boss and co-workers about ways to help you gain new work experiences that can help you. Think about ways you could work with other departments or groups to gain new experiences and work with new people., All of us need help at work at different times, and it often turns out that you go to your coworkers and bosses with problems, not solutions. Rather than just ask for help, think through possible answers to your problem, and present them as well., Make sure you keep track of the work you do, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Every 3-6 months, write a few paragraphs about what you have achieved in that time, and include any numerical data about your work, like the number of accounts secured, amount of money in grant funding, or other measurable metrics. Even though it won’t appear in this form on your resume, it’s a good way to track your progress. It can also be a great point of discussion for you and your mentor.You can also assess your progress by writing about:


Are you doing well and feeling fulfilled at your job? If not, what could change so that you would feel that way? Is the work easy or challenging?
Think about whether this is a job that you are willing to stay in long-term, or if you feel like starting a new job search immediately. Sometimes it’s worth sticking with a job so that you can show you followed through with a long-term project, for example, even if it’s not fulfilling to you, realizing that it’s important to learn how a project comes to fruition.
On the other hand, if you are unfulfilled, poorly compensated, and with no possibility for advancement, you probably should start looking for a new job as soon as possible.

, If you're not achieving as much as you had hoped in your current position or career trajectory, it may be time to reassess your strategy. For example, you can seek a new job or even a new career that more closely matches your goals, skills, and interests. In the same way, note where and how you were able to achieve the most success and do it more often.


Reassess your goals and motivations regularly to make sure you're still headed where you want to go. If you aren't, make a change immediately.

Be clear about what you want.,
Identify possible candidates.,
Solicit primary candidates.,
Interview each candidate.,
Select mentors.",How to Be Successful in Your Career3," Do you want someone with whom to discuss both life and personal choices? This would necessarily be different than a person with whom you have a specifically professional relationship. What kinds of information do you want to discuss with your mentor, and what kinds of advice do you think you need? You need to be sure you know what exactly you want before pursuing a mentor., Start by thinking of four or five possible mentors, as it’s possible that some will be unable or unwilling to act as a mentor for you. If you don’t have some kind of relationship with each person, initiate contact. Ask to become part of their network, email them with some kind words about their work, or ask a mutual friend to introduce you. Establish some kind of relationship with each person.


Assess possible mentors by what they can offer you. Look for people who you can easily talk to and be friendly with first, as friendship is the basis of a successful mentorship.
Narrow your candidates by thinking about who can give the best advice. Which of them has been where you are now and can give guidance and help you through the challenges of your career?
Finally, consider finding a mentor that can offer sponsorship. A sponsoring mentor promotes you to the upper levels of your industry or company and can help you move up the ladder. In this case, you'll want to narrow your mentor search to within the company.

, Tell him or her the kind of skills or advice you are hoping to gain from him or her. Realize that he or she might be too busy to take you on in a mentee relationship, so have a gracious response ready for that scenario. If your first choice is unavailable, move to the next person on the list and ask again. If the person is local, meet face to face to ask if he or she will be your mentor. If you have a long-distance email relationship with the person, write a formal email to ask. Some possible approaches might be:Dear Ms. X, I have admired your work since I first saw your “Bingo!” campaign and realized I wanted to work in advertising. I am currently working at ZVT but hope someday to own my own agency as you do. I am looking for career advice and wondered if you would be open to giving me advice occasionally as a business mentor. I realize that you have a busy career, but I hope you will consider my offer.
Dear Mr. J, As a fellow alum of the Wharton School, I have been impressed by stories about your business acumen for years. I’ve recently moved to the Bay Area and am looking for career advice in your field. Would you be open to getting drinks with me one night and answering some of my questions? I know that you are a very busy man with many other colleagues wanting your advice and mentorship, but I hope that we can find a time to meet.

, Mentoring requires a close personal relationship, so the interview should be used as a time to see if a potential relationship would be mutually satisfactory. This means that the interview should go both ways, with both parties asking questions of each other. You can start by asking for advice. Ask all of them a work-related question and see their response.


Did they give good advice in a way that made sense to you? Did they perhaps not even respond? How the possible mentor responded can tell you a lot about their suitability. If they didn’t even respond, chances are they would not be a good mentor., Figure out which of the people you think would be the best fit for you. He or she might not be the one at the highest point in their career, but instead someone you could see having a close working relationship with. Know that you can, and should, have more than one mentor. For example, you could have one mentor at work and one outside of work. Most successful people have the guidance of more than one mentor and benefit from the multiple perspectives offered to them.

Review your current employment.,
Consider the consequences.,
Prepare a strong job application or resume.,
Find employment opportunities.,
Do the research.,
Practice interviewing.,
Consider your job offer.,
Respond professionally.",How to Be Successful in Your Career4," Figure out exactly why you are leaving your current job. Is it for more money, due to a lack of advancement opportunities, a bad relationship with your employer/boss, or for another reason? Try to understand what you liked about existing job and what you disliked about it. Consider your own failures in your current position and what you might do differently in a new position.


Use what you learn to inform your search for a new job. You may
You may wish to jump to a new career path by making a ""lateral"" move to a position with the same pay as your current job. This can give you a change of pace and set you on the path to greater success in the future.
However, you should think about whether a lateral move is worthwhile in the long term. Will your new trajectory be worth the lost growth opportunity in your old career path?

, There may be unintended consequences or costs of your job search. Finding a job can takes months of applications and planning. Look at a variety of job sites in your area to be sure that you see all of the possible openings in your chosen field. You should also consider what your current employer will think of your job search. Specifically:


Will your search be confidential?
What will be your employer's reaction?
Are you bound by employment contract or non-compete?

, Make sure you are clear on what they are asking for and explain how you are well-qualified for the position. Even if you don’t get the job, you might be working with the people at the company to which you applied at some point in the future, and you want to show your professionalism.Have someone else read and proofread your application documents. A second pair of eyes will help to identify any mistakes you may have made.
Focus on quality over quantity by focusing on specific jobs for which you are qualified and submitting exactly the information in the format they want.

, If you’ve decided to move on from your current job, reach out to friends and colleagues in similar positions elsewhere. Let them know what you’ve been doing. If you are close, confide that you are considering making a job change and are starting to look for other work, in case they have any ideas.


Utilize your professional network by asking former colleagues and/or clients about job opportunities at their companies. You can also check the companies' websites for job posting then ask your contacts for referrals.
You can do the same thing with your social network, including friends and family.
In addition, try checking out online employment sites like Monster, Indeed, and Glassdoor.
You might also consider hiring a professional headhunter to find a good position for you. Your mentor may be able to recommend one that they have worked with in the past.

, Sometimes the job we think we want isn’t actually the job we do want. To increase your understanding of the position, research the industry and specific position online. Look at job satisfaction, salary expectations, growth potential, and other factors that might be important to you. Then research the potential employer. Are employees generally happy with their experience there and the company's management? Finally, make sure to look into occupational requirements if you are changing careers.


You can gain an even better look at a potential company with informational interviews.
Informational interviews with people who have already had success in your chosen career can be very helpful in steering you toward jobs and giving real-world advice.
Prepare yourself well for an informational interview. There might be opportunities at some point at your interviewee’s workplace, and you want to make a good impression., Different jobs will require different types of interview, from a 15-minute chat to multiple days of interviews and events. Be sure you know what kind of interview you will be attending and start preparing yourself.Do research on the company or institution at which you’ll be interviewing. You want to be prepared for their questions about how you will fit there, and have your own questions for them.
Make a list of possible questions and have a friend do a mock interview with you. If it doesn’t go well, do it again.

, You might receive multiple offers, or you might wait a long time for just one. Regardless of your situation, you need to decide what you are willing to accept in terms of compensation, benefits (or lack thereof), room to move up within the same company, etc. No job is perfect, and few of us stay in our first jobs for the rest of our lives. Think about whether the job you are considering is right for your career path, or if you want to stay where you are.

, Whether you take the job or not, be sure to always respond professionally to all offers. Be respectful, grateful, and polite to the hiring managers you correspond with during this time. This also includes leaving your current employment. There is no need to burn bridges when you depart for your new job. Who knows when you'll need a recommendation or favor from a previous colleague.

If your school doesn't have an activity, start it!",How to Be a Smart Student," Whether it's two weeks before school or two weeks before school ends, organize your materials. This means your folders, your binders, all your papers, and everything you need for every class. Being organized makes the actual work so much easier. Here are a few ideas:


Buy small binders for every class. On the inner flap, put the syllabus. Then start organizing your homework and the sheets your teacher gives you in chronological order, if possible.
Keep specific materials you need (markers, scissors, etc.) organized by class. Every binder should have a pen and a highlighter, too.
Throw some stuff out! If your locker looks like a paper hurricane just hit it, clean it out! The less stuff you have to sort through to get to what you want, the more time you save to do other, more important, things.;
, You know how they say never to work in bed? That's because if you work in bed, it suddenly becomes a place for work and not for sleep – we associate activities with where we do them. To take advantage of this, make a place at home just for studying. When you get there, your mind will go into the studying zone automatically, because it's the only association it has with that place.


Have you ever heard of context-dependent memory? That's when your memory finds it easier to recall things in the place where it learned them.So if you study there one night, studying there the next will make it easier to recall what you studied before!
If you can, have more than one study space – the library, at a friend's house, etc. Research says that the more places you study, the more connections your brain has and the easier it is to remember the facts you study., Most teachers (from 6th grade to college) will supply you with a list of books needed for the year before the school year starts, or at least at the very beginning. Get this list and get on getting your textbooks. Then, ruffle through them and get familiar with how they're set up. Start reading the first chapters as soon as possible, whether it's assigned or not.


If your teacher doesn't give you this list, ask! He or she will be very impressed with the initiative you took and how seriously you're taking their class. You may become a favorite!

, Your teacher probably has a book or two he or she didn't put on the list, but almost did. This book can make for good supplemental reading, which will help you understand whatever it is you're studying and give you a fuller picture.


This is true for everything from math to history to art. There's always more reading you can do to wrap your mind around a topic, regardless of what it is.

, Start a conversation with your teachers about their class. What do they emphasize (participation, originality, reading, etc.)? What will make it easiest to succeed? Do they do extra credit? Do they do a lot of group work? Will there be a lot of writing in class? Knowing these things can help you understand what's expected of you.


This also establishes a relationship with your teacher from early on. You'll be the one who cares about their grade and is trying their best. When grading time rolls around and you're at an A- on the edge of an A, your teacher may give you the benefit of the doubt because you're a good student and bump you up to an A!

, If you're writing down every single word your teacher says, A) you're going to get so bored and B) you're going to have far too many notes to go over at home. Instead, stick to the important stuff and make it fun! Here are a few ideas:


Turn sentences into charts or pictures. Germany in 1941 was 60% Jewish? Turn it into a pie chart. It'll be easier to see in your notes, too.
Use mnemonics to help you remember. What are the colors of the rainbow? Why, Roy G. Biv of course! (Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain)
Use highlighters. The more color your notes have, the more fun they'll be to read. Develop a color-coding system to help you find stuff quicker, too.

, Most students seem to either not do the readings at all or sort of skim them during class while the teacher is talking about them. Don't be that student! Whether it seems important or not, always do the reading before class. In class you'll know exactly what's going on for when your teacher ends up calling your name.


If you don't know what the reading was, look at your syllabus. There's a reason it should be in the front flap of your binder – it should have listed every piece of homework or reading and when it's going to be talked about. A quick look at that piece of paper and you'll know exactly what to do.

, If you want to actually understand your homework, do it thoroughly, and get the best grade on it possible, you can't do it on the ride to school the morning of. When you get home that night, sit down and get it over with. Then you can go watch TV, play video games, and not worry about it the next morning.


If you have a long time to do a certain piece of homework, that means it's probably bigger than usual and important. Do a bit each day after you get it – that way the work is spread out and you don't feel swamped.

, Lots of teachers give points just for showing up. Why give those points up when all you have to do is walk in the door? But beyond that, lots of teachers give participation points, too. Raise your hand even if you don't know the answer – your teacher will appreciate you trying your hardest.


Besides, if the teacher thinks you're not paying attention, she might ask you a question and you might not know how to answer because you have not been paying attention! The less you embarrass yourself, the better!

, Everybody needs something to work towards. If you don't have goals, you won't know what it is you want to get done. To motivate yourself, make concrete goals you can reach for. Straight As? An hour of studying each night? X number of pages read throughout the week? They can be whatever you think would keep you going.


Talk to your parents about how they can help or reward you. If you get all straight As, could you get that video game you've been hoping for? Extended curfew? You need all the motivation you can get!

, School is hard, especially when you have other things to balance in your life, too. Sometimes even smart kids need a tutor. Talk to your teacher, counselor, or parents about getting a tutor to help you get awesome grades and focus. Sometimes older students do it for their school credit for free, too.


You can also ask your older siblings or parents to help you, too, if they're good at a certain subject. Just make sure they wouldn't distract you and can actually help you get work done.

, Studies have shown that students that work in groups of 3-4 (no more) get better test results than those who study alone or in large groups.So grab 2-3 friends and make plans for studying. It'll be more fun than studying alone, anyway!


Make sure the people you're studying with are good students that care. You don't want to be working with a few people who just want to mess around during your ""study group"" time.
Have everyone bring snacks and think of a few things to talk about. Make a rough schedule of what you're going to cover and delegate a person as that week's group leader, so they can help keep everyone on track.
If it's a Friday night and you have a test in a class on the following Monday, gather up 2-3 of your friends that are in your class and quiz each other. If a person gets a correct answer, then they get 2 points, if they get a wrong answer, they get 1 point taken away. Whoever gets the most points at the end of the study session get to pick a movie to watch!

, Whether it's a big test or project, the last thing you want is to have to do it all in the 1 or 2 days before its due. Start on it a week or two beforehand to make sure you have plenty of time in case things were to go wrong. Better safe than sorry!


When it comes to tests, you should be studying a little bit every day about a week or so beforehand. The more days you spend studying, the more times your brain has to recall it, making the connections in your brain stronger and more reliable.

, Some teachers have great extra credit policies, where you can do a little extra work that can get tacked onto your test or project score. If you're looking for a little extra nudge in the right direction, talk to your teacher about doing extra credit. It can't hurt!


And other times this extra credit will just be tacked onto your year-end score. That's good, too! With extra-credit, you really can't go wrong.

, The verdict is in: cramming for tests makes your scores worse.Why? Your brain can't function on little to no sleep, making it impossible to remember what you've studied all night for. So don't do it! You can study a bit in the morning if you absolutely have to.


Your body needs sleep (7-9 hours, depending on your specific preferences). A lot of being a good student is about taking care of yourself, too! So skip the cramming, go to sleep, and eat a healthy breakfast. Studies show eating a good breakfast can power your brain and get you better grades, too!, If you want to learn something, it makes sense to think, ""study, study, and study some more until you have it down."" In actuality, that's not how it works – our brains literally fry. If you take breaks (10 minutes every hour), your attention and memory is improved.So when you're studying for that big exam, take breaks! You'll actually be doing your grades a favor!


During your break, grab a handful of blueberries, nuts, broccoli, or even dark chocolate for a brain boost.Snacking can give you more energy if you're feeling a little fatigued, too.

, You know those 10 minutes you spent today waiting for the bus? The few minutes you had before each class yesterday? Those are all little opportunities you could be using to study. And it all adds up! So keep materials like flashcards with you that you can bust out at any given time.


This is especially good if you have a friend with you during this time you can study with. You can each give each other a few flash cards and quiz each other. When you're reading and talking about the information, it becomes more solidified in your mind.

, To be a ""smart"" student, that means you'll be smart about college and your resume, too! In today's day and age, you've got to have it all, and a great way to do that is to volunteer. It shows prospective colleges and employers that you're not only smart, but you're a good person, too! Here's a few places to consider:


Hospitals
Nursing homes
Homeless, battered women's, or children's shelters
Animal shelters
Soup kitchens
Churches

, On top of having great grades and volunteering, the ideal student is involved in extra-curriculars – both athletics and drama, music or art. This shows that you're well-balanced and can do it all. Most kids can't!


No one said you had to be good at these things. If you're a star basketball player, take an art class or try out for the school play. If you're in the school choir and can't throw a ball to save your life, try out for the soccer team. It's only for a season!

, On top of everything else, consider joining a group or club that speaks to something you care about. Does your school have an environmental club? LGTBAU group? A creative writer's group? Join! This shows you take an active part in your school when it comes to things you care about.


What's more, these are some of the easiest organizations to find leadership roles. Saying you're the ""president' of something is pretty impressive!

, Not only does taking different kinds of classes show the world that you have many interests and are good at lots of things, it's a load off on you, too! Imagine taking 8 math classes and nothing else – you'd be pretty fried. So mix it up with your core classes like English and math, and then add in some interesting ones like history or robotics, and some fun ones, like cooking or woodshop, too.


If your school doesn't have a class you want to take, a lot of schools have partnership programs where you can take the class at a different school or local community college. And if you're in high school, you may even be able to get college credit!

, Plenty of small schools (and some large ones) are lacking in certain activities. Either the funding has been cut or the draw just wasn't there before. If you see a hole in your school's extra-curricular offerings that could be filled, talk to your principal about starting something. The fact that you started an entire organization on your own is incredibly impressive! Here are a few ideas:


A school-wide recycling program
A thespian, chess, or writer's club
LGTBAU group
Pre-SAT or ACT study organization
Technology club

Don't look out the window, or at the kids next to you, or at the phone you're trying to hide under your desk. Look at your teacher and what is being presented.


Look at the board at least, or find something at the front of the room to focus your eye on if your'e bored and struggling to pay attention. Look forward, toward the front of the room.;
, If you want to look like you're paying attention, sit up as straight as possible. Push your butt back in the chair and keep your back straight. Put your feet flat on the floor and your hips underneath you.


Don't fiddle with things. You don't need to mess around with your hands. Just cross them in front of you or take notes.

, When your teacher asks you to do something, do it. If you're supposed to get out your book and turn to a specific page, get out your book and turn to that page. If you're supposed to get into a group, get into a group with people around you as quickly as possible. Do it when you're asked, without messing around or hesitating.


At the same time, don't do things your'e not asked to do. Unless you're told to talk to your neighbors, no goofing around.

, Anytime you're unsure about what's going on, or if you have a follow-up question, ask it. Contribute to the conversation that's happening in class. Raise your hand and wait to be called on to ask questions properly. If you have a question, chances are someone else does too.


Respond when questions are asked, as well. If your teacher puts a question to the class, raise your hand if you have a good answer.
You don't have to answer every question. Responding a few times a day is enough. Let other people talk and give them a chance to contribute too.

, It's difficult to stay focused and pay attention in class when you're tempting to mess around with your friends. It might seem like more fun to get through class while sitting next to a buddy, but that's exactly how you'll get into trouble and struggle. Instead, sit elsewhere and decide to hang out later.


If you still want to sit with your friends, sit in the front of the classroom so your friends will have to, too. It's too hard to mess around when you're right next to the teacher.

, When it's time to go to class, make sure you've got everything that you need ready to go, so you won't have to miss anything because you're struggling to catch up. You'll miss part of a lecture if you're trying to finish your homework before class starts. In general, you want to make sure you have, for each class:


Paper for notes, or notebooks
Pencils or pens
Books needed for class
Homework or assignments that are due
Glue, crayons, rulers, calculators, or other specialty stuff for a particular class

, Keeping your stuff organized for class will help you pay better attention. You can be calm and confident that you have everything you need to succeed.


Have a specific spot for your new notes, your old notes, your homework, and other stuff that's necessary for class. Some people like to keep a separate binder, while other like individual folders for each class.

, Keeping your blood-sugar up will help you pay attention and listen in class. If you're hungry and feeling dragged down, your mind will wander and you'll really struggle to be a good listener in class.


Always eat breakfast. Focus on eating whole grains and fruits for breakfast, instead of something sugary that will result in a crash later in the day. Eat something that'll keep you full until lunch.
At lunch, eat a good meal. Too many students think a bag of chips and candy bar will get you through the day. If you're struggling to listen in class, make an effort to eat a full meal at lunch, or bring your own.

Get plenty of sleep. Students often stay up too late and have to wake up early for school. Make sure your bedtime is early enough that you can get at least eight hours of sleep.

, Talk to your teacher, your counselor, or your parents if you're really having trouble following what's happening in class and paying attention. Learning disabilities can be corrected in a variety of ways, if you're having a problem.


If you get in trouble regularly, talk to your teacher. It's important to let your teacher know that you want to do better and you're trying. Listen to what they say.

, Concentrate on understanding the broad concepts, but worry too much about listening to every single word. Listen for keywords and concepts that your teacher mentions, and pay attention to what's written on the board.


It's ok if your mind wanders some while you're listening, if your mind is wandering around the particular issue that you're talking about in class. If you start wondering what it was like in the era that you're talking about in history class, that's a good thing.
Don't get discouraged if you feel like you miss things. Just focus on the big idea, and trying to understand it.

, Lots of communication is non-verbal. That means that it's helpful to watch your teacher's body language to get some idea about what's important and what's not important, so you can pay attention to the most critical parts of the information.


If your teacher is standing up and talking really dynamically, it's probably important. If your teacher is droning on while seated, and doesn't seem super-interested, it might not be important., It's important to avoid judging the things that you're learning in class before you've had a chance to understand them. Sometimes, we hear something and automatically think, ""Oh that's silly"" or ""I don't need to know that"" or ""That's confusing."" After we've already decided, it becomes very difficult to actually learn anything about the subject.Instead, try to be receptive to what your teacher is saying, and assume that you'll find it interesting.


Try to come up with creative ways to learn. If you're in math class, don't imagine that you're learning boring math problems, imagine that you're studying to become an astronaut, or you're learning a new robotic language.

, In your mind, create a visual ""movie"" of what you're learning. Try to put the concepts and the images into a landscape and actually picture them happening.


If you're talking about the plot of a play you're reading, picture the characters actually doing what you're talking about.
If you're talking about biology, actually picture the microbes dividing and changing according to the processes you're discussing. Shrink yourself to their size and watch.
Even if you're talking about math, try to actually picture the concepts happening. Picture groups of objects like apples or potatoes getting bigger or smaller as you multiply and divide them in a set number. It makes it a lot easier to learn., Have a different notebook for each class, and have some pencils or pens ready to go when you want to take notes. There are lots of different ways to note-take, but there's no wrong way. As long as you try to keep up and write down important ideas, being ready and taking notes is a good way of paying attention in class.


Keep your notes organized by subject. Write the date of the class period at the top of each new page and then draw a line when you're done, or when you're finished with a particular topic and moving on to something else.

, Some studies show that note-taking, even if you don't use the notes later, helps you to engage with what you're listening to and pay attention more. Just the act of writing things down helps you to pay attention and listen better.


Always write down notes when you're told to, or when your teacher writes something on the board. This is a good sign that you need to remember something for a test or for homework later.

, Lots of school involves vocabulary. Understanding the concepts and the issues that you're studying will involve learning lots of new words. When you learn one, write it down in your notes, along with the definition, or other important information to remember about the topic.


Don't try to write down too much in your notes. It's not necessary to have a total record of everything your teacher says.
Any words that your teacher says a lot might be important to keep in mind. If there's not a clear definition, that makes a good chance for a question.

, When you write something in your own words, it'll help you to remember what you've learned. Translating your notes, or even just re-writing them is a good way of studying and helping you learn what you're talking about in class.


Sometimes, your notes can get kind of sloppy and re-copying your notes quickly afterward will ensure that you remember the lecture more clearly.
Re-copying notes is like learning each thing three times. You hear it, you write it, then you read it and copy it. Good way to study.

, Research shows that doodling, even if you're just doodling shapes, or pictures, or nothing in particular, helps you pay attention.Doodling helps you grasp new concepts, retain information, and stay focused while you're listening.

Balance your studies and your work responsibilities.,
Make the most of your relationship with your mentor.,
Value and respond to feedback.,
Talk to your boss about expectations and conflicts.",How to Be a Successful Graduate Assistant," The most important thing you can do to help students succeed in your class is to clearly communicate to them what you expect them to learn and how you expect them to demonstrate their knowledge. This will make the whole semester go much more smoothly.A well-outlined syllabus will help students understand the progression of the course.
Clear course objectives will help you communicate what skills students need to acquire by what dates.
A grading rubric is a very useful tool. The better you communicate the standards that you use to grade, the less likely students will be to argue with you about their grades.;
, If you've never taught a class before, the thought of lecturing to a room full of students may be a little intimidating. Being prepared for each lecture and paying attention to the way you present yourself will make your lectures much more enjoyable for both you and your students.Plan ahead so that you will always know exactly what you will be lecturing on each day. It's a good idea to practice your lecture so you can be reasonably sure that it will take up the entire class period without being rushed.
Pay attention to the volume of your voice and the pace of your speech. If you're talking too softly or too fast, students may not be able to understand you. You may want to consider asking a few students for feedback if you're not sure.
Make use of the blackboard to write down important points in an organized fashion. This will help students take coherent notes. Be sure that your handwriting is legible.
If possible, circulate around the room instead of staying at your desk or behind your lectern. This will make the students feel like you are more actively engaged.

, Depending on the kind of class you are teaching, you may want to incorporate classroom discussions into your syllabus to break up your lecturing. This will give students the opportunity to debate their opinions and make their own connections to the course material.This works especially well for small classes, but you may be able to implement discussion even in larger groups. If you have too many students for a whole-class discussion, consider breaking them into smaller groups.
Letting students know before class that you will be having a class discussion about a particular topic will give them time to prepare, which may make them more likely to participate.

, In addition to teaching classes, you will likely also be required to hold office hours every week, during which time students can come talk to you about their work. It's a good idea to encourage students to come see you, especially if they are struggling in your class. When they do come, be welcoming and offer helpful feedback to them to help them improve their performance.If you find that no students are coming to your office hours, you may want to consider making one appointment each semester mandatory. This will give you the opportunity to get to know each student a bit better, and it may make them more comfortable coming to see you in the future.
You may have to share an office with other graduate assistants, so it's a good idea to work together to create a schedule that works for everyone.

, When it comes time to grade your students' assignments, always be objective and stick to your grading rubric. It's a good idea to go over your grades with your mentor professor to make sure you both agree on the standards you are holding students to.


It's also important to grade in a timely manner. Grading can be time consuming, but it's not fair to keep students waiting for weeks for their grades.

, If you are interacting with undergraduate students as a part of your graduate assistantship, it's important to approach these relationships professionally. Be sure to let them know that you are their teacher, not their friend, even if you are close to the same age.


Don't flirt or get personal. Avoid adding your students as friends on social media.
If you have difficulties with a student in class, immediately document the incident in an email to your supervisor.
It's also important to respect the confidentiality of your students' personal information, including grades., Whether you are working in a lab or doing legal research, put your all into everything you do and leave no question unanswered. This will help you demonstrate to your superiors that you are hard-working and intelligent.Apply this theory of practice even if you are doing something completely straightforward, like cleaning up your work station.

, Curiosity can really help you get the most out of your experience as a graduate assistant. No matter what kind of project you are working on, always think about what more could be done. If you have an idea for a new angle of research, discuss it with your supervisor.This will not only make you look good to your supervisors and help you learn more, but it will also make your experience much more enjoyable because you can constantly be looking for ways that you can contribute by doing the kind of work that most interests you.

, As a graduate research assistant, you are essentially being paid to learn how to become a better researcher. You will be working alongside many more experienced researchers, so take advantage of the opportunity to learn from them.Don't be afraid to ask questions and request feedback from your colleagues.
Work collaboratively whenever you can. This will give you more exposure to your colleagues' ways of thinking and methods of research, which can really help you develop as a researcher.

, As a graduate assistant, you will be expected to present yourself in a professional way, just as you would at any other job. This starts with dressing like a professional.The correct attire will depend on what kind of work you will be doing as a graduate assistant. For example, you will probably want to dress more formally if you will be teaching classes than you will if you will be working in a lab.
If you are unsure about how to dress for your first day as a graduate assistant, ask your supervisor what the dress code is.

, It's extremely important to make a good impression on your supervisor and demonstrate that you are a hard-working graduate assistant. You can do this by always showing up for work on time (or early). If your hours are flexible, make sure you are still meeting the expectations.


You should have a good understanding of what your schedule will be like before you start working as a graduate assistant. If you are unsure what your schedule will be, arrange a meeting with your supervisor to go over the expectations.It's also important to show up to any meetings that you are invited to, even if they are not mandatory. Unless you are unable to attend because of a class, you should do your best to be there.

, Always be polite and respectful to everyone you meet, no matter who they are. Do not act as though you are superior to others just because you are a graduate assistant. Being demeaning to others will reflect poorly on you and may come back to haunt you.


Everyone deserves your respect, including your peers, your superiors, your students, and the support staff that you will be working with.
Don't assume that you can call everyone by their first names. Call your superiors by their professional titles (Professor Jones or Dr. Yates) unless they tell you otherwise.

, During your time as a graduate assistant, you will likely encounter at least one situation that aggravates you. While you may be tempted to vent about it to other graduate assistants or university employees, it's usually best to keep your complaints to yourself. You do not want to be seen as a whiner, especially if you are hoping to be re-hired as a graduate assistant next year.You may have to deal with equipment that is less than state-of-the-art, and it's important to make the best of this situation. Instead of complaining about the technology, think of it as a good opportunity to hone your problem-solving skills.
You may see inefficiencies in the way that your supervisor works, but it's usually best to accept them and move on. Depending on the situation and the relationship you have with your supervisor, you may want to suggest improvements that could be made, but you should always do this in a constructive, non-judgmental way.

, Before you accept any kind of professional role, it's always a good idea to make sure that your online presence does not reflect poorly on you. Take a good look at your accounts and get rid of anything that you would not want your superiors or your students to see.Change your privacy settings so that strangers cannot see your personal posts.
Even if your account is private, avoid posting anything inappropriate or offensive. You never know who might share it!
Consider creating a professional social media account to connect with colleagues. LinkedIn is a good choice.

, Graduate assistants are often asked to help their supervisors in a variety of different ways, and it's important that you be willing to do pretty much anything that is asked of you. Even if you do not enjoy a particular task, agreeing to do it will help ensure that your supervisor values your contributions, and it will help you develop skills that you will need in the future.It's important not to go into a graduate assistantship with overly high expectations of the kind of work you will be doing, as this may lead to disappointment. You should expect to deal with at least some grunt work, like grading papers or entering data.
Try to see everything as a learning opportunity, no matter how menial the task may seem.

, As a graduate assistant, you are both a student and an employee at the university, and it's important that you dedicate enough time and energy to both roles. Be careful not to neglect your studies for your job, or vice versa.If you feel that you are not able to keep up with the demands of your classes due to a busy work schedule, talk to your supervisor about it. You may be able to work out an arrangement that will be more favorable to your class schedule.
Unless you are told otherwise, you should not be working on class assignments during work hours. Instead, you should be using this time to contribute to the department's goals to the best of your abilities.

, You will have a lot of control over the relationship that you have with your mentor: you can choose to forge a strong relationship with him or her and get as much input as you can, or you can choose to keep to yourself. It's in your best interest to take advantage of all the time you have to work with your mentor.You're much more likely to be given rewarding work to do if your mentor comes to see you as a valuable employee, so work hard to make a good impression.
Keep in mind that your mentor may be able to help you after you graduate by writing you a recommendation letter or putting you in contact with other industry professionals. The better your relationship, the more helpful he or she will be to you.

, It can be hard to get negative feedback on work that you've done, but try not to get defensive about it. If your mentor or another colleague lets you know that you could have done something better, listen carefully to what they have to say and implement their suggestions in your future work.If the feedback is not constructive, consider asking how you can improve your work.
Remember that you are here to learn, so you should not expect yourself to be perfect. Do your best and always look for ways in which you can improve your work.
Always take responsibility for your own mistakes instead of trying to blame them on someone else or make excuses for them.

, You will have a much easier time succeeding as a graduate assistant if you communicate well with your boss, both when there is a problem and when there is not. Open the channels of communication early on and keep them open throughout your graduate assistantship.


Whenever you start working on something new, try to sit down with your boss and discuss what you both want to come of the project. It's best to make sure that you are both on the same page from the very beginning.
If there is ever a problem, it helps to address it with your boss as soon as possible. For example, if you believe you are being overworked, sit down with your boss and discuss the problem. If you are both able to share your thoughts in a professional way, you will be more likely to come to a solution that works for everyone.

Work hard.,
To start with, listen to the teacher.,
Stop procrastinating!,
When a test is coming, actually study for it.,
When you're sick for a day, ask your teacher if you can come in for lunch.,
Probably the most obvious rule.",How to Be a Great Student at School1," Getting good grades in school is not a walk in the park. A+ Grades cannot be summoned with a flick of the wrist and poof!, there is a grade you can be proud of. Make sure you understand that.;
, This doesn't mean talking while listening...no, they don't go together. Listening ultimately lets information or directions to come right in, so you don't have to get up and ask the teacher what he/she said and make them annoyed. Remember the rule: ""Silence is Golden, Duct Tape is Silver""

, This gets you nowhere, and just makes you feel overwhelmed or hopeless. It's not worth it!

, Yeah, maybe you thought you remembered everything, except when you're on the test and notice you forgot Einstein's theory of Relativity or who the second king of Kush was. Studying can almost always stop this from happening. Pick a night you're free and devote it to finding a good way of studying, taking notes, etc. Studying with friends can help tremendously, as long as you can work and accomplish tasks efficiently without getting side-tracked.

, Miss recess for a day. Is 15 minutes out of your life really gonna' kill you? Probably not! Not only will you get the work and complete it, you have almost the whole time to have the teacher help you with problems and understanding them, so you'll be back in a jiffy. Plus, you'll earn the respect of your teachers for your high reputation of responsibility!

, Get your brain going and get that work done! What do you think the teacher's going to grade? So sit down, stop reading this if you have to, and start completing that homework! Hey, do you want that A+ or what?

"
"
Do your best at everything.,
Be nice!,
Use your manners.,
Don't cuss.,
Know that insecurity is common and natural, but some people let it control them.",How to Be a Great Student at School2," It reflects on your character and who you are.

, Nobody likes a snob, a know-it-all, or a ""get out of my way or I'll punch your brains out!"". There's always a good-side of everything, kinda' like yin-and-yang. Think before you do. Also, think about this: who you are and what you do defines what is attracted to you, like a magnet. If you're not a very nice person to others, not very nice things will happen to you, like a scolding, detention, etc. Kinda' like Karma.

, Closing a door on the jerk that humiliated you last block isn't right. There's no need for revenge. Try being polite to other people, it's contagious! Teachers will be more prone to being polite to you too, as well! Not only that, other people will be more prone to becoming friends, etc.

, It makes you look like an idiot. It makes habits. Soon, the words don't even make you feel relieved or anything. Don't do it.

, If you feel like you have to act differently around others or do stuff that you don't want to do while around companions, it's a sure sign of insecurity. If you feel this is interfering with your ability to be a great student, a counselor can help you lots!

Most importantly: Be polite! Actively seek to present a positive image of yourself online. Appropriate digital etiquette also requires that you:


Reduce your sarcasm. Since facial expressions and body language cannot be conveyed via text, sarcastic comments can easily be perceived negatively.Do not escalate disagreements. Do not use harsh, crass, or aggressive language.
Do not take part in cyber-bulling. Speak up when you witness cyber-bullying. Support the target of the harassment, and acknowledge that those users who are bullying are behaving inappropriately.;
, Digital communication, or the electronic exchange of information and correspondence, is rapidly becoming the main form of communication between one another. Take care, however, with what you post online. Do not share personal information electronically with people you do not know and on websites you do not trust. Understand that some forms of communication are more appropriate to undertake in person.Specifically:


Do not post about your vacation plans, your income, and anything that might endanger you or someone else in any way.
Do not post about your personal feelings regarding your job or a relationship. Have emotional or important conversations in private with the other people involved.

, There are specific legal rights and restrictions governing the use of electronic technologies.Know that you are legally accountable for your online behavior. Educate yourself about copyright and fair use policies if you are unsure of the legality with which you want to acquire any form of media available online. Be especially careful using peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing services. More specifically:Do not steal money, intellectual property, or someone else’s identity.
Do not damage other people’s work, identity, or online property.
Do not download music or movies that were made available illegally.
Do not create destructive malware, programs, or websites.
Do not send spam.

, Work to improve digital literacy by learning and teaching others about the availability and uses of new technology.Recognize that new technologies are emerging with greater and greater frequency. Being a responsible digital citizen requires we know how to use these technologies appropriately.Furthermore, recognize that teachers now need continual training on how to properly use technology in the classroom. Ensure that your children and those children in the school nearest your home are digitally literate by calling and asking whether they have a plan to increase students’ digital literacy. There are several curricula and lesson plans available online to help guide educators.The New York City Department of Education has made a comprehensive guide called “Citizenship in the Digital Age” that includes lesson plans for grades K-12., Digital access refers to the degree to which people are able to participate electronically in society.Be welcoming when interacting with others online. There are also more active ways to advocate for the increase of digital access for all people, regardless of socioeconomic status, abilities, and physical location. An important policy issue today is providing equitable access to technology for all students, and there are many organizations working to achieve this goal.Here are a few other ways you can help increase digital access:


Lobby your local politicians to prioritize public access to the internet and the availability of computer equipment for public use. Support those politicians and community organizers work for these causes.
Contribute your unused technological equipment to your local library or a school that can use it.
Volunteer with an organization that works to increase digital access.

, Digital rights and responsibilities help to shape and ensure the freedoms that everyone should be able to enjoy online.Note that rights come with responsibilities. Be aware of you own rights and responsibilities in the location and network you are using, and share this information with others if they are not behaving accordingly. This knowledge includes the degree of your freedom of speech and your freedom to visit most public websites. Respect everyone you interact with online, and ensure that your own rights are not being violated.


Contribute to positive, respectful conversations about your rights and responsibilities as a digital citizen to help define the proper use of new technologies as society progresses.

, Take precautions with your technological equipment and online behavior to protect yourself as well as the material you share online. Be especially cautious with information associated with your identity. These are all important measure to operate with digital security:


Install virus protection on the equipment you use to go online.
Be cautious when opening up email attachments and clicking links.
Back up your data, preferably in multiple safe locations.
Use a surge protector to protect your equipment from more tangible dangers such as electrical surges during increment weather, etc.

, Though you may not picture sitting at a computer as dangerous or unhealthy, your health and wellness are effected by your digital lifestyle. Be aware of the physical and psychological effects of operating in a digital world. Protect yourself from these dangers, and encourage others to stay aware as well. Some risks involved with heavy use of computers and other online devices include:Carpal tunnel syndrome.
Eye strain.
Poor posture.
Internet addiction.
Repetitive stress syndrome.

, Digital commerce encapsulates purchasing and selling goods and services online.Be aware of the risks associated with this practice. Make only well-informed and safe decisions before engaging in online transactions. Many goods and services available online are not lawfully allowed to be possessed in certain countries. Be sure that any transactions you take part in are legal and legitimate.

Create word associations.,
Use mnemonics.,
Be as creative as possible.,
Integrate the new words into your environment.,
Make the new words part of your life.,
Turn learning into a game.,
Make a visual record of your work.,
Find the methods that work best for you.,
Practice with flashcards.,
Expose yourself to new words.,
Test yourself.,
Use your new words as often as possible.",How to Memorize Vocabulary," Whether you're learning vocabulary in your native language or a foreign language, associations can help you memorize new words. Absurd, vivid, or ridiculous associations are the most likely to help you retain your new vocabulary.


If you’re learning a foreign language, associate new words with words in your native language. If a new word resembles a word in your native tongue, create a mental image association between the native word and the new word. For example, the French word “vin,” or wine, sounds similar to the English word “van,” so you might make a visual association of a van full of wine to help you remember.
Word associations are also helpful if you’re learning a new word in your own language. For example, the beginning of the word “curtail,” which means to cut short, resembles the beginning of the word “curtain,” so you can make a mental association of curtains cut too short to help you remember “curtail.”
When creating word associations, be sure to visualize the image vividly and to review it in your head several times a day so the association will become hardwired into your memory.;
, A variation on the “similar word association” technique, mnemonic devices use patterns to assist your memory.For example, the word “abrogate,” which means to deny or cancel, can be broken down into a pattern of images based on the series of letters that make up the word. So, you might break “abrogate” down into “a”+”bro”+”gate” and then visualize a bro standing at your gate while you ""deny"" him entrance.
Like word associations, mnemonic techniques work best when they relate new concepts to concepts already in your knowledge base.

, It’s often easier to remember unusual or bizarre things rather than banal ones, so get creative with your associations.For example, the term “banal” means “boring or everyday,” so to help you remember its definition, you might picture a banana peel (because the beginning of “banal” resembles the beginning of “banana”) floating in a canal (because “canal” rhymes with “banal”). A banana peel floating in a canal is a vivid enough image to remember, but it also captures an image of something banal, allowing you to associate “banal” with the definition “boring or uninteresting.”

, Post sticky notes or hang large blank pieces of paper in places you frequent, like the bathroom or kitchen. Add new words and their definitions to the hanging paper as you encounter them. That way you’ll find yourself frequently encountering them as you go about your day.


Include a written definition of the word if you’re struggling to remember it.
You can also draw a small picture depicting the meaning of the word beside it to help you build the association.
For foreign vocabulary, try writing words for everyday objects like ""mirror"" and ""table"" on sticky notes. Attach the sticky notes to the objects the words refer to to strengthen the association between the word and the object in your mind.

, Writing new words into sentences that are relevant to your own life can help you build strong and relevant associations.For example, if you want to learn to use the word “azure,” a term for a deep blue color, write it into several sentences that relate to your current situation or surroundings: “My new shampoo bottle is a striking azure color” or “the sky this summer has been a particularly vivid azure.”

, The more fun you can make your vocabulary learning time, the more likely you are to do it and to learn from it.


There are a number of vocabulary-learning games accessible online. To see a sampling of learning apps for tablets and smartphones, go here. For a listing of web-browser based games, go here. For a review of various vocabulary-learning software options, go here.
If you prefer a game you can play offline, see EdHelper’s Board Game Generator.

, This technique will be particularly helpful to you if you're a visual learner.


Another tool that is great for learning vocabulary words is Quizlet!
Create a vocabulary journal or notebook and write out new words and their definitions. Write them as often as you need in order to set them in your memory.
Create stories using your new words. You can write stories that simply incorporate the new words into a narrative, or you can challenge yourself to write a story using only your vocabulary words.
Draw pictures depicting the meaning of your vocabulary words to accompany their definitions. Create a visual storyboard if you like to express yourself artistically.

, You may need to try out a number of different learning techniques before you find those that work best for you.

, One of the most time-honored techniques, flashcards remain a simple but powerful tool for vocabulary practice.


Write down each new word you learn on the front of a small note card or piece of paper, then write its definition on the back.
Run through the flashcards several times each day, trying to remember the word’s definition before checking on the back.
There are a variety of flashcard apps available for tablets and smartphones that can make using flashcards even more portable and accessible. Go here for a short list of Android apps or here for a list of Apple apps.

, Read texts at your desired vocabulary level in the target language. Reading and looking up--and writing down!--new words while doing so is an excellent way of building and practicing vocabulary.If you’re trying to elevate your vocabulary in your native language to, for example, the university level, read academic journal articles, The New Yorker, The New York Times, etc.
If you’re trying to learn a new language, read texts at your current skill level. So if you’re just beginning to learn, read books for young children to help you establish the fundamentals. If you’re at an intermediate level, read books for young adults, and so on.
Reading a book you’re familiar with in your native language that has been translated into your target language can be a fun and effective way to practice your vocabulary and language skills.

, Giving yourself frequent vocabulary tests will help you work on words that pose a particular challenge.


A number of websites offer online vocabulary quizzes to help you practice. There are some like this that allow you to select your level, desired quiz length, and vocabulary word category, and others like this that allow you to create custom quizzes using the specific list of words you provide.

, Use new vocabulary words in your daily conversation, in your writing, and at any other opportunity you have.


The more you use the new words, the more completely you’ll understand and remember them."

Take detailed notes.,
Listen and respond to other students.,
Engage with your teacher or professor.,
Ask good questions.",How to Be a Good Literature Student1," During class, write down the most important points emphasized by your teacher or professor. Write down your questions, points about the plot of the book, your opinions, your teacher or professor’s opinions, and your classmates’ comments. Write down the big, main points--don’t get weighed down in the details. Keep all of your notes for your literature class together in one notebook or section of a binder so that you can stay organized. Here are some ways to organize your notes:

Details about the historical context of the text;
, If your class is discussion-based, pay attention when other students are speaking. Look at the student who is speaking and practice active listening skills, including nodding at the person, absorbing what the person is saying (rather than preparing a response in your head!), and turning towards the person with open body language. Ask questions to make sure you understand what the person means. You should respond thoughtfully to your classmates’ ideas and opinions, whether you agree or disagree. Everyone will enjoy the class more if the students are respectful and interested.

, Express your thoughts and opinions in class, and ask questions. Demonstrate to your teacher or professor that you want to succeed by going to his or her office hours and talking further about the readings. Come to class prepared to discuss the readings and to listen to the thoughts of your teacher or professor. Stay after class to ask a quick question or comment on a point you think is interesting. If you are having trouble understanding the material, reach out to your professor. He or she will be happy to help you through complicated material. , When asking a question in front of the class, speak clearly and loudly. Look the person you're talking to in the eye.


Don't interrupt the answer to your question.
Use open-ended question, rather than questions with a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. A good open-ended question might be, ""How do race and politics interact in this novel?""
Ask shorter, more specific questions, rather than long, general questions. "
"
Do your reading before class.,
Read and reread the assigned texts carefully.,
Use outside tools to help you understand the assignments further.,
Talk about the assigned texts with people in your class.",How to Be a Good Literature Student2," Go to class prepared--look at your class syllabus and write down which texts you should read before each class. Make a schedule for how much reading you will do every day. It’s important to do the reading before class so that you understand the lecture or discussion while it’s happening, rather than being confused and unprepared in the moment.

, While you read, take notes where you summarize what’s happening in your own words, note unfamiliar words, and write your thoughts down. Reread a text if you find it dense or confusing the first time--sometimes professors and teachers choose challenging texts that deserve a second look. In order to maximize productivity, take a ten minute break for every fifty minutes that you read.

, Keep a dictionary near where you study, and write down the names and definitions of unfamiliar words you come across. If your teacher or professor allows it, use websites such as Sparknotes, Shmoop, and BookRags for plot summaries and refreshers on character names. These sources, however, should only serve to supplement your basic knowledge of the assigned texts. All your thinking and ideas for your essays should come only from you.

, Maybe you have a good friend in the class with whom you can chat over coffee or you want to organize a weekly study group. Talking about the assigned texts in a group can help you gain new understandings of the text, answer your questions, and get further enjoyment out of what you read. If your literature class has exams, your study group can help you review the important plot points, details, and themes in the assigned texts.

Give yourself enough time to write and revise.,
Create an original, argumentative thesis statement.,
Use both direct quotes from the book and your own analysis.,
Revise and proofread extensively.",How to Be a Good Literature Student3," Make sure that you have enough time for outlining your paper, looking through the book, writing your paper, seeking feedback from others, and revising your paper.


Make a schedule for the time frame in which you will complete your paper.
Set internal deadlines where you are accountable to another person. Saying “I will send a draft of my paper to my peer revision partner by Thursday” is some effective than saying “I will finish a draft by Thursday.”
Reward yourself for completing tasks on time with breaks and smaller rewards. For example, if you complete your outline on schedule, you could go get ice cream with friends.

, All effective papers about literature include a thesis statement, or a specific argument that you wish to prove in your paper. Your thesis statement should be opinionated, original, and relevant to the literary work. It should not be a factual statement but instead a debatable opinion. An example of an ineffective thesis statement: “In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry’s wand is unique to him.” This statement is ineffective because it is simply a fact--although one could write many interesting things about the fact that Harry’s wand is unique to him, no one can dispute that this is true because it is a fact.
An example of an effective thesis statement: “In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry’s wand represents his coming of age through its power to give him more agency through magic, its link to both his past and his future, and its unique physical form.” This thesis statement works well because it is debatable; someone might instead argue that the wand represents Harry’s duty to the wizarding world or that the wand more represents his identity as a student. The thesis statement has both facts and opinions, so it seems opinionated but not outlandish.

, In order to support your thesis statement, you should find quotes from the book that illustrate your point. If your thesis statement argues that rain presents despair, for example, you might want to look for a passage in the book where a character is crying in the rain. Then, once you have an example, you should analyze this example in your own words.


Quotes should be integrated well into the text of the essay itself, and analysis should analyze the quote further. For example, you might write, 'When Romeo says, “But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? / It is the east, and Juliet is the sun' (Shakespeare 2.1.44-45), he draws a comparison between the sun rising in the east and the beginning of the relationship between the two lovers.""

, Ask your friends, family, and teacher to read your paper. Incorporate their feedback into your edits. Read over your paper for grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes. Don’t be afraid to make a lot of changes between your first and second drafts--your paper will improve with every thoughtful revision.


When you’re done with your paper, read it aloud to yourself to check for awkward wording and small mistakes.
You can also try reading it, starting from the last sentence and working towards the first sentence.
When you turn in your paper and receive feedback, keep your feedback for the next time you write a paper.

Know the format of your test.,
Make flashcards of important literary terms and words.,
Reread your class notes.,
Reread confusing parts of assigned texts.,
Look at symbols and themes.,
Utilize your study group.",How to Be a Good Literature Student4," Literature tests can be in wildly different formats depending on the class and the instructor; they are very different from math or spelling tests. If your professor or teacher gives you the format of the test, make sure that you understand what each component of the test entails. This understanding will aid you in the study process. Here are some common literature exam components:


Definitions of literary terms or phrases
Quote identifications, where you are given the quote and need to explain who said it in what context in what literary work by which author.
Passage analysis
Short answer questions
Essay questions, either on one work or linking together multiple works

, If your class focuses on literary terms, such as “symbol” or “anaphora” or “free indirect discourse,” make sure that you can not only define the literary term but also provide examples of it from texts in your class. Quiz yourself with these flashcards and look for more examples of them in your assigned texts.

, If you have taken good class notes, rereading through your notes will refresh your memory about the important points made during class. Take note of the important ideas presented in the class, such as “coming of age” or “man vs. nature.” The ideas that stand out in your notes could potentially appear on the exam. Make a condensed study guide, pulling together the most important ideas from your notes. Use the “read-recite-review” method --read over your notes, recite what you remember from them, and then review and assess how much you retained.

, Understanding all of the material for a literature exam is crucial, so now is the time to look back on that confusing passage of Faulkner that you didn’t understand in class. If there’s a passage analysis on one of these confusing sections, you will be happy that you reviewed it!

, If your exam requires an essay, you should look through your notes and texts for potential essay topics, such as dreams, motherhood, or nature. Take note of these for potential exam questions that ask you to talk about symbols and themes across multiple texts studied. Symbols and themes are often frequent topics of literary discussion, and having a grasp of the underlying meaning in your assigned texts will prepare you even more for the exam.

, Ask them questions about confusing passages. Discuss what each of you thought were the important ideas throughout the class--your opinions might vary! Ask them to read-recite-review their notes to you. Hearing different opinions and points of view about the texts in a literature class will help you see the works more holistically.

Imagine you're memorizing a few states and their capitals from west to east.,
Know that rote memorization is better for some types of memory than other types.,
Make a list of what you need to memorize.,
Practice reading what you've memorized.,
Practice producing what you've memorized without looking at your list.",How to Memorize Quickly1," For the following steps in this method, we'll be trying to memorize these states and their capitals:


For rote memorization, we simply repeat and repeat what we need to memorize until it's committed to memory. This repetition makes your brain form new connections and patterns to help you produce what you're memorized - as neurologists say, ""neurons that fire together wire together"".;
, Memorizing through repetition encourages your brain to form the necessary connections to say or do what you've memorized.


Rote memorization is very good for manual tasks and short lists of items like a shopping list, starting a car, or ironing a shirt.
Rote memorization is not very good for memorizing a large number of separate items or single complex ideas like the elements of the periodic table from left to right, the idea of dialectical materialism, or the components of a car engine.

, Make sure your list is complete and in the sequence that you need it.

, For these states, that's simply reading off your table, over and over again, the names of the states.

, Try covering part or all of your list with a piece of paper and reciting what you've just covered over. Scroll down so that the previous table is covered - can you remember what goes in the last two blanks?

At first you'll get a lot wrong - don't get frustrated! This is just your brain getting used to the work. Keep at it and within a few minutes you'll be able to remember everything you've memorized.

Listen to your child.",How to Unschool Yourself and Your Children," Unschooling allows a child to learn in their own, individual way, using their natural curiosity and interests. Instead of sitting in a classroom for eight hours a day they are able to have interactive projects and constant learning opportunities.Unschooling is incredibly adaptive, as it changes and moves with the child and goes at the child's pace. It teaches children that learning happens constantly, not within a rigid structure of 'facts' and tests, but in a natural, non-stressful environment. There is no doing school since you are learning all the time.
Giving children the opportunity and the resources for learning on their own gives them greater independence and a greater ability to take charge for themselves and to make decisions for themselves.
Regular public school tends to be a space more for showing off and for artificial boundaries drawn based on class, race, and gender that perpetuate in children behaviors and boundaries which are already problematic in the wider culture. Most children learn little more than how to work within a system that does not even treat them as people (many students have stories about cheating on tests, lying to avoid getting in trouble, and so on).;
, Unschooling means that both the parent(s) and the child have to take charge of learning. This does not mean that the parent is responsible for becoming the 'teacher,' so to speak, but to be an active, participant in their child's learning.This means doing interesting projects, looking up answers to a child's questions with the child (like: why is the sky blue?).
There are a variety of good books and helpful spaces for parents who are unschooling their children, that can help give them ideas and deal with difficult times. Books like John Holt's Teach Your Ownor Grace Llewellyn's The Teenage Liberation Handbook. Or check out the Self Made Scholar's unschooling reading list., Unschooling means constant learning. It sounds tiring, but really all that means is rather than setting aside a specific time to sit down to memorize some facts, your child is constantly being exposed to the world and the learning opportunities it provides.


You will start to figure out both how you, and your child, learn things and it will take some trial and error to find the most useful ways for your child to learn, since there is no one right way to learn.

, You may think that a child who is being unschooled won't get into college (and that the same problem applies to homeschooled children as well), but this is actually not true. Of course, not everyone wants or needs to go to college, but many do.Universities and colleges like Harvard, MIT, Duke, Yale, and Stanford are actually actively looking for students who have had alternate learning experiences, because those types of students tend to earn more credits than regular students and tend to do better, since they have more often been exposed to self-motivated learning.
Many colleges have adjusted their admissions policies so that it is easier for these types of students to apply.
The most important things to do if you're an unschooler who wants to go to college are to keep good records of your work, make sure you know and meet the deadlines for things like the SAT and submitting applications, and focus on your application essay.

, The point of unschooling is to focus on the child's learning and where that interest takes them. It can take awhile for them to want to do reading or mathematics, but if they are allowed to work at their own pace they are more likely to learn for themselves and the retain that information.Encourage their natural interest in things. If they show an interest in cooking, find some fun cooking experiments and try them together, or let the child try them on their own. Cooking can teach all kinds of things, like mathematics (with fractions and amounts) as well as being a practical skill.
If your child likes to make up stories, do creative writing projects and talk about the different characters in their own games and in the stories that they (and you) might be reading. They'll learn about characterization, about writing skills and they'll be having fun.
If they want to learn more intensively about a subject you don't know about, there are some really good free online courses that they can participate in, like Khan Academyand the Self Made Scholar.You can also find free online college courses on the Open Culture database., This is one of the most fun and exciting parts about unschooling. You and your child get to have lots of different, creative opportunities to learn about the world.


Check the museums in your area. Many museums have days where they are free, or are free for children and it can be a fun outing. Also, many of the bigger museums have their catalog online, so even if you can't physically go to a museum, you can still look at amazing and interesting things.
Libraries are great learning resources. They often have projects going on and reading groups and lectures, beyond simply having a lot of interesting books! Check out your library's events calendar to see what's happening and talk to your child about what they might be interested in.
If your child is interested in something and you know someone who has the right skills, see if you can have your child learn from them for a day, or a week, or even a couple times a month. This could be anything from a chef, to a chemistry professor, to an archaeologist. Not only will this provide the child with new knowledge it's also a great way for them to see other viewpoints and to be more involved in the adult world., Since you'll be looking for lots of fun and creative ways to learn, using different games and projects can be a great way to help facilitate learning.


Discover the what the ecosystem is like in your area. For example, if you live near a the ocean, learn about marine animals and different kinds of water ecosystems. If you can, take a trip to them beach to look for shells and sea creatures.
If you can get a hold of a telescope, or make one, you can use that to look at the night sky and talk about the stars. You can even use this as a way to talk about mythology using the constellations as a jumping off point.
Using a microscope, examine dirt from your backyard and from the park and compare them. Talk about why there are differences in the soils and what could cause them.

, It is incredibly important that you take the time to answer questions with your child. You don't have to be an expert in every subject, but when they ask a question, sit down with them to find out the answer.


You can even point them in the direction of an encyclopedia (or the internet) and tell them to look it up and then tell you. If they can't figure out in ten minutes, work with them to find the answer.
If there is no answer, or no one right answer, you can discuss why that is and talk about ways of trying to figure the answer out for yourselves. For instance, you can talk about what gravity is and how no one knows the exact cause. You could even do experiments with gravity (since, who doesn't love throwing things off a high building).

, Sometimes you have to deschool before you unschool. This is often especially important if your child has been in the public school system for a while. Deschooling means giving them a break, for a few weeks or even a month, to get them out of the schooling mindset.


Once they've gotten into a more relaxed rhythm, talk with them about what they want to learn and how they'd like to learn it. They don't have to have anything concrete at that moment, it will simply introduce the idea again.

, You probably won't see the effects of unschooling immediately. Sometimes children can be recalcitrant and not want to learn anything, especially if they've been in the public school system for awhile. That is okay. It can take time to adjust to a new system and to rediscover their natural curiosity.


You will have to trust your child to take control of their learning. Children are naturally interested in the world and curious about things. Even if it takes time, they will start learning, because they won't be able to help themselves.
Putting pressure on children to learn can make them anxious and less likely to learn (as often happens in school). Keeping learning stress-free and enjoyable will keep them much more likely to learn for themselves.

, For parents considering unschooling, the problem of reading can seem like a huge one. Reading is so often equated with intelligence. The usual schooling ideas about when children should be reading are, more or less, made up, however. Children learn to read when they want to., Make reading simple, like a serious (not silly) but desirable game and very easy. When children are ""coached"" (not coaxed, not pressured) for playing reading, they tend to have a more consistently positive attitude towards reading. This makes it easier for them to learn to read when they choose to ""play"" reading.

, Find ""push/pull, go/stop, in/out"" on business doors and such, one syllable, and add a few important, two-syllable words like ""EXIT"" and ""ENTER"" which are found. At home, show them each individual letter and mainly teach ""sounds"" of letters, not the names only. A is the name, but ""a, eh, ah"" are some of its sounds, as if it can make cute sounds.


Studies have found that unschooling students tend to go from non-reading to fluent in reading very quickly. So whether your child is four or older, each will learn to read when it's best for them.

, The worst thing you can do is pressure your child into hating reading. That ""backfires"" and make them less inclined towards reading. When a child is under stress one is much less likely to accept learning quickly and easily. In fact, some studies have shown that children who have difficulty (or shame) in reading are more likely to act out behavior-wise in school, instead of learning happily.


For example, don't make a young child write out lists of words they need to learn. You'll find that your child will be less likely to want to learn the words, than if they had been left alone to learn on their own. Suggest sounding-out the letters to get new words such as ""c-a-t, cuh eh tuh"", ""ceht""; ""c-a-t cat""! Don't force phonics as a study on them as lessons but let the child have their ah-hah moments, to feel the joy of getting a word or an idea. If the child tries to write, be satisfied that it is crooked and spelled oddly: Say, ""Now you're getting it. Keep it up!""

, By having reading as something that is apart of your daily life, you'll show your child how important it is. You don't have to talk about reading every second of the day, but have books around the house, talk about books that you're reading with your child.


Ask your child what books they enjoy most, and make sure to have lots of those types of books around (either from a bookstore, or by going to the library and picking them out with your child).
Don't do all the reading for them. While it is important to help out your child when they ask for it, by not always doing the reading for them they will realize they importance of learning to read. So, for example, if you're reading a story for them, go at the pace that works for your schedule. If they want to get the story more quickly, they'll need to learn to read it on their own.

, Children tend to learn better when they're exposed to people of all different age groups, with readers and non-readers mixed together. This can be some sort of mixed-age children's group, or reading at home with family.


Children often learn reading through games between readers and non-readers. There are lots of games that require reading comprehension and the readers interpret for the non-readers. The non-readers begin to learn words as they play.
Some ideas for a family mixed-age interaction might be watching t.v. with the captions on so the non-readers start to identify words and letters, having shared reading time where the whole family gets to read out loud. A nightly reading where parents or older siblings read to the non-reader.

, A lot of times children learn to read, because they learn to write. They often learn to write because they're writing the things that interest them: captions to go along with pictures they draw, stories of their own, notes for their family members.


Help your child spell things when they ask you for help. Otherwise, it's best to let them sort out language on their own. Don't worry, they will learn to spell properly, even if it takes them some time.

, These steps are really only suggestions for things that might help your child learn to read. The person who knows your child's learning style best is your child. Pay attention to how they are learning things and what they want to do. After all, unschooling is about letting you child direct their own learning.

Create a transcript and diploma for your child.",How to Unschool Your Child," For most children, this means they think of learning as necessarily unpleasant or something mandated by an external authority. Let them know that from now on, there will be no expectation of them learning any specific subject, or studying for any exams.Even if you’re afraid of your child wasting time or goofing off, avoid pressuring them to do any specific activity. Let them spend their time however they want, even if it means playing video games or watching TV for long stretches.
Depending on a child’s experience of school so far, they may need more or less time to fully “deschool.” It may take anywhere from a couple of weeks to six months for a child to fully adjust to being able to determine their own schedule. Be patient.;
, Instead of pressuring or requiring your child to do certain things, simply provide the opportunities for them to engage with exciting ideas or people.Invite interesting friends of yours over for lunch or dinner. With your child around, ask them about what they’ve been up to lately, or what they think of current events.
Do interesting projects yourself that your child might be curious about. You can bake bread from scratch, take up a musical instrument, do a craft project, or do some home repairs.
Make sure there are engaging toys and activities available at home. Purchase the books and toys that you loved as a kid, or that you always wanted. Don’t force them on your child, but make sure they’re available.
Go out and about and invite your child. Invite your child along on errands like going grocery shopping or to the library.

, One of the key premises of unschooling is that children will naturally develop interests that will lead to learning. Take note of what interests your child and let them pursue those things.Even things that may not seem “educational” may lead to learning. For example, playing video games may lead a child to learn to read, so they can follow the directions. Baking cookies may lead to learning about fractions or chemistry.
When a child shows interest in something, encourage them to pursue it fully. If they get stuck or have questions, help them learn. For example, if a child is trying to bake cookies, but asks, “What is ¼ cup?” use this as a learning moment. If a child asks you to help them read instructions for a game, take the time to help them learn to read the instructions themselves.
Follow your child’s interests in a deep way. For example, if your child shows interest in baking, you may want to take them to a local farm to actually see where milk and eggs come from.

, The legality of homeschooling your child will vary depending on where you live. In most states, it’s relatively easy to register your child as homeschooled. However, make sure to look up the laws where you live so that you can continue to homeschool your child safely.In some places, all you need to do is register with the school superintendent 30 days before the start of the school year.
Generally, there is no requirement that you as a parent have any certificate or qualifications to homeschool your own child.
If you feel daunted by the process, seek out a local homeschooling group or advocacy website for assistance navigating any bureaucracy.

, While the freedom of unschooling is one of its great joys, it can lead some children and parents to feel bored or listless if they have no structure. You can create a personalized schedule to help you plan your days and weeks.The schedule should include concrete activities, as opposed to learning goals. For example, you could write, “Monday: Go to the library, visit local farm animal sanctuary, make homemade pizza for dinner.” Avoid writing things like, “Monday: Practice reading, learn about mammal biology, practice fractions.”
The schedule can include goals, however. For example, if your child wants to build a treehouse or start a lemonade stand, you can put things on the calendar such as:

Week 1: Research types of treehouses.
Week 2: Draw plans for treehouse.
Week 3: Visit Aunt Vicky’s woodshop to ask for advice.
Week 4: Begin building treehouse according to plans.



, No one expects an unschooler’s parents to know everything. Nor is it healthy for children to only have one or two adults they can learn from. Make sure there are other people for your child to interact with and learn from.Sign your child up for a class or group activity. It can be anything from a sports team to a drama class.
Many homeschoolers and unschoolers form groups so that kids have others to socialize with. Join a group in your area.
Take your child to museums, zoos, or regional parks and attend a tour or other guided activity there.

, Since your child isn’t in school all day, they’ll have plenty of time to get involved with things going on in your town. Look for events that your child can get involved with, whether with you or on their own.Check the local newspaper to find out what is going on. There may be an article about a community cleanup effort, or a classified ad looking for people to foster puppies for the animal shelter. There are plenty of things to do if you just look!
Volunteer at a local charitable organization with your child. For example, helping at the local soup kitchen can help your child learn good values as well as learning about the science of cooking.

, You may feel a lot of extra pressure now that you’ve taken on full responsibility for your child’s education. It’s natural to worry that your child isn’t learning “correctly,” or that you don’t know enough to be a good teacher. When your own limitations come up, be honest with your child about them.If your child asks you a question and you don’t know the answer, say something like, “That’s a really good question. Let’s look that up together, since I’m not actually sure of the answer.”
If you are feeling burnt out or like you need a break, you can say, “I think I need some time for myself right now. Why don’t you go work on something on your own for a while, while I take a rest”

, Hopefully you started practicing this during the deschooling phase. However, it’s important to continue letting your child learn at their own pace, even if it makes you uneasy at times. Remember that contrary to what is taught in school, there’s actually no correct pace at which children should be expected to learn something.If a child expresses that they want help learning something quickly, such as reading or arithmetic, take that as an opportunity to actively help them. But make sure it’s guided by their own interest in the subject.

, When unschooling your child, it’s great to continually express support and enthusiasm about what your child is doing and learning. This will encourage your child to keep actively pursuing their own interests, which will inevitably lead to learning.Avoid being too critical. If your child is spending a lot of time with activities you don’t prefer, try to hold your tongue. If you’re genuinely curious about why they’re so interested in an activity, you can say, “Tell me what you enjoy about that TV show so much.” That might help you understand where your child is coming from.
You can show support by saying things like, “Wow. You spent so much time working on that today. That’s amazing dedication!” or, “It seems like you’re struggling with that, but that’s okay. Some things take a lot of practice to get better at. You’re doing great.”

, Other people who’ve been unschooling for a while can be a great resource. They likely have been through the same struggles and difficulties as you and your child. Find a group in your area or online and ask for support or seek answers to your questions.Other unschoolers may have great ideas for activities to do or groups to join.
Other parents may be able to reassure you if it seems that your child isn’t learning anything or doesn’t have any productive interests.

, If your child has a specific area of interest, try to help them find a way to apprentice or intern in that area. Many professionals will be happy to have a helpful and curious young person around.Don't assume your child will be paid for their time and work. Often, internships and apprenticeships are unpaid. If you expect your child to be paid, establish this before they begin working.
Internships and apprenticeships can be great stepping stones toward a specific career, or can look good in a college application portfolio.
Make sure your child will be learning skills directly related to their interests. For example, if they've decided to apprentice with a fashion designer because they're interested in clothing design, make sure they won't simply be stuck in the wholesale shipping department packing boxes.

, Because you’re doing unschooling, there’s no set graduation day, and there’s no guidance counselor reminding your child of college application deadlines. If your child is interested in going to college, start looking at options a year or two before they plan to apply.There are many colleges that offer programs without majors or academic requirements. These might be well suited to your child if they want a college experience similar to unschooling.
Trade schools can be good options for unschoolers who have already found a passion they’d like to pursue as a career.
Contact college admission offices and ask about what kinds of transcripts or documentation they require from homeschooled applicants. If you do this early, it will give you plenty of time to make sure you have what you need before applying.

, Once your child is old enough and mature enough, try registering them for a class at your local community college or trade school. Even four year colleges will often let a non-matriculated student take a course or two.Taking a college class shows colleges that your child is able to adjust to a school setting and handle college level academics.
Even if your child doesn’t plan to go to college full-time, taking classes at a community college or trade school can be great ways to supplement their learning once they’re in their teens.

, Most colleges and universities require applicants to take a standardized test, such as the SAT. It’s possible that your child may do very well on the test without any kind of preparation. However, if you’re concerned that they might not do well on the test, you can enroll them in a preparatory course.If there aren’t any courses available in your area, you can sign them up for an online course, or hire a private tutor.
Not all universities require applicants to take a standardized test. Contact the specific institutions you’re interested in to find out what their requirements are.

, Even though your child won’t receive a formal diploma from a school, they will need something to demonstrate that they completed the equivalent of a high school education. Together, create a portfolio that demonstrates the work they’ve done over the past few years. Meanwhile, as the parent, you’ll need to translate that work into a type of transcript.Your child’s portfolio should demonstrate the breadth of what they’ve done as an unschooler. It can contain photos of them participating in activities, writing and artwork they’ve done, and documentation (such as video or web documentation) of other projects they’ve completed.
When writing the transcript, make sure it reflects the way your child’s studies fit into a traditional course of study. For example, the work a child has spent volunteering at a local farm become “biology” and “ecology.” The local 10K they ran qualifies as “physical education.”
You do need to make your child some kind of diploma. However, you can determine what form this takes and whether or not you want to hold some kind of formal ceremony for its presentation.

Imagine you have to memorize the countries on the UN Security Council.,
Know what chunking is good for.,
Divide what you have to memorize into smaller, easier-to-memorize pieces.,
Practice producing your your small items (the chunks) from memory.,
Practice combining the chunk.",How to Memorize Quickly2," There are 10 countries that could be organized according to some scheme or another.
, Chunking works well when you're memorizing things that are composed of smaller things in a sensible order. Our example could subdivide by continent; the elements of the periodic table could be broken down by type; or if you have to memorize the components of an engine, you could divide it up into sub-assemblies (intake, engine, exhaust, electrical).

If you've ever memorized a phone number, you might have noticed the way we write them - they're set up to be chunk-memorized. For instance, the White House phone number, (202) 456-1111 is easier to remember as three numbers - 202, 456 and 1111 - than it is to remember as a single complex number, 2,024,561,111.
Chunking isn't a great strategy for big, complex things and concepts that don't break down into parts easily. For example, it's not easy to figure out what ""memorizable"" chunks would be for memorizing the concept of civil rights, the definition of nationhood or a list of similar phone numbers.

, Since you'll have to create smaller pieces from big ones, this strategy works best with items that you can actually break down according to some sensible scheme.
, For our UN Security Council example, you might try reciting one of the continents and their countries from the list above:

, Mastering each individual portion or chunk is just the beginning - to fully memorize something using this method, you'll need to get the entire list down. Try scrolling down so the previous list is covered. How much of this list can you remember?

Imagine you have to memorize a shopping list.,
Understand what chaining is good for.,
Make a sentence or image composed of all the items you have to memorize.,
Repeat and memorize your sentence or image then practice producing the items you've memorized from your sentence or image.",How to Memorize Quickly3," Your list is composed of a bunch of different items that have no relationship to each other.
, If you have a very large number of things to remember, this will be unwieldy; for this reason, the chaining method is best for shorter lists of hard-to-remember items.


Chaining is great for a limited number of items in an arbitrary list without any seeming relation to each other (for instance, the list tree, bird, keyboard, bottle). It's hard to apply a strategy like chunking because there aren't any real categories to break stuff down.

, This is the fun part of this method: the more outlandish and weird your sentence or image is, the easier it will be to remember. For instance:



Peanut butter and espresso bean sandwich wrapped in ethernet cable with a screwdriver going through it.


, You'll use your sentence or image as a key that will bring up what you've memorized.



Peanut butter and espresso bean sandwich wrapped in ethernet cable with a screwdriver going through it=
peanut butter, espresso beans, bread, ethernet cable, screwdriver bit

Create a mnemonic scheme.,
Practice remembering your mnemonic and what you have to memorize from your mnemonic.",How to Memorize Quickly4," Suppose for this task we're memorizing how to figure out the sine, cosine and tangent of the base angle of a right triangle.

, Mnemonics is simply a fancy word for a process you're probably familiar with from grade school. If you've ever used ROYGBIV to remember the colors (red orange yellow green blue indigo violet), or a nonsense sentence like ""My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas"" to remember the planets (Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto), you've used a mnemonic.

, If you have to memorize more items than you can make a short sentence or phrase for, this will be hard to work with; for this reason, the mnemonic method, like chaining, is best suited for limited numbers of items you have to memorize that can fit into a scheme. Mnemonics are better suited for memorizing a list of words, for instance; it is not as good for memorizing big lists without clear organization, like a list of phone numbers or the digits of pi.

, A mnemonic scheme is simply a ""key"" sentence or a phrase for what you have to memorize. For our example, we can make up a simple, easy to remember nonsense word.

, Your mnemonic serves as the 'key' to your memory. Scroll down to cover the previous list - can you remember what the mnemonic stands for?

Suppose you need to memorize the components of a 1911 handgun slide.,

Rehearse walking through or traversing your mental map and bringing up what you have to memorize.,
Practice traversing and exploring your mental map.,
Rehearse producing what you've memorized from your mental map.",How to Memorize Quickly5," From the front to the back, a list of what you have to memorize would look like:

slide
barrel bushing
barrel
firing pin
extractor
hammer stop

, The human mind is very good at associating things. This talent runs so deep, in fact, that it's possible to use that ability to memorize things. For this memory, you'll create an imaginary journey or walk-through that you'll associate with what you have to remember. Going on your imaginary journey or walk-through will bring up your memories.

, The associative method is very powerful, especially if you have a strong imagination. Throughout history, people have used some variation on the associative method (like imagining walking through mental houses, looking around an imaginary room or flipping through a pretend book) to organize memories.


Memories that are easy to split up and spatially organize are best suited for the associative method - things like the stanzas of a poem, components of a machine or the procedure for cooking eggs.
Memories that can't be divided up are less well-suited - like the basic idea of Abstract Expressionist painting, the history of the War of the Roses or remembering how to ask someone out.

, You'll use your second set of memories as a ""key"" for what you have to remember.


For this reason, if you have a list of discrete items that don't fit together in any way, it'll be harder to shape your second ""key"" memories. For our example, we'll simply imagine being a tiny little man walking around inside a 1911 slide.

, This can be as cool and interesting or simple and easy to remember as you want to make it. For our example, a tiny man walking through a 1911 slide might say:


""First we'll encounter the barrel bushing, and inside it, I can see the barrel poking out. Behind the barrel and the breech face as we walk further back I'll see a tiny hole through which I can see the firing pin, and to its left will be the extractor against the side of the slide; when I make it to the very back, I'll reach the hammer stop.""

, A few times a day, concentrate and visualize going back through your walkthrough. The more that you practice, the easier it will be to remember.

, As you perform this visualization exercise, your mind will get better and better at shaping your ""key"" visualization, but that's not enough - you need to remember the individual components you fit into your key. Try ""working backwards"" - starting from a list of items, see if you can reproduce your original mental journey or ""key"".

Adjust the lighting.",How to Get Boring Homework Done1," Before you can tackle any homework, you need to make sure that you have everything you need to finish the job. You can avoid needing to get up every few minutes by gathering all your supplies first.Take out all of your homework from your school bag, including your agenda, if you use one. Go through each homework task and determine what supplies you will need.
Gather all of your supplies and keep them in reach.
Make sure you have lots of paper, extra writing utensils, a calculator or other tools, and any textbooks you may need. If you need to use a laptop or computer, make sure that is available to you.;
, It’s easy to get distracted when you’re doing homework, especially if you find the homework to be boring. Help yourself to stay focused by removing all distractions from your environment.Put your phone away. Put it on silent and hide it in a drawer so you’re not tempted to check it.
If you need to use a computer but find you’re easily distracted by other websites, use an internet nanny to block sites, like social media, that you don’t need to visit.

, Pick a spot to do your homework that is quiet so you can concentrate without getting distracted by loud noises or other people talking.


If you can’t find a quiet place in your home, try visiting your local library.

, It’s easiest to concentrate when you are at a comfortable temperature, not too hot or too cold.


If you find yourself falling asleep when you do your homework, try turning the heat down. You’re more likely to feel sleepy in a room that’s too warm.

, Make sure you have a good source of light so you aren’t straining your eyes to see your homework.


Dim lighting can also make you feel sleepy. Make sure your homework space is bright by opening window shades, turning on lights and using a desk lamp, if necessary.

Warm up your brain.,
Stick to a routine.,
Create a plan for finishing your homework.,
Take breaks.,
Reward yourself.",How to Get Boring Homework Done2," You may need to take some time to get your brain back into study mode, especially if you’re doing your homework after dinner. It’ll be easier to focus on boring homework if your brain is ready to work.


Reading is a great way to warm up your brain. Read a newspaper article that catches your eye, a chapter from your favorite book or a section of a magazine.

, When possible, homework should be done on a set schedule as part of a daily routine. Boring homework won’t seem as boring if you know that it’s homework time instead of struggling to find time to get to your homework.Find a routine that works best for you. You might prefer to tackle your homework as soon as you come home to get it out of the way or you might want to take 20 minutes to relax first and then start on your homework. Whatever routine works for you, it’s important that you stick to it.
Try to do your homework in the same place and at the same time each day so your routine becomes second nature.

, Take a few moments to plan out how you are going to do your homework. By creating a plan, the workload will seem more manageable because you’ll know exactly what is coming next.Write your plan as a to do list. Once you finish a task, you can cross it off your list.
Schedule your homework into sections. It’s less overwhelming if your homework is comprised of small tasks instead of one huge project.
Write your plan in the order you want to finish it. Make sure homework that is urgent is on top of the list.

, It’s important to give your mind and your body some rest time while doing your homework. You don’t want to burn out or get frustrated. Schedule your breaks so that you keep yourself fresh and alert.Try the Pomodoro Technique: Set a timer for 25 minutes and work without stopping until the timer goes off. Once it goes off, take a five minute break. Reset the timer for another 25 minutes and repeat. After three breaks short breaks, take a longer (15 - 30 minutes) break.Use your break time wisely. Get yourself a snack, refill a glass of water, stretch or walk around. Try to get up from your desk so that it feels like you’re really taking a break from the work.

, Homework can be hard work, especially if it’s boring and tough to get through. Treat yourself to little rewards as an incentive to push through and get it all done.Set up a reward system so that you get a treat for reaching mini milestones. For example, you can leave a candy at the bottom of every second page to eat once you get there.
Remember, rewards don’t always have to be candy. Get creative and think of other small treats you would enjoy as a reward for a job well done.

Ask for help when you need it.,
Get someone to check your work.,
Find a homework buddy.,
Announce that you’re doing homework.",How to Get Boring Homework Done3," Don’t be afraid to reach out to the people around you and ask for help if you are struggling. Sometimes boring homework is actually homework that you find difficult. Take the time to ask for help.Help is available all around you. You can ask your teachers for help at school, your parents or siblings for help when you get home, or a classmate who might be able to explain the homework to you.

, It always helps to have a second pair of eyes go over your work and help check for any mistakes. Ask your parents or an older sibling to look over your homework before you put it away for the night.


Your checker can also help keep you on track to getting your homework done. For example, if you ask your mom to check your homework at 8:00 PM, you are committing to having your homework finished by that time.

, Sometimes the best way to get through boring homework is to do it with a friend. Find a classmate you can do your homework with to help keep each other motivated and on task.For extra motivation, you could start a challenge with your homework buddy. For example, you could compete to see who can get the highest grade on the next test.
Be cautious when picking a homework buddy. You want to find someone who helps you focus and not someone who distracts you.

, When you finish making your homework plan, share it with your family at home. By sharing your plan with the people around you, you’re making a commitment to finish the work and you’re asking those people to hold you accountable.


Be specific with your plan. Tell your family exactly when, where and what homework you’ll be doing. For example, instead of saying, “I’m doing homework!” you can say, “I’m studying for my math test in my room for the next hour. Can someone check on me when the hour is up?”

You can find an overview of current homeschool laws here: https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/current-policy/


Twenty-four states currently require some periodic assessment of your child’s knowledge. This assessment usually follows one of two formats: standardized testing or a portfolio review.
Standardized testing can be arranged either through local public schools or independently.For a portfolio review, a certified teacher will examine and approve a collection of your child’s work, including writing samples, reading lists, math tests, and science labs. If your state relies on portfolio reviews, you’ll want to start saving examples of your child’s work as soon as you begin homeschooling.;
, You’ll be responsible for school supplies, books, and any online curricular content you purchase. Create a list of these costs and incorporate them into your family’s financial planning., While not all states require that you inform the school about your plan to withdraw, it’s a good idea to exit your public school with courtesy. Have an open conversation explaining why you want to switch, and ask for any advice administrators or teachers might be willing to share.Especially if your child plans to continue participating in extracurricular activities, you’ll want to maintain a good relationship with the school community.

, If your child has been in public school for several years, the district will have a file containing their medical and academic records. You’ll want to access these records to make sure they’re not lost when you withdraw your child, and so you are fully aware of your child’s educational experience up to this point., Be honest and clear about your plan to withdraw your child from public school, talk about their needs, and be sure to listen to what they have to say.


Try asking your child questions about what they like and don’t like about school now, and what they would want to learn about if they could pick their own lessons. This will jumpstart a conversation that allows you both to talk about your expectations for homeschooling.Give your child plenty of time to reflect on your conversation and their new reality. Introduce the topic well ahead of the date you plan to withdraw.

, There are many different teaching methods and curricula available for homeschooling. Reflect on your reasons for switching along with your child’s learning preferences, and develop your approach according to their unique needs.Choosing your curriculum will largely depend on how your child best learns and how you best teach. You’ll want to decide whether to adhere to a more traditional, textbook-based curriculum, or to take the alternative route by designing and compiling a less structured curriculum.
Some parents choose to participate in established online homeschools. The main benefit of these programs is that much of the content preparation is done for you.

, Taking the time to research other parents’ experiences with various homeschooling materials and online schools is the best way to ensure that you’re purchasing high-quality content that works. Reviews will also usually specify the driving teaching philosophy of the curriculum., Up to this point, your child will have spent a large majority of their time at a school that’s not your home. Give them a few weeks off from academic study so they can process their emotions regarding this shift.


Some homeschooling parents recommend giving your child at least two weeks and up to a month of time off from school before beginning your homeschool curriculum.
During this transition, you may want to incorporate hands-on lessons to maintain or renew your child’s enthusiasm for learning. You can explain the chemistry behind baking cookies or take a nature walk through the woods., Pick hours that work for your family, and stick to that plan. Even though flexibility and spontaneity are hallmarks of successful homeschools, especially at the beginning of the transition, you’ll want to ensure that your child recognizes that their home is now also their school.


To set up this schedule, reflect on which hours of the day your child has the hardest and easiest time learning. Schedule difficult subjects during their high-attention hours, and easier ones when they might need less brain power. Be sure not to block more than 45 minutes to an hour of any one subject.
You don’t need to adhere to typical 8:00-3:00 public school hours, but your child may crave continuity as they move away from the public-school model and begin learning in a new environment.

, Public schools build in blocks of time for children to either play outside, rest, or study independently, allowing children time to recharge. Make sure that these “relaxed” blocks of time are part of your daily schedule so that your child’s school day contains both work and play., Even if your state doesn’t require that you be prepared for a portfolio review, it’s a good idea to keep orderly records of your child’s progress. This will help your child if they choose to apply to college, or they want to transition back to public school at a later date.

, This will be a learning process for you and your child. Make sure your child knows that you’re open to their ideas, comments, questions, and critiques. This will allow your child to feel invested in the transition and their new education.Your child may initially ask you to replicate certain elements of their public school experience. While you made this transition for a reason, let your child guide the pace of the switch.

, When your child leaves their public school, they may be most worried about leaving their friends behind. In order to ensure that you and your family are remaining socially connected, continue or expand your child’s involvement in extracurricular activities.


Many extracurricular activities are not directly connected to the public school system, including civic clubs such as the Girl or Boy Scouts. Sports teams may also be organized through the community, rather than the school. Be aware of your options, and be sure to budget for the extra costs of these activities.

, Even if your child isn’t a fan of extracurricular activities, they’ll surely miss their friends as they transition away from public school. Schedule periodic visits between your child and their closest friends. Make sure your child knows that they can rely on you to make these social activities a consistent part of their life.

, There will almost certainly be ups and downs over the course of this transition. Tell your extended family and friends about your plans, and get ready to rely on them when you need it. There are also many online and in-person support groups for homeschooling parents that you should look into joining.


If a homeschool support group doesn’t yet exist in your area, consider starting one. There may be other parents who feel a similar need in your community, and they’ll be grateful for your efforts.

Read all of your material.,

Write down your lines.,
Move around as you memorize.,
Pay attention to others.,
Use word tricks.,
Take it one chunk at a time.,
Repeat, repeat, repeat.,
Record your lines.,
Relax.,
Learn to adjust.",How to Memorize Lines1," Before you begin to memorize your lines, you should read all of your material and have a firm grasp of what the play, speech, or presentation means. Take the time to read it alone in a quiet place and read it aloud if necessary.


If you really want to improve your memorization, read it more than once.;
, Once you've read it, you can think about what it really means. Instead of just memorizing it, you should understand the meaning and purpose behind your lines, whether it's to motivate workers during a presentation or to deliver a passionate monologue during a play.


If you're in a play, understand the motivations of your character. This will help you get a better sense of what they would or would not say.
If your play, presentation, or speech involves others, then reflect on their lines as well. How does your character or presentation relate to what others have to say? Understanding what others say will give you a better sense of when your own character will speak.

, Once you've read and reflected on your materials, you can write down your lines. If you're memorizing lines from a long play, you can just focus on the longer monologues. Whatever you do, know that writing down your lines will help you process the material much faster and will make you feel more in touch with the lines. They won't feel like just any words on a page, but like your own words.


Remember to focus on the words while you're writing them down. Don't just write them down while watching TV or listening to music. Really take the time to absorb everything you're writing down.

, You will memorize your lines much faster if you move around, gesture, and show emotion as you say them. Don't just say the words, but mimic the movements you'll be making when you actually deliver the words. This will help your whole body understand the lines better.Even if you're not gesturing, just try pacing back and forth as you recite the lines. This will still be a big help.

, If there are other cast-members in your play or other people involved in your presentation, pay close attention to what they have to say. Don't just wait for their monologues or statements to be over so you can jump into yours. Instead, get a deep understanding of what they're saying so you know how their words relate to your own.


Try to have a strong sense of all of their lines if you don't flat-out memorize them. Remember that the other people involved may need your help remembering their lines on the big day.

, If you're stuck memorizing your lines, try a variety of words tricks to help you fully absorb the lines. Here are some word tricks to try:


Use rhymes to help you remember the right words in a sentence.
Use visualization. Visualize the words you will say and what message they will convey, and they will come to you.
Try acronyms to remember your lines.

, You don't have to memorize your lines from start to finish if you have a long chunk of lines, or an entire play's worth of lines, to memorize. Instead, you should break down your lines into manageable parts so that you have a grasp of all of the lines eventually.


Work on memorizing the lines from the beginning of the speech first. Once you have those down, move on to the middle while incorporating the beginning. See how far you can go without forgetting something. Once you have the beginning and middle down, move on to the end.
If you're in a play, you can work on all of your monologues first, and then work on your interactions with one character, and then another.
Don't try to memorize too much at once. Work in small manageable chunks and you'll be much less likely to get frustrated.

, Once you feel very comfortable with your lines, you should take the opportunity to applaud yourself, but don't stop practicing. You should still repeat your lines as much as possible until they feel like second nature to you. You should keep repeating your lines until the day you have to deliver them, or you may forget them by the big day.Repeat your lines when you get up in the morning and as you get ready for bed.
Repeat your lines in the car.
If you're working on a play, repeat your lines with a cast-mate.
If you have a patient friend or family member, ask if you can repeat your lines to him or her from time to time.

, You should make a recording of your lines and keep it on hand all the time. For one thing, sitting down to record all of your lines will help you memorize them even more. If you're memorizing for a play, then you can record the lines of the entire play, so that you know when it's your turn to speak. You can play this recording at any time to maximize the amount of time you spend memorizing your lines.


Play the recording whenever you can. Play it as you get ready in the morning, while you're doing chores like folding laundry, or even when you're working out or just going for a walk.
You can also play the recording in your car.

, This is an important point. You should relax while you're memorizing your lines and before you have to deliver the lines. If you don't relax, then you'll be more likely to forget your lines in the middle of a rehearsal or even on the big day.


Just keep telling yourself that it's no big deal. If you make a mistake, you'll be able to recover gracefully, and it won't be the end of the world if you don't remember every last word.

, If you know how to improvise, you will be much less worried about memorizing your lines. Improvising is a great way to keep people from even knowing that you've forgotten your lines. The important thing is not to leave any time for silence or confusion. Whether you're alone on stage or a part of a play, everyone should always look like they know what's going on even if they don't.


As long as you're comfortable with your character or your role, you'll be able to say something similar to what you were supposed to say.
Remember that you're not the only one who can mess up. If you're in a play, one of the other characters may also make a mistake, so you should be comfortable enough with everybody's lines so you can wing it if need be.

Finally, when reciting the memorized text, try to remember what the page looks like.",How to Memorize Lines3," Rather, it is a technique or skill that can be learned by anyone, and is one of the oldest memory techniques in the world. One ancient technique is called a ""Memory Palace"". The idea is that you build a giant palace in your mind, with a special place for everything, and when you want to save a memory for later recall, you visualize yourself in the palace, putting the memory in the appropriate room. Then all you have to do later, is remember where you put it, go get it and see it with the mind's eye.

, Sort it by idea.

, For instance, if memorizing the Gettysburg Address, the first section (""Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."") refers to time, place and cause, so you could remember ""section number 1 = when, where and why.

, Use the colors of the rainbow in the standard order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, or ROY G BIV for short.

, Think of this as a bigger version of step 4. This way, when reciting the Gettysburg Address, you can remember that the first section ends ""the proposition that all men are created equal"" and that is connected to the first part of the next section, that goes ""Now we are engaged in a great civil war.""

, See the sections broken out, see their numbers and colors. See what words are next to each other. Even try to see the font it is printed in. The idea being, if you can really see the text in your mind's eye, you can actually read it off of the page in your head.

Read your quote over and over again.,
Read the quote out loud to yourself.,
Focus on the quote’s key words.,
Work on understanding the quote completely.",How to Memorize Quotes1," The first step to memorizing something is to read it as many times as possible. Read the quote once through completely to get a feel for its overall logic and meaning. Then slowly reread it word by word and, once every few words, take a moment to see the sentence written out in your mind’s eye., Softly say the quote out loud to yourself, and listen to each sentence’s rhythm. Try exaggerating the stressed syllables in each sentence, so the quote becomes a bit like a song.For example, say out loud, “so the QUOTE be-COMES a BIT like a SONG."" Rhythm can help you remember a quote, but just keep in mind you won’t want to recite your quote in singsong fashion once you’ve memorized it.

, If you start by memorizing the quote’s key words, like nouns and important adjectives, you can fill in the conjunctions and prepositions intuitively. Try to internalize how each key word logically proceeds to the next.

For example, consider the Bertrand Russell quote, “The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.” Work on remembering how one key word leads to the next: whole problem -> world -> fools and fanatics -> certain -> wiser people -> doubts.

, If a quote includes any unfamiliar words, look up their definitions. As you read each clause, try to understand how each of the quote’s parts relate to one another. If you’re trying to remember a quote with an unfamiliar vocabulary or syntax, like a poem or Shakespeare passage, take the time to find out how its language works.Try asking an English teacher for help understanding a quote’s meaning or looking online for an interpretation.

Stop what you're doing and start immediately.,
Force yourself to start writing notes and also draw your notes.,
Motivate yourself.,
Plan rewards.,
Make your study plans known.",How to Force Yourself to Seriously Study1," It's all too easy to tell yourself ""I'll start in an hour"" over and over again until you've wasted the entire day. If you need to seriously study, don't procrastinate any longer. Stop whatever you're doing, go to a quiet, secure place with your study materials, and get started. Don't sabotage yourself by playing just one more video game, just one more TV show, and so on. The sooner you start, the sooner you'll be done and the more free time you'll have in the long run.


It's much harder to start doing something than it is to keep doing something. Once you break past your initial resistance, you'll find that it's much easier to continue studying.;
, Drawing notes will be easy to remember and fun, for example lets say if you have to remember the war of 1812 then draw some things you know about it. The first minute or two after you start studying are crucial, as it's extra-easy to give up during this window. To avoid this, start writing notes immediately, even if they're not good notes. Once you've actually made some progress (however minor), you'll find that it's much harder to stop than if you hadn't made any progress at all.


Don't forget that you can always re-write your initial notes late if you find that they're not helpful.

, Morale can play a huge role in determining whether your study session is a successful one. Get ""pumped"" early on and stay pumped throughout your studying. Below are just a few ideas for keeping yourself motivated - only you will know what works best for you:


Listen to rousing music - the same types of songs you might listen to before a sporting event
Move around - pace, do jumping jacks, shadowbox, etc.
Watch an inspirational speech
Change locations frequently - don't allow yourself to get bored with your surroundings

, It's easier to study if you know that you'll get something that you want eventually if you do so. Set yourself up for success by arranging rewards for yourself - after you study, of course. For instance, if you've got a sweet tooth, set aside some time after you study to make a trip to the local ice cream shop after a successful study session.

, When all else fails, let shame be your motivator! Tell your friends that you're going to study and get a good grade on your upcoming assignment. The fear of embarrassing yourself by neglecting to study can be highly motivating - as the assignment approaches, you'll probably start to feel pressure to study, which will make it easier to start doing so.


Better still, tell your friends that you want to study with them. This way, you'll have to either study (in the presence of friends who can potentially keep you on-track) or break your appointment. Either way, your friends will know.

Break the quote into smaller parts.,
Copy the quote by hand.,
Look away and say the quote line by line.,
Practice memorizing your quote every day.",How to Memorize Quotes2," If you’re trying to memorize a paragraph, start by memorizing it one sentence or clause at a time. It’s a lot easier to remember little pieces than it is to memorize chunks. Consider the difference between memorizing 634 - 284 and trying to retain 634284.Try spending a half hour or so copying and reading aloud one sentence, then take a break. During your break, say the sentence to yourself a few times to reinforce it. After your break, move on to the next sentence.

, Write out the quote by hand, and try speaking the words out loud as you copy them. If your quote is more than a few sentences, copy one sentence at a time. If your hand can handle it without cramping up, try to copy the quote at least five times.It might be quicker and easier to type out a quote, but copying it by hand is a better learning and memorization method., After reading a sentence or clause out loud as you copy it, look away or cover the page. See if you can repeat it by heart. If you need a reminder, glance back at the page, then look away and try again.Once you’ve memorized one line, move on to the next and gradually build the quote up one clause at a time.

, Practicing every day is especially helpful if your quote is more than a sentence or two. Try committing one sentence or line to memory one day then, the next day, build on what you've previously mastered.

Practicing a little every day will also help prevent you from getting overwhelmed. If you're too stressed, you might get distracted and have a harder time memorizing your quote.

"
"
Walk or run while saying the quote to yourself.,
Try visualizing a memory palace.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Take a nap after practicing.",How to Memorize Quotes3," Once you’ve made some progress memorizing your quote, try going for a walk or run and recite it to yourself. Physical activity can help your brain reinforce the new memory.You can read the quote while you’re walking if you haven't committed it to memory, but make sure to look where you’re going!

, A memory palace is a visualization technique in which you associate a word or concept with an object in a room. Imagine your bedroom and try to see in your mind’s eye all of the objects around you. Match your quote’s words to objects in your room and, when possible, link a word or phrase with something that calls to mind its meaning.For example, for the Bertrand Russell quote, you could match “the world” with the globe on your desk, “fools and fanatics” with some stuffed animals, and “wiser people” with the figurines on your bookcase.  

, A mnemonic device typically makes an acronym out of the first letters of a series of words. You could try memorizing or making an acronym for the first letters of your quote’s words to help jog your memory.A popular mnemonic device is PEMDAS or Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. It stands for the order of mathematical operations: parentheses, exponents, multiply, divide, add, subtract.
Some people think trying to remember something just to remember something else is silly, but memory works differently for everyone. Try a technique and stick with it if it works for you.

, Reward yourself for dutifully studying your quote by catching a cat nap! New memories are fragile, but sleeping helps the brain process and store them.If you nap right after studying your quote, your brain can reorganize your new short-term memories into your long-term memory.

Ask your teacher for clarification about what you are supposed to do, when the assignment is due, and how it will be graded.
Ask how long each assignment should take, so you can plan to budget your time.;
, Tasks which are worth a higher percentage of your grade or that are more challenging should be completed first.Look at your assignment list.
Rank each assignment in terms of importance.
Plan out how much time you need to spend on your homework for the evening.
Decide in what order you will complete your assignments.

, Most students have between 1 to 3 hours of homework every evening and often finish their homework when they get home. If you have after-school activities in the late afternoon, you will need to set aside a different time.
Plan to sit down and start your homework at a specific time. Budget enough time for each assignment.
Plan to take a 5 minute break between major assignments. Most people can't concentrate for hours and hours on end.

, You will need to be able to see well and well lit places will be best for concentration.


A brightly lit room with a window (open the window for fresh air)
Have any homework supplies set aside in a bin or basket in this area. Things like pens, pencils, paper etc. should be readily accessible.
Dimly lit rooms are not good choices for a homework area.
Without good lighting you are likely to be tempted to fall asleep or have a wandering focus.

, It doesn't have to be very large, but just big enough for your computer and study materials.Make sure you have a good, supportive chair to sit on.
Avoid sitting on a bed or soft sofa. These are not ideal surfaces to work on.
Make sure your chair doesn't hurt your back or shoulders when you sit for long periods.

, You should avoid any room that has a TV, other people making noise, electronics, phones, or other noises.

Make sure you can't hear or see TVs.
Turn off your cell phone.
If you need a computer to work, close any other open applications or tabs on the computer.
Avoid working in an area where other people are likely to be making noise, like a living room or kitchen.
You can play music in the background if it will help to drown out other annoying noises that will distract you. Stick to something neutral like classical music so you aren't tempted to listen too closely. Try not to use music with lyrics.

, You will be less tempted to leave your space to get these items if you already have them at hand.Having a snack with you can help you avoid distraction from being hungry.
Keep your snacks light and healthy. Junk food is not a good choice when you are studying or doing homework.
Keep a bottle or glass of water with you in case you get thirsty.

, You won't want any of these to distract you.Log out of any social networks such as Snapchat, Tumblr, or Instagram.
Turn off any instant messengers on your phone.
Turn off your computer, unless you need it for your homework.

, They will help to make sure they don't distract you.If you have younger siblings, ask your parents to make sure they don't bother you as you do your work.
Make sure you tell them how long you plan on working.
Keep your parents informed on what your assignments are and if you are struggling in a particular subject.

, Most people have a time of day that works best.If you are tired and distracted late in the evening or right after dinner, that might not be the best time to work.
You may have to experiment with this by trying different times to see when you concentrate best.
Many students find that if they take a short break when they get home from school and then start working in the late afternoon, they can complete their work early before they are too tired or distracted.
Work in 30 minute to 1 hour intervals. You will need to take a couple of minutes as a break in between assignments to avoid distraction.

, Review each assignment and see if you need to make any adjustments to the time or order of assignments.You should complete the most difficult tasks first.
You are more likely to concentrate well at first, with your attention wandering towards the end of your homework time.
Later, when you are more tired, you can do easier assignments.
Keep your homework list accessible while you are working.

, Make sure it is not someone who will distract you from finishing your assignment.Everyone gets stuck from time to time on a difficult problem or task when they are doing homework.
Calling a classmate briefly or asking someone for help can assist you in avoiding becoming frustrated.
When you are frustrated, it is more likely that you will become distracted and procrastinate on your homework.

, This will help you feel accomplished.This will help you visualize where you are in terms of how much work you need to get done.
It will help you budget your time as you work. If an assignment took longer than expected, you can adjust your time as you go.
Make sure you do the assignments in the order you have decided. Don't be tempted to do something easy right away, as you will need to devote better concentration to harder assignments.

Set a period of time aside for studying.,
Find a place to study where you won't be distracted.,
Use music/white noise as desired.,
Make sources of procrastination inaccessible.,
Exercise, eat, and rest before studying.",How to Force Yourself to Seriously Study2," When you study, you want to be able to devote your full attention to your work. If you split your attention between your studies and some other distraction, whether it's a television show, a job, or some other task, you won't be able to retain very much information (if any). Ensure that you're able to study effectively by setting aside a reasonably-sized chunk of time for your work - and only your work.


Based on the amount of work you have to do, this time you set aside may be a one-time commitment or a regular addition to your schedule. The latter is preferable, as, over time, you'll become ""used"" to devoting a certain amount of time to studying.

, Unfortunately, many people set aside sufficient time for their studies only to waste it by allowing distractions to sidetrack them. Make sure that your study location doesn't contain anything that's been a distraction in the past. Usually, this will mean that you'll want to find a quiet, private place where you won't have access to video games, online entertainment, socializing friends, TV, and so on.


If your studying requires you to use the internet and you're worried that you may become distracted with online games, videos, and so on, try using a free productivity extension for your web browser. These applications allow you to block certain websites temporarily, ensuring that you can't access them while you study.

, To some, complete silence is a distraction of its own. If you find this to be the case, feel free to experiment with music or white noise while studying. Music can have a motivating effect on some people, keeping them focused when they might normally daydream. Others enjoy studying with white noise - constant, formless noise like rainfall or crashing waves - as it allows them to relax, focus, and ""tune out"" distractions. What's most important is that any noise you study with doesn't distract you - if you find yourself singing along to your music instead of focusing on the page in front of you, you may want to turn it off. Only use it when you feel you need it.

, In extreme cases of procrastination, it may be necessary to bite the bullet and remove the sources of the procrastination from your life temporarily (or even permanently). For instance, if you have a hard time studying because you always put the task off in favor of playing video games, leave your games at a friend's house over the weekend to give yourself the freedom to study. If they're still a distraction, sell them. Though it can be painful, eliminating the root causes of your distractions can be very worthwhile in the long run.

, The physical distractions of hunger, restlessness, and fatigue can hamper your studying efforts just as seriously as any mental distraction. To ensure you're able to study to the best of your abilities, take care of your physical needs before you begin. Eat healthy, well-balanced meals throughout the day. Devote time to exercise. Get plenty of sleep the night before. Caring for your body by doing these things gives your mind the best possible opportunity to learn new information.

Lay out the materials for each assignment you are going to do. Clear anything else off your work surface.If you have many textbooks and worksheets, stack them and put them to the side. Lay out the materials one at a time. Having a big pile of visible homework may stress you out.
Before you sit down, ask yourself: what am I about to do? What do I need to get it done?
Get things like pencils, erasers, calculators, rulers, and paper.;
, Generally, you should start with your hardest homework.However, if you are having a really hard time getting started, ease yourself into homework mode by doing your easiest assignment first.Zipping through a topic you are good at may motivate you to zip through the rest of your homework.


Do your hardest assignment second, and save your second-easiest assignment for last.
Don't save the hardest assignment for last—you may be tired by the time you reach the end of your homework pile., Once you have your station set up and your starter assignment laid out, take a quick break. Get a snack, use the bathroom, walk the dog, text, or chat with your family for 15 minutes. Once you return to your desk, it will be easy to start.Setting up your first assignment and then walking away gets you subconsciously thinking about your homework.
Catch up with a family member about both of your days. When you come home from school, your brain is usually full of school thoughts. Take a moment to process and to hear how a parent or sibling's day went.

, Do your first assignment. Estimate how long it will take you.Decide on a reward for finishing the assignment. Check the time, then try to finish the assignment in one shot. If it's a long assignment, break it into sections that will take less than 45 minutes each, and take a break in between sections.For instance, tell yourself that if you finish your first assignment in 20 minutes, you can go on your phone for 5.
Another example: you intend to finish your assignment in 20 minutes, but no matter how long it takes you, you get to walk around the block as soon as you're done.
Be careful with using food as a reward, as it can get you in the habit of snacking when you aren't hungry. If you're hungry, eat before you do your homework., If you are having trouble starting, or if you're just stuck on a problem, talk about the assignment with someone. Text or facetime a friend and chat about the homework you both have. Bring the assignment to a family member and ask them to talk about it with you. If you're stuck on something you don't understand, ask for help, or email your teacher.Sometimes just explaining what you have to do will help you understand it better.
Other times, the person you are talking to will notice something about the prompt that you overlooked.

, Do your homework for 45 minute stretches with breaks in between.Take a break for 15 minutes. Breaks are the time to get your reward, to use the bathroom or get a glass of water, and to move a little. They can also be a good moment to rearrange your homework station, if you're starting to feel stuck there.


Make sure you stand up and do something when it's your break, or you won't get your wiggles out.
Break long assignments into chunks, and switch between tasks every 45 minutes or every half hour.
Set a timer on your phone, or use a kitchen timer, to let yourself know when it's time to switch tasks.
If you can't concentrate for 45 minutes, try working for 20 minutes and breaking for 5.

, You might want to ease yourself into homework by having something enjoyable happening in the background, such as a show, music you like, or a chat with friends. However, if you get absorbed in your entertainment, you run the risk of forgetting to do your homework, or of doing a bad job.If your homework requires a lot of concentration, dividing your attention will make you feel anxious and distracted. If you do choose to study with entertainment, turn it off (including your phone) once you're focusing on the hard stuff.


If you like to study with music, try music you know well, or music with no words.
When you're struggling to focus, sign out of your email and all social media so you don't check them as a reflex.

, Write all homework you are assigned in your planner, as well as when it is due. Write the other activities you have also: extracurricular activities, special events, time with friends. Write down when you need to start each long-term assignment, and how much you need to get done each day.


Having a planner will make it less tempting to procrastinate, as long as you have broken up your studying into manageable chunks.Your planner can be paper, or you can get one on your phone. Just make sure it has space for task lists as well as events.
Once you have completed a task, cross it off or put a check next to it. Seeing that you're getting your work done will make you feel better, which in turn will motivate you to keep up the good work.
Organize your daily tasks. Put your most important homework at the top.
Homework might be considered important if it is due soon, if it is worth a lot of your grade, or if the class is hard for you.
Don't put more than you can do in one day on a list! Split up your week's work so that every day has a manageable amount.
Make sure you do everything on your list everyday. The more seriously you take the list, the more useful it will be to you

, Notice your friends who do well in school. Ask them if they'd like to form a homework group. Get together once or twice a week and work on your homework. You can work on the classes you have in common and ask each other questions, or you can work on assignments for different classes without talking.


Take turns working at one another's houses.
Make it the rule that you work for a certain amount of time, or until a certain amount of work has been accomplished. Afterward, you can hang out. Stick to this schedule.
Try this out and see if it works. If you're too distracted by having friends around, make a date to hang out after homework instead.

, Set goals for yourself and work to match them. If you always struggle with a certain kind of assignment, set a goal to learn how to do it better. Try to beat your last grade in each class. If you did perfectly, remember that the teacher may have raised the expectations for the next assignment, and do your next assignment with even more energy.


Time yourself. Set time goals. Say ""I'm going to finish this reading response in 20 minutes."" Sit down with your materials, set a timer, and go.
If you have friends or study buddies who are competitive and good with homework, compete with them. As long as it doesn't stress your friendship, this can be a fun way to motivate yourself.

, Getting into a homework routine will help you get into a homework mindset. Try out different times and see which one works best for you. You might want to get your work done right when you get home from school, or you might want to take a half-hour break first.


If you have a job or extracurricular activities that change your daily schedule, determine a weekly schedule that you stick to as much as possible.
Set certain times on weekends that you stick to.
Getting your work done reliably will help you enjoy your free time.
Experiment with working for different amounts of time. You might try focusing on one task for 20 minutes, then switching to another task for another 20.
Once you know how much time you can focus, stick to it.

, Be your own cheerleader. When you finish a task, tell yourself ""good job!"" When you're mid-task, encourage yourself to keep going, and note that you are making good progress. If you're alone or at home, you can talk aloud.


Talking to yourself can help you stay on task. If you get distracted, remind yourself out loud of what you need to do.Ask yourself questions like ""What do I need to do next?""
If you're in a public place, say it to yourself silently.

, Whenever you have an assignment with a topic you can choose, pick something that really interests you. For instance, if you have to write a paper about the civil war, pick a historical figure who you really admire or really despise. Topics that involve your feelings will be easier for you to think about for a long time.


If you don't have control over the subject, try to find connections between the topic and something you care about. Find aspects of the subject that interest you.
For instance, if you have to study History but you care the most about fashion, investigate the styles of the times and places you are studying. Learn how political and economical developments changed the way people dressed.

, If you find your workplace pleasant, you'll associate that pleasure with your homework. Work in a clean room. Clutter makes it harder to concentrate. Set a workspace by a window or in a room you think is comfortable and attractive. Make sure your workplace is well lit, your chair is comfortable, and the noise level is low.


Try working in a public or school library for a change.
If you do your homework at night, work somewhere well-lit.
Don't work on a soft surface, like a bed or a couch, if you tend to doze off.

, It can be really hard to stay motivated when you don't have a clear sense of what the point is. Some homework assignments turn out to be useful eventually, but some never do. If you feel like your work is pointless, make a list of the reasons to do it.


Reasons to do homework include: Learning something that will probably help with future assignments, even if you don't know what they are yet.
Proving to your teacher that you understand the homework so that she or he doesn't keep assigning it over and over.
Showing everyone that you are trying.
Getting a good grade.

, If you care about your grades, it can be easy to remember why you are bothering with homework. If you don't care about your grades, train yourself to care. Getting bad grades can close doors for you in the long term and in the short term. Having the option of getting into a good college can make your whole life better.


Getting good grades can qualify you for scholarships and grants.
If you are in elementary or middle school, doing well in school can get you into a better high school when you are older.
In many school districts you need a certain GPA to get a work permit as a minor.Having a high GPA can get you a ""good student"" discount on your car insurance.If your school doesn't give grades, remember that your reputation still matters. Teachers, and your classmates, will think of you as dependable and hard working if you do your work.
If you are in high school, you need your teachers to think of you as a good student so they can recommend you for college, for jobs, and for scholarships.

Stay motivated.",How to Focus," Each person may start off with a certain amount of ""focus stamina"" but rest assured that this is something that can be improved over time. To build your focus stamina, just give yourself a certain amount of time -- say, 30 minutes -- to do nothing but work on a certain task. When that time passes, see how long you can keep going before actually stopping, whether it's just another five minutes or another half hour.


If you repeat this process, you'll see that you're able to focus on just one task much more than you thought. Keep going until you feel you need to stop, and try to focus for longer the next day.;
, Meditating is not only a great way to relax but if you meditate for just 10 to 20 minutes every day, you will slowly improve your focus. When you meditate, you'll be focusing on clearing your head and concentrating on your body and breath. You can easily transfer these skills to clearing your head and focusing on the work ahead of you. You can meditate when you first wake up or to wind down before bed, or even during both times.


Find a relatively quiet environment so you're not distracted by noise.
Just find a comfortable seat and place your hands on your knees or lap.
Work on relaxing your body, one part at a time, until all of the parts of your body are relaxed.

, Reading is a great way to build up your focus. Try reading something without stopping for just thirty minutes, and slowly build your stamina to reading for an hour or even two hours with only short breaks. Being able to focus on the material in front of you, whether you're reading a romance novel or a biography, will help you learn to focus on your work.


As you read, ask yourself questions every few pages to make sure that you understand what you're reading and that you're placing all of your concentration and energy into the material.
Reading in the morning is a great way to wake up your mind, and reading in bed is a great way to wind down before bedtime.
Make a goal of reading for thirty more minutes a day, and watching television for thirty less minutes. The concentration you build up from reading can be harmed by the concentration that you may lose from watching a television show with a lot of commercials.
Try to block out all distractions while reading. Keep your phone on silent and if you want to, tell your family members not to disturb you while you're reading. This will not only build up your concentration and focus but will also help you absorb the words written on the page before you.

, Though many people think that multi-tasking is a great way to accomplish goals more quickly and to get two or three things done at once, multi-tasking is actually harmful to your concentration. When you multi-task, you may think you're getting more done, but you're not putting all of your focus and energy into any one task, which actually harms your concentration.


Work on getting just one thing done at a time and you'll see that you get this done more quickly.
Chatting with your friends online while getting work done is one of the worst forms of multi-tasking. Chatting with a friend can slow your productivity down by half.
If you're working at home, avoid the temptation to do chores while you're working or studying. You may get the dishes washed, but you'll slow yourself down tremendously.

, Have you ever spent a whole day ""working"" and then wondered how you managed to accomplish almost nothing? If this has happened to you, then you should reflect on the experience before you jump into another equally unproductive day. Before you start working, you should write down all of the things that were and weren't working during your study or work session to make sure to have a better experience.


Were you supposed to study, but spent the whole time gossiping with your study buddy? Then you should study solo next time.
Were you doing work in your office, but really spent the whole day helping out your colleagues instead of getting any work done for yourself? Then next time, you should be less helpful and a little bit more selfish.
Did you waste your whole day reading random articles that people posted on Facebook, g-chatting with your friends, or texting with your friends about what you'll do that night? It's better to do those things after the work day is done.
Before you start your work day, write down whatever it was that kept you from accomplishing your goals, so that you're less likely to make the same mistake.

, Whether you're going to the library or heading to the office for an eight-hour work day, it's important to have a solid routine before you start working so your day starts off on the right foot and you're more motivated to get everything done.


Get enough sleep. Wake up and go to bed around the same time every day, so that your body feels alert and refreshed when you get up, not groggy and tired.
Eat a healthy breakfast. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day, so you should eat enough to have the energy to start working, but not so much that you feel sluggish or bogged down. Eat healthy carbs like oatmeal or wheat cereal, proteins like eggs or lean turkey, and some fruits or vegetables to get your day started.
Make time for some quick exercise. Just 15 to 20 minutes of walking, light aerobics, or sit-ups and abdominal exercises will get your blood pumping without making you tired.
Watch your caffeine intake. Though coffee can jolt you awake, try not to have more than one cup a day, or you'll crash by noon. Instead, switch to a low-caffeine tea, or even wean yourself off of caffeine completely, if you really want to have a productive day.

, Though you may not have the luxury of choosing when to start and end your work day if you work in a traditional office, if you do have some flexibility, then you should start working when you feel most alert, and pick an environment that helps you do work.


Remember that everyone's most productive hour is different. Some people are most productive when they first wake up, while others need some more time to get settled before they really feel alert. Pick the time when your body is most ready to say, ""Let's go!"" and not, ""Let's nap.""
It's important to find the right work environment for yourself. Some people work best from home because they feel the most comfortable there, while others feel more motivated when they're in a coffee shop or library where everyone is doing work.

, If you want to be as focused and productive as possible, then you should anticipate your needs before you start studying, or your mind will start to wander if your body wants to do something other than work.


Be prepared with healthy snacks like nuts, apples, bananas, and carrot sticks to keep you going instead of stepping out to the vending machine.
Always hydrate. No matter where you go, you should bring a bottle of water to keep your body refreshed.
Bring or wear layers of clothing. If the room where you're working is too hot or too cold, you should be prepared to take off some layers or throw on a scarf or a sweater. You don't want to lose your focus because you're sweating or shivering and can't do anything about it.

, If you want to focus better, you need to make a to-do list every day so that you have a tangible list of things to check off when you're done, and feel more direction to accomplish your goals. Instead of sitting around aimlessly, you'll have a list of goals in front of you, and will feel a sense of pride when you get them done.Write down at least three things you need to get done that day, three things you need to get done the next day, and three things that need to get done that week. Tackle the things that you need to get done that day first, and feel accomplished if you have time to get a jump start and work on the other tasks.
Reward yourself with breaks. Give yourself a small break every time you check another item off of your to-do list.
Try doing all the small tasks, such as getting groceries, as soon as you can. This will narrow down your list and will ensure that you do all the minor tasks first. Don't be lazy and procrastinate those small things!

, Remember to do the most creative or difficult tasks in the morning, when you're full of energy and motivation. Save the easier things, like scheduling meetings, filing old papers, or cleaning your work space, for the afternoon, when you're feeling more drained.Don't put off the hardest task until the end of the day, or you may find that it will spill into the next day.

, Keeping an organized space is the key to being able to focus. Focusing is much easier if you know exactly where everything in your office, library desk, backpack, or general workspace is. Having an organized space will save you countless time when you need to find something, and it will keep you more motivated to get work done.


Clear anything not work-related away from your workspace. Aside from a few photos in your work office, everything you keep out should be related to work, whether it's paper, a stapler, or a set of pens.
Put away your cell phone unless you really need it to work. You can check it every hour or two, but don't keep it out on your desk, or you'll be tempted to look at it all the time.
Have an organized filing system. Knowing exactly where all of your documents are will save you tons of time throughout the day.

, Managing your time is an important part of being focused. When you start a new work day and write your to-do list, write how long you think it will take to accomplish each task next to the task, so that you have a sense of what your day will look like. Try to do the most time-consuming things first so you can get them out of the way.


Set reasonable expectations for each task. You shouldn't give yourself twenty minutes to do something that should take an hour. Otherwise, you'll get disappointed when you don't accomplish your goals.
If you finish a task early, use that time for a quick break. This will motivate you to get more work done.

, Taking breaks is just as important as staying on task. If you plan your day to include bursts of productivity followed by short breaks, then you'll be far more focused than if you just spend the entire day ""sort of"" working without taking any real breaks.Give yourself at least 10 to 20 minutes to take a break after every hour of work. You can use this time to make a quick phone call, respond to a friend's email, or step out to get a cup of tea.
Reward yourself with breaks. Use the breaks as a motivation to get work done. If you think, ""I can have a delicious smoothie once I'm done with this paper,"" then you'll be much more motivated than if there's nothing positive on the horizon.
Use one of the breaks to get some mild exercise. Just taking a quick 15-minute walk or walking up five flights of stairs and then back down will get your blood going and will make you feel more alert and energized.
Take a break to get some fresh air. Don't spend all day cooped up in your office or home. Step out to breathe in some fresh air, catch a morning breeze, or let the sunlight hit your face and you'll feel more focused and ready to get back to work.

, The Internet may be filled with interesting and valuable information, but when it comes to getting work done, it can be a huge time-suck. If you really want to get work done, then you need to avoid social media and chatting with your friends throughout your work day, and to check your email only a few times a day if you really need to.


If you spot an interesting article, tell yourself that you can read it during your scheduled break time -- but not sooner.
Avoid sending personal emails while you're working. This will distract you and will usually take a lot longer than you intended.
If you don't really need the Internet for work, then disconnect your wireless completely. You can reconnect it every hour or two to check back in.
Avoiding online distractions completely takes time. If you check your Facebook and email every fifteen minutes, start by checking it every 30 minutes, and see if you can work up to checking it just two or three times a day, or to avoiding Facebook altogether.
If you do need the Internet to work, try not to keep more than five tabs open at a time. Focus on what you need to read and move on. If you have too many pages open at once, your mind will be in multi-task mode.

, Other people are a major distraction, whether you're working in an office or a library. Don't let them keep you from accomplishing your goals. Though it may be tempting to socialize when you're supposed to be working, this will slow you down and will make you work longer.Let everyone around you know how important it is that you get your work done, whether you're working near your family or your colleagues. They'll be less likely to butt in if they see how committed you are.
Don't take personal phone calls or text messages unless there's no avoiding it. Tell your friends and family to contact you while you're working if it's really important, and you'll get less messages.
If you have a study buddy or a study group, make sure everyone stays on task. You can even clap your hands once every time people get off task to serve as a reminder of how important it is to stay focused.

, Any work environment can be distracting if you allow it to get to you. But if you have the right mindset, then you can use almost any work environment to your advantage. Here's what to do:


If you're working in a loud and public place, invest in some noise-cancelling headphones or listen to music without lyrics to stay focused.
If you're sitting next to someone who is talking on his phone, or two friends who are loudly engaged in conversation, move away from them, even if you're settled in your place.
If you're working somewhere where a television is on, don't look up at it more than once an hour, or you can get sucked in.

, If you want to avoid distractions and focus more, the best way is to stay motivated to finish your task. You should write down why you're motivated to get your work done, and look down at this reason several times a day, to remind yourself why it's important to focus and not be tempted by a distraction.


Consider the importance of your work itself. Tell yourself that if you're grading papers, it's important to give your students feedback. If you're wrapping up a project, then it's important for the success of your company.
Consider yourself. What personal advantage will you gain from getting the work done? If you study for a test, then you'll be able to get a good grade and boost your CGPA. If you seal an important deal with a client, you may be able to get a promotion.
Consider the fun things that await once the work is done. Remind yourself about the fun things you can do once the task is done, whether it's taking an evening yoga class, catching up with an old friend over ice cream, or having a nice, relaxing meal with your significant other.

Get into your character’s mindset.,
Identify your lines.,
Write your lines out.,
Practice speaking lines from memory.,
Rehearse your lines with someone.","How to Memorize Scripts, Poems, Verses1"," It might be easier to memorize your lines if you first spend some time reading the script closely and thinking about your character. Tapping into your character’s motivations and emotions can help you to see your character’s lines as reactions to other characters and situations rather than just memorizing words on a page. Read through the script and ask yourself some questions about your character, such as:


What is he/she like?
What emotions is he/she experiencing at different points in the script?
What does your character want?;
, Unless you're in a solo show, you won't need to memorize the entire script from cover to cover. Before you begin memorizing the lines you will need to know, it's a good idea to visually identify your lines so you can quickly scan the script and find your parts.


Use a highlighter to highlight your lines throughout the script.
Select a different colored highlighter to mark the lines right before yours, called the cue lines.Consider having a different color for each character's cue lines, if you'll be speaking after more than one other actor.
When you study your lines from the script, you'll now be able to quickly glance at the page and recognize the line that leads into yours (which you may need to respond to), and your own line.

, Depending on the length of the script and the number of lines you have, this may not be as feasible as with a poem or verse. However, writing continues to be recognized as one of the best ways to commit something to memory.Write your lines out by hand. It's more effective for memorization than typing.
Try writing all of your lines in one huge paragraph. Then rehearse the scene from your notes, and practice breaking the paragraph into your individual lines by memory.Use chunking. Don't write out all the lines from the entire play; break it into acts or scenes to make it more manageable., Just as poetry is easier if you focus on the rhythm, memorizing script lines can be easier if you pair your lines with a physical action. Bringing muscle memory into your practice while you do something distracting can help your brain concentrate on the lines and commit them to memory.Try cooking, cleaning, or walking/jogging while you rehearse your lines.

, The best way to learn your lines for a play is to rehearse the lines with another person. That way you'll learn your own lines and you'll learn the cue for when you come in on each line.


Take the time to really listen to the words in your cue lines. This should start when you're rehearsing at home with a friend, but it becomes particularly important to learn the other actors' inflections and tonal shifts during on-stage rehearsal.
Consider why your character says the things he or she says after each cue line. This may help you memorize the words, and it will almost certainly help you develop some type of emotional component to bring the words to life.Remember to breathe while you practice your lines. Your breathing pattern will need to be fine tuned when you step on stage, so practice learning your lines with the proper breathing from the start."
"
Select a poem.,
Read the poem over and over.,
Write the poem out.,
Practice reciting the poem from memory.","How to Memorize Scripts, Poems, Verses2"," Similar to verse memorization, it may be easiest to begin by memorizing a poem you're familiar with. If you have a favorite poem, go with that one. If not, look for a poem that you have at least a passing familiarity with.It may be helpful to start out with shorter poems. Trying to memorize a long, sprawling, book-length poem could prove difficult enough to turn you off to memorization.
In addition to brevity, look for a poem that has strong rhythmic component to it. A metered rhythm can help you remember the words by nodding or tapping to the beat., The first step to memorization is immersion, and poetry is no different. Re-read the poem over and over, as many times as it takes until you can hear the rhythm and remember bits and pieces of the poem just by recollection.Make sure that you understand the poem before you begin to memorize it. What is it about? What does it mean? Reciting or writing it by memory will be much easier if you have a deep understanding of what the poem is all about.Try incorporating a tactile component by using your finger to trace the letters of the poem's words on the page.
You can also whisper along to the poem under your breath to further drill it into your memory.

, Writing by hand on scrap paper will help commit the poem to memory. It forces you to develop some muscle memory connected to the words of the poem.Try chunking, or breaking the poem up into manageable parts.Write out the first line or two of the poem, then practice re-writing that line or two over and over. Aim for a significant, yet manageable, number of repetitions (15 or 20 should be enough to commit it to memory).
Once you've written that first line or two out repeatedly, move on to the next line/lines, and so forth.

, Reciting the poem to yourself can both test your memory and help cement any parts of the poem you may be struggling with. Write the poem out on a sheet of paper so you have something to reference, and keep it in your pocket unless you absolutely need it.


Try combining a physical movement with the meter of the poem. Go for a long walk and use each step as a ""metric foot"" of the poem.Check the written (and correct) poem from time to time to ensure that you're not mis-memorizing it.

"
"
Choose a verse.,
Memorize the verse's location.,
Recite the actual verse.,
Put it all together.","How to Memorize Scripts, Poems, Verses3"," Rather than beginning with just any verse, it may be easiest to begin by memorizing one of your favorite verses. That way you'll already have some familiarity with the verse, and you'll be able to recall the general concept of that verse very easily.Select your favorite verse to begin with.
If you don't already have a favorite, choose a verse that you're familiar with and can easily recognize when you hear/read it.
Re-read the verse you've chosen several times until it is fresh in your memory.
Think about what the verse means as well. What is it saying? Is there a lesson attached to the verse? If so, what is it?

, If you're trying to quote verses from the Bible, it's important to learn the verse's location in conjunction with the verse. Quoting the Bible may take some skill in itself, but without the corresponding location you may not appear to know the Bible as well as others do.Write the verse's location on a scrap of paper - for example, ""Peter 2:24"" is shorthand for the Book of Peter, chapter 2, verse 24.
Practice writing the verse's location over and over. This is called rote learning (learning by repetition), and it's considered a highly effective memorization technique.Say the verse's location out loud to yourself as you write it. Combining the spoken verse location with its written numerals may help cement it in your memory.

, Once you've committed the verse's location to memory, you'll be ready to incorporate the verse itself. This may be more difficult than the verse's location, due to its length and complexity in comparison to the location.


Write the verse repeatedly on a sheet of paper. This can help drive the verse into your memory the same way writing the verse's location did.Practice saying your chosen verse out loud over and over. Try to repeat the verse in its entirety without looking at the written verse, if possible.

, After learning the verse itself and its location, you'll need to commit the pairing to memory. You can do this by the same written methods you used for the individual components, or you can try using a missing words exercise to test your memory.


Take a dry-erase board or a sufficiently large piece of blank paper.
Write out the verse location, followed by the verse. If you're using a dry-erase board, write in a dry-erase marker; if you're using paper, use a pencil or keep index cards on hand to cover it up.
Erase or cover up various portions of the verse and its location. Wait a few minutes before coming back to the lines, and see if you can recall the words or numbers missing from the board.
Another variation on this exercise is to write parts of the verse on separate, identical slips of paper. Then scramble the slips up and try to return them to their correct order."
"
Use mnemonic devices.,
Develop a kinesthetic memory.,
Try downloading an app.,
Develop a memory palace technique.","How to Memorize Scripts, Poems, Verses4"," A mnemonic device is a memory trick to help you remember larger pieces of information. These can be very helpful no matter what you're trying to memorize, as they will associate the lines you're learning with something you're already familiar with.


Having a mnemonic device like an acronym (in which the first letter of each word is used to form a word or phrase) can make it easier to spark your memory if you find yourself searching for a word. You'll probably remember at least a few words from the line, and may be able to piece the rest together if you can remember your acronym.Try memorizing lines by pairing them with music from a song. Music has been shown to be a powerful and reliable technique for any type of memorization, so associating lines from a verse/poem/script with a familiar and catchy melody might help you recall those lines later.
Use visual association by linking each word with a visual image you're familiar with. As you read the line you're trying to memorize, close your eyes and picture whatever visual cue will help you remember that line (it works best if you can find some kind of correlation between the image and the line).
You can use visual associations with ""peg words"" (also called hooks) by making a numerical list for each word in a given line. Rhyme each number with a visual image (for example, one - bun, two - shoe, etc.), then try to associate that image with a corresponding word in the line.Grouping/chunking involves lumping words or lines together based on common characteristics. This may be helpful if many of the lines you're trying to memorize are scene-specific.
You can use rhyming as a way to associate the lines you need to remember with a word that shares similar sounds. Try saying the word out loud until a rhyming word pops into your head, then recite the two words together until it sticks in your memory., Kinesthetic memory associations use physical sensations or actions as a cue for remembering something (in this case, a line from a verse, poem, or script). For example, you might use certain actions/motions while rehearsing your lines so that you will later associate that line with the corresponding action. Alternately, you might visualize how something will feel (for example, easing into a hot bath) and use that physical sensation's memory as a cue for a line that reminds you of that sensation.

, There are a number of applications you can download on a smartphone or tablet. Some give you advice or tips, while others can actually let you download scripts and practice with the device.Search online for apps that are available on your device.
Try to find a balance between price and helpfulness. If you can afford it, it might be worth splurging on a really useful app that will help you learn your lines faster.

, If you've ever seen the television series Sherlock, you're probably familiar with the titular character's ""mind palace."" However, you may not realize that that technique is actually a real memorization trick. The memory palace, also called the method of loci (for location), dates back more than 2,000 years to the ancient Greek poet Simonides.Today it is used by some memory experts to recall 100-digit numbers, the order of a deck of cards, and so on.


Visualize a complex physical place large enough to store a physical set of memories (if such a thing existed).
Many people use their childhood home, as it is easiest to recall, but any physical space (indoors or outdoors) will do.If using an indoor location, break the space down into separate rooms, then distinct locations within each room. If using an outdoor location, try something specific like a particular street with multiple addresses.
Give some slight embellishment or exaggeration to the ""item"" you're trying to ""store"" in your memory. For example, instead of a wool blanket, imagine a talking sheep who is trimming his own wool coat off.
Store different verses, stanzas, lines, or any other piece of writing you need to memorize into the various walls and corners of each room in your memory palace."
"
Set aside a specific time to do your homework.Doing your homework at the same time each day will help you develop a regular routine.For instance, try setting aside a time you know you can work well such as an hour or two before dinner, or if you're a night owl, after dinner.,
Work in blocks of time with breaks in between each block.,
Prioritize tasks.,
Create a schedule.,
Make sure to complete the most pressing assignments first.It might be easier to do all of your 5-point quizzes right now for an online class your taking, but procrastinating working on a major research paper that is due much sooner will likely have negative effect on your grade.,
Break down larger projects into manageable tasks.,
Don't multitask.,
Find a comfortable, but not too comfortable, place to work.,
Minimize social distractions.,
Minimize noise.,
Ask your parents or peers for help.,
Ask your teacher for help or clarification.,
Find a tutor (if available).,
Go to the library.",How to Finish Your Homework," Just make sure it's a time when you'll likely be alert and motivated.;
, Studies suggest that the most productive students and workers in general are the ones who take breaks, as it helps to recharge your brain.Work in hour blocks, with 50 minutes spent studying and 10 minutes spent taking a break.It can also be helpful to move around when you are taking your break, especially if you are working at a screen., Knowing which assignments are most important and which will take the most time will help you manage your time effectively. Don't forget to include time for revisions, corrections, or other additional parts of an assignment (such as going to the library or to the store for materials).Identify which assignments are worth the most points for each class. Most likely these will take the longest to complete.Consider how long you have to do each project, and if possible, see when the assignment is introduced. Oftentimes, primary and secondary school classes do not have syllabi, so it might be harder to plan out an entire term, but if you are in college, you will most likely have a syllabus with at least a partial course schedule. Knowing how long you have to complete an assignment will help you prioritize which assignments to do first. You can also ask the teacher how long you have to complete an assignment., Make sure that your schedule effectively shows assignment due dates, other obligations, and specific time-blocks for completing assignments. This will help you visualize your schedule, and help you remember your homework. It will also help with prioritizing your assignments.Use highlighters or stickers to mark which assignments are most important.
If you're using an online or mobile schedule, create alerts or notifications for the projects and any time-sensitive steps for those projects.

, Besides, it will be easier to complete other assignments once you've gotten the biggest ones out of the way. However, it is also important not to let a big project overshadow the smaller assignments you need to complete.

, This can mean breaking down a packet of math problems into separate sections to be worked on at different times. For something like a research paper, it can mean dividing the assignment in to the planning, researching, writing, and revision stages.You might even create an outline of the steps in order to visualize the necessary tasks to get the assignment done.

, While multitasking seems as though it would save time, it often results in taking longer to do more tasks. It also decreases performance of cognitive tasks.So, not only should you not multitask between assignments, but you should avoid multitasking with television or social media as well.

, Environments can help or harm your productivity. You'll want a place that's quiet and not too busy, but you'll also want to avoid places where you could easily fall asleep. If you have a desk or a table, that might be a better location than a couch or a bed., While working in groups can sometimes help especially with difficult subjects like physics and calculus, they can also be a distraction from getting work done. In order to maximize study time when you're alone, you'll need to un-plug to get the most out of your time. Though you may still feel the temptation to socialize, it should be easier to avoid the temptations when you've minimized the social distractions.


Turn your phone off or on silent (not vibrate). It might be best to put the phone out of sight, or in another room while you work, as the temptation to text or get on social media can be as much of a distraction as actually using social media.Use an app that blocks social media. There are plenty of applications out there that can help block social media and other distracting sites (such as shopping or gaming sites)., Noise has been linked to decreased performance and increased stress levels, neither of which are good for doing homework.While certain kinds of noise such as the sounds of a coffee shop or music may help some people focus, it can easily turn into a distraction, as in the case of a loud group of people who suddenly come into a coffee shop. For best results, find a way to study in quiet.


Use a white noise app to block out noise.Use earplugs or noise-blocking earmuffs. Work in a quiet place, such as a library or a home office, if you have one.
Avoid listening music while studying. Studies have shown that although listening to music while studying lowers overall performance, this does not affect everyone equally. However listening to music before studying has been shown to improve performance on cognitive tasks., Parent involvement in homework has been shown to help with homework completion and improved academic performance.Peers are also a valuable resource in learning. Asking a friend for help in understanding a concept or an assignment can go a long way in helping you complete your homework on time., While it can feel daunting to ask a teacher for help on an assignment or for clarification on an assignment, their goal is to help you understand what they're teaching. Most likely, they'll be glad you've reached out for help, and will do their best to assist you.

If you're too afraid to ask a teacher during class, see if you can stay behind to ask your questions., Sometimes, a tutor can be a great resource for improving your understanding of a subject.Tutors are a great resource, as they have knowledge of your subject, and one-on-one instruction can help you understand the material in a way that in-class discussion might not have. It is also often easier to ask questions of your tutor rather than in front of the whole class.


First, contact your school to see if there are any after-school tutoring programs. While not all primary and secondary schools offer tutoring, a vast majority of universities do. If your school does not offer tutoring, they may know of other resources for you to contact.
Then, contact your library to see if they offer any tutoring.In some areas, there may also be free community tutoring programs. Contact your local community center for more information.
There are plenty of private tutors out there as well, but they can be costly (ranging any where from $10 to $40 an hour).You can find tutors online through a number of websites, such as Craigslist or Angie's list.

, In addition to having books and other useful materials for homework, many libraries offer quiet places for study. Many libraries offer other resources such as tutoring, reference librarians, and, at many academic libraries, subject specific librarians. If you need to work at a library after school, ask your parents or search the web to find your local library."

Sticking to this schedule will give you a greater feeling of control over your homework.


List items starting with the most difficult.
If you have one large assignment with multiple parts, break those down in their own list.

, Your ability to concentrate will be highest when you first begin doing homework which should make these more difficult tasks take less time.If you are having trouble getting started you might start with a couple of shorter assignments that you can easily cross off your list before tackling the more difficult or more boring work.
If you find yourself running out of steam or getting distracted, try taking a break to work on one of your easier assignment. This way you're giving yourself a chance to recharge while still staying productive.

, These will give you a good idea of what material is going to pop up and prepare you for what to look for as you read., If you are the type of reader who feels like you always have to go back and reread sections or someone who finds their mind drifting in the middle of paragraphs, reading out loud can be a great way to stay focused on the material and increase your comprehension., Rephrase passages or the steps to solving a problem in your own words to help your understand and memorize key concepts.


Imagine you are explaining it someone else.

, Have a pen or highlighter handy to note points that seem important., Make sure you are asking questions of the text rather than just trying to breeze through the reading. Consider the writer’s intent, organization, voice etc.

Now as you read you can be looking for the answers to this question., If you have a hundred math problems to do, tell yourself you have to get twenty of them done in the next 30 or 40 minutes. If you have ten chapters to read in a novel, focus on getting through one or two at a time with brief breaks in between. , Before you get started write down what you hope to accomplish. Is your goal to finish the outline for a paper? To complete the practice test at the end of the chapter in your math book? Be realistic about what you can get done while still challenging yourself.

, Setting up small rewards for yourself can be a great motivator as long as you practice restraint and stick to your schedule. Have a granola bar or some almonds as a snack.
Listen to some music.
Give yourself five minutes to check social media.

, Sitting and focusing for a long period of time can be exhausting. Giving your brain and body a break will help you stay alert. Take a ten minute break every hour or so to get up, stretch, walk around or grab something to eat.

, This can be a helpful way to get started. Tell yourself you need to work for a half an hour straight before you can do anything else. You can increase the time as you go to start training yourself to work for longer periods of time without a break.

, Caffeine can make you more alert and help you stay awake, but too much can leave you jittery and anxious which will make getting your homework done even more difficult. Try to stick to one or two cups. , Most high school students have study hall time.

Keep the big picture in mind.",How to Enjoy Homework," If you want to enjoy doing your homework, the time of day you start can make a big difference. Everyone has certain times during the day where they feel more energetic or more tired. You're unlikely to enjoy homework if you feel exhausted while studying. Pick a time of day to work during which you have a natural energy boost.It may help to take a few days to measure your natural ebb and flow of energy. You may find that, during late afternoon, you feel a sudden slump in energy. However, as it gets closer to the evening hours, you may suddenly have a boost in energy. Therefore, instead of doing homework after school, try to do your homework after dinner each night.
You'll feel happier and more productive if you're studying during a time when you're experiencing a peak in energy. Homework will seem to go by faster, and you will not struggle as much to concentrate.;
, You can get into the homework mode if you start with something you enjoy. If you loathe your weekly algebra assignments, don't start there. You'll start off doing your homework in a bad mood, which is likely to get worse as you move through a subject you hate. Instead, start with an assignment you genuinely enjoy. For example, if you love writing in your English journal, begin there.You can alternate between subjects you like and dislike. This can help give you motivation while moving through subjects that bore you. For example, if you love science but hate history, do half of your science assignment, then half of your history one, and then return to science.

, The atmosphere where you work can affect how much you enjoy doing your homework. If you're working in an area full of distractions, you'll have a harder time completing assignments. This can lead to feelings of frustration and stress. Instead, opt for a fun and relaxing environment.Even small changes can make homework time more enjoyable. You could, for example, move your desk near the window. Natural light may lead to a more calming environment, and you can occasionally look up and enjoy the view.
You can also think about studying outside the house. If you love hanging out at a local coffee shop, try doing your homework there. You can get a latte or a coffee as a treat as you move through your homework.

, Having music on in the background can make studying more fun and enjoyable. Try making yourself a homework playlist, including songs that pump you up and keep you going. A small bit of background music can make homework a more pleasant experience.You may have to experiment with different songs. Some songs may be distracting. If a song makes you want to get up and dance, for example, it may not the best to include on a homework playlist, as you will lose focus in your homework. Some people find classical music is very helpful when studying.
Not everyone can concentrate with music in the background. If you find music is making it harder for you to study, you may want to nix the playlists and focus on other means to enjoy your homework.

, It can be hard to stay motivated during homework, especially if you have a lot of work to do. Therefore, it's a good idea to motivate yourself with short breaks. Create a time table for yourself in which you reward yourself with brief breaks.Many people find it's most effective to work in short spurts. You may want to plan to work in half hour to 45-minute intervals, for example, and then take a 5 to 10 minute break.
Be careful with breaks, however. Make sure you time your breaks wisely so they don't end up running over. If you allow yourself a 10 minute Facebook break every 40 minutes, set a timer on your phone to make sure you do not end up procrastinating on social media for hours.

, Homework may feel more enjoyable if you know you're working towards a goal. Obviously, there are many abstract and long term rewards that come with homework, such as good grades and learning new things. However, concrete and short term rewards may be helpful in the moment. Pick a small indulgence for yourself, like a piece of candy, that you work towards when studying. For example, you could allow yourself to have a snack after you finish your math assignment., Studying and homework can be more fun if you do so in a group. You can keep each other motivated and provide one another with company and brief distractions. A study group can also help if you struggle with a particular subject, as a knowledgeable friend may be able to help you work through a challenging assignment.Be careful who you include in a study group. While you want to be able to enjoy yourself, you also want to get work done. Choose people who are serious enough students that you won't end up distracted all night.
Together as a group, you can brainstorm ways to have fun. For example, you can agree you'll do homework in silence for 40 minutes and then take a 15 minute break to chat.

, A game of ""Beat the Clock"" can help make homework more fun, and make it go faster. See how many math problems you can get done in 15 minutes. Then, try to break that record. Challenging yourself a little can make homework seem like a game. If you're working in a study group, you can have a small competition between you and your friends. You can even consider a reward as motivation. For example, the loser has to buy the winner a cup of coffee.


Be careful, however, not to do sloppy work. If you're trying to break a record, you may speed through your homework. Strive to work efficiently rather than quickly.

, You should not think of homework as a boring task you have to do. Instead, think of it as part of the process of learning, finishing school, and a normal part of your daily routine. Allow yourself to feel like you've achieved something when you finish your homework. This will provide you with a sense of motivation, meaning you'll be more likely to enjoy your assignments.It can help to make a to-do list. Your studies are items you can check off the list, allowing you to relax and unwind. You'll also feel a sense of achievement with each item you check off your list.
Stop and think about what you've accomplished when you finish your homework. Try to feel proud of yourself for getting your work done. You'll learn to work towards this sense of accomplishment in the future.

, Procrastination is a major temptation, especially if you're not a fan of homework. However, procrastinating greatly reduces your ability to enjoy your homework. You'll end up frustrated with yourself later on, regretting the time you spent procrastinating when you should have been working. Eliminate distractions going into your homework time, buckle down, and get things done., A good way to keep up motivation is to chart your progress. If you're working towards the end of the school year, count down the days. Only allow yourself to check off a day on the calendar after you've finished that day's work. You can also make a list of your assignments, and cross them off one by one as you go. This can contribute to a feeling of achievement. You may enjoy doing your homework more if you can physically the progress you're making., It can also help to work with a bigger picture in mind. You may enjoy yourself more if you know you're developing an impressive skill set. If you find yourself feeling bored or frustrated by an assignment, pause and consider how this will benefit you down the road. This may help you gleam a newfound appreciation for a subject, allowing you to enjoy it more.

If you dislike your writing assignments, pause and consider how good writing skills can help you get a job. If you dislike your computer class, try to keep in mind that basic computer skills will be important in college and the working world.

Begin to learn German, if you have not already started.,
Visit exchangestudentworld.com or talk to a former exchange student, so that you can get a first-person point of view of what it's like to live in another country.,
Talk to your family about why you want to do an exchange program in Germany.,
Speak to your German teacher, if you have one, about possible exchange programs.,
Do research into German exchange student companies.,
Apply for scholarships to study abroad.,
Raise money through fundraisers or a job.,
Communicate with your host family, if you have one.,
Set up a way to communicate with your family and friends.,
Keep a high Grade Point Average (GPA).,
Prepare yourself mentally for a few months of loneliness.,
Ask your parents or friends to visit at the end of your trip.",How to Become an Exchange Student in Germany," Even though total immersion into a culture is the best way to learn a language, many exchange programs require you to take classes in German while you are there. If your school does not have a German program, you may need to seek out a German tutor.;
, Exchange programs are not for everyone; they require open-mindedness, flexibility, positivity and the spirit of adventure. Make sure you consider the ramifications of being isolated away from friends and family before you speak with your family about an exchange.

, If you have thought long and hard about what it would mean to you, and how it will help you to achieve future goals, your parents are likely to understand. Most exchange students are minors so you will need your parents' approval.


Begin planning 1 to 2 years in advance. This will give you plenty of time to learn German, get enough funds or scholarships to pay for the trip and communicate with your host company.

, The teacher may be able to facilitate an exchange with friends and families in Germany. If not, there may be companies that the teacher would recommend highly.

, Some good places to start are the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange, at usagermanyscholarship.org Two Worlds, at Twoworldsunited.com, ASSE, at asse.com, Rotary Youth Exchange, at https://www.rotary.org/en/youth-exchanges, and the German Academic Exchange Service, at daad.org.


Understand that you may not have a choice in where you are placed. Some companies or organizations only have contracts with certain schools and families. You should be open to living almost anywhere in Germany.
Some of these exchange program companies are for-profit. This means they will require extra money from you in order to facilitate the exchange and you will pay them for their services. They may require a deposit and regular payments before departure.

, The Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange and a few other programs provide scholarships to help cover the costs of housing, schooling, food and more when you are abroad. Download the forms, write an essay and submit it in time.

, Germany currently runs on the Euro, which is evaluated over the dollar. This means that it is slightly more expensive to live in Germany than it is to live in the United States, and perhaps much more expensive, depending upon where you will live.

, It is a great idea to practice your German by writing letters or emails to your host family and get to know them before you go. If other students are also going to be spending a year nearby in Germany, you may want to start communicating with them as well.

, The best way is to use a newer laptop computer or tablet. You can use the built-in web cam and microphone to use Skype or Google Hangout, so that you can see and speak with everyone on a regular basis.

, Some programs require transcripts that show you have a 2.75 GPA or higher. You will need high grades in German, and you may be required to take conversation or written tests in German.

, Living away from your family and friends during your formative years will be very hard. Rest assured that most exchange students find themselves adapting and not wanting to leave at the end of their stay.

, The best way to ensure that your parents understand all the changes you are going through, is to invite them to see what you have seen. Either ask them to stay in your home stay village or travel through Germany and/or Europe.

Check your work.",How to Do Your Homework During the Holidays," Look at the due date of each assignment, as well as how each assignment is weighted as a part of your final grade. Prioritize those assignments that are due first, as well as the ones that will have the greatest impact on your overall mark in class.If you know a certain assignment will take longer, even if it is not due first, budget time for it when you are creating your schedule. For example, a paper may be due later than a worksheet, but it will likely also take longer, and so should be started sooner.;
, You may have a lot going on during the holidays, which is why it is important to make sure you have time set aside every day to study. Create a schedule that fits around your holiday plans, and stick to it as much as possible.Try setting aside consistent times for certain subjects every day. For example, if you know you will have time in the afternoon, set aside a block from 2pm to 4pm to work on your homework.
If you need to work on multiple subjects over the holidays, alternate your study time from day to day. You may want to work on your history homework on Mondays and Wednesdays, and your maths work on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Use a personal planner or calendar to mark down your study times, and write what assignments you want to work on for each day.

, You may have other plans during your holiday, and it’s important to make sure your study schedule doesn’t interfere with your holiday plans. If you know you will be on vacation, visiting family, or doing something else at certain points during your holiday, reserve those times as special, “no-school” times and leave your books at home.Studying distracted can actually make it more difficult to learn and retain information. When you designate no-study time, it’s important to stick to it so that you don’t miss vital steps or information in your school work.

, Before you leave school for any extended period of time, make sure you have all of the materials you will need to do your work with you. These may include your books, a computer, notebooks, pens, calculators, or any special materials relevant to the subjects you will work on.If you are traveling and you forget something, it may be difficult or expensive to get a replacement on the go.
To avoid missing anything, look at each assignment before you leave and make a checklist of what materials you need to complete that assignment. Go through the checklist and make sure you have packed everything you need to take with you before you leave school.

, Set an alarm to wake up and give yourself enough time to do your homework, or set a reminder for later in the day if you plan on doing your homework in the afternoon or evening. Make sure you have a reminder to keep you on schedule and motivated.


If you carry a phone or tablet with you regularly, set reminders on your digital calendar so that you get instant notifications.
If you use a planner, write reminders down there as well, so that you know what you expect to do and when you expect to do it.

, Set aside a space that is just for you to work on your homework. When the time comes to do your work, sit down there and do not leave until you have finished your work or until your designated study time has ended.Clear your study space of all distractions. If you work at a desk, for example, make sure that only your computer, your notebook, your school books, and materials relevant to your studies are set up.
Make the space more comfortable by providing yourself with comfortable seating, good lighting, and accoutrements such a blanket that may help you feel more relaxed in your space.

, If you get distracted studying on your computer, use an app to block online and other computer distractions. Set the app for the amount of time you plan to study, and use it to keep yourself focused.Apps like Freedomand LeechBlockallow users to temporarily block certain sites or set whole blocks of time where the internet is inaccessible.
Tools such as FocusWriterand Focus Boosterare designed to help you track your time to accomplish specific tasks.

, Remember to build breaks into your study time. Avoid overloading yourself or becoming distracted while doing your work by allowing yourself short 10 to 15 minute breaks every hour or so.


Taking occasional breaks has been found to improve attention and potentially make your overall studying more effective.Even if you are focused on an assignment, try to include breaks to keep from overworking yourself.

, It is important to have designated spaces and times to study, but if you know you are going to have some lazy beach time or a chance to curl up by the fireplace one afternoon, bring your school books with you. Get comfortable and switch between your school work and personal interests to keep yourself productive but not overwhelmed.Do try to avoid packing schoolwork into times that won’t properly allow you to focus, such as on a tour or during a family get-together. Save the school work for designated study time or your leisure time.
Make sure your environment is compatible for the work you need to do. For example, avoid bringing your computer or scientific calculator to a beach setting, which could damage such equipment.

, Chances are that your holiday included some sort of distraction, so if you have a major assignment due when you get back from your holiday, proofread and check your work to make sure it is accurate. Try to give yourself at least a couple days between completing the assignment and checking the assignment so that you can look at it with fresh eyes.If possible, save any editing for a time when you are not on a trip or dealing with family visits. Find a low-stress point in your holiday where you can go over the work you’ve done thus far.
See if any of your peers would be interested in exchanging assignments and peer editing. Arrange it with a friend before you leave school, and set exchange deadlines for the two of you.

Enjoy yourself!",How to Get a Visa to Study in Belgium," If you are a citizen of a member state of the European Union, you don’t need a visa to study in Belgium. If you are a national from a country outside Belgium and the E.U., you will need to apply for one in order to enroll as a student of higher education there for a period of longer than three months.If you have questions about whether or not you need a visa based on your nationality or the duration of your stay, contact your nearest Belgian consulate. Explain your situation over the phone or in an email, and ask them directly what the visa requirements are.;
, Consulates are official offices that handle a national government’s affairs abroad. They are also the places where you will handle your application for your student visa. Do a Google search to find the one that’s closest to where you live.In the U.S., Belgium has consulates located in major cities across the country, including in New York City, NY; Los Angeles, CA; and Atlanta GA; as well as their Embassy in Washington, D.C. You should apply at the location nearest to where you reside. For example, if you live in New England, you should go through New York.
The exact application process might vary from consulate to consulate, so it’s important to visit the website of or be in direct contact with your nearest one before you apply in order to make sure you’re doing it according to their specific guidance. It’s advisable to check in with your consulate about their visa requirements as far in advance of your planned visit as possible and no later than four months before., It can take a long time not only to process your visa application but also to get all the materials together for it. Plan accordingly. For a long-stay visa, it is recommended that you make an appointment with your consulate at least two months before your planned departure date. That means you should start gathering the materials for it several months in advance of your visit., The Belgian government has four requirements (academic enrollment, sufficient financial means, medical soundness, and a spotless criminal record) that you must meet in order to apply to study there. You must meet all four prerequisites in order to qualify for a visa; your application will be denied and you will lose your fee if you do not. If you don’t currently meet the basic requirements, you should wait to apply until you do., The first requirement is that you be enrolled in a government-recognized institution of higher learning and have paid your initial registration fees. (Note: if your visa isn’t granted, you will be refunded.) You should be a regular student whose pursuit of higher education is your primary reason for being in Belgium.If you are doing a study abroad program, your home university will often handle the logistics of this for you.

, The second requirement is that you have “sufficient means of subsistence.” This means that you have to be able to show that you can financially provide for yourself while you’re there, with enough money to cover the costs of healthcare, tuition, the cost of living, and your travel back to your home country.


The Belgium government calculates the minimum amount you need for each month of your stay on an annual basis, so be sure to check what their current figure is here: https://dofi.ibz.be/sites/dvzoe/EN/Application-guides/Pages/Sufficient_means_of_subsistence_Students.aspx


, The third requirement is that you must not have an infectious disease, like tuberculosis, that is considered dangerous to public health. They will ask for a medical certificate verifying that you are free from the diseases they are currently screening for. You can ask your family doctor to supply this certificate.

, This fourth requirement only applies to those people who are over the age of 21. If you are, you cannot have any criminal convictions on your record., It’s available in Dutch, French, and German. There is also an English version that is available here: https://dofi.ibz.be/sites/dvzoe/EN/Application-guides/Pages/ApplicationforavisaforalongstayinBelgium.aspx


It will ask you for personal information and information about your intended stay in Belgium, including the main reason for your visit.

, The Belgian government only offers you a reply to your visa application in the official languages of their country. As part of your application, you must complete a form that designates which of those languages you would like to receive your response in (German, Dutch, or French).


Fill out the form with your full name as it appears on your passport, pick your language of choice, and then sign and date the bottom. The language form is available here: http://unitedstates.diplomatie.belgium.be/en/visa-belgium/higher-education-students


, You will need to submit a passport with your application that has at least two blank pages to which a visa can be affixed. Your passport also needs to be valid for more than 15 months after the date of your application. If it’s expiring soon, you’ll have to apply to a new one before you can apply for a visa.

, If you are over 21 years of age, you will need to include this as proof that you have no criminal convictions. You can obtain your record through the FBI, which refers to it as an “Identity History Summary Check.” You can apply for your report here: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks.


Leave plenty of time for this step as the processing times are often quite long. The FBI estimates it can take 12-14 weeks to receive your personal criminal history record.
If you’re short on time, you can opt to get your record processed through an “FBI Channeler” instead. These are private organizations who perform the same function. The fees are generally higher, but the turnaround time is generally faster. There’s a list of approved FBI Channelers here: https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/list-of-fbi-approved-channelers-for-departmental-order-submissions

This document must be dated within six months of your application date in order to be valid.

, There is a medical certificate that you will need to include with your application. The form needs to be completed by a doctor who can verify that you do not have any dangerous communicable diseases. Your consulate will provide a list of approved doctors who can perform the necessary examination for you.Some consulates require this form to be authenticated or notarized. Check with yours to see if this requirement applies to you.
This document is only valid if it is dated within three months of your application date.

, You must submit evidence of your financial solvency along with your application. This can come in the form of a sponsorship form (where another person promises the funds to cover your expenses), proof of a scholarship or grant that will cover your expenses, or proof that you have already paid for the expenses of studying abroad.


If you go with the sponsorship option, keep in mind that they will need to sign a financial support declaration, provide notarized copies of an official government-issued identification document (like a driver’s license or passport), and offer evidence (such as tax returns, pay slips and/or bank statements) that can verify they have the means to cover your costs., You will need an official letter verifying your acceptance to and full-time enrollment in a Belgian university. Some consulates may also require one or more copies of your most recent academic transcripts.

, Include a letter with your application that explains your course of desired study during your stay. You should write the supporting letter yourself, briefly outlining what you intend to study, how it will contribute towards your career, and why you want to do it in Belgium in particular.

, You will need to send two to three passport-sized photos with your application. Many local drug stores, photo centers and postal carriers can take passport photos for you and develop them very quickly. Some photobooth also do passport-sized photos, which is generally cheaper and more instantaneous.


You should dress simply for passport photos, and be sure that your hair is out of your face. You are not supposed to smile for them; try to keep your expression neutral.

, It should be big enough to include your application materials. This is a requirement, so that they can send your visa and return your supporting materials to you once they’ve processed your application.


Seek advice about the best way to handle this from the mail carrier of your choice. Some may require you to print the postage yourself so as to avoid responsibility for its contents.

, The necessary documents and number of copies may vary according to your consulate and the date your application, so be sure to double-check their specific requirements before you submit it.


In general, they require: two copies of your completed and signed visa application form, your passport, two passport-sized photos that are signed on the back, the original and two copies of your nationwide criminal history record (if you’re over 21), your medical certificate, your proof of financial solvency, your academic documents and a prepaid self-addressed envelope.Some of the supporting documents may also require duplicates or triplicates; be sure to check with your consulate’s requirements. Be sure that you always include the originals along with any copies. The originals will be returned to you.

, You can do this in person at your nearest consulate or send all the materials to them via the mail. If you choose the first option, you’ll need to call or use their electronic scheduler to make an appointment with your consulate first.If you have the option of applying for your visa in person, take it. It’s often more expensive, both in terms of the fee and the cost of travel, but it usually simplifies the process. You also generally get a decision immediately.
Always check for the latest fee amount, but expect to pay $200 or more for processing your visa application.

, It will take approximately 5-8 weeks to process your visa application. Enquire with your consulate for definite information about their average processing times. If you have not provided all the necessary materials, it may take even longer or they may deny your application altogether.


It’s not usually helpful to contact them for an update on the status of your application. It takes the time it takes, and inquiries tend to delay the process or frustrate you by not getting the information you would like. Only be in touch with your consulate if there is an emergency.

Being abroad has much more to do with culture and experience than simply language skills. Reaffirm your intentions by listing the positives and negatives of being a foreign exchange student., There are many great exchange programs out there. Look at the web page for Council On Standards For International Educational Travel (CSIET) to get a reputable list. Programs are organized based upon a commitment to universally accepted higher standards.A few to consider are:

Determine if your desired host country accepts your education level.,
Apply for a passport and visa as necessary.",How to Become a Foreign Exchange Student2," While some programs make no promises about the exchange destination, it’s still worth selecting the country you’d like to visit. Isolating the country can help prepare you for the various paperwork, financial obligations, educational requirements, and language hurdles.

, The language requirements vary depending on your destination and on the program you're applying to. In some situations you may need to be fluent to survive, while in others just the language basics will be sufficient to get you started. While the expectation is language skills will improve abroad because of complete immersion, there will still need to be some understanding of the host language.


In general, one year or foreign language study in high school, or an intensive summer program, is required for preparation. Practice the language with a pen-pal. Locate a pen-pal from your future host country. In years past, foreign pen pals were much more difficult to find. Now it’s just a matter of registering for any number of pen-pal websites, searching a database, and initiating correspondence., Different countries have different study and live abroad options open to high school and college students.Research if where you’d like to live accepts your age group and/or scholastic level.


Study abroad while in high school may be a bigger transition than in college, with more language and social difficulties., Some countries you may go to will require a passport, and others will require both a passport and visa. It may also depend on your country of origin and its political affiliation with a potential host country. You’ll need to view a government-sponsored website that lists specific requirements when visiting foreign countries.Be aware the some countries require submission of paperwork or travel to their specific consulate in order to receive appropriate passport and visa stamps.Note that some countries have visa requirements based upon the length of time you intend to stay in their country.

In other countries, the following types of tests and measurement requirements are mandatory: The Standards-based Measurement of Proficiency (STAMP) test was originally developed at the University of Oregon and measures skills like reading and speaking in nine different languages.The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is a worldwide recognized test that measures English proficiency, and is widely used at the college and university level., Many programs require information that supplements your language proficiency. Aside from proving you have the appropriate passport and visa, you may also have to provide an additional passport photo, your scholastic transcripts, and a curriculum vitae (CV) among other documents, Most programs have an orientation before you leave. It may be at the business location or at your home. Afterwards, a follow-up orientation is often conducted once you arrive at your host country.

You don't need to make a lot of money to become a host family. However, you will be required to provide adequate food and shelter for the exchange student. Foreign exchange students usually receive an allowance from their parents or the exchange program for lunch money and personal items.
The main family member must be 25-years-old, and most exchange programs want to place exchange students in families with at least 2 members. Single parent households are fine, but it's important for foreign exchange students to interact with other family members as well.
Foreign exchange students do not have to have their own room, but they do require their own bed. If an exchange student shares a room, it must be with a host sibling of the same sex and near the same age.
You need to provide the student with a place to study and a stable environment.

Choose the right study abroad program.,
Once you choose your program, you have to take the required tests and get the scores before application deadline of the program.,
Once you are done with the tests and arranging documents for applying, fill out your application and submit.,
Once you get your admission decision, ask them for the official admission document like i20.,
Begin to immerse yourself in the local culture.,
Prepare for your destination city.",How to Study Abroad1," This is the most important step. You'll have to decide what program is best for you — not what program is best for your twenty closest friends in college. You'll have to pick the program you want to do, and the city where you'll be studying. Here's how to decide:


If you're not majoring in a foreign language or interested in one particular foreign culture, do some research. Look through travel guides and search the Internet to see what city appeals to you. Once you've narrowed your list down to a few places, ask around to see if you know anyone who did the program you were thinking of, and ask how it was.
If you are already majoring or minoring in a foreign language, it's likely that you'll want to study in a country where that language is spoken. You need to check to see how many credits toward your major or minor you will receive from each program.
You can also decide if you want to do a program directly through your school or through another college. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. If you choose a program through your own college, it's likely that your credits will transfer more easily, that you'll be around some people you know and will feel more comfortable, and that you'll have to do a lot less paperwork to get the process approved. If you choose a program outside of your university, you may have more options to choose from and will be more adventurous because you'll be studying with a group of people you've never met, but you'll have to do more work to find and apply to the program.;
, Then you might have to report the scores to the chosen program departments or schools as instructed in how to apply in their website.

, You'll have to ask about the student visa requirements and make sure to have a current passport. Each country is different, so figure this out well in advance.

, Different countries have different documents, with which you can apply for visa, then apply for visa.

, You can start preparing for your study abroad trip months in advance. Not only will this make you more prepared to embark on your foreign journey, but it will also make you more pumped to begin your adventure. Here's what you can do:


Brush up your language skills. If you need to know a foreign language in your country of choice, take a language class and practice speaking it on your own. Watch movies in the language to help your comprehension skills.
Take a class about the culture. If your school offers a course about the history or art of the culture, you should jump at the opportunity.
Try some cuisine from the culture. If you're in the right place, it won't be too hard to try some local fare from thousands miles away. Give it a try to get used to the thought of eating it every day.
Hang out with friends who are also studying in the same country or city. You can start immersing yourselves in the country together.

, Once you know where you'll be living, read everything you can about the city. Read blogs online, get travel books, and read up on the history of the city. This will give you a stronger appreciation of where you're going, and of all the cool stuff you'll have to do once you get there.


Create a bucket list. Make a list of at least twenty things you just have to do in the city before you leave.
Mark all the pages in your travel books that show places that you just have to see.
Talk to other people who have lived in or studied in the city before. Write down their recommendations.
Read up on the weather in your destination city. This will help you know what clothes to pack.

"
"
Immerse yourself in the local culture.,
Hang out with the right people.,
Take the opportunity to travel.,
Don't forget to learn something.,
Beat homesickness.,
Stay safe.",How to Study Abroad2," Above all else, this should be the final goal of your study abroad experience. You have chosen to study in a foreign country because you are excited about its culture and customs, and because you want to broaden your perspective on the world. Therefore, you should seize every opportunity you have to try something new, have a new experience, and to step out of your comfort zone. Here's what you should do:


If you're in a country where a foreign language is spoken, immerse yourself in it. Try to speak the language as much as possible, to read the language, and to even catch TV shows on the local channels.
Enjoy the cuisine of a foreign land. Though you'll crave your old favorite foods and should indulge once in a while, try to eat as much local food as possible.
Understand the local customs. If you're in a country where a siesta is customary, then take one.
Enjoy the local music and dance culture. Go to a show or a concert.
Watch local films. Go to the movies in your new city. You'll have fun even if you don't understand anything.
Go to as many museums, exhibits, and other cultural venues as possible. Learn everything you can about the country and even take notes.
It's okay to take a break once in a while. Order some pizza, watch your old Modern Family DVDs, and fall asleep listening to Katy Perry. You can't be a good cultural student all the time.

, A big part of having the perfect study abroad experience is who you hang out with. The company you keep can make or break your entire trip, so choose your friends carefully. If you have the right friends, you could end up learning a lot more about the culture. Here's what you can do:


Find a few trusted friends in your study abroad group. It's good to maintain relationships with people from your program so you can stay grounded, participate in fun activities, and not feel too lonely.
Focus on finding friends who are natives to your new city. Though you may be shy about meeting new people or getting past a language barrier, people from foreign countries are often friendly and will be excited by your foreign-ness. Plus, these people will know where to eat, where to go out, and where the tourists traps are.

When you hang out with these people, try to stick to their native tongue. They will most likely say they want to practice their English on you; you can indulge them, but ask them to speak their language to you as well.


If you're living in a home stay, then take advantage of your host family. You can learn a lot about the culture from them. If they invite you to join them in events outside the home, don't miss the opportunity.
Your main goal should be to avoid being just another tourist. If you spend all of your time hanging out with the thirty study abroad kids from your school, you won't be broadening your horizons as much.

, If you're studying abroad, then there's a good chance that you're living within just hundreds of miles of many fantastic destinations. A ticket to these countries is much cheaper than it will be from home, so you should make a point of seizing the opportunity to visit a few exotic places you have never been. However, you shouldn't forget that your main goal is to immerse yourself in the country where you've chosen to study, so you should explore that country the most.


Travel within the country where you're studying abroad. This will give you an opportunity to understand the complexities and customs of the different regions of the country. This will also help you appreciate the art or history classes you've taken about your chosen country.
Plan a few trips to visit foreign countries. Ideally, you can visit cities where your friends are studying, so they can act as your tour guide.
Try to bring a travel buddy or two with you wherever you go. Not only will it make traveling more fun, but it will be safer, too.
If you're traveling and can't stay with a friend, it's likely that you will look into hostels, the cheaper alternative to hotels. Hostels can be a fun place to stay and a great way to meet people, but try to book one with a friend, to watch over your belongings, and to do as much research about the hostel as you can in advance.
Many students who study abroad in the fall love going to Munich for Oktoberfest. If you'd like to participate in this raucous celebration, book your tickets many months in advance, maybe even before you leave to study abroad.
Though your study abroad program will give you an amazing opportunity to travel, make sure that you still leave some time for you to spend the weekends in your city of choice, so you get used to the rhythm of life there and have a chance to really appreciate the city where you're staying.
If you do travel out of the country, always let your friends and study abroad teachers and administrators know about it in advance.

, That's right. It's called ""study abroad"" for a reason, which is that you will be spending half of your time either in class, or learning about the local culture through educational trips to museums, palaces, castles, and other historical sites. Don't let yourself forget how absolutely amazing it is that you get to get first-hand knowledge about a culture that fascinates you. Here's what you should do:


Don't blow off class. Take the time to pay attention, take notes, and do well on exams, just as you would do back home.
Take the time to talk to your teachers. They are real representatives of the local culture and they can teach you a lot.
Be alert during your cultural outings. Don't spend your time at the Louvre or the Alhambra snickering in the back of the pack while your teacher tries to tell you something important. You could be missing an opportunity to learn something that will stay with you for life and you will regret it.
Pay attention on the tour bus. If you're lucky enough to go on a tour bus with your study abroad program, don't close your eyes and nurse your hangover. Instead, listen to what the guide is saying, and even write it down.
Take the initiative to educate yourself. If you're taking an incredible art class in Madrid, take a trip to The Prado by yourself. Nothing beats exploring a museum in a foreign country by yourself.
When you're hanging out with locals — and hopefully you are — use them as an opportunity to learn something about the attitude and perspectives of the local culture. Without sounding like an interviewer, ask the locals how they feel about certain issues within their country as well as globally.

, You may have been looking forward to studying abroad since the moment you were accepted to college, so it may be hard for you to imagine that you might not love every second of the experience. However, you should expect that there will come a time when you miss your family, your friends, and the customs and foods of your own country. Being prepared for this in advance will make it easier for you to cope with homesickness. Here are some things you can do to beat homesickness:


If you're feeling homesick, make a list of all the amazing opportunities you're getting just by studying abroad, such as meeting new people and trying delicious foods. This will make you feel more grateful for your experience.
Talk to other students who are studying abroad. It's likely that they have had or are having the same experience, and they may have some coping tips.
If your family can afford it, plan for them to pay you a visit after the second half of your study abroad session. Seeing them will make you feel much closer to home, and will make it easier for you to hang on for the rest of your trip.
Stay in touch with people from home. Email or Facebook your friends from home, and talk to your family over the phone when you can. Just don't make a habit of talking to them too much, or you'll be too busy thinking about what's going on at home to focus on your once-in-a-lifetime experience.
Don't forget to pack a few things that remind you of home. This could be as simple as your favorite stuffed animal, favorite CD, or a collection of your favorite movies. Bring a few pictures of your friends and family, but don't put up too many of them or you will feel even more homesick.
If one of your best friends is also studying abroad, plan to visit her or for her to see your new neck of the woods.
Write in a journal where you can reflect on your homesickness as well as all of your amazing experiences.

, Though you may be studying abroad with a handful or even a few dozen students from your college or a college similar to yours, you should never forget that you are in a foreign country. This may sound obvious, but it means that you should not conduct yourself as you would in your school back home. You are in a new environment, and you may be surrounded by people who you just met or whom you don't know at all, so you should keep your guard up. Here's what you need to do to have a fun and safe study abroad experience:


Take it easy on the alcohol. Though drinking is the favorite past time of many study abroad students, you shouldn't drink as much as you would at your college back home. You should still have fun, but don't drink to the point where you don't know what's going on, because the next thing you know, you could be lost on the street without knowing your address and may run into some real trouble.
Know your address. Keep it programmed in your phone, written a piece of paper in your wallet, and memorized.
Don't spend too much time hooking up with the locals. While studying abroad is all about taking risks and having fun, remember that you're in a foreign country, and try to avoid going home with someone you just met. Though people from another country aren't inherently sketchier than people from your own, your chances of getting into an untoward situation are higher because you'll be operating out of your comfort zone.
Don't do dumb things to impress your peers. Don't let study abroad become a contest of who could do the craziest thing just to impress a bunch of people you barely know. You don't have to be disrespectful to the local country, take three shots of a strange drink, or make out with a local on the dance floor just to look cool.
Follow the rules. You can still be adventurous without being reckless. The police force in a foreign country may not be as lenient about your antics as they would be in your hometown. Just try to behave.

Be attentive in class.,
When something is taught to you, and a doubt or question arises don't hesitate to ask.,
Don't correct the teacher unless it is an important concept or piece of advice.,

Work hard in class and push yourself to achieve the best grades you can.,
Be kind and don't show off.,
Let your personality shine.,
Join in after-school activities or school sports clubs to meet more people and to get to know classmates better.,

Get along well with boys and girls.,
Be interested in your classmates, when you talk to them try to evoke positive emotions this way when they see you they will experience that emotion.

",How to Be a Class Favourite," Try to avoid chatting with your friends that sit nearby, and if possible, move to a seat away from them! Avoid passing notes and give your teacher your full attention. Your eyes should be on them at all times, and it shows them that you are paying attention and willing to learn. Have your notebook out on your desk with a date, name, and notes, and be sure to listen to keywords your teacher mentions to know what to write down.;
, Choose an appropriate time to ask, perhaps when the teacher has finished speaking and is preparing the next activity or after class. If you ask intelligent, focused questions the teacher will realise you're interested and engaged. Your questions and honesty about your knowledge's limits will encourage your classmates to ask questions when they're struggling. You can be pretty sure that someone else was wondering the same thing too!

, Try to phrase your correction subtly- Why do we...?, I know when I did this with the Athletics Club we did it slightly differently; why is that, what's the difference?, What's the difference between (the term they gave) and (the term you believe to be correct)?. Embarrassing the teacher will make them feel insulted or defensive. Correcting them and being wrong is very embarrassing and makes you look like you're very unpleasant and a bit of a know-it-all if you do it often. If they don't agree with you or answer your question with the answer you think is wrong, nod and say thank you. Look it up at home and find evidence that answers the question one way or another.

, The more you talk, the more familiar you will get with people and become their friends. Try to remember their names and greet them by name. Remember their hobbies and interests and any special event that they told you about. Ask them about it the day after. Major brownie points if you can find a way to be a part of their hobby! Even if you're not into the same things you could ask how they got into it, ask for advice or say you'd love to learn more about it or try it out. Make everyone feel special! (EG Hey Diarmuid, how was your football match?, Hi Claire. Have you read any good books lately? I was hoping to get a good one as a present for my sister whose birthday is this week and I hoped you might be able to advise me.)

, People respect dedication and determination and will respect and admire your academic ability. It will also please your teachers and enthuse them to work harder to teach you-and thus your classmates -if they feel that their efforts are going to good use and will pay off. Never show off your good grades or belittle people who do badly and never, ever laugh at people who don't know something. If they're having a really hard time, talk to your teacher or ask them if they want help with anything, but be discreet and don't let other classmates in on what you're doing.

, This will help you to get along well with people. If you ask a favor politely people would be happy to help.

, Everyone has some fantastic personality traits so let people see yours. Occasionally have a joke to show your humour but be careful not to belittle anyone or their beliefs - remember, it's only funny if everyone is laughing. Show how kind and considerate you are by helping a classmate having a hard time or offering to carry textbooks for the teacher. Show you're thoughtful and deep by occasionally talking to other people about their beliefs and compare them to your own, but be respectful and never undermine their or your point of view.

, Be a good team player and work hard at the activity. You might be there to make friends but some people could take the activity seriously or want to succeed. Have a laugh at training but knuckle down and work hard to get your skills and fitness up before a game as well so you're a great asset to the team both on and off the pitch.

, Don't trail them, just say hi or talk to them when you run into them and get into small talk until you become friends with them. Make sure not to join a clique that excludes others. Be nice to everyone but don't be creepy.

, You would have to make your personality interesting so that no one gets bored when they talk to you.

, Helping is the best way even if you hate someone help them and you would notice that their opinions about you would change.

Decide when to transfer.,
Attend orientation.,
Consider your goals.,
Read the handbook.,
Prepare to succeed.",How to Adjust to School as a Transfer Student1," If you're able to determine when you transfer schools, try to begin classes at the start of the school year. This way, everyone is adjusting to the new school year and classes at the same time you are. If you can't start at the beginning of the year, at least try to start when a new term or period begins.


If you have no control over when you start and you have to start during the school year, try to meet with your instructors. This way, you can find out their requirements and whether you need to catch up on what the classes have already covered.;
, If you're a transfer student, it's incredibly important that you visit orientation. Orientation is your chance to meet representatives from the school, instructors, and some fellow students. The goal of orientation is to reduce your anxiety, make you feel welcome, and answer questions you have about making the switch to the school.Schools may have separate orientations for new students and for transfer students. This way, you're getting information specific to your academic situation.

, You're probably transferring some academic credits from your old school. Check your new school's academic requirements so you can fulfill credits without repeating courses. Decide what areas of study you'd like to focus on and try to enroll in classes that you'd really enjoy.You may want to make a timeline of goals, especially if you'd like to graduate within a specific time frame. This can be helpful when scheduling classes that have prerequisites.

, Your school will give you a handbook when you sign up for classes. Take the time to read it so you understand the schools policies on anything from attendance, tardiness, grading scales, to graduation requirements. If you're unsure about anything in the handbook or still have questions, talk to a guidance counselor or school administrator.


The handbook will also list important dates for the school year (like holidays, exams, and teacher meetings).

, Once you know what classes you'll be taking, you should find out materials you'll need before starting class. Ask the instructor what supplies you'll need for the class. For example, you may need a textbook, supplemental readings, art supplies, or math supplies.


If you won't be able to see the instructor before starting the class, try to email the instructor in advance. This way, they can tell you what supplies you'll need immediately.

Be well prepared.,
Avoid the trap of procrastination by tackling it head on.,
Be careful not to fall into the trap of ""illusions of competence"".,
Avoid the trap of highlighting too much.,
Don't fall into the trap of re-reading the text over and over again.,
Don't be shy about making mistakes.,
Don't try to remember everything at ––to do so is a trap.,
Avoid repetition.,
Be careful not to over learn the material, it's another trap in studying.,
Avoid sticking with the same problems, which gives the illusion you're prepared.,
Make the most of metaphors, stories, tricks and analogies when learning.,
Visualize your learning.,
Do not reduce your sleep, a typical study trap that must be avoided.",How to Avoid Study Traps," All good study begins with being set up in a suitable place where you can study without being distracted. This helps the retention of information with greater ease and gives you a ""mind's eye"" view of where you were when you learned the information, making it easier to recall the information. It really helps to avoid moving around study locations while studying, unless each of those locations is distinct to a subject and remains the same to that subject. (For example, math study only on the library room, English study only at your home desk, etc.);
, It happens to everyone, and it will happen to you. Procrastination occurs when you start to do a task that you may not necessarily love. Your brain will signal its unhappiness, and an unhappy feeling will wash over you. Thus, your brain will funnel its attention to another task that brings it pleasure; for example, checking social media. This action will make you feel better, but only temporarily.


One key method to beat procrastination is to use the Pomodoro technique. This technique involves setting a timer for 25 minutes, and then focusing on only that task for the entire period. Once the 25 minutes are up, you may then reward yourself whether it be with a piece of chocolate, or by listening to some music.
To overcome procrastination, focus on the process of getting your work done, not the product of getting your work done. The process will help form good learning habits. The product is what triggers the pain in procrastination in the insular cortex. The product is the result of the process.

, An illusion of competence is when you believe that you have learned something, when in reality you haven't. It is like tricking your brain into thinking you've mastered a topic. You must try to avoid this at all costs.

, You may think that highlighting allows you to identify key ideas, but in reality, highlighting too much is like tricking your brain, as it believes that whatever is highlighted you already know. Therefore, you must try to keep highlighting to a minimum. It is okay to highlight, as long as you keep it to one sentence per paragraph.


Margin noting on the other hand, is a great method, because it is not an illusion of competence, but it still allows you to identify key ideas and facts and it forces you to put the ideas into your own words, making it much clearer whether or not you've understood and learned it.

, This technique, just like the last one, hardly helps when it comes to remembering information. If you do not take a minute to really understand the text, you will not remember anything. Thus, re-reading is a waste of time. Instead, give the method Recall a try, as this method helps you to remember information easily.


To preform this task, read a chapter, or lesson and once you are done, try to recall as much information about the chapter as you can. Most importantly, recalling is not an illusion of competence, and it shows that you are actually getting something out of the text.

, It is through making mistakes that you truly learn, as you scramble to amend the errors you wish you'd not made. Give mini-testing a try. Both this method and recall together will help you learn more efficiently in a shorter period of time. This method is similar to the previous method but instead of recalling, you ask yourself questions based on the text you just read. If you can answer correctly, then this method proves that you understood the text. Making mistakes is a great way to learn, teaching you how to do a problem correctly the next time.

, Instead, try chunking. Chunking is a mental leap that helps unite bits of information, through meaning. Chunking can be helpful, because it makes remembering information a million times easier.


In your brain, you have an area called the working memory. This area is almost like short term memory, because this information is not yet ingrained into your long term memory. Your working memory only has four slots, and can only hold four pieces of information at a time.However, if you chunk information, you can fit more information into those four slots. That chunked information will only take up one slot, rather than all four. To help form ""chunks"" you should try to learn bit by bit.
When forming chunks, beware of using a worked example, because sometimes they can be bad. Rather than focusing on the connection between the steps, and why the next step is the next step, learners will tend to focus on why the next step works. When using a worked example, be sure to look for the connection between the steps.
The three main steps to forming a chunk are:

Focus your undivided attention on the material you want to chunk- that means no TV. You are taking new information and connecting to material you already know.
Understand the material you are trying to chunk- Understanding will hold underlying memory traces together. Though, you need to review material, even if you understand it.


Practice the material you want to chunk. Practice will help you to gain the big picture context. One tip is to look at the pictures if a lesson before hand. This tip will help you grasp chunks, and understand how they relate to the big picture context.

, Instead, give deliberate practice a try. Rather than than repeatedly practising the material that you find easy, it is important to focus on the material that you find difficult. For example. imagine you have a test on basic arithmetic. If you find addition and subtraction easy, then make sure you practice division and multiplication.

, Over learning may not even seem like a real thing, because you can never really learn enough. Over learning is when you continuously review material that you already mastered. Over learning is really just a waste of time, because once you have already mastered a skill, going over it will not make the information any more memorable. In fact, over learning is actually an illusion of competence, because it gives the illusion that you memorized everything, when in reality, you only memorized the easy material.

, Instead, interleave your learning. When you interleave the material. you are jumping between different problems, that involve different techniques. For example, when you are preparing for a math test, rather than just doing chapter after chapter of problems, that are grouped under using the same technique, it is beneficial to do a problem or two from one chapter, then skip around to another chapter, and then do some problems from there. This method helps you understand when to use a certain technique, rather than just how to apply the technique. Interleaving helps build creativity and flexibility when it comes to understanding the subject.


This method also helps broaden your understanding. When you are studying for a math test in particular, it would be helpful to do the mixed review at the end of the chapter.

, Metaphors, stories, as well as analogies all make remembering information a million times easier. Use metaphors, stories, tricks, and analogies that relate to what you are trying to remember.


Remembering a funny story is much easier than memorizing some boring old formula or list of information. For example: To remember the great lakes, try to remember HOMES, and BAM, you have all five great lakes. HOMES is an example of using meaningful groups. Meaningful groups are when you take bits of information and combine them to form one easy to remember group.

H- Lake Huron
O- Lake Ontario
M- Lake Michigan
E- Lake Erie
S- Lake Superior


An example with a metaphor, is to relate the focused mode of thinking to a pinball machine. The bumpers of a pin ball machine are close together, and so in the focused mode of thinking, there is not much room for your thoughts to run free.

, Our brain has superior spacial and visualization skills. Indeed, we should take advantage of it. Use your spacial skills to your advantage. Because we are naturally good at remembering how a location looks, as opposed to information, try plopping an item into that certain location you know well. This item should be related to the information that your are trying to remember. Now, when you recall that location, your will remember the item/items as well.


For instance, we all know our living rooms pretty well. Pretend you are trying to remember the items on a shopping list- eggs, milk, and bread. Now, plop those items straight into your living room. This will make remembering the items much easier. Put the bread on the couch, the milk spilling on the coffee table, and an egg about to roll off the TV stand, or however you prefer to arrange the items. This method is called the Memory Palace technique.


, We all love sleeping, but sometimes we tend to think of sleep as a waste of time. Instead of sleeping, you could easily be studying or the like. However, it is essential that you get your recommended amount of sleep. (8 to 12 hours). Throughout the day, metabolic toxins form in your brain. These toxins are terrible, and can interfere with your brain when you are trying to concentrate. Metabolic toxins make it impossible to 100% focus on a task. Anything you study while tired will not stick very well in your brain. Although, it may slide for a test, it will only be a matter of time before your brain loses it from the short term memory, meaning that you've learned nothing. Going to sleep, allows your body to wash away these toxins, and that is why it is easiest to focus in the morning.


One especially helpful tip is to try to dream about what you are studying. This method will help you remember, as well as deepen your understanding about the material. To dream about the topic, you should specifically think about it before you go to sleep, even tell yourself that you will dream about that certain topic.
If you didn't get enough time to study for a test that you have the next day, and it is getting really late, it is best to go to sleep, and hope for the best! If anything, try to wake up early, and review the material in the morning. It is most likely to stick in your mind then.

Begin taking Spanish.,
Decide the best timing for you to go to Spain.,
Speak to your parents about the exchange.,
Speak to your Spanish teacher to see if there are programs that the school has used in the past.,
Research other programs, if your Spanish teacher is unable to help.,
Sign up for an exchange program.,
Raise money by holding fundraisers or getting a job.,
Maintain good grades.,
Apply for a passport.,
Apply for a visa, if necessary.,
Sign up for Skype or Google Hangout so that you can connect to your parents, other family and friends while you are abroad.,
Be prepared for the positive and negative experiences that happen when you go to a foreign country without friends or family.",How to Become an Exchange Student in Spain," During your studies, you will learn about the many different locales that speak Spanish. Be sure that you would prefer to do an exchange in Spain rather than Central or South America.;
, Most exchanges take a year or more to plan, and you should be conversational in Spanish before you go. For many teenagers, this also means leaving their friends and family to go on a solitary adventure, which can be emotionally trying.


If you are not sure that you are emotionally ready for an exchange when you are in high school, many colleges and universities offer study abroad programs at universities in Spain. You can choose to wait 2 to 4 years and do it when you feel ready for the adventure.

, Most exchanges happen between the ages of 15 and 18, so you will most likely need your parents to sign approval forms, help you apply for your passport, and, possibly, pay for the program. Discuss when, where and why you want to do an exchange so that they understand its importance to you.

, If not, the teacher may have connections to other programs or schools in Spain that would be willing to host an exchange.

, There are many organizations that help to facilitate exchanges for students across the world. For example, TwoWorldsUnited.com, ayusa.org and asse.com all facilitate exchanges.


Some of the organizations that do exchanges are for-profit and some are non-profit. If they are for-profit, then along with the costs of the services you'll require in Spain, they will charge for their services. Look up reviews to find out what other students thought of their experience with the company or organization before you sign up.

, Try to sign up 6 months to a year in advance, if possible. This will allow you to pay for the program, raise money and gain conversational fluency.

, Spain's economy is run on the Euro, which is currently valued over the American dollar and just under the British pound, so it is likely to be more expensive to live there than at home.

, Many exchange programs require you to have a 2.5 or higher grade point average (GPA). You may be required to pass oral or written exams in Spanish.

, You will need one in order to live in another country, unless you are under the European Union Economic Agreement. You will be required to have a passport in order to apply for a travel visa.

, This depends upon your country of origin, and the exchange program should be able to tell you if it's necessary. Many countries outside of the European Union only need a visa if they are staying more than 90 days.

, These forms of video chatting allow you to use a web cam, microphone and computer to see people as you talk to them, making it easier to feel connected while you are away.

, Some students journal, email or write blogs to channel their feelings. For many students they have a few tough weeks, become accustomed to the culture and then they do not want to leave at the end of their stay.

Put out a public request for a study buddy.,
Ask a teacher.,
Chat them up during a time when they don’t look busy.,
See if they’d like to hang out after you’ve gotten to know them a bit.,
Ask them if they’d like to study for exams together.,
Find out more about their study habits.,
Ask more serious questions about their motivations and schedule.,
Ask them if they’d be interested in being your regular study buddy.,
Discuss what you both need from each other and what you can give.,
Be prepared for their answer.",How to Ask Someone to Be Your Study Buddy," Ask yourself what kind of study buddy might be good for you, what kind of person you would like to study with, and where you would like to study.


Make note of your strengths and weaknesses. Know what kind of help you can contribute and what kind of help you want to receive. A good study buddy will give help, as well as seek it.;
, If there’s a particular classmate of yours that asks interesting questions, makes comments that intrigue you, or you already know you work well with, consider approaching them. Chances are, they have the same interests as you.


Also observe those who are in the same school clubs as you are or are interested in the same extra-curricular activities.
While you and your study buddy don’t necessarily have to have the same level of intelligence, you should share a similar level of commitment and get along well.Remember, your energies will influence each other’s work habits., If there’s a particular place you like to study (cafe, library, etc.), keep an eye out for others who often study there as well. There’s a good chance that they have a schedule similar to yours, and they are likely to feel comfortable studying in the same environment., You may have people in your immediate social network who are also looking for a study buddy but haven’t spoken up. They may even be people that you already know well and feel comfortable around. Use all available resources:


Post a call for a study buddy on a bulletin board in a public building (classroom buildings, libraries, community centers, etc.).Post a request for a study buddy on social media.
Send a request for a study buddy to a class or departmental email list. This is a good way--especially for an introvert--to gauge people’s interest in obtaining a study buddy.It’s also an efficient way to find someone with similar academic interests.

, An attentive teacher will have a good feel for other students’ strengths and weaknesses. They will know which other students share your interests and have the same level of motivation. Ask them for a recommendation.

, A simple way to begin conversation is by mentioning something that interested you during class. Introduce yourself and tell them what you’re studying or would like to study. Then you can ask them the same.You don’t have to ask them to be your study buddy right away. Take some time to get to know them first. That way, you’ll know if your personalities are a match.
Take interest in what they have to say, make eye contact, and pay attention. This will show them that you are interested in what they have to say. You’ll learn whether or not their personality and interests will complement yours.

, A good idea is to ask them to join you for lunch or a recreational activity you already had planned. This is a great opportunity to experience their personality, to ask them more questions, and learn about their interests and motivations., This is a good no-pressure way to test whether they’d be a good study buddy for you, before permanently committing to it. It’s also a good way to test whether or not they are properly motivated or prone to distraction.

, Once you’ve hung out a couple of times, and you think you get along, you can begin asking questions to help you figure out whether they have the skills you’re looking for in a study buddy. Try some of the following questions:


”Do you think you work best alone or with others?""
""Do you struggle with any subjects? Are you really good at any subjects?”

, At this point, you will be able to more comfortably share information and ask direct questions. You want to get a good feel for if they’re a practical fit for you. Try asking them some of these questions:


”Are there places where you work better than others? Are there any places you absolutely wouldn’t study?”
”Are you easily distracted while studying?”
”Do you like to take a lot of breaks?”
”Do you have any major time commitments that get in the way of studying?”

, The best way to ask someone for something is to be clear and direct about what you want. That way, they will know you’re sincere. They’re likely to be flattered as well. People usually feel complimented and excited--not burdened--when they’re asked for assistance.An example could be: “I’ve enjoyed spending time with you lately, and it seems like we really get along and have a lot in common. I’ve been looking for a study buddy recently. Would you be interested in being my study buddy?”

, Tell them about your expectations: what kind of help you may need from them, what kind of environments you like to study in, and your level of motivation. But also tell them what you can bring to the table!

, Don’t be offended if they turn you down. Not everyone will be a great study buddy for someone else, regardless of strengths. If they say no, simply thank them for considering it and move to your next possibility. If nothing else, you’ve made a new friend!

Create a support network.,
Be active.,
Live on campus.,
Meet with your guidance counselor.",How to Adjust to School as a Transfer Student2," Your support network can be made of anyone you can go and talk to when you feel stressed. This can include old friends, family, new classmates, and even guidance counselors. Knowing that you have people to turn to can reduce the stress of transferring schools.It may be harder to maintain existing relationships once you change schools, especially if the new school is far away. Let friends and family know that you'll be going through an adjustment period with all the new changes in your life.

, Take full advantage of your new school's resources and opportunities. Find out if there are clubs, organizations, or athletics that you'd like to become involved in. This is a good way to make friends and feel like you're a part of the school community.You'll need to introduce yourself in classes or clubs. Keep it brief, but include something interesting about yourself. You might mention where you transferred from and what you're currently studying.

, If you have the option of living on campus, this is a great way to quickly meet people. Many schools that offer student housing have housing options specifically for transfer students. For example, you might be assigned to live with another transfer student in a dorm.Even if you don't have the same classes or interests as your roommate, you'll feel more involved in the school and you'll still share common concerns as transfer students.

, Most schools will assign a mentor, guidance counselor or academic advisor to you when you begin classes. This person may or may not be one of your teachers. Take advantage of meeting with your counselor frequently. Talk if you're struggling to fit in, need advice, or just want to talk about your life or career goals.Your counselor is your ally. They'll be able to help you plan classes, tell you about activities offered through the school, and write letters of recommendation for you.

Have a positive outlook.,
Avoid making comparisons.,
Give yourself time.,
Get help.",How to Adjust to School as a Transfer Student3," Although you may not be excited about transferring, try to have a positive attitude about the change. Focus on the positive aspects of changing schools. Over time, you'll stop thinking about it so much and will just enjoy being at the new school.As soon as you find yourself thinking something negative, change it to a positive statement. For example, instead of saying, ""This is never going to work,"" say, ""I think I need to approach this differently.""

, If you're unhappy about having to transfer schools, it can be easy to only see the negatives of your new school. Try not to compare your new school to your old school. Remind yourself that you're in a new place and need a new start with new opportunities. Comparing the schools will only hold you back.Realize that your school experience will be unique to you. One school or set of experiences isn't better than any other.

, Just as it took you time to adjust to your old school, you'll also need to give yourself time to adjust to the new school. To help with some of the little things, try to walk through the school or campus before classes start. This way, you can figure out where your classes are ahead of time.


It can also be useful to know how meal plans work, where you can park (if you drive to school), and where the main offices are (for guidance, financial, and academic advising).

, If you're still struggling to find your place in a new school or you feel lonely or isolated, there are resources for you. Visit your school's guidance counselor or transfer support center. Trained professionals can talk with you about your concerns and help you adapt to life in a new school.


Your school can also put you in touch with other transfer students or peer mentors who are going through similar situations as you.

Place your information or objects in an easily visible location.,
Create an open and accessible space to place your information or objects for alphabetizing.,
Decide if you wish to place your objects or data in alphabetical order by name, title or another system.

,
Place the item that begins with the letter “A” at the beginning and work in order through the alphabet towards “Z”.

,
Compare the first letter in the first word.,
Compare the next letter in the words if the first letter is the same.,
Organize the names of individuals by last name followed by first name and then middle initial or name.,
Treat hyphenated names and titles as one word.,
Spell out numbers in titles to alphabetize them.,
Make a record of the system you used to alphabetize.",How to Alphabetize," Seeing all of the data that you need to alphabetize will help make the process go quickly and smoothly.


If you’re organizing data on a computer, it may help to create a new file or folder for alphabetizing to avoid confusion.
If you’re alphabetizing objects, such as records or books, remove them from their current placement so that you can more easily see the names;
, Avoid clutter and confusion by creating a clear area where your data or objects will go as you alphabetize them.

,,,


Place the two items next to each other to determine which comes first in the alphabet.
Choose the one that is closer to the beginning of the alphabet (“A”) first, followed by the one that comes later in the alphabet.

,


For example, if the first two letters in one word are “Am” and the first to letters in the other word are “An”, then place “Am” before “An”.
Continue comparing the next letter in the word if the words continue to have the same letters until you reach a difference in the letters, then place the word that has a letter that appears first in the alphabet before the other word.
If you get to a point where there are no more letters to compare in one word to the other, the word with the shorter string of letters goes first in the alphabetical order.
If the first words in two items are the same, look to the spelling of the next word to determine which one goes first.

,


If you’re alphabetizing books or documents, it’s easier to organize and search using the author’s last name.
For example, “John W. Adams” would be listed as “Adams, John W.” and would go before “Adams, John B.”, which would go before “Adams, Lenny A.”

,, For example, “12 Angry Men” should be ordered as though it were written as “Twelve Angry Men”.

, If you’re organizing a large amount of data or objects, a record will help other people follow and maintain your system, and remind you if you forget.

Give yourself context that you find interesting.",How to Learn Faster," A lot of the time, there's nothing wrong with you or how you study or learn: your brain just can't hold the information because your body isn't getting something that it needs. Often, that need is more sleep. You'll want to be sure to get plenty of sleep if you want your brain to be alert enough to absorb information. Just drinking an extra cup of coffee isn't going to work. This means you'll want to stop doing those late night study sessions. Instead, go to bed early, get a few hours of sleep, and then get up early so that you can study more on a well-rested brain.


Studies have actually revealed that while we sleep, the brain is flushed with a fluid that cleans it of toxins.When we don't get enough sleep, our brains are so overloaded with junk that it becomes difficult for the brain to function correctly.
How much is enough sleep really depends on you and how your body works. Seven to eight hours is what is recommended for most adults, but some people need less and some people need more. You should be able to feel awake and alert through most of the day, without the aid of coffee. If you're tired before four or five in the afternoon, then you're probably not getting enough sleep (or you might be getting too much).;
, When you're hungry, your brain will have a really hard time absorbing any information. It's hard to focus when all your body can tell you is that your stomach is empty. Make sure that you get enough food for all of the major meals. You might even want to choose something healthy to snack on while you study as well as during any classes or tests you might have to take.


It's also a good idea to make sure that you're eating healthy foods. Junk food doesn't give your body the nutrients it needs to perform at its best. Snack on some almonds or a couple of carrots in order to feel alert and focused, instead of bloated and tired.

, Your body is at its best when it's well hydrated. When you don't get enough water, you won't be able to focus. You can easily become distracted, whether you realize it or not, by your thirst. It can even lead to things like a headache, making it even harder for you to learn.


Different bodies need different amounts of water to stay hydrated. The ""eight glasses a day"" that you hear recommended is just a rough estimate. The best way to tell if you're getting enough water is to look at the color of your urine. If it's pale or clear, you're drinking enough. Any darker color means you could use more water.

, Of course you know that exercise is good for your body in lots of ways, but did you know that it can also help you learn faster? Some studies have found that light exercise while studying can help you to learn faster. For people who are very physical and active, being forced to stay still for too long can also make it hard to stay focused, so exercising while studying can also be helpful in that way.


For example, try walking around a large room while you read your textbook. Record your class lectures and listen to the recordings while you use an elliptical machine at the gym. There are lots of options. Just remember to keep the exercise light and do it while you study.

, Learning quickly is a habit and you might need to work to retrain your brain for good habits instead of bad ones. Improve your focus by doing complex tasks without breaks (even if they're unrelated). Set aside a time and place that's just for learning and keep that place sacred. Perhaps most importantly, find a way to make learning fun for you. This will make your brain want to do more and you won't struggle to learn quite so much.


For example, pursue learning about the subjects that you do enjoy. Eventually, your brain will master the learning skills and you can apply those skills to subject areas that you don't enjoy too.

, Look at the changes you want to make to Measurably Improve Your Quality of Life. Which goals require you to learn more before you can confidently make the change you want? Look for a goal you could start on now, without too much time required. In this case, the goal we have chosen is to take better care of our body. Then we are going to break it down. What elements go along with taking better care of our body?

Study as early as possible.
Get plenty of sleep
Eat healthy food
Drink plenty of water
Get exercise

,


Brainstorm criteria for which options you are attracted to and which you are not. Are you interested in researching on the internet? Do you want to talk with a nutritionist or a fitness instructor? If you have difficulty when paying attention while reading, would magazine articles be an effective option for learning?

Trust your intuition. If heading down a certain path doesn't feel right, don't go that way! If you begin reading on ways to improve your sleep habits, and the information is not something you would be willing to use in your own life, then stop reading, and find a different resource. Do not continue simply because it is information coming from an “expert” or because “everyone is doing it”. The information has to be useful to you.

Refine your goal with research. As you begin to look into ways to take better care of your body you may discover there is one element that you really want to focus on. This narrows your goal from “I want to take better care of my body” to “I want to take better care of my body by eating a healthier diet.”

Find someone who has done what you want to do and have them show you. If you know someone who has changed elements of their lifestyle, such as exercising more or implementing a healthier way of eating, talk to them. Find out what they did, how they did it and where they found their information.

Do research on the internet, take a class, interview others, and find a mentor. Try out different varieties of learning to see which one works best for you.

,


Pick something that is possible to do in your environment, that you can work on constructively within your timeframe, and that you can do successfully with the energy and attention you have. Do not decide to take a nutrition class if you are already pressed for time and won’t have time to attend. Instead, take a smaller piece, such as following a nutritional plan. Whatever it is, it needs to be something you can effectively add to your life.

Consider time constraints, geographic constraints, and your mental state. Do not bring more stress to your life by taking on more than what works for your life circumstances. Learning should add to the quality of your life, not take away from it.

Schedule a time of day for learning and practicing what you learn. Having a set time for learning can help motivate you to continue the process.

Develop the habit of paying attention to what you want to learn or improve upon. ""Emotions drive attention. Attention drives learning."" Pay attention to your emotional reactions. If you are researching exercise options and find yourself resisting, explore why. What is it about exercising that is causing the reaction? There is a reason for resisting the learning experience.

Don't become overwhelmed with all the choices. Sometimes we become distracted and overwhelmed by wanting to choose the “right” option. There is no “right” or “wrong”; it is about what works for you. Just pick one and try it! If it doesn’t work, then pick another one.

, To effectively conduct an experiment you need to have a plan, a way to evaluate if the experiment is working and a time to reflect on the process and outcome. The learning process works the same way.


Setting a specific criteria allows you to see if you have met it or not. When deciding on a nutritional plan do I want it to include 3 meals a day or do I need it to cover several smaller meals throughout the day?

Be sure to have a method for keeping track of progress. Use whatever tools you have! Notebooks, phone, apps, computer, internet, calendar, blogs, etc.

Keep reflecting on your progress. Do I still need more information or do I have what I need to begin a new sleep routine?

Set milestones and stick to them. I want to find 3 new healthy dinner recipes to incorporate into my nutrition plan.

,


Did you reach them? Did you learn enough to implement a new exercise plan? Have you found an effective way to improve your sleep habits?

A reminder in your calendar will prompt you to reflect. Set a “check-in” date to evaluate the information you have learned; see if it is effective; is there is more you have realized that you need to know. What worked and what didn't? Why?

, If the learning approach you chose worked, then keep going with it. If not, go back and pick a different one and start experimenting!, The best way to learn faster is to make sure that you're really paying attention when things are explained to you the first time. Even the smallest break in your focus can cause the information not to settle properly in your brain. Unfortunately, there are few tricks for this: you'll mostly need to learn how to maintain willpower.


Try listening with the idea that you will have to answer a question immediately about the material, such as your teacher calling on you, or so that you can repeat the information back to yourself. In fact, if you're on your own, repeating the information back to yourself (paraphrased and in your own words) can help to anchor the information in your brain.

, Taking notes is another great way to maintain your focus as you learn the material the first time. Taking notes not only forces you to think about the material you're learning, it also give you a framework to study from later.


Taking notes doesn't mean writing down everything that is said. All you have to do is write down the broad outline, with specific information when you know it's important. Write down major facts and any explanations that you either have a hard time understanding or you know you won't remember because they are very complicated.

, Stay active in your learning experience. This will not only help you stay focused, it will also help your brain absorb the information better because it becomes a multi-sensory experience, rather than you just listening to someone talk. There are lots of ways to participate in your learning experience, from getting active in group work to asking questions during the lecture.


Try to answer questions when the teacher asks. Don’t worry about being wrong: this is a learning experience and being wrong sometimes is a part of the process.
When you’re split up into groups in order to do activities, reading, or discussion, really embrace the experience and participate. Don’t just sit quietly and do as little as possible. Engage your fellow students and ask them questions, give your opinions, and enjoy the experience.
Ask questions when you don't understand or want to know more. Asking questions is another great way to stay focused as you learn material, plus it will also help make sure that you really understand what you're learning. When you don't understand what your teacher said or when you think something is interesting and want to know more, don't be afraid to ask.

, If your lab partner is a huge nuisance or your place to study at home is in front of the TV, then it's probably no surprise that you're having trouble learning quickly. You'll need a quiet environment that's dedicated to studying if you want to give your brain the best chance at learning the information. Having a quiet, distraction-free environment means that you won't get distracted. Having a place set aside for studying and learning can also help, because it triggers your brain into working in a particular way.


If your classroom environment is a problem, ask your teacher for help. You might be able to move seats or work with someone else. If your home environment is the problem, find unique places to study. You can go to a library if there's one close enough. You can also do things like study in your bathroom or really early in the morning, if you have noisy roommates.

, Learning styles are the different ways in which our brains best absorb information. There are many different learning styles and while we all can learn using every learning style, there are usually one or two that work best for an individual. You can take online tests to help gauge what your learning style might be, but if you have a teacher available to help you, they should be able to help you figure it out. You can even talk to them about adding more of that learning style to how they teach.


For example, if you find that you learn best when you can look at charts and graphs, you might be a visual learner. Try studying by drawing up your own infographics, to help you remember the information more.
Do you find that you remember how things sound or that you can clearly remember what you were reading as you listened to a particular song? If so, you might be an auditory learner. Try recording your class lectures to listen to before and after you study, or even while you study if the information is very clearly the same.
Do you sit in the classroom feeling like you might burst because you need to go for a run? Do you absent-mindedly tap your foot while you listen to lectures? You might be a physical learner. Try fiddling with a small object during class or go for a walk while you study, to help you learn faster.

, Different kinds of subjects are learned better in different ways. You might not be studying for the subject you want to learn in the most helpful way. Adjust how you study so that you’re learning the right skills in a way that works with your brain.


For example, our brains are designed to learn language through interactions, listening, and usage. You’ll learn English much faster if you immerse yourself and spend time speaking it, rather than just looking at flash cards. If you need more help learning English faster, see our article on the topic here.

Another example is with learning math. Instead of just solving the same problems and looking at the same examples over and over again, look and solve lots of different problems that use the same skills.Doing problems with related but different skills can also help solidify your understanding of what you’re trying to learn.

, If you really find that you can’t focus while learning or that your brain doesn’t seem to absorb any of the information, even with help and different techniques, then you might want to consider getting evaluated for a learning disability. There are lots of learning disabilities and most are fairly common (it is estimated that as much as 1 out of every 5 people in the US have one). They don’t mean that you’re stupid or that there’s something wrong with you, it just means that you learn in a slightly different way. Common learning disabilities include:


Dyslexia, which causes problems with reading. If you find that your eyes can’t track properly as they move across a page, you might have dyslexia.
Dyslexia-related disorders like dysgraphia and dyscalculia which cause similar problems with writing and math. If you find it difficult to write about something but you can easily talk about it, you might have dysgraphia. If you have trouble recognizing numbers or doing things like estimating costs, you might have dyscalculia.
Central Auditory Process Disorder is another common learning disability which makes it difficult for sufferers to process sounds. It's similar to deafness, but without any hearing loss, and can lead to problems following conversations and focusing when background sounds are present.

, Of course, the more you study, the more you'll learn, so studying frequently is a good idea. But the sooner you start studying, the easier it will also be for you to remember everything. This means that you shouldn't start studying two or three days before an exam. Start work at least a week before an exam; and consider just studying continuously throughout the quarter if you feel like you need to.


It's a good idea to go back over old information at the same time that you go over the information from this week too. This will help keep those older ideas and skills fresh in your mind so that you can build on them.

, There's nothing wrong with getting some help and getting expert advice that's tailored to your situation. It can seriously help you learn much faster. Put aside your shyness and your pride and ask your teacher for help. If they don't have time to help you, they should be able to help you at least find a tutor.


If you don't have money for a tutor, your teacher might be able to set you up with someone in your class who is doing well and can help you out.
Many schools also have free tutoring centers. Check those out if they're available.

, A mind map is a great way to burn whatever information you're trying to learn straight into your brain. A mind map is a visual representation of what you're trying to learn. Use note-cards, pictures, and sheets of paper to write out facts, explanations, and organized concepts. Now, pin the items on a wall or lay them out on a floor, placing similar items together and using string or other items to indicate linked ideas and subjects. Study from this map instead of just looking at your notes.


When you go to take a test or write a paper, you'll be able to think back to your mind map and remember the information based on where it was and what it was connected to, just like how you can remember where things are on a geographical map.

, Memorizing isn't always the most foolproof technique, but it can help if you need to learn certain kinds of information very quickly. Memorization works best for lists of things, like what order actions should be done in or vocabulary words. Systematic memorization of more complex material is unlikely to be successful.


Try using mnemonics in order to learn information more quickly. Mnemonics are phrases or words with act like a key to larger amounts of information. For example, the mnemonic phrase ""My very eccentric mother's jazz singing usually nauseates.""
Focus on small sections at a time. When you're learning and studying, it's a good idea to get as comfortable with small sets of information before moving on to new ones. You may feel like this goes slower but it's actually faster because you won't need to go back over the information as much. This is especially important when you're trying to memorize vocabulary, lists, and other similar types of information. Work on sets of words no more than 5-8 at a time before moving on to the next one.

, When you have context for information, it becomes much easier for you to process. When that context is really interesting to you, it also makes the information easier to remember. Do your own research and look for experiences which can help you to contextualize the things you're trying to learn.


Let's say you're trying to learn English. Try watching a movie that you're interested in that covers a similar subject to the particular area of vocabulary that you're trying to learn at the moment. So, for example, if you're learning travel words, try watching Lost in Translation.
Another example would be if you're trying to study for a history class. Find a documentary on the subject you're learning about or even one which just shows the country you're studying. Even just having visuals to go along with the stories will help you remember the information because it becomes easier to imagine.

Ask questions.,
Be critical.,
Think before you speak.,
Focus on what you know.,
Cite your sources.,
Carry reading material that will make you look smart.",How to Appear More Intelligent in Class1," Asking questions in class will make you seem engaged, and thus smart. However, your questions should be on topic, and not on something the teacher has already answered. This requires that you remain focused in class so that you do not ask repetitive or off-topic questions.Find a good balance between asking too many questions and asking too few questions. Asking only one question during class is on the skimpy side. However, asking eight to ten questions might be too much, especially if it is on one specific topic. A good healthy balance would be four to five questions on different, distinct topics.
Ask questions that will clarify your understanding of a topic. For example, a teacher might say, “When a liquid is heated to a certain point it will turn blue.” You can then ask, “Why would the liquid turn blue instead of yellow or orange?” You are clearly trying to increase your knowledge by asking these types of questions.;
, We all have the experience of having a view that is different from the view of another, say a classmate or a teacher. When you have a view that is contrary to the teacher’s or another student’s, bring this to the attention of the teacher or the student.Disagreeing and being critical is great for having meaningful discussions with your classmates and your teacher. In turn, this can help you appear more intelligent in class.


Bring up your point of view by saying, “Well, in my experience, I think sports is a fundamental part of American culture. Research shows that 1 in 3 Americans have participated in some kind of sport in their life.”

, You will not look smart if you blurt out answers or comments in class. Instead, take time to think about the question or the comment you will say or ask. Often times, this means being the last person to speak. However, taking the time to think about and refine your comment or question can make a significant difference in how you are perceived in class.


When an idea pops into your head, take a minute or two to ask yourself the question to see if you can answer it on your own. If you simply cannot come up with an explanation, then proceed to ask the question. For example, ""What does social performance mean? I know what performing means for actors, but what does it mean for everyday people?""
You can also appear smart in class by summarizing the best points made by the class, and then by contributing your own comment or question., When speaking up in class, focus on what you know. It is tempting to make up for what you do not know by making bizarre arguments, or by relying on secondhand knowledge to answer a question. It is OK if you do not know all the answers. The best thing to do is to admit to yourself that you do not know everything. Base your questions and comments off of things you are absolutely sure of., When asking a question or commenting in class, you can appear intelligent by citing your sources. For example you can say, “I read an article in the Washington Post that says that eating sugary foods can reduce brain productivity,” or “A study conducted by a social scientist shows that asking questions during class can make your appear more intelligent.” Try to remember that random information seems suspicious and questionable.

, Try carrying around a copy of National Geographic or the Harvard Business Review, for example. Carrying around things people associate with intelligence sends the message that you regularly read “smart” material. More importantly, it sends the message that you have the ability to understand the material presented in these magazines or books.Of course, it is better if you actually read the material you carry around with you. By reading the material, you can avoid looking phony if someone asks you what the latest article in the magazine is and you cannot answer them.

Pre-read the text.,
Direct your reading with questions about the content you're about to read.,
Write down your answers to remind you as you read.

",How to Learn Quickly when Reading1," Give yourself a minute or two to just look things over and think about what it is that you need to absorb from the text. Use the steps in the section ""Familiarizing Yourself with the Text"" to Identify the basics first:


Is it a list of facts? An understanding of a concept? A sequence of events?
What sort of learning will you need to do?;
, Especially if you are reading something that was assigned in a class, good questions to consider include:


Why am I being asked to read this? What is the purpose of the assignment?
How does this assignment fit in with the rest of what we have been doing? It is the main idea? Or, is it just an example or sideline to the main idea?
What am I supposed to be getting out of this? (Ideas, background information, procedures, overview?)
What level of detail am I going to need to retain? (Do I need to understand everything, or will the main ideas be sufficient?)

,"
"
Do all of your assignments.,
Do extra research.,
Prepare a list of questions.,
Be on time.",How to Appear More Intelligent in Class2," By completing all your assignments, you will be ready to discuss the material in class. Being able to discuss the material in class will make you appear intelligent not only to your classmates, but also to your teacher. You will also be able to ask questions about difficult problems or ideas that you do not understand.Make sure to complete your assignments ahead of time, i.e., at least the night before. This will give your brain a chance to process the information in time for class.
At the end of each class, take note of all the assignments the teacher gives in class. This will ensure that you will know exactly what the teacher expects of you for the next class.

, You can appear more intelligent in class by doing extra research on a topic of interest. Perhaps you are really interested in ancient Chinese dynasties. You could look up more information about them, and bring up these points in class.


You could say in class, ""I find ancient Chinese dynasties intriguing and I found some interesting information about the Chinese. Did you know they were the first people to experiment with fireworks?""

, While you are working on your assignments, take notes on things you do not understand, or ideas that you find particularly interesting. Then, after you have completed the assignment, prepare a list of questions and comments that you can bring to class with you.

, If you are late to class, you may miss important information or announcements in the beginning of class. This way, you can avoid asking repetitive questions. Also, being on time shows respect for the teacher and your fellow classmates. You can avoid being late to class by knowing what time the class starts and by trying to get there 5 minutes early. If you are in the middle of a conversation or activity before class starts, respectfully excuse yourself from the situation so you can make it to class on time.

"
"
Read, read, read.,
Challenge yourself.,
Refrain from relying on technology.,
Believe you are smart.",How to Appear More Intelligent in Class3," You can also appear more intelligent in class by actually increasing your intelligence. Reading is a great way to increase your intelligence. You can read more by committing to a reading goal. Tell yourself that you will complete a book once a month. You can also subscribe to magazines or journals like National Geographic, The Economist, or Scientific American to increase your reading of relevant topics and material. Read the articles in these magazines that interest you. If something comes up in class that is related to the article, you can bring this up in a class discussion.


You could say, ""The concept of cultural shock reminds me of an article I read in National Geographic about a American photographer who traveled to Japan in the 1960's.""

, Increase your intelligence by challenging yourself. Challenge yourself by learning something new, like a new language, a new topic of study, or a new activity, like painting. Often times challenging yourself means stepping out of your comfort zone. Therefore, once you have mastered a task, like Sudoku, for example, move onto something else to keep your brain guessing.Other examples of challenging yourself are learning to cook a meal, instead of purchasing it; reading the whole book instead of a review of the book; or, instead of giving up if you do not understand something, like how to play chess, push yourself to try to understand it.

, Instead of relying on technology to do things for you, learn how to do things on your own. For example, instead of relying on your GPS to get you places, learn how to get somewhere on your own. Learn the roads and how they connect. Learn how to determine which way is north, south, east, and west., By believing that you are smart or that you have the capability of being smart, you will be able to convince yourself that you can learn new things. Remember that attitude is everything. If you are sitting there telling yourself that you have learned everything you need to know, you have just set up a major obstacle for yourself. Be open to new ideas and things by learning something new like how to write or how to locate constellations in the sky, for example.

"
"
Think about what you already know about the text.,
Figure out what is in the book, how it is arranged, and where the important stuff is.,
Think about what you already know about the topic.",How to Learn Quickly when Reading2," This includes considering the context in which it was written, or is used. Sample questions might include:


Who wrote it? What do I know about this person?
When was it written? What do I know about that time?

, Sample strategies include:


Scan TOC (Table of Contents)
Scan chapters and headings.
Look at pictures and graphs.
Read the introduction and conclusion.
Scan introductory sections.

, You may not need to read more, or you may be able to read only the parts you still need to learn.

"
"
Choose a method that works for you to highlight main ideas and important details.,
Try the highlighter and pen reading system if it's your own book or paper.,
If it's a library book, do not mark in it.,
To take notes from an on-screen text, select the text and copy and paste into another document.",How to Learn Quickly when Reading3," Marking the text serves as a way of anchoring what you've learned––you can find the ideas again quickly and it will also remind you of the initial thoughts you had when reading these marked portions. Methods of highlighting will depend on what you're reading, for example, if it's your own book or the library's or if it's printed on paper or read on a screen.

, If you read this way, you will always have questions and comments on the reading for class discussion and your teacher will think you are a conscientious, engaged student. The method works as follows:


Find 2 highlighters and a pen.
The first highlighter is for key points and things you want to remember. (Be judicious—only highlight a few items per page.)
The second highlighter is for things you don’t understand, questions, and places you disagree.
The pen is to write comments in the text. (Writing comments keeps your learning active and helps you remember the content you read.)

, Instead, make notes on cards, slips of paper, or in a separate notebook.

, Some formats also allow on-screen highlighting, comments, and other ways to mark up the text.

"
"
Reflect on what you have read.,
Try using two or more of the following strategies:


Reflect on your pre-reading (fit it into the course goals).,
Review the reading material within 24 hours to process it again.,
Begin any assignments promptly after reading the text.",How to Learn Quickly when Reading4," Don’t immediately switch gears when you finish reading. (Switching gears immediately is the surest way to erase everything you just read from your short term memory.) You will process better and remember more if you take a few minutes to reflect on what you read.

,
Write a summary. Here are some sample questions you could discuss:

What is this writer’s purpose? Who is the audience?
What are the main points/topics covered?
What reasons and evidence support these main points?
How is it relevant to this course? Context.
What am I supposed to learn from this?
How and how strongly do I react to this? Why?


Question the material. What do I think is wrong/right? Why? What reasons do I have for my beliefs?

, This helps move the material from short-term to long-term memory.

, If you find you need to review the material in order to complete your assignment, you will be able to find the parts you need more quickly.

"
"
List all the subjects you need to study.,
Figure out what you need to do for each subject or exam.,
Prioritize your list.,
Divide your available time during the week into study blocks.,
Reserve time for non-academic activities.,
Fill in your study blocks.,
Assess your current schedule.,
Take into account your learning style.,
Reflect upon your work ethic.,
Make the most of your scheduled off time.,
Take short breaks and stick to them.,
Stick to the schedule.,
Tell others about your schedule.",How to Create a Study Schedule," Perhaps the first step in creating your study schedule is to list all of the subjects and courses you need to study for. Putting your obligations on paper will help you get a better idea of what you really have to do. If you have specific exams to study for, list these instead of courses., Now that you’ve written down all of the different subjects you need to study for, you need to figure out what you need to do for each course. While your time commitment and other obligations for a specific class might vary per week, chances are you’ll find out that over the long-haul, you’ll need a certain amount of time per subject.


If you have a study guide or a textbook with review sections, use it to narrow down what you list.
Reserve time for reading.
Reserve time for reviewing your notes.
Reserve time to create exam study guides, if you'll need them., After you’ve made a list of all the subjects or exams you need to study for and figured out what you need to do for each, prioritize the list. Ranking each class in importance will help you figure out what subjects you need to devote the most time to and which subjects should get your best time slots.


Put a number, starting with one, next to all of your subjects or exams. If you need the most time for math, give it a one. If you need the least time for history (and you have five subjects to study for), give it a five.
Take into account difficulty of the subject or exam.
Take into account the amount of reading you will need to do.
Take into account the amount of reviewing you will need to do., Before you go on, you need to divide up your available time during the week into study blocks. After you do this, you can go and assign your blocks to a subject.


The trick to creating a study schedule is to plan to study the same time every day so you actually have a schedule you can memorize without constantly checking. By creating a routine, you’ll build a positive study habit.
Check if there are times or days of the week you can always study during. For example, you may be free 3-4 p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday. If possible, try to schedule your studying then, because a regular, set routine can help you get into a studying mindset and into one more quickly.
Schedule study sessions in 30 to 45 minute blocks. Shorter time blocks are easier to find and to schedule than longer blocks.
Create blocks for all of your available time.
If you have a certain amount of time before an exam, create a reverse calendar instead of a weekly schedule., While blocking off time for each subject, you also need to make sure that you are reserving time for family, friends, and rest. This is because you won’t be able to succeed at your studies unless you create a healthy balance between your personal life and your academic life.


Reserve time for events you can’t reschedule, your grandmother’s birthday, a family reunion, or your dog’s veterinary appointment.
Block off any times you have other commitments such as swim practice, family time, or religious services.
Reserve plenty of time for rest, sleep, and exercise.
If you only have a very limited amount of time before important exams, consider postponing or canceling regular social or extra-curricular activities., Once you’ve got your schedule blocked out and you know what you need to schedule, fill in your schedule. Write down which subject you are studying in each session. This will help keep you on track, create checkpoints for the material, and allow you to organize your textbooks and study materials ahead of time.


Buy a daily planner or something similar. You can also use a basic notebook.
Program your schedule into your smart phone, if you have one.
Only plan for a week at a time first, until you've figured out how your schedule works.
Prioritize studying for approaching exams. Divide all of your studying up into the limited amount of time you have and spread the material out over the time you have before a given exam.
Prioritize courses you are doing poorly in or are determined to ace., Your first step in creating a study schedule is to assess your current schedule and the way you currently spend time. Assessing your current schedule will enable you to take a good look at how you use time and to help identify where you can be more efficient and what activities you might be able to cut.


Determine how many hours a week you currently study.
Determine how many hours a week you currently devote to entertainment.
Determine how many hours a week you currently spend with friends and family.
Do some quick math to see what you could cut. People tend to find they spend a lot of time on entertainment, start there.
Make sure to create your study schedule around your work schedule, if you work., While figuring out how you spend time is one of the most important parts of creating your schedule, you also need to figure out how you actually study. Figuring out how you study can help you determine if you can have overlap in activities. It will also help you figure out how you can use time you don’t normally use. Ask yourself a few questions.


Are you an auditory learner? Perhaps listen to recorded lectures or other audio studying material when driving in the car or when working out in the gym.
Are you a visual learner? Can you put up pictures or watch videos to learn? Try watching a video as a way to learn and as a way of entertainment., Although you might design yourself an awesome schedule, your schedule will mean relatively little if you don’t commit yourself to studying. As a result, you need to spend a little bit of time reflecting upon your work ethic. After doing so:


Plan your schedule based on how you think you will work. If you tend to lose focus and take a lot of breaks, build in extra time into your schedule.
If you know you procrastinate, build in extra time before any deadlines. This will provide a cushion so you don’t wind up missing a deadline.
If you know you have a very solid work ethic, provide yourself with the ability to complete work early. You might do this by creating an extra “bonus” spot in your schedule that you can use to get ahead on any subject you want., One of the biggest challenges in following your study schedule is that you’ll be tempted to blow it off and instead do something relaxing, fun, or entertaining. However, you need to resist this temptation and instead make the most of your scheduled entertainment time.


Look forward to your off time as a reward for studying.
Use your off time as a way of recharging. Taking a nap might help you. Going for a walk or doing some yoga might relax you and help you to focus when you need to get back to studying.
Make sure to get out of the house. Use your off time to go out away from your study space., Make sure to take one break during each study block. However, this could present problems. One of the most important elements of following your study schedule is to make sure you abide by your schedule and only take the allotted amount of break time. Taking extra breaks or prolonging breaks can and will undermine your schedule and sabotage your plans for studying success.


Take one 5 to 10 minute long break during your study blocks. Don't exceed 5 to 10 minutes.
At the start of your break, set an alarm that will go off when your break is over.
Use your break wisely. Make sure to use your break to refresh yourself. Take a stretch, go for a short walk, eat a small snack, or get pumped by listening to some music.
Avoid distractions that could prolong your break., The one hard-and-fast rule about making sure your schedule works is that you’ve got to adhere to your schedule. There's no point in making a study schedule if you don't stick to it.


Try to get into the habit of looking at your calendar/planner on a regular, preferably daily, basis. This will help keep you away from the ""out of sight, out of mind"" trap.
Once you’ve established a routine, you may start mentally associating certain acts, such as the opening of a textbook or sitting down at a desk, with a study mode., Sometimes our schedules are hard to follow because important people in our lives distract us from our goals. This is not done maliciously, but just because people who care about you want to spend time with you. In order to avoid this, tell people in your lives about your schedule. This way, if they want to do something, they can plan around it.


Post a copy of your study guide on the refrigerator at home so your family can see it.
Email a copy out to your friends so they know when you are free.
If someone plans something during a study slot, politely ask them if you can reschedule for another time."

Find a quiet, isolated area.,
Block out noise and distractions.,
Tell others to leave you alone.",How to Absorb What You Read1," Pick a reading spot that you know will be quiet and have the least amount of distractions. At home, this might be your bedroom or a room upstairs, away from shared areas like the kitchen or living room. At school, you may read in the quiet area of the library or in a quiet corner of the study hall.Choose an area that has thick walls and a door or a partition. This will help to block out noise and other sounds that could distract you from your reading.;
, If you know there is going to be noise where you are reading, wear noise cancelling headphones or ear plugs. Close all doors to keep out noise. This will help you stay focused on the text.

You should also turn off your cellphone and your wifi. This way, you are not distracted by social media or text messages.

, Let those around you know that you are trying to focus on reading. Put up a Do Not Disturb sign on your door. Ask others around you to stay away from your room or area so you can try to absorb the text in peace.

You may instruct others to leave you alone for a set period of time, such as 30 minutes or 1 hour. This way, you are assured of some peace and quiet for a set period of time so you can focus on the text.

Consider how you will use the slider.,
Refer to educational books or expert opinion regarding the types of words appropriate for the young learner.",How to Make an Educational Word Slider1," Are you trying to teach a youngster sounds or to read small words? Are you trying to teach larger phrases or something else?


Consider the child's ability and age too. If you're working with a younger, preschool student will may need to “jazz” up the slider or purchase larger index cards to make it easier to read.;
, You will want the words or sounds to be challenging but not so challenging that they'd only be suitable for an older child. You don’t want your student to become frustrated working with material meant for an older learner.


Identify the number of words or the amount of time appropriate to spend on playing a word game based on the child’s age, skill level and maturity.

Make a schedule for all of your exams.,
Start highlighting and creating.,
Coax a friend to come with you.,
Scope out a nice area to study.,
Gather all your materials (and some goodies, too).",How to Study for College1," Arrange them by date so that the one you are having first comes at the top, then your next exam, then the next etc. Read the syllabus that comes with your classes.


By the time finals roll around, your time is precious -- every minute counts. Which is why scheduling is essential during the weeks (er, days) prior to exams. So as not to go totally bonkers during this stressful time, make a realistic study schedule for yourself, too. Leave yourself time for breaks -- you'll be taking them anyway -- and be sure to prioritize according to which class you'll need to study for the most. The syllabus is one of the most important papers your professor will give you. Hold onto it! Use it when you're studying for your finals as a sort of outline.It may also make it clear what topics your instructor finds interesting and important -- certain topics may pop up more than others and those are definitely the ones to crack down on.;
, Do you have to study just words? If yes, type them out in a word processor and print them. The words you already know should not be on the list. Make absolutely sure that you know them before you take them off the list! Repeat every word 10 times and you will remember.


Go through your notes and highlight major vocabulary words and concepts (in different colors!). Manipulate the material to your liking. Create charts and index cards to help yourself study. Make cards in different categories -- some for terms and/or concepts, some for formulas, and some for specific quotes from reading assignments.

, And if they're in your class, all the better (for them and you). However, make sure it's someone who's serious about studying -- goofing off together won't be very productive. A friend is beneficial if you can stay focused.


Take turns explaining terms and concepts to each other. Odds are if you can explain it to someone else (and they can follow), you have a good grasp on the material and that'll show up on the exam.

, Study in a quiet place that has a nice chair you won't hesitate to spend large chunks of time in. If you find the perfect chair in a not-so-perfect area, move it. It's not glued to the floor for a reason.


Or, rather, scope out nice areas (yep, that's plural) to study. Believe it or not, several (again with the plural) studies have found that if you switch up your environment while learning, retention is increased. Somehow, magically, keeping your brain surrounded by new stimuli makes the information more interesting and therefore easier to remember.So if you get antsy, listen to your gut and find a new armchair to sink into.

, When you leave your dorm room or home, make sure you have everything you need and then some. Grab all your papers, folders, writing utensils and books you need, but make sure to not forget the almost more important stuff: a water bottle, some money (just in case), your headphones, and snacks to munch on.


Magically, chocolate is starting to be deemed the new ""super fruit."" It's high in antioxidants and healthy plant compounds, even more so than most fruit juices.So don't feel guilty about grabbing your dark chocolate bar when you hit the study room. You may actually be doing yourself a favor.

Discover your child's natural affinity and academic aptitude.,
Provide an environment that will instill a healthy balance among your child's IQ (Intelligence Quotient), EQ (Emotional Quotient) and PQ (Physical and Physiological quotient).,
Teach children about the ways in which science and technology add value to the quality of human lives.,
Create a science and technology environment outside of school.,
Bring science and technology closer to life by pointing out its daily applications.,
On a regular basis, conduct a task analysis in relation to metacognition standards.,
Explain that science and technology can lead to fame and monetary gain.,
Teach critical inquiry skills to your child in the early stages of his or her life.",How to Impart STEM Education to Your Children," Every child's constitution is different, and even though the theory of neuroplasticity tells us that the human brain can adapt to almost anything, some children are able to learn about the sciences more easily than others. Since it's clear that different forms of knowledge exercise different parts of the brain, some students will probably require a little more time and effort than others to learn the same academic subject. As a parent or caregiver, it is most important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your child, support him or her through the process, and to try to alleviate unnecessary stress.;
, Fundamental for your child is the PQ; a child will not be able to learn if he or she is hungry, tired, or indisposed. EQ also plays a very important role in a child's academic success. If a child feels emotionally deprived, he or she will not be able to learn. IQ blooms only when PQ and EQ are supported to be their best.

, If children understand all of the wonderful things technology has done and can do, (for example, the cell phone, the Internet, video games, cures for diseases, for example), then they are much more likely to get excited about what they can achieve by pursuing an education in science and technology.


Make sure children can relate to the examples you pick. Talk about curing illnesses rather than relating technological progress to something like cancer stem cell research. Young children will not understand highly technical language. If you can base your discussion of scientific progress in a story about someone or something a child is already familiar with (such as a family member or friend who has been ill), your message will be much more effective.

, This can be accomplished in many ways:


View science and technology TV channels with your child. Engage in discussions about what you viewed afterward.
Try an experiment that you saw demonstrated on TV or in a video. Part of the fun can be gathering the items needed to perform it as well as setting up the ""experimental lab.""
Conduct Internet searches on performing fun experiments. There are many sites dedicated to science projects for kids.
Make home experiments fun occasions. Organize groups of kids to participate at your home, in your backyard, garage, or another safe place.
Join or organize science and technology (S&T) related groups on social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn in order to brainstorm with other parents and caregivers. You might even be in contact with teachers in S&T through these online communities.
Find or start a supplementary school like the Saturday math school in a Boston suburb established by Russian immigrants.Become a member of the local science museum and keep a watch on activities for kids. Incorporate regular visits into your family's activities.
Use building blocks, puzzles, and games for family activities. Leave these in obvious places so that kids pick them up, play with them, and view them as part of their everyday surroundings.
Most importantly, engage in conversation about science-related topics with children in way that pertains to everyday life experiences.

, Help children understand how science and technology have led to such things as running water, electricity, and cars. Create a before-and-after scenario in order for your child to realize that people did not always have running water, electricity, or cars. By explaining the history of technology, your child will begin to comprehend that technology is related to progress and serves a very important purpose in day-to-day living.

, This way you can help teachers correctly evaluate the cognitive abilities of your child and match the mode of instruction to his or her skill level.

, Appeal to children's fantasies and tempt them! Provide examples of great scientists and achievers. You can easily find examples by conducting an online search.


Consider making a home project out of researching the lives of famous scientists and innovators. Show your child how to find age-appropriate resources on the Web or in books and magazines to find interesting facts. Have him or her report back with findings! Work with your child to create a poster, Powerpoint, video, or interactive presentation. Why not use technological media to display knowledge about science and technology?

, Start by demonstrating how to observe, ask questions, create hypotheses, and test those hypotheses. Inquiry is the basis of science, math, and technological activity. When one is interested in how something works, inquires into it, and then makes discoveries, the desire to learn more ignites! Curiosity leading to inquiry provides the best foundation for perpetual self-improvement through study and experimentation.


Encourage children to ask questions. Try not to brush aside their queries, even if they don't make sense or are not good questions. Turn the bad question into an interesting and relevant question and then engage in discussion. You don't necessarily need to know all of the answers. An important part of the process is helping your children learn how to find answers themselves through your guidance.

Determine if you are on a point system.,
Determine the total number of earned points.,
Determine the total number of points you earned.,
Determine your percentage.",How to Calculate Your Grade2," Before calculating your grade, you will need to figure out if your teacher is using a point system or a weighted grade system. With a point system, everything you do in the class will be worth a certain number of points. Look for a point score on your assignments or simply ask your teacher to determine if this is how you are being graded.
, Look at your syllabus, add the numbers listed on completed assignments, or ask your teacher to determine the total number of points available. If you are just trying to find out what your grade is at the moment, add together only the points for assignments you have completed so far. If you want to guess the grade you will end with in the class, you will need to ask your teacher for the total number of points that can be earned in the class.

, Next, add up all of the points that you earned on your assignments. You can get these numbers from the assignments themselves (if your teacher listed your point score) or you can get them by asking your teacher for your scores.


If you are trying to guess what grade you will end up with, you will have to guess how well you will score on future assignments in order to calculate your final grade. You can guess these numbers by choosing a number of points similar to the percentages you have been getting or you can choose a higher number of points (to see what would happen if you study harder) or a lower number of points (to see what would happen if you studied less).

, Now, take the total number of points that you earned and divide that number by the number of total earned points. You can use the points only for assignments so far or you can use the number of points for the entire class. It depends on the information available to you and your reasons for calculating your grade.


An example of this equation would look like this: Sam has completed ten assignments and one test. Altogether, these assignments were worth 200 points. Sam added together their scores and found that they had earned 175 points. Sam calculates the grade (175/200=.87) to find a score of 87% for their class grade.

"
"
Determine if you are using weighted assignments.,
Calculate your percentage in each category.,
Convert those percentages to a number.,
Add numbers to get your class percentage.",How to Calculate Your Grade3," Your teacher may be using a weighted grading system. This means that your work will still have points, but those points will be worth different amounts based on what category it falls into. Common categories include homework, tests, participation, quizzes, final exam, and participation.


Each category will be worth a certain percentage of your grade. To get a good grade, you will need to score all or a majority of the points in each category. However, scoring fewer points in a category which is only worth a small percentage of your grade will not affect your grade as much as if the category was worth a large percentage.
For ease of calculating, we will assume that each category is worth a number of point equal to its percentage weight (For example, a category worth 20% will be worth 20 points). This should make the total number of “points” for the class equal 100, which should make it significantly easier to calculate your grade.
Different teachers will prioritize different things in their class, based on their philosophy of teaching and what they believe is most important. For example, some teachers will most heavily weight the final exam, whereas others will most heavily weight participation.

, Using the same method discussed above, figure out your point percentage for each category. Think of it like figuring out your grade, but just for homework or just for your quizzes.


If you are trying to figure out how you will do in the overall class, you will have to guess how well you will do on the work you have not completed.

, Multiply that percentage score by the number for the category to find out how many points you earned for that category. For example, if you earned 95% in a category weighted at 20% (.95 x 20 = 19), you will earn 19 points for that category.

, Add the resulting numbers for each category to find out your percentage for the class. This can then be compared against the chart below to find your letter grade.

"
"
Determine the percentage and points you want.,
Ask your teacher for help with weighted grades.,
Get extra credit.",How to Calculate Your Grade4," In order to figure out how much you need to raise your grade with a point system, you will first need to decide what letter grade you want in the class overall and what the corresponding percentage is (you can use the chart below).


Next, use this percentage to determine how many points, out of the total number of available points in the class, are necessary to earn this percentage.
Compare the number of points you’re already earned against how many points are needed to get the grade you want. Compare that number against the point count for the work you have not yet done. If the number of points available is small than the number of points needed to gain that grade, you will not be able to achieve the grade you want without some form of extra credit.

, Calculating what you will need to do to raise a weighted grade is much more difficult, since there are so many different factors. The easiest method will be to ask your teacher for help and advice.


You will want to focus on doing better in the categories which are more heavily weighted. This will raise your grade faster than focusing on the lesser categories. However, if those more lightly weighted categories are easy to raise (such as regular attendance to raise a participation grade), then you certainly should not ignore them.

, Extra credit for either grading system will help raise your grade. The more the extra work is worth, the more it will do to raise your grade. However, if your teacher uses weighted grades and puts extra credit in a less weighted category, this will help less. Ask your teacher how extra credit is counted before taking on too much.

"
"
Understand standards-based grading.,
Understand rank-based grading.",How to Calculate Your Grade5," Your teacher may use further methods to determine your grade in the class. It is important to know which system your teacher or school uses before doing too many calculations. If your class will be graded using standards-based grading, then the methods above should accurately predict your grade.


Standard-based grading is a system where all of your work can earn a set number of points and the number of points you earn directly results in your grade.

, Rank-based grading is a more complicated system that has been adopted by some teachers and schools. In this system, all of the grades earned across all of your classmates will be placed on a curve. The majority of students will receive a middle range grade, whereas students who score higher or lower than the middle group will receive correspondingly high or low scores. Where you placed on the curve will then determine your final grade, so it can complicate your calculations.


For example, you may get an “A” (even if you scored only an 85%) if your classmates all scored worse than you did.
This system can be used to determine your entire grade or just particular parts. Sometimes teachers will apply it only to a final exam, for example.

"
"
Convert your percentages to a letter grade.",How to Calculate Your Grade6," You may wish to convert the percentages you have calculated to a letter grade. Alternatively, you may wish to know the percentage of a particular assignment where your teacher provided only the letter grade. The letter grading scale varies greatly depending on where you are going to school but this is the most common.


A = 93 - 100%
A- = 90 - 92%
B+ = 87 - 89%
B = 83 - 86%
B- = 80 - 82%
C+ = 77 - 79%
C = 73 - 76%
C- = 70 - 72%
D+ = 67 - 69%
D = 63 - 66%
D- = 60 - 62%
F = 0 - 59%

"
Calculate your GPA.",How to Calculate Your Grade7," Your GPA (or grade point average) is used to determine your performance level across all of your classes. Your high school GPA is often used to determine which colleges you can get into and your college GPA will determine your graduate school entrance.


Your GPA is calculated by assigning a certain number of points, based on the grade you earned for a class versus how many credits that class was worth, and dividing the resulting total point count by the total number of credit hours. The points assigned for a 1 credit class are listed below (for classes above one credit, multiply the number of points by the number of credits).

A = 4
A- = 3.7
B+ = 3.3
B = 3
B- = 2.7
C+ = 2.3
C = 2
C- = 1.7
D+ = 1.3

Read a printed text.,
Skim the text for keywords, ideas, and themes.,
Read the text out loud.,
Revisit passages you do not understand.",How to Absorb What You Read2," Reading a text that is printed on a page, rather than on a computer, will make it easier for your eyes to focus on the text. Print out texts that are online or on a computer so you have the physical copy. This way, your eyes will not have to strain to read the text on a computer screen.If you are worried about using too much paper, print on both sides of the paper. Choose the double sided option when you print the text. You can also use recycled paper to print the text.
Alternatively, you can read the text on an eReader or on a screen designed for reading small print. Make the text large and easy to read on an eReader so you do not have to strain your eyes when reading.

, Look for words that are repeated several times. Identify ideas that seem important to the rest of the text. Notice themes that reappear from page to page. Skimming the text for these elements will make it easier for you to then understand the rest of the text when you read it in full.Keep these keywords, ideas, and themes in mind when you read the text in detail. Use them as a guide for your reading.

, Reading the text aloud to yourself can help you slow down and read the text more carefully. Listen to each sentence as you read it aloud. Pay attention to how the words sound on the page. Notice repetition, turns of phrase, and the language used in the text.To keep the reading engaging, you may try reading the text aloud with a peer or friend. Take turns reading the text aloud. This will allow you to listen to the text when it is being read by someone else.

, If you struggle with certain sentences or sections in the text, re-read them. Read each word slowly and consider the meaning of each sentence in the section. Spend some time pulling apart the passage. This will help you better understand it.Once you have re read the passage, consider it within the context of the rest of the text. Ask yourself, “How does this passage relate to the text as a whole?” “What does this passage say about the key themes or ideas in the text?”

Highlight or underline sentences you find interesting.,
Put notes in the margins.,
Make notes in a notebook if you can't mark up the book.,

Make a list of words you do not recognize.",How to Absorb What You Read3," Use a highlighter or a pen to underline sentences that stand out to you. Look for sentences you find striking or interesting. Do not be afraid to markup the text with underlines and highlights, as this will force you to read the text more closely.Try to only highlight or underline sentences that you think are really important. Highlighting or underlining the text too much can make it hard for you to identify sentences that are important, and you’ll end up with pages of underlines and highlights.
Only highlight or underline the book if you own it and it is okay to do so. Library books, borrowed texts, and old texts may not be suitable for highlighting and underlining.

, Reflect on the text as you read by jotting down notes in the margins. Write down short thoughts you have about the text. Put a question mark next to sentences you do not understand. Put one to two words next to lines that spark a thought for you.For example, you may write in the margins “key detail” or “explores main theme.”
Only make notes in the margins if you own the book and you are allowed to do so. Do not write directly in library books and old texts that are not yours.

, You can also make notes about the text in a notebook or on a piece of paper. Pull quotes from the text that you find interesting or important and write them down in the notebook. Then, add notes next to it. Or put the page number from the text down next to the note.

For example, you may make a note about a particular passage like, “important discussion of title” or “key character moment.”
You may designate a notebook to a particular text so you can return to it for reference later. Having separate notes in a notebook may be a good idea even if you can write in the book.

, Asking questions about the text will help you become a better reader. Pretend you are having a conversation with the text directly. Ask questions about passages you are confused about or intrigued by. Add to the list of questions as you read.For example, you may ask questions like, “How does this sentence explore key themes in the text?” “Why did the author include this example?” “How does this passage make me feel as a reader?”
Keep the list of questions in a separate notebook so you can refer to them later.

, Identify any vocabulary that you are not familiar with or do not know the meaning of. Keep a running list of terms. Use a dictionary to look them up and then consider the definition in the context of the sentence. This will help you better understand the text and read it more closely.You may keep a dictionary handy while you read the text so you can look up words quickly and easily.
Keep the list of vocabulary in a separate notebook so you can look at them later.

Study in a group.",How to Study for College2," Whatever you think will work for you, do it. There are dozens of studying tactics out there -- experiment with as many as possible and see what seems to be sticking.


Write summaries. If you have to learn for science or history, you need another system of learning. Make a summary for each chapter and learn it.
Use mnemonic devices. Why did the US enter WWI? Duh, everyone knows that's because of SPRENCZ.What's SPRENCZ? Uhh, Submarines, Propaganda, the Russians, Economic ties to Europe, violations of Neutrality, Cultural ties with Britain, and the Zimmerman note, obviously. With the device, it'll jog your memory and you can easily expand in essay form.
If you make study cards, recite them out loud. It'll help you remember. Reading the cards silently is too passive.Carry them around with you and go over them when you find yourself with a bit of free time.

, It won't help if you'll study continuously for 5 hours. Your body (and even your brain) needs a break. Eat something and drink a glass of milk or water. Study for 20-30 minutes, have a 5 minute break and then study again for 20-30 minutes. You will learn much more.


According to the Dartmouth Academic Skills Center, you should study in 20-50 minute increments and give yourself a 5 to 10 minute break between each session. For best results, study throughout one full week., Most people have heard of the Mozart effect. That's where you listen to Mozart and miraculously you get smarter. Not surprisingly, most of it's crap. But there is a thread of something tangible there, and it's in all music.


That original Mozart study was done on young adults, not babies (so you're in luck!). And while the music by no means made the participants smarter, it did increase the brain's alertness for about 15 minutes afterward. When the study was extended, it showed that any music (so long as the participant enjoys it) can stimulate the brain, not just Mozart. And, in fact, getting up and running around or doing jumping jacks can do the same thing. So whatever it is, find a way to get your brain jogging.

, Not only will your attention span appreciate it, but your brain will more easily take it in as well. Instead of sticking to vocabulary, cover it and then switch to concepts and reading passages.


You know how musicians practice with a mix of scales intertwined with actual pieces and rhythm practice? And how athletes never do the same drills two times in a row? They're doing what you should: using a panoply of skills in one session. Your brain will be more impressed., Study groups can motivate you to get started when it's hard to motivate yourself -- plus, explaining difficult concepts out loud will help you figure out what you understand and what you still need to go over, and getting a group together will allow you to divide and conquer definition of terms and explanations of concepts. And if you can get each member to bring a snack, that's incentive to actually meet!Have each student prepare for the practice session by bringing in a couple of practice questions or prompts (maybe what they find the most confusing). Together, the group will work through the answers, solving each person's most burning questions. However, don't take a group mentality and get off track though! And make sure everyone shares accurate information; otherwise, the whole group will get lead unintentionally astray.

Get some sleep.,
Eat breakfast.,
Be confident.",How to Study for College3," Pulling an all-nighter is risky business. While most college students think that studying all night will help them learn more for an exam, all-nighters can actually damage grades. Exhausted students can't concentrate on exams, and cramming for a final can actually reduce the amount of information you remember. Well-rested students, on the other hand, are much more relaxed and alert when it comes time to take exams. Make time to sleep -- you'll thank yourself later.


Cramming isn't worth it. This is known as a ""freshman trick,"" meaning that good, veteran students learn very quickly that it is futile. What you may gain from extra study time won't compensate for the loss of alertness and ability to concentrate due to lack of sleep.

, Not only is this good for your body, it's good for your mind, too. It’ll be more difficult to concentrate if you’re hungry. Don’t eat anything that may upset your stomach, though.


Avoid the temptation to hype yourself up on caffeine. It may just make your more anxious. Stick to your normal breakfast -- your routine will be comforting.

, It may sound like a load of baloney, but being confident and thinking you'll do well can help calm you down and, ultimately, make you do well. And let's be honest, you've done what you could. So whatever makes you think you've got it, do it. It'll pay off when you're not breaking out in a sweat, fingers twitching in nerves


When we intend to remember without having confidence that we can remember, the intention is weakened into mere hoping. The memory strengthens as you lay burdens upon it and becomes trustworthy as you trust it. Try to form the habit early on of relying on your memory before referring to your written reminders."

Exercise every day.",How to Motivate Yourself if You Are Homeschooled1," Doing this allows you to set your body’s clock and create discipline. Humans are creatures of habit, so getting up and going to sleep at the same times each day normalizes your routine. Additionally, this habit improves the quality of sleep over time, so you’ll wake feeling more rested and alert.Depending on your age, you'll need to get between six and ten hours of sleep each night. Ask your doctor how much sleep you should be getting to fully rejuvenate your mind and body.
Stop hitting snooze. Each time you do, you'll be interfering with your body's natural sleep cycle and making it more difficult to wake up.;
, Don’t get right out of bed and start an assignment. Instead, give your brain time to wake up. Take a shower, go for a walk, or do yoga. Whatever you want to do to get your blood flowing, and make you feel more awake and alert once you start on your assignments., Set repeating alarms on your cell phone, and change subjects or take breaks at the same times each day. Again, this will get you in the habit of staying on task. If there’s a subject you’re not very fond of, reminding yourself that you only need to study or work on an assignment in that subject for a specific length of time can make you feel more positive about getting through your tasks., You can organize these in whatever way works for you. For instance, create a list of assignments you need to complete each day or for each subject. You can write these down or add them in a calendar, Word document, or other form of digital file. Whatever form of to do list you choose, make sure to periodically review the items, and mark off those you’ve completed., Exercise releases endorphins, boosts energy, and helps you concentrate. Even if it’s something as simple as taking the dog for a walk in the morning or standing up and doing some stretches, exercise can help you stay on task and get your work done. You should do a few stretches or at least walk around a bit during every break.


If you're sitting for long periods of time, you need to stand up to allow blood to flow through your body and improve energy.
Move your shoulders forward and back to remove tension that can build up there.
Stretch hands and arms to avoid a repetitive motion injury, especially if you've been typing for several hours.

Eat light, healthy meals with lots of protein before getting to work. This will give you the energy you need to complete the tasks without weighing you down. Eat small snacks at various points in your lessons to boost energy periodically rather than consuming large meals.Peppermint improves concentration. If you find your energy flagging or you’re getting distracted, grab a peppermint.
Eat fruits to get a natural sugar boost. Apples are a great option to increase energy and concentration naturally.
String cheese, Greek yogurt, and other low-fat dairy items help to boost energy without creating excessive fullness.

, If you notice you’re getting more easily distracted or working more slowly, you may want to shorten the period of time you spend working on each subject. This doesn’t work for every student, but try switching more often, every half hour instead a full hour, and see if helps you stay on task., Play a game of ""Let’s Make a Deal."" For example, you can tell yourself, ""After I finish math, I can go outside with my dog for 10 minutes."" Make sure that your parent or tutor approves of these rewards., Don’t force yourself to keep working without breaks for more than an hour or two. If you’re “in the zone” and don’t want to stop, keep going, but if you’re dragging, let yourself stand up and walk around for a few minutes every hour. This breaks up the day and re-energizes you to get back to work.


Taking a twenty minute nap midway through the day can increase your productivity in the afternoon, so you may want to consider laying down for just a few minutes.
Standing up, going for a walk, or stretching will get the blood flowing, improve circulation, and make you feel more alert., If you have a parent or tutor supervising your curriculum, ask them to help you come up with ways to keep things interesting with more project-based learning. That might mean taking a field trip or going to see a performance of play. You should also remember to be flexible. If you get really interested in one subject, keep going!

Find a way to do what you're learning about.,
Dig deeper when you're interested in a subject.",How to Motivate Yourself if You Are Homeschooled3," If it's possible, play an organized sport, take music lessons, or join a book club. The discipline of these group activities will help you get motivated and stay focused. Because you have other places to be, you’ll have a reason to get your work done within a specific timeframe., School doesn't have to be limited to your desk or the kitchen table. Find out what’s happening at local museums and zoos. Check out what shows your community theater is performing, or keep it simple and take a trip to the local park to identify plant types. You'll be surprised how much is relevant to what you're learning, and how seeing things for yourself can make once-boring schoolwork exciting again., With the right mindset, homeschooling can be the best way to receive an education. One of the most unique things about homeschool education is that you don't necessarily need to do it at home. Visit your local public library or spend some time at a coffee shop. A change of scenery can be an easy way to reset your focus.

, If you're studying a topic, don't just read about it in a book. Students in schools have labs and other experiential learning assignments, and you should too. Find a way to do at-home science projects, put on the play you're reading with family and friends, or ask your local vet if you can shadow them for a day or week to learn about animals. Get creative and have fun learning.

, If you find a topic that really catches your interest, see if there are books in the library or a YouTube video that tells you more about it. One of the best things about homeschooling is the flexibility, so take advantage of it and have fun."

Set a budget.Before you begin educating your child at home, you can estimate how much you think it will cost to do so.,
Share classes.If you’re a member of a homeschooling network, collaborate with other parents to teach your children together in a small class.,
Share learning materials with others.If you’re a member of a homeschooling network or organization in your area, you can propose sharing learning materials between you.,
Make your own learning materials.Instead of buying a set of flashcards at a teacher’s store or book shop, make them yourself.,
Reuse paper.If you have sheets of paper that have printing on only one side, use the other side for math problems or art activities.,
Look for sales on school materials.During back-to-school sales during the Fall, check your local papers and advertisements.,
Get a job where you can work from home.Homeschooling means that until your kids are teenagers, you or another adult will need to monitor them.,
Consider part-time homeschooling.Homeschooled children are allowed to attend classes at a public school if they want to.",How to Save Money on Homeschooling Curriculum1," Try to stay within this estimated budget. Then, once you’ve spent a semester or two actually homeschooling your child, revisit your original budget estimates and figure out how much you’ll actually need to spend on classes and materials, and how much money you can earn while still effectively educating your child at home. Use the actual data on your costs and earnings over the course of your first semester or two to allocate future money for classroom materials, textbooks, and so on.


Books, pencils, and other school materials can add up quickly. Deciding on your maximum expenditure will help you manage these costs and buy cautiously when building your child’s curriculum.
Don’t feel locked in to your budget. You should use it as a guide, but don’t worry if you go slightly over the budget.
You might find your budget varies from year to year.
Free or discounted materials for younger children tend to be easier to obtain than those for older children.
Reevaluate your budget at the beginning of each school year to ensure your budget is realistic relative to your child’s needs and your finances.;
, For instance, if your child and another are close in age and learning ability, you could teach them one subject, while the other parent could teach them another subject. That way, each of you will only need to invest in one set of learning materials, but your kids will have access to two different classes.


Work together with the other parent to develop a curriculum in each class that you’re both happy with.
This approach will also save you time, since you won’t have to prepare for the class that the other parent is teaching.
Sharing classes can help you cut down on your budget.

, Alternately, you could just (at discounted rates) buy secondhand materials from other members.


For instance, if your child is in the third grade, they will not need materials from their second-grade curriculum. Try to find a parent who is looking for materials for their second-grader and sell them to that parent.
Then, locate a parent in the network whose child is a bit older and no longer has use for third-grade materials. Obtain these materials through purchase or trade.
By obtaining all or many of the materials necessary for a certain grade level at once, you can save time.
You can often get flashcards, books, DVDs, and learning software for free or at discounted rates from parents who no longer have use for them.
Sharing class materials will help you keep your educational costs low.

, All you need is a marker and some notecards. Write the appropriate information on each side and you’ll have your very own set of educational flashcards. This will help you slash your budget for learning materials.


For instance, if you’re making flashcards for a German course, write English words on one side of the card and the German translation for each word on the opposite side. Your child can use these to study.

, Junk mail is often a prime candidate for reuse in a homeschool setting. Reusing paper is not only thrifty, but eco-friendly as well.


If possible, get unused paper with printing on just one side from friends and neighbors, too.

, These sales often offer steep discounts on notebooks, pencils, pens, and other school materials. Look for coupons that can help you score even bigger discounts at the checkout line. Getting materials on sale will help you figure out how much money your materials budget really needs.


If you’re really patient, you can sometimes get even better deals once the school year has gotten underway. Stores will try to liquidate their surpluses by offering their school supplies at discount rates.
Check dollar stores, office supply stores, and pharmacies for discounts on these materials.
Getting school materials on sale is an easy way to cut back on your overall budget.

, Homeschooling often means that one parent sacrifices their career in order to homeschool their child. However, if you are that parent, you don’t necessarily need to be entirely unemployed. If you can get a job where you can work from home, you’ll still be able to provide instruction to your child and make yourself available to them if they have questions. Good employment options for a parent who homeschools include:


graphic designer
writer
artist
musician

, Many parents choose to send their kids to public schools to participate in classes with expensive materials, or classes that are best learned through interaction with other students. For instance, you might choose to send your child to public school to take, art, drama, and debate classes. Sending your child to public school for certain classes can help you cut down on your overall budget.

Borrow books instead of buying.,
Use online resources.There are countless sites designed for self-teaching or homeschooling that can help your child learn a variety of subjects like science, foreign languages, maths, and many more.,
Find discounted books.There are many resources available to help you find second-hand or discounted textbooks.",How to Save Money on Homeschooling Curriculum2," Buying books isn’t your only option. A library card will save you a lot of money. Libraries are great for helping your child find books they are interested in that also have educational value.


Even if a book is not available at your local library, you can probably get it through an interlibrary loan program.
As a homeschooling parent, the library is your friend. In addition to books, take advantage of their other resources like documentaries, learning software, and periodicals to build a strong, low-cost curriculum for your child.
You can rent books through a library for free, or through a book rental service like Chegg.com. Book rental services are useful for helping you get hold of especially hard-to-find titles with low resale value.

, Many of these sites are free, though some have a small cost.


Try Duolingo to learn a foreign language.
Khan Academy offers free videos on many topics, and is well-known for producing quality lessons on scientific and mathematical subjects.
Try running a word string like “full lecture” or “homeschooling video” through YouTube (with replaced with the topic you want to teach) to locate high-quality videos taught by subject experts to supplement your child’s curriculum.
Look for educational websites that offer printouts.While ink cartridges do cost money, you’ll save more money by printing a few pages each day than by investing in textbooks.

, Amazon.com, eBay, and other sites offer secondhand books at a fraction of their cover price. You could also check out book sales at your local library, which are usually scheduled once every three or four months.


Contact your library for more information about their books sales. You might also contact local churches about books sales, and check thrift stores.
Many libraries offer the opportunity to purchase used books year-round in a small library store.
Freecycle can help you locate books for free. Check their site at https://www.freecycle.org/ and search for a group near you.
Amazon also offers hundreds of free e-books.
You could also look into trading books with others – including audiobooks and textbooks -- on Paperback Swap.

Visit museums.Public museums are often free, or require only a small donation.,
Take your child to public parks.Public parks and wildlife sanctuaries provide many possibilities for learning.,
Look for community programs.Community programs encompass a wide variety of events and activities.,
Visit the zoo.Some zoos offer special programs aimed at homeschooled kids.",How to Save Money on Homeschooling Curriculum3," Often, only the newest temporary or traveling exhibits have a cost. Use museums to teach subjects like history, art history, and natural history.


You can easily break up a museum trip into several short trips based around certain subjects that you want your homeschooled child to focus on in their curriculum.
For instance, if your child is learning art history, you might schedule one field trip to the art museum to look at Renaissance art, another trip to examine Impressionist art, and another trip to look at modern art.
Find out if your museum offers tours, art classes, or other special events that could provide more material for your child’s curriculum.

, You could go to the park to learn about zoology, ecology, botany, evolution, and many other subjects. Before you go, decide what question or topic you want your child to learn about.


Keep your child focused on exploring the topic, but don’t squash their sense of exploration if they become interested in some other aspect of biology.
Take advantage of any nature center or learning space that the park offers. Many public parks have small exhibits
Contact the park to find out if they offer nature walks. Nature walks are organized by park officials to help the public learn more about

, They might include elementary astronomy lessons at your local planetarium or stargazing club. They might also include presentations about Shakespeare or another playwright at your local theatre. Libraries host many community events, as well. These events can help you educate your homeschooled child about religion, history, and science.


Look online for a community events calendar to find out what sorts of activities and programs you can enroll your child in.
Alternately, contact various community organizations directly to find out more about the programs they offer.

, These programs might consist of question-and-answer sessions with a trained biologist, dissections, or hands-on interaction with certain animals.


Even if your zoo doesn’t offer any special programs, you should still schedule time with your child at the zoo. Find ways to integrate a zoo trip into lessons about ecosystems, evolution, and biology.
Pack a lunch when you visit the zoo. The food on-site can be expensive.

Start socializing your children at a young age.,
Encourage after school activities.,
Require each child to earn service hours.,
Model behavior.,
Take school into the “real world.” Field trips into society can not only help you socialize your child but further his/her education through real life experiences.",How to Socialize Homeschoolers," Some of the strongest bonds begin at an early age. Provide numerous opportunities for your toddler or preschool aged child to meet other children and learn how to get along, share and have fun.


Preschool. Although you plan to homeschool your child, allowing him/her to meet other children in a semi-academic setting can help your child obtain some of the most basic social skills such as listening, sharing and playing.
Mom and tot group. If you prefer to be with your child, plenty of mom and tot type groups are available through numerous sources including churches, gyms or children’s play centers.
Organized sports. Even three-year-olds can join a team or take karate or a dance class. If your child seems to like roughhousing, try pee wee football or soccer. On the other hand, individual sports like dance or karate can also provide him/her with a creative outlet, while meeting other children.
The park. A beautiful day at the park can provide several opportunities for your child to meet other kids and play.;
, Continue the same activities you started in toddlerhood and mandate that each child must have at least one or two special after-school activities.


Select activities that allow your child to develop and grow. Consider a sport or activity that may help him/her obtain a possible scholarship to college or one that your child can build upon such as competitive dance, theater, gymnastics, karate, track or team sports. Also, theater and art courses at the local art studio or theater house can attend to your child’s creative edge.
Choose an activity that provides limitless possibilities. Select a school or league that will allow him/her to advance to a higher level and doesn’t end at a certain grade.
Consider joining a travel team. Some of the strongest bonds are formed between team members who travel together for sports or an activity. Numerous leagues offer travel teams that require the team to travel to different cities and possibly states every weekend. Also, Boy or Girl Scouts provide an unlimited amount of social and travel opportunities.

, Some states require that high school aged children earn service hours in order to graduate. Even if your state doesn’t require service hours, make a personal request that each child earns a certain number of hours performing community service such as assisting at an animal shelter, a retirement community or reading to children in the schools. Community service will teach your child how to be grateful for what he/she has and how to have empathy for others.


Check with your state to determine if your child must have service hours in order to graduate. In many cases, if your child needs hours he/she should begin during freshman year in order to have enough.
Set your own limits. If you don’t have a service hour requirement, balance academics and after school activities with service hour requirements so that your child does not become overloaded. Anywhere from 15 to 30 a year should be a sufficient amount.

, Children learn the majority of their social skills from how their parents interact with others. If you stay inside, away from others, your children may not consider being social an important aspect of growing up and living in modern society. Demonstrate how to be social and how to act.


Engage in your own set of activities. Start a book, garden or a wine club. Invite friends and their children over when you host an event to provide an opportunity for everyone to socialize. You could even host social hour for other home school families and children.
Use certain social situations as a teaching moment. If you were trying to buy groceries and someone rudely pushed past you, demonstrate the correct way to react by calmly reminding the other person that you were in line before him/her. When you get to the car, use the incident as a teaching moment to explain what your child should do if confronted with a similar situation.
Admit when you’ve been wrong or made a mistake. We all can’t be the most eloquent, model of ideal behavior. When you are wrong, admit it and let your children know that you may have made a bad choice in a certain social situation. Your child needs to know that you too are human.

, Consider spending the day at an art museum, the ballet or visit a courthouse.

Familiarize yourself with the educational requirements and laws in your state.,
Talk with other parents.,
Identify the approach you want to use.,
Read homeschooling information and resources.",How to Prepare to Homeschool Your Children1," Requirements and laws regarding home education vary widely from state to state. Therefore, it is important to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations that you will have to follow to educate your child at home. You can ask about these rules and regulations at a local public school in your area or visit your state's education department website and look for information on homeschooling. Some of the things that you might be required to do to comply with these rules and regulations include:Filing a notice of intent. This is a document that some states require you to file every year. It includes a description of your curriculum and information about your qualifications to home school your child. These qualifications may include special credentials or just a high school diploma.Registering with an umbrella school. Some states require that you register to home school your child through a local school. This may be a local public school or a private religious school if you plan to include religious materials, such as Bible stories, in the curriculum.
Submitting grades and/or an academic progress report every year. In some states, you are also required to submit your child’s grades and/or a report of your child’s academic progress. Check your state guidelines to determine if you will be required to do this.;
, Talking with other parents who homeschool their children can be an excellent way to find out how to get started. You can also ask questions and learn from what other parents have found to be helpful. Try joining an online homeschooling forum if you do not know anyone who homeschools. These forums can also be valuable sources of support if you run into a question or problem while homeschooling your child.
Some questions you might ask other parents include, ""What do I need to do to register my child for home education?"" ""What are some good resources for lesson plans?"" and ""How do you keep your kids on task during school hours?""

, There are many different approaches to homeschooling to choose from so take your time to read about each method and find out what method or combination of methods might work best for your child.Some methods that you might consider include:Classical Method. This approach includes an emphasis on rhetoric, grammar, dialectic, logic, and Greek and/or Latin language.
Charlotte Mason. This approach to home education emphasizes literature over academic readers as well as nature study, narration, dictation, and short lessons.
Delayed Academics. This approach allows the child to hold off on formal educational studies until the age of 8 or 10. Then, the child may choose what to study based on his or her interests and the parent would develop a curriculum based on those interests.
Unit Study Method. For this approach, you would need to select or design units that will teach your child about a concept or skill. The units usually build on one another and are taught in a sequence.
Unschooling. This method allows the child to study whatever peaks his or her interest with little to no intervention from the parent. The method trusts that the child will seek out knowledge about things that he or she is truly interested in.

, It is important to learn as much as possible about homeschooling your child before you get started. This will help to increase your knowledge and confidence so that you can design the best possible program for your child.


Try to read as many books and articles on homeschooling as possible before you begin planning how to educate your child.
Check out your local library. You can find a wealth of resources on homeschooling as well as materials to use for teaching by visiting your local library.

Express your concerns about the quality of public schools.Classes in public schools use standardized testing.,
Explain that public schools can’t provide individualized attention.,
Argue that you don’t need to be a teacher for your kids to learn.The parents of most homeschooled kids aren’t professional teachers.",How to Overcome Opposition to Homeschooling1," This manner of testing produces an education system in which the goal is often to get the kids to pass the test, rather than learn important skills and abilities.For instance, in U.S. high schools:


reading skills are ranked lower than those in 19 other nations
math skills are ranked lower than those in 29 other nationsscience skills are ranked lower than those in 26 other nationsIf someone is opposed to homeschooling, share with them the results of the 2009 study that demonstrated that homeschooled children are more successful than children educated in public schools.;
, If your child is very bright, teachers might struggle to provide them with a truly engaging education.Homeschooling your gifted child is a good choice to ensure that they are being challenged and taught at an appropriate level. At the other end of the scale, if your child does not learn quickly or has a learning disorder, you might also choose homeschooling in order to provide them with the extra attention and assistance they need.


The average number of kids in a public school class is about 23. Some classes have over 30 students. In a homeschooled environment, however, parents or tutors get to work with just one (or a small handful) of students.

, But because homeschooling is not structured in the same way regular classes are, the need for a regular teacher to lead lessons and explain instructions is less important. Most homeschooled students learn on their own using interactive self-guided lessons online or with DVDs and movies.


In a homeschooled environment, any day could be a field trip day. Explain to homeschooling skeptics that children can learn a great deal when visiting the zoo or history museum.
There are tons of homeschool teaching resources out there. Many companies produce educational materials – books, films, audio recordings -- across a range of subjects and grade levels. These resources make homeschooling easy."

Decide who will teach your child at home.,
Look into pre-packaged curriculum materials.,
Design your own curriculum.,
Use trial and error to find what works best for your child.",How to Prepare to Homeschool Your Children2," Many parents choose to homeschool, but not all parents provide the instruction. Other instructional options include online schools that meet through video conference, private tutors who will visit your home, or online tutors who will meet and correspond with your child on a regular basis.Think about your lifestyle and your willingness to teach your child to determine if you want to provide instruction or if you want to hire someone to instruct your child.
For example, if you work from home or take care of small children during the day, then it might be difficult or even impossible for you to provide instruction to one of your children as well.
Even if you are going to do most of the teaching, you might also consider having some special guests come and talk with your kids now and then. For example, you might invite a local farmer, religious leader, or member of local politics to come to your home and talk to your kids about their profession.

, Unless you have a background in education, the idea of planning curriculum can be daunting. However, there are many pre-packaged curriculum materials that you can purchase or find for free online. Look into different types of pre-packaged curriculum to see if they might work for your child.For example, if your child has a strong interest in geology and you want to encourage that interest, then you might seek out pre-packaged curriculum that includes several lessons on that subject.
The cost of pre-packaged curriculum varies. Some packages may include a full year of lessons and cost anywhere from $500 to $1,050.However, you can find free materials from sites like Edsitement, Khan Academy, and the Free Federal Teaching Resources website., If you have a background in education or you are knowledgeable about designing curriculum, then you may consider designing your child’s curriculum yourself. You can use online resources to help you determine what to include in a lesson plan or use textbooks to help guide what you teach your child.Try basing your lessons on pre-packaged lesson plans to help you get the hang of designing curriculum. For example, you might use a pre-packaged math lesson on subtraction to help you design a lesson that focuses on a multiplication.
You can also combine pre-packaged lesson plans with lessons that you design yourself. For example, you might use 50% pre-packaged plans and 50% plans that you designed on your own.

, You may already have a good idea about how your child learns and what works best for your child. Maybe he or she is a visual learner and needs to see pictures and videos to understand something. Or perhaps your child has a kinesthetic learning style and he or she has to have a hands on experience with a concept to grasp it. Just keep in mind that what works for someone else’s child may not work for your child. Be open and willing to change the program if something is not working for your child.For example, you might have a friend whose child really loves a specific type of lesson plan or activity, but your child might not respond in the same way. Keep careful notes on what works and what does not work for your child.

Keep your family’s regular routine in mind.,
Determine when school will begin and end.,
Schedule tasks in 15 minute blocks.,
Include meal and break times on the schedule.,
Put the schedule somewhere visible.",How to Prepare to Homeschool Your Children3," It is important to make sure that you child’s school routine will mesh well with your family’s normal daily routine. Before you set up a daily school routine for your child, think about what your normal daily routine already looks like.


Examine your normal daily routine to figure out how much time you have available to homeschool your children. Then, work within this amount of time.For example, if you find that you have four hours of time free each day, then this is the amount of time that you will have to homeschool your children.
It is also a good idea to maintain your regular daily tasks in your schedule to help structure your days, such as getting dressed in the morning, running errands on a specific day, or preparing meals at a certain time.

, Setting a time boundary is important when you are homeschooling because this will help to prevent you from working too long or starting too late. Try to set a daily start time and identify the days of the week that will be “school” days.


For example, you might decide to start school at 9am every day and end school at 3pm every day.
Make sure that you make your kids aware of these start and end times, such as by posting them somewhere visible.

, It can be hard for kids to focus on one task for too long, so you might want to schedule tasks in 15 minute blocks. If your child ends up needing less time to complete a task, then that is fine. Just try to avoid scheduling tasks that might take more than 15 minutes to complete. For example, you might schedule a short reading or a worksheet for one 15 minute block. However, scheduling an entire book chapter, or a packet of worksheets would be too much for 15 minutes.

, Including meal and break times on the schedule is also important to maintain structure in your child’s environment. Make sure that you include snack times, meal times, and other important breaks on the schedule.For example, you might schedule in a snack from 10 to 10:15am and then schedule lunch for 12:30 to 1:30pm.

, To ensure that your kids can always find out what tasks they should be working on at a given time, post the schedule somewhere that is easy for them to access, such as on the kitchen table or on the refrigerator.


You might even want to take a few minutes each day to review the schedule with your kids and make sure that they know what tasks they will be working on and when they will be working on those tasks.

Demonstrate that kids can have social lives even while homeschooled.One of the primary myths about homeschooled kids is that they are weird social outcasts who cannot function with other people because they haven’t had a school experience with their peers.,
Show that homeschooling is not a form of parental indoctrination.,
Show that homeschooled kids are happier than other students.If a homeschooled student doesn’t like a particular subject, they can express it to their tutor or parent.,
Explain that homeschooling doesn’t need to be absolute.Homeschooled kids have the option of attending certain classes at their local public schools.,
Argue that homeschooled kids can be themselves.In a public school surrounded by their peers, students tend to feel the need to look and act a certain way.",How to Overcome Opposition to Homeschooling2," However, there are plenty of opportunities for socialization outside of school. Share information about how homeschooled kids can:


form friendships with the other children in their neighborhood
join community sports teams
get jobs and make friends that way (when they are of age)
join a homeschooled students’ organization to meet up and socialize with other homeschooled studentsparticipate in extracurricular activities at public schools, including sports teams, debate clubs, chess clubs, and so on.

, Some people believe that homeschooling is only or typically used by parents who are overly controlling and want to “brainwash” their kids.However, you could argue that enrolling children in public school does not guarantee they will not be “indoctrinated” by their parents during the hours when they are not in school. Remind your opposition that parents who insist on restricting their children’s exposure to the real world in some way often send their children to private schools that line up with their worldview and values.


Even when they send their kids to public schools, parents are often extremely selective. In Washington, D.C., for instance, whites comprise 40% of the population, but only 5% of all public school students are white., If the tutor or parent sees the child’s point of view, they might choose to adjust the curriculum. Alternately, if a child is really interested in a particular topic, they might be able to get their parents to introduce more information about that topic into their education. Explain that this flexibility makes homeschooled students happier and more productive.

, Many kids go to public school for an hour or two each day, then get the rest of their schooling at home. Classes which might best be learned in an environment with other students – like art, music, and drama – are available. Encourage homeschooling skeptics to talk to their local public schools about such arrangements for more information.

, Schoolchildren are susceptible to direct and indirect pressure at school. This pressure might inspire them to engage in risky behavior like drugs, drinking, or sex. It might make them want to buy certain expensive items of clothing or jewelry. Homeschool skeptics will be interested to know that in a homeschooled environment, students are free of these pressures and can more easily express who they truly are.

"
"
Explain how homeschooling helps build strong families.Kids who are homeschooled tend to have parents who stay more closely involved in their lives.,
Explore how homeschooling improves community involvement.Since homeschooling requires less time out of a student’s day than regular education, the students have extra time they can (and do) use to give back to their communities.Homeschooled kids use the extra time in their days to volunteer at soup kitchens, recycling centers, and other community service projects.,
Point out that homeschooling saves money.In private schools (and increasingly, in public schools), school uniforms – which cost $150 -$300 – can be an excessive cost on parents.",How to Overcome Opposition to Homeschooling3," When parents have more direct interactions with their kids, the relationship between homeschooled kids and their parents can continue to grow and develop in a healthy way. Homeschooled kids and their parents report fewer problems even into the teen years, when most kids grow away from their parents and their relationship becomes more combative.

, Use this evidence to demonstrate that if more kids were homeschooled, we could have stronger communities.


Homeschooled children, when grown, are employed in political campaigns at higher rates than the general population.
When they reach voting age, 95% of adults who were homeschooled vote. Among the general population, however, just over 50% of Americans vote.

, You can also explain to your opposition that the more students are in the public school system, the higher the financial burden on the state.


Each school year, about $8,300 is allocated per student. In some districts, costs reach $25,000 per student. Homeschooled students, by contrast, require just $546 from the state per school year.
If someone argues that “Only rich people with lots of free time can homeschool their kids,” you might point out their error by reminding them that homeschooling actually requires less time than does traditional schooling for both parents (who don’t have to drive their kids to and from school, review teacher feedback, attend parent-teacher conferences, or fill out permission slips) and students (who often spend most of their education studying independently, and may spend as little as one hour each day with an actual instructor).You could go on to explain that homeschooling can easily be done on a budget, and parents of homeschooled kids can have fulfilling careers working from home as artists, writers, and web developers.

3 - 6 year olds will be learning their alphabet, numbers and writing skills.,
Pick a brand of pencils, rubbers, rulers etc for your child(ren).,
Visit the local primary school - they will give you good websites to print things from, maybe give you old textbooks, and give you advice.

,
Make a room in your house suitable for teaching them.",How to Prepare to Home School a Tween1," Writing for a long period of time will make their little hands ache. You will not need much for a child between these ages.;
, Smaller pencils, hard wearing rubbers and slightly shorter rulers are good.

,,

Put up bright, attractive posters with good mottos on up on the walls (eg Learning is fun with a kid reading a joke book, or 'Reading is Useful' with a toilet door with 'Pull' written on it, and someone trying really hand to push it open)






Write out the alphabet in bright letters and stick them on the walls, along with numbers 1 - 25, as a reminder for your child.






Buy a cheap blackboard, and a lot of white, blue and green chalk. If you write in green and blue a child may be more attracted to try to read it.






Buy lots of paper, paint, pens and coloured pencils for 'art' lessons, along with a good stack of newspaper to protect the tables.






Consider discipline. Are you in a state where they paddle the kids at school? Do you believe in paddling? Do you live in England where corner times are a traditional punishment for naughty 3 - 6 year old children? Do you believe in smacking but you live in England where schools don't do it? Now you can decide how to punish your children when they are naughty in school!






Buy plenty of lined and plain exercise books from your local stationary shop.







"
"
Buy all equipment listed above, and some writing pens, and some squared paper books.

,
Sort out a room to teach them in.,
Consider discipline.,
Buy a years membership to the local pool to give your child swimming lessons - if they don't know how to.

,
If your child is 11, find test papers online suited for an eleven year old (previous years 'SAT's' papers are a good choice).

",How to Prepare to Home School a Tween2,", It will need:

To be bigger than a 3 - 6 year old's teaching room.






To be less bright and colourful - it will distract an older child a lot more.






To have a higher desk and seat.






To have a computer for 'I.T' lessons.







, As an older child, they may be able to withstand a proper spanking, rather than the odd smack, or a grounding rather than corner time, or a smack rather than a scolding. Decide. Most schools in paddling states won't use a traditional wooden 'paddle' until your child is 8.

,,"
"
Smacking, or spanking with an implement, or bare - bottomed, or even just smacking may be illegal in your area, so look it up first!

,
Don't be afraid to ask the local primary school for help in finding resources.

Look for established groups.,
Consider starting a group.,
Plan an activity.,
Find a location.,
Advertise your group or activity.,
Keep a regular schedule.",How to Plan Social Activities for Your Homeschooled Child," There are likely many different homeschool groups for a variety of activities and ages in your area. They may meet once or twice a month - or even more often - for games, physical activities, music or drama clubs, field trips, or crafts.;
, If you don't find any for the age range or activities that interest your child, start your own! Would your children enjoy a reading club? Chess? Swimming? Ice skating? Gardening? Singing in a choir? Hiking? Volunteer work? The possibilities are limited only by your imagination. Likely other families would also be interested but haven't taken the initiative to do it themselves.

, Plan something that is age appropriate for all in the group, such as mini golf, a trip to a museum, the movies, a get-together art class, basketball game, or simply pizza and kickball.

, You can look to churches, community centers, parks, libraries, or even businesses for rooms to fit your group's needs. Some may charge a fee, but others will be happy to let you use their facilities for a donation or service hours - or even at no charge!

, Contact other homeschool parents through local organizations. Advertise on homeschool forums, newsletters, websites, or in the newspaper.

, Plan events to fit your schedule, and make it a regular occasion - such as every third Saturday or the first Wednesday of each month.

Get involved in activities.,
Meet other homeschoolers.,
Learn with other people.,
Keep in touch with old friends.,
Develop independence.,
Be friendly, but be smart.",How to Make Friends While Homeschooled1," Go out and do what you love to do, and you'll meet people with similar interests. Youth groups, 4-H, summer camps, volunteer centers, churches, and community centers are all good places to start. If you're already passionate about sports, music, acting, or other extracurricular activities, make an effort to talk to the people you meet in those contexts.


Most schools allow local homeschoolers to join after-school activities.;
, Most homeschoolers have a flexible schedule compared to a regular school day. If you're bored while your other friends are at school, find other homeschoolers so you can visit them during the day.


If you don't know any other homeschoolers, search online for homeschooling groups and co-ops in your area. Your local librarians may be able to help you find them as well.

, Homeschooling families often meet for group classes once in a while. This lets each parent teach the subject he's good at, and lets the students help each other on their work. Group field trips are another great way to meet people during ""school"" time.


If you can't find a homeschooling group, look at public schools, churches, and community centers. Some of these offer classes that anyone can join.

, If you used to be in a regular school, you might have friends from that time. Don't let good friendships fall apart just because you don't see each other every day. You can still spend time together on the weekends, and talk to each other on the phone.

, If you feel like you aren't getting enough socializing time, have a conversation with your parents to see if you can figure out a solution. If you are responsible and old enough, they may give you more freedom to leave the house on your own. Teenagers especially should consider the following:


A driver's license or bicycle gives you the ability to go out on your own schedule.
Getting a part-time job can lead to new friends among your co-workers. It also shows your parents that you are ready for independence.

, Homeschoolers often meet people with a wide range of ages and backgrounds. Ask your parents if it's okay to talk to the strangers you meet at different activities. Their answer will depend on your age and the community you live in. Follow your parents' rules, and remember not to give out your personal information (such as your last name, address, or telephone number) to someone you just met.

"
"
Stay safe.,
Join communities that share your interests.,
Create your own content.",How to Make Friends While Homeschooled2," The internet is a great tool for socializing, but it can be dangerous as well. To avoid predators and scams, follow these rules whenever you talk to people online:


Never use your real name with strangers. If a website requires your real name, you should only use that site to talk to friends you know in real life.
Never tell anyone the name of the town you live in, your phone number, or other personal information.
Avoid unmonitored chat rooms, dating apps, and apps that put you in contact with random users.
Do not reply to suspicious emails.
Follow any rules your parents set about internet use.

, There are online forums and social media sites for just about every topic. These are great places to connect with people who enjoy talking about the same things you do. If you find a site about your sport or hobby, ask its members for advice on how to improve or learn more.

, You can start your own blog, make your own crafts to sell on Etsy, or (if your parents don't mind) make your own videos. Maybe you can earn class credit for one of these projects — or keep it as something you do for fun.

If your child is too little to take an active part in the decision, chart out a few hours of the day for the various activities, and stick to it.,
If your child is old enough, consult him and find out when he wants to learn.,
Homework is also a part of homeschooling.,
At homeschool, the child should be taught the importance of speaking and behaving in a proper manner and appropriate corrections need to be meted out if behaviour is unsatisfactory.

,
Consider keeping aside a particular room or a part of the room for your homeschool.,
Homeschooling is doomed to fail without patience.,
When this happens, switch to something new.",How to Maintain Discipline in Homeschooling," When there is no outside agency to supervise and no exams to answer, it is easy to get sidetracked.;
, Apply your parental discretion and come up with a timetable.

, What this means is that once lessons have been taught, the child should be asked to do some part of the course work by himself without your guidance. You will need to make sure that your child sits willingly and finishes his or her work.

,, The child should be expected to reach his desk at the appointed time, in proper attire with all the necessary material. It is easy to allow the school to become an extension of play if these ground rules are not laid out and followed. As the teacher, supervisor, principal and janitor rolled into one, you should also approach the study area with a cool professionalism.

, In spite of all the precautions and steps one takes, it is easy for a child to get familiar at homeschool. At such times, it may be difficult to discipline the child and get him to listen to you attentively.

, Allow the child to take a breather and enjoy a break yourself.

Make up for lost time.",How to Make a Homeschool Schedule," In the United States, different states have different laws for homeschooling. Some states such as Texas, Alaska, and Michigan have little or no requirements regarding structure and progress. Other states such as Massachusetts and New York have much stricter requirements. First look at these laws so you can determine how much freedom you have and what standards you need to meet.Homeschooling is legal in the United States, but it is not in every country. Check the laws in your country to find out if you can homeschool your children and the laws you need to follow to create a homeschool schedule.;
, Start by creating your yearly goals. Determine the subjects you want to cover and what aspects of them you want to get through before the end of the year. You might want to cover a little bit of each subject throughout the year or focus heavily on one particular subject this year and another subject the next year.Breakdown your yearly goals into monthly, weekly, and daily goals to determine how you are going to achieve your overall plan.
Create goals such as, “learn about the Civil War"" and ""learn long division.”

, Make sure your goals are realistic and attainable. Don’t expect to be able to teach your children everything about a subject in just a year. Be optimistic but also realistic about your goals. Don’t have vague goals such as getting though a textbook. Make the goals specific.


For example: “learn the multiplication tables,"" ""master cursive,"" and ""learn the water cycle."", As the teacher and parent, it is important to set goals for yourself too, not just your children. When you create goals for your children also create goals for what you want to accomplish to improve your teaching.


For example, if last year it was difficult for you not to get impatient about redundant questions, make a goal to overcome this and be more patient with your children.
Think of any improvements you want to make not only as a teacher but also as a parent., You might have big goals for your child, but they might not feel the same way. Are you going to be stern with your child about sticking to goals or are you going to give them freedom in deciding what they want to learn? Consider making your goals checklist with your child to find a good balance.Ask your child what they want to learn for the year, give them options, or ask about their interests so they have a say in the curriculum.

, Look online for lesson planning resources, schedule makers, and homeschool progress tracking systems. You can use these resources to create your schedule or to get ideas for your own homeschool plan., Talk to other parents homeschooling their children for advice, support, and guidance. You can get ideas from other parents and have people to talk to about the experiences you have as a homeschool parent. If you don’t know anyone who homeschools their kids, you can look for homeschool support groups in your area online., Your family’s particular circumstances and structure will probably impact your homeschool schedule. You can schedule when you teach your children based on when your children learn best, when you are able to teach, and when you don’t have other commitments.Take your children’s strengths, needs, and personality into consideration when making your schedule. You might need to make different schedules for each of your children.

, You can have a set time each day for school or you can have school blended in throughout the day. Some parents might want every detail of school to be organized. If this is the case, a set time each day will be helpful. Determine how many days a week you want to have school, then set the times each day that work for you.


If you work best with a flexible and unstructured schedule, you might not need to determine daily hours for school.Check your state requirements to see how many “classroom” hours your children need to have.

, Homeschooling allows you to do the system that you want to do. This could mean that instead of the usual “nine months on then three months off” system, that you homeschool your kids all 12 months out of the year. You can do this by teaching for six weeks then taking one week off or by simply having less in school time each day or each week. This helps take away stress and can stop you from cramming too much into each day., Routine can be great, but don’t be afraid to mix up your schedule. The great thing about homeschooling is that you can teach by doing something out of the box. Break up the traditional in class learning by going on nature walks, going to museums, growing vegetables in the garden, playing games, or working on projects. You can do this sporadically or make a set day of the week, such as Friday, to use as a fun day., Before you make a schedule, create a checklist of tasks you want to complete each day. You might find that you don’t actually need a strict schedule for your particular situation and just want to use the checklist for your daily progress. You can use this checklist to keep your kids on track each day.For example: “learn about President Truman,"" ""memorize the multiplications of 3,"" ""learn the parts of the cell.”

, If you need a strict schedule you can plan out what and when you want to accomplish your daily tasks. You can use a large calendar or poster board so everyone can see the daily schedule, a planner if you want the schedule just for yourself, or technology (such as Google Calendar) to structure each day.


Your schedule does not have to be only about schoolwork. You can also schedule chores and errands into the day.

, In the morning, take some time to yourself to have a cup of coffee, go on a walk, or lay in your bed to gather your thoughts. Look at your daily tasks and think about how you want to accomplish them. Giving yourself this time each day to prepare and think will help you stay more motivated to stick to your schedule., Copy down the daily tasks onto a poster board, white board, or chalk board so everyone can see what the daily goals are. Have your children check off each task as it is completed to encourage them to stay motivated too. If they see what they need to do each day, they will be more inclined to get it done.For example, once you finish teaching your children the different bones in the body, have them check it off the daily task list.

, Although you might not be the type of person to have a strict schedule, still try to keep things fairly consistent. If one day you are having school in the morning then they next day it is in the evening, this might confuse your kids and make them less likely to be motivated to learn. Consistency will also help your children be more disciplined, which will help them in the long run., Once you make a schedule, you might realize you can’t always stick to it. Commitments change and situations come up. You might have to adjust your schedule as time progresses and life happens. Try to stick to your schedule, but don’t be afraid to rewrite it, change your goals, or start completely over part way through the year., Although flexibility is important, be firm about your schedule too. When it is school time, make it be only school time. Don’t make appointments, take phone calls, or have guests over during school time. Treat it as if you were at a public or private school, not at your home.For example, don’t schedule a doctor’s appointment right in the middle of “classroom time” and mess up your schedule.

, Sometimes things come up that can mess up your schedule such as illness or unexpected commitments. When this happens you can make up for lost time by having school for more hours or on weekends until you catch up. You can also extend the length of the school year a few extra days into summer.

Think about your learning preferences, level of motivation, and decide what would work best for you. Read Grace Llewellyn's Teenage Liberation Handbook. It should awaken the autodidactic spirit in you.;
, Your region may require as little as a notice of intent or as much as quarterly reports and annual assessment. Find out exactly what is required of you and decide whether or not you're still up to it.

, They will need to help you set up your homeschool legally. It's also important for them to understand what you'll be doing and why you want to self-school.

, Take into account that there may be mandatory subjects by law in your region or things you have to study for college admissions. Once you have those bases covered you are free to add the subjects of your liking, from vegetable gardening, to meditation, history of art, European royalty, Asian studies, all sorts of languages, the sky is the limit! If you find that your interests aren't compatible with homeschool, think again! How abut you brush up on the history of videogames? Or learn to write in goth calligraphy?

, For math, borrow or purchase a used textbook, and work through the problems. For English, write stories and essays on topics that interest you. Go to the library and check out some books. Even if you hated the classics in school, try to read them on your own. Often you only thought you hated them because you were frustrated with school. Use the library and the internet as much as possible because they are wonderful resources. Look at Cafi Cohen's Homeschooling: The Teen Years for ideas.

Record keeping is important not only for the sake of regulations.",How to Keep Accurate Homeschooling Records1," It is also an exciting way to record and document the learning process of the child. When most of the learning is done through play and there is no clear cut index of topics that have to be covered, it is necessary for the parent to keep some sort of a log which records the child's progress.The records you keep can be as simple as a daily journal, or as elaborate as a software program. If you participate in a support group, you probably have set forms and requirements. But even so, keeping track of daily work makes reporting easy and efficient. There are various record keeping methods used by various home schools. You may wish to explore some of the categories below:

"
"
Make sure homeschooling is the right choice for you and your family.,
Get your curriculum before taking the child out of school.,
Plan your schedule.,
Do not let your kid be un-socialised.,
Make the lessons fun.,
Watch DVDs or something educational.,
Know the laws.,
Be there when your child needs help.",How to Make Homeschool Fun for Your Children," There are many reasons why children may want to be homeschooled. For instance, parents may homeschool children due to bullying at school, and for religious reasons (you may feel that the school is not giving your child a proper education).


In the UK, you only have to write a letter to the headteacher explaining why you are going to take your children out of the school. If you are not in the UK, investigate the different laws/rules to take your children out of the school that they are attending.;
, There are many different ways of homeschooling your child. One of the most popular choices is online/virtual school. This is a way that is free in the USA, but unfortunately not in the UK, as there are private online schools that are quite expensive.

Another popular option is to order a pre-packed curriculum that includes worksheets to mark. These are not as expensive as online private schools, but if you are looking for one pack per subject, they normally cost between 150-300 pounds.
Consider buying different types of textbooks that cover each subject you choose to study online or from shops. This is one of the best, and quite cheap, ways of home educating. You can get good textbooks, that, for example will tell you how to solve a math problem in detail, whereas others just give the questions.







, If you choose to do virtual school, the school will give you times to be on the website and probably the duration of time that you should be using the website. However, if you decide to learn from textbooks, then you can choose what you want to learn for that day and how long you would like to do it for.

The average person wants to study about two to three hours a day. You do not need to do it for six hours, like an average school day, as much of the time is wasted in schools, particularly with lunch and recess. You should study at least two subjects per day, but it is advisable not to study more than four subjects per day.







, Children should be part of at least two clubs, in order to make new friends or stay in contact with old ones. There are also home school co-ops; they are in loads of areas, can help each other and swap textbooks. Your child will make plenty of new friends at the meetings!

, To make the lessons fun, it is best to know if you are learning something interesting in history or science. You can always go on field trips after you have finished the subject. Places may include the museum, the zoo, or an aquarium.

, This will always help with a child's education and will keep them more involved in the work.


Go beyond a textbook; this will make homeschool more engaging for children. For music lessons, you can have the children join a music class, or you can buy an instrument and teach different techniques through YouTube videos and teach that way! For P.E, you can have the children go roller/ice skating or swimming; these are all fun ways to get exercise. Also, you can join a sports team or go to tennis, ice skating, football classes. This is a fun way to make new friends!

, In some states or countries, you need to keep a portfolio of all the work you or your child has been doing. It is good to keep one, as you can show this to a college or university as proof of what you have been learning, when your children are ready for college.

, It is quite difficult for children to homeschool themselves, and it requires much dedication and commitment in order to get a good education.

Prepare the daily planner by recording events.",How to Keep Accurate Homeschooling Records2," This can be maintained by the teacher or the student. This basically aims to keep a log of what was learned and what was done.Recording memorable events that happened in the course of the year is a great way to reminisce later on.;
"
"
Write down assignments.",How to Keep Accurate Homeschooling Records3," Lay out the plans and the assignments for the week in a teacher's planning notebook. Check each item as it is covered. Maintain a separate area where any additional things can be recorded. This includes educational trips, visits and videos etc. Any extra topics that were covered are also recorded in this area. Make a summary every quarter.

"
"
Collect various study materials.,
Purchase a record-keeping system, if desired.",How to Keep Accurate Homeschooling Records4," This consists of a collection of varied materials that show what the child has achieved and done during the course of study. Portfolio assessment is a very effective way to chart the child's progress. It gives structure to the otherwise loose and flexible form of schooling called homeschooling.


A drawing portfolio will consist of some paintings or sketches that are considered the best in that quarter.
A language portfolio may consist of essays, stories, reading-logs, spelling samples or letters. Progress in mathematics, fine arts, history, science and social studies can all be recorded this way. The biggest advantage is that portfolio assessment places control in the hands of the children.
Record tangible milestones. Having a tangible record of what they have established encourages children on to greater heights.

, Other than the above-mentioned systems, there are also purchased record-keeping systems that lay out a good checklist. Some of these allow one to personalize the organizer. Irrespective of the methods used, record keeping in one form or the other is essential. Your child's future may well depend on the well-maintained record that you have meticulously kept over the years.


Many of these journals, portfolios, charts and assessment-records are freely available on the internet. Alternatively you may wish to design your own which will fit perfectly with your subjects, studying programme, and curricula.

Prioritize.,
Develop a good routine.,
Integrate life and school.,
Integrate multiple subject areas.,
Expect and train your younger children (toddlers and preschoolers) to occupy themselves with a single activity for at least 20-30 minutes during school time.,
Meet the unique needs of your little ones.","How to Homeschool With Infants, Toddlers, or Preschoolers"," Make sure to put first things first. Priorities will be different for each family, and different tasks have to be juggled on different days, with varying levels of importance--so this is a very fluid process. Our priorities: faith, family relationships, discipleship of our children, academic learning, and home management. Not everything needs to be done perfectly every day. The idea is that in the long-haul all your goals will be met. Remember that when you home school, it's 24/7/365, not from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Monday through Friday, 180 days a year. Some days it seems that we have to emphasize character-building issues and it may be a temporary frustration not to do so much ""schooling,"" but we catch up quite easily on other days. It's a balance--so set your priorities and keep them in some kind of order, day by day.;
, ""Schedule,"" maybe--if it works and doesn't become a hard taskmaster for you. Routine, DEFINITELY. Everything goes much smoother if everyone knows what to ""generally"" expect in the course of each day. Make time for spiritual time such as prayer and meditation if this is a priority for you. Fit in chores, school time, free time for the children, some family time, extracurricular activities (well-considered), and whatever else is on your priority list.

, As much as possible, consider how multiple objectives can be met concurrently. Some of the things that need ""doing"": taking care of the baby, keeping the young ones occupied during school time, schooling the older kids, character training, home management and perhaps ministry or service within the community. And of course, it's important to always enjoy just being a family! Some examples of integration: let one of your older children spend some time rocking the baby while they listen to a teaching tape or watch an educational video. Have a daily 30-minute chore time (or two, 30-minute chore times) during which everyone helps in some aspect of home management or food preparation. At the same time, do math drills out loud, Mom can read aloud to the kids while they work, or verbally review what the children have learned in their lessons during the morning or the day before. Let the little ones use the math manipulatives that the older kids are using or scribble on paper while the big kids do their writing. It may be a bit distracting, but it keeps the family unified and lets the little ones feel included--thus, they are often less disruptive.

, Think about how you can kill many birds with one stone in academic learning by doing a Unit Study on a topic of interest. Use your science or history textbook as a springboard for theme-related ideas that you can flesh out with different activities. A quick search online will usually result in many great ideas, no matter what topic you want to cover. One example: One science topic on our list of objectives was to study the human body systems. We read a library book on body systems (SCIENCE), then (for LANGUAGE ARTS), we reviewed how to use a dictionary. The younger children used a simple kids' dictionary and the older used a standard dictionary. Each child looked up different words related to the topic. (For example, the first grader looked up things like ""brain,"" ""stomach,"" and ""lungs,"" while the third grader defined things like ""system,"" ""organ,"" and so on.) They wrote words and definitions, then a short summary of what we had read. To integrate MATH, we compared the interrelated body systems to the interrelation of different mathematical operations (i.e., addition as the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication and division as inverse operations). Integrating social studies in this case was a bit challenging so we simply did some book work at a later time. Integration is great, but it doesn't have to be all-or-none. You can purchase many unit study materials, but a little creativity and an Internet connection sometimes suffices just as well. Also consider how the arts and different subject areas can be integrated just through journaling and ""living books,"" as in the Charlotte Mason approach.

, Activities in a bag or box are good for this (many ideas online, free or for purchase). Help them enjoy reading by giving them quality picture books and simple stories for an independent ""reading time.""

, Balance quiet times with more physical activities. Keep them well-hydrated and offer small, healthy, mid-morning snacks. Fill them up with some ""Mommy time"" before their more independent play period. Finally, don't expect them to tend to a task or activity for much more than 20-30 minutes.

Make sure online learning fits your learning style.,
Be realistic about your computer skills and computer access.,
Carefully select a college or university or virtual high school.,
You may discover many community colleges have gone into Internet learning in a big way...but be aware of tuition and fees.,
Expect to work and participate.,
Set realistic expectations for online courses.",How to Take Online Distance Education Classes," Online classes typically involve lots of reading and writing. If you don’t learn as well from reading or dislike writing, you’ll have a more difficult time learning online. Everything ""said"" in the online classroom is written in the form of messages. An advantage of this is that it eliminates note-taking. Every word is captured in an online classroom and can usually be referred to throughout the quarter to help on tests, papers and projects.;
, In most online classrooms you’ll be expected to use standard Internet tools such as a Web browser and email, and may be required to download and install additional software on your computer. You may need regular (often daily) reliable access to a computer and the Internet. You’ll need basic computer skills, to be able to save, rename and manage files and copy and paste text.

, Make sure the program is accredited or recommended by your school counselor and that the degrees, certificates or classes offered meet your educational goals. Look for a mature online program with a rich variety of courses leading to complete degrees or certificates. Make sure the school provides educational value that satisfies your financial requirements. Spend time going through the Web site to find out what other services are available online. This is important for students who may rarely (or never!) set foot on campus. Look for online technical support and advising, financial aid, registration and an online bookstore and library.

, Community colleges may charge higher fees for ""out of district"" students. There are some (for instance, Oakton Community College in Des Plaines, IL) which do not discriminate between ""in district"" and ""out of district"" students on Internet courses. ""Out of District"" students are charged the same as ""In District"" students. This could be a large saving for many seeking to take several Internet-based classes from an accredited institution.

, Online classes typically require the same amount of work and interaction as a traditional college course. Plan to spend 5 to 12 hours each week on the class depending on the difficulty and your abilities. Good online courses create active virtual classrooms and students are expected to participate in weekly discussions and assignments and online group activities. Many classes expect you to be able to check email and log into the classroom a number of times each week.

, Schedule time for personal emergencies and computer problems. Notify your instructor as soon as you realize you have a problem that may result in you missing the deadline for an assignment or test.

Get the facts.,
Enroll.,
Get a head start.,
Buy a school computer.,
Meet other students.,
Remember that online public schooling means you have to participate in state testing.,
Don't be afraid to ask for help.",How to Transfer to an Online Public School," You need to do your research before you enroll; otherwise, you could end up at a school that isn't well-suited for you. Is this school successful overall? What do people in your area think of it? Is it even available in your state? Figure out what school you think is best for you before you go.;
, Once you've found the school that you think will be best for you, start enrolling. This is often a long process, involving the parent and the student. While the entire procedure starts online, you'll also need to fax in certain things to the school, depending on your state and which school it is. It may take a short while to get everything sent in as needed, but in 1-3 weeks, you should be signed up.


If this process is taking over a month, you probably need to switch to a different school. This is abnormally long, and you'll just end up getting yourself annoyed as it takes longer and longer.

, Once you've successfully enrolled, there may be a few other things you'll need to do, such as getting your supplies (if you need any), sending in some more information, and completing various tutorials.

, Online school is very time-consuming, and if you're constantly taking up space on your house's computer, it can make things tough for others. Get a laptop so that you can do your school without taking up others' space.

, One of the toughest parts of moving from brick-and-mortar school to online school is making friends in an unfamiliar way. So do whatever you can to connect with your classmates! Social activities vary from school to school, but you're guaranteed to make some friends as long as you make an effort to connect.

, Because the school is public, you'll be required by law to take it, so be prepared!

, Just like teachers in a brick-and-mortar school, your online instructors are there to help you. Keep in touch over the phone or through your school's messaging system so you can get better in school.

Choose a study space with reliable internet access.,
Set a time to log onto your class each day.,
Make a calendar to follow.,
Strive to stick to your schedule.,
Print out any materials you can.,
Take notes on online lectures.,
Write out difficult material.,
Read difficult information out loud.,
Have goals for each study session.,
Quiz and test yourself.,
Take breaks.,
Reach out to instructors with questions.",How to Study for an Online Class," You will probably need to refer to online lectures and notes when you study. Therefore, you will need a study space where your internet access will not be interrupted. Internet access will be particularly important during things like study sessions for your class.You can study at home, if you know you won't distract yourself. Many people, however, have difficulty concentrating when they try to study at home. This is one of the challenges of online courses.
A place like an internet cafe usually has reliable internet access, as well as some coffee shops and restaurants. Just make sure workers won't mind you hanging around these places for long hours while you study.
You can also try a library.;
, Maintaining a strict schedule is vital to success in an online course. Even though you may not be required to attend classes or lectures at particular times, you still need to keep up with the course material on your own time. Therefore, self-discipline is important. Set a time each week to log onto the class and study materials.You may have some regular lecture times you need to attend. However, you should also make time on your own end for review. This is especially important if you're required to review some of the course material on your own.
To make an online class feel as vigorous as an in-person course, choose the same times and days to log in each week. Set a specific timeframe for how long you'll read and review materials. You can, for example, log in from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to study.

, Oftentimes, deadlines won't be as obvious in an online course. As you won't be attending lectures every day, where you'll be reminded of due dates, making a calendar for your own reference is important.You can make a physical calendar for yourself if you study at home. Write down things like the dates papers are due and the dates of tests and quizzes. This will help let you know when you need to start committing to reviewing materials.
You can also make a calendar on your phone or laptop. This may be more helpful if you don't study at home, as you'll be able to refer to it while you're out studying.

, It can be hard to stick to a schedule for an online course. This is especially true if you're allowed to do things like watch lectures on your own time. However, be strict with yourself about adhering to your schedule. Self-discipline is vital to your success in an online course.Remember, just because you don't go to the course in person does not mean it is not costing you money or that it does not affect your overall GPA. Make sure to treat an online course as seriously as you would treat a course you attend in person.

, Sometimes, a computer can be a distraction. It can be helpful to turn your laptop off at times to study. In addition to helping you study away from your computer, you can highlight printed out materials and also make notes in the margins.You should also print out things like a course schedule and syllabus. It's good to have a physical copy of these materials to refer to throughout the course.

, You should take notes online as rigorously as you would during a physical lecture. Sit with a pen and paper and take careful, legible notes in front of your computer. You can also type up your notes in a word document.Use headings and dates to keep track of what materials are covered in each section of your notes. You can refer to these headings later when studying.Do not try to record every single detail an instructor said. Instead, jot down the general idea and any insights that help you better understand the material. Later, when you're studying, you can refer to your notes to remember the major ideas of the course.
Even if you can re-watch lectures, taking notes is still helpful. It helps better remember the material later and you can also write down key material. If you need to, say, remember a date, you can refer to your notes instead of searching the video for the specific moment when this date was mentioned.

, If something is really difficult to understand, try writing it down. You can also try writing and re-writing anything you have to memorize. This can be a helpful technique for studying for any course, including an online one.You can recopy your notes onto a new sheet of paper.
You can also write down vocabulary words, dates, names of important figures, and other information you need to memorize.

, If you're really struggling to understand something, reading it out loud can help. You will both see and hear the material, helping you better commit it to memory. If a lot of your online course material is text, this can be very helpful. If you have written lectures, for example, you won't hear them read out loud by an instructor. It can help to read them out loud yourself.You can also try summarizing the material from memory out loud. You can, for example, pretend you're explaining a concept to another student.

, Never go into a study session undirected. Have specific goals each time you sit down to study. You can break the material up into chunks and study one chunk at a time. Make a schedule for yourself, with individual study sessions divided by topic.You should also remember your overall academic goals when you study. This can help with your motivation. Think about how a good grade will contribute to your overall GPA. Think about how the material will benefit you after the course.

, Simple memorization can only go so far. One of the most effective means to memorize material is giving yourself tests and quizzes. Quizzing can improve memorization because of a process called ""retrieval."" Every time a memory is retrieved, it becomes more accessible in the future. If there are practice tests and quizzes available online, take as many as you can. You can also make up tests and quizzes for yourself.Flash cards can be a great way to test yourself on things like vocabulary and dates.
You can also write down potential exam questions as you study. This can be very helpful if you're expecting an essay test. After you finish studying, take the test you made for yourself.

, Studying for long hours can easily lead to burnout. It's important to take breaks as you study. Take a break about every hour or so. Do something fun, like watch TV for a few minutes or go for a brief walk, and then return to your materials. You will find yourself feeling refreshed and recharged after a quick break., Remember, your instructor in an online course is a valuable resource. Just because you don't see them every day does not mean you can't reach out to them. If you stumble across anything confusing while studying, do not hesitate to send your instructor an email asking for clarification.If you have a web camera, try setting up a video chat meeting with your instructor for face-to-face feedback.

,


Filling out your application should be an obvious thing to do, but when you begin filling it out, be sure to have all your information in front of you, like transcripts, financial aid information, etc. You don't want to start filling out your information then miss a step and have to do it all over again.

Once enrolled in your online classes, consider your professional goals and utilize the unique nature of online education to build your network of professional contacts and enhance your level of professional decorum.,
Be sure you have an email account that you check often.,
Always remember that your classmates might hold varying levels of authority in a diverse array of industries and from a large demographic and geographical area.,
Use the discussion board frequently.,
Note that typing in all capitalized letters is an electronic representation of yelling.,
Create an electronic signature that includes your full name, title and position, place of employment, and general contact information.,
Avoid arguments with your classmates.,
Respect, and learn from, your instructors.,
Take notes.,
Ask Questions Regularly.",How to Network in an Online Class," The following are a few key guidelines to help improve your online communication in your online college classes.;
, As email becomes an increasingly dominant aspect of business communications in every industry, your online classes will provide you with invaluable experience to hone your electronic and written communication skills. Your current or future job likely utilizes email to interact both internally, with coworkers, and externally, with clients.

, The classmates with whom you interact in your online college classes might currently or in the future prove remarkably beneficial business contacts.

, Interact both on a personal and professional level with your classmates. Find out something about each of your classmates - their employer, their title and position, and the reason that they are taking online classes. Forging friendships and creating contacts within your online classes can prove fruitful in your own career. Don't be afraid to display your abilities to think creatively and critically, organize your thoughts, and communicate both effectively and in a professional manner.

, Never yell at your classmates or instructors. Also, remember that not all computers have the same fonts installed, so use a common font that is likely to be visible to all classmates - unusual and script fonts should be avoided. Additionally, you should always use black fonts of a common size and displayed on a white background - bright colors, large print, and fun fonts might be appropriate for personal communications, but are not acceptable in a professional environment.

, This will provide your instructors and classmates with a method in which to contact you should professional or business opportunities arise for which they believe you to be well-suited. Use your new signature in both your emails and in your discussion board postings.

, The anonymity of online classes allows many students to engage in conversation and reveal opinions that they might not share in a traditional classroom. Though you might have an urge to offer passionate disagreement, you should refrain from doing so. Your classmates are invaluable resources, both for your current education and your future professional endeavors.

, Likewise, many of your professors are selected to teach online classes because of not only their education, but for their extensive professional experience within the industry. This means that they likely still have numerous personal and professional contacts with which they might connect their qualified online students. Presenting a diplomatic, professionally demeanor in front of your professors might lead to additional career opportunities following your graduation from your accredited online degree program, or possibly even sooner!

, Not only should you be taking notes on the materials presented within your courses, but you should also take notes on what you learn from and about your classmates. Jot down names, titles, positions, employers, interests, and anything else that you learn about your classmates - you never know when you might need to contact a classmate or professor for a reference, or even to discuss your ideas and goals.

, Students in an online college class have several distinct networking advantages over students in traditional, on-campus classes. One such advantage is the diverse array of classmates. As an online college student, you will likely have classmates and professors from all over the country, even the world. Your classmates and professors will also likely have diverse personal and professional experiences, in various industries, for all different kinds of employers, in numerous geographical locations, and with varied perspectives. You can learn a great deal about your chosen online degree field and eventual career by simply asking questions and getting to know your classmates on a personal level. Likewise, you should return the favor by sharing your own professional experiences and opinions.

Know when to seek an associate degree.",How to Get Your Associate’s Degree Online1," An associate degree is generally 60 semester credits. This is half as much as is required for a bachelor’s degree. Ideally, an associate degree should take half as long and cost half as much a bachelor’s, though this might not be true if your institution is charging exorbitant tuition., There are three types of Associate degrees. An Associate of Applied Science (AAS) and an Associate of Science (AS) concentrate on teaching a particular trade. On the other hand, an Associate of Arts (AA) will provide a general education designed to fulfill requirements for a bachelor’s degree.If you believe that you have the time and interest to pursue a bachelor’s degree, but don’t have the educational background to be accepted by a major university, an AA can be a good way to improve your chances of acceptance as a reputable institution.
An AA and AS, on the other hand, can be fast track to a lucrative career.

, There are many lucrative careers that only require an associate degree. These typically tend to be technical jobs.

With a bit of research you might find that a career as a nurse, medical assistant, or band manager is possible for you. That is why it is important to talk to people in the industry to see what careers are possible.

, An associate degree is a great idea if you already have some college credits and you want to quickly convert them into a formal degree. An associate degree can also be a great idea if you know that your career does not require a bachelor’s or if you do not have the time or the money to invest in a longer degree program."

Think about the type of work that you would enjoy. For example, if you don't like being outdoors much, a career studying plants or animals may not be the best choice for you. On the other hand, laboratory work might be just the thing you'd love.
Identify degree programs that will help you get the type of work you can be passionate about. If you love to read and value books, for example, a degree in the library field may be the best choice for you.

Examples of well-reputed online programs include those at the University of Illinois at Springfield, Fayetteville State University, Liberty University, Marylhurst University, Washington University in St. Louis, Hodges University, Missouri Valley College, Northeastern University, Belhaven University, and the University of Louisville., There are now a variety of search engines designed to match potential students to an online college. Be careful though; not all of the colleges on these lists will be reputable. Some online colleges are scams with exorbitant fees and little academic credibility.


Databases that help you find online programs appropriate for your interests include www.elearners.com, online www.onlinedegree.com, and www.yourdegree.com.
Alternatively, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are generally free and are often offered by extremely reputable institutions. Most, however, offer individual classes, not degrees. They can be useful though if a couple of specializes classes would improve your professional position., This tool has important statistics that can help you determine if a college is credible. These include whether or not a college is accredited, if students receive financial aid, and how frequently students default on their loans.


Do not take a college at its word when it claims to be accredited. Many colleges are “accredited” by fake organizations. Use the College Navigator to verify the claim that the college is accredited.
Also be mindful of what type of accreditation the college has. ""Regional"" accrediting organizations are considered more reputable than ""national"" accrediting organizations.Visit the Council for Higher Education Accreditation to determine if your school's accrediting organization is on the list of regional organizations.
Compare how frequently students from the college you are interested in default on student loans as compared to other institutions. If students default frequently, this means that they either need to take out too much debt to get their degree, do not get jobs after graduating, or experience some combination of these two problems.
Similarly, check to see how frequently students graduate. Low graduation rate suggest that the college does not support its students., Be suspicious of any college that is labeled “for-profit.”Be especially suspicious of a college that pressures you to take out substantial loans from private lenders, rather than federal student loans. Ask to speak to counselors before applying. If you are not allowed to, it is probable that they will not adequately support you after you begin your program., Once you’ve found some reputable colleges, figure out which ones would be best for you. Use the College Navigator to determine which colleges will be the most affordable for you. Research whether the college specializes in what you want to study and if that program is strong.


Don’t base your decisions entirely off tuition, because some colleges are able to provide more financial aid than others. The College Navigator allows you to ascertain the average net cost of tuition at universities by factoring in financial aid. Also, call the financial aid department to discuss the subject directly with them.
Think about the resources available at each school. Is the school nearby, so that you can visit the campus if you need assistance with anything? Does the school offer job placement services upon graduation?
Typically associate's degrees give students a hands on experience with their occupation, which can be hard to do online. Ask what resources the program has and whether it provides internship opportunities.See what current and former students say. You can find reviews written by students who have experience with the colleges you are considering at websites such as Student Review and College Prowler.
Review the website for the department you are applying to join and see who teaches there. Have the professors published academic works? Do they have impressive professional experience? Compare the faculty at the respective universities you are interested in to get a sense for how good their programs are.

Apply to your schools of choice.,
Fill out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (“FAFSA”).,
Wait for your acceptance letter.,
Choose your classes.",How to Get Your Associate’s Degree Online3," Most colleges now accept online applications, which you can find by visiting the school’s website. Locate your school’s online application and print a hard copy. Complete the application and, if applicable, submit your application fee.


Apply to multiple universities and compare the financial aid packages that they offer.

, Filling out your FASFA every year is the first step for obtaining financial aid. You can complete the FAFSA online or download a printable version. After completing the FAFSA, you will receive a report describing what types of federal financial aid are available to you. You may then accept or reject each loan or grant offer individually.

, Once you are accepted at a school, you will receive an acceptance letter in the mail and possibly via e-mail. Follow any instructions included in the letter or any informational packet.

, When choosing classes, be sure to consult with your guidance counselor and check your degree programs listing of required classes. Review the department website to see what professors are the most experienced. You can also visit ratemyprofessor.com to see what past students have thought of your professor.

Begin classes.,
Stay disciplined.,
Refrain from taking time off.,
Finish.",How to Get Your Associate’s Degree Online4," Make adequate time in your schedule to devote to class and schoolwork. If done properly, getting an associate degree should be a quick process.

, Online programs often allow you to progress at your own pace. In such situations, it might be easy to get distracted. Try to treat your online education like you would a traditional education.


You should try to allot a certain amount of time per day to your education. Plan to finish your courses by a particular date and draw up a schedule that will allow you to meet your goal.
The good news is that, while popular opinion suggests that a disproportionate number of online students do not complete their programs, evidence indicates that this s not true. Online students graduate at a rate similar to that of community college students. However, online students do generally take longer to graduate., If you are less than a half-time student for more than six months, your federal student loans might go into repayment. This might mean that you will need to work more to support yourself, leaving you with even less time to complete your education. This sort of spiral can extend your education indefinitely and prevent you from graduating.


Contact your lender if your loan goes go into repayment. If you are unemployed, you might be able to claim a deferment. In special circumstances you can also get temporary forbearance, during which time you won't be required to pay, but the loan will accumulate interest., Devoting time to finishing your associate degree might mean that you need to take some time off work. Remember though, you will be able to earn more once you are finished. The quicker you graduate, the quicker you'll be able to claim a larger paycheck.

Determine what you expect to gain from piano lessons.,
Determine your budget.,
Evaluate multiple instruction options.",How to Learn Piano Online1," When assessing the best path to learning the piano, it’s important to first explore your goals for learning the piano and assess your current resources. There are two primary methods of learning piano online: working with an online individual piano instructor, or learning through an instructional website.To find the learning method that works best, ask yourself:


What do you want to get out of your lessons? Are you planning to perform piano pieces for others, to join a performing ensemble, or simply to play on your own?
Would you rather work with a human individual or move through website tutorials at your own speed?
How much time can you devote to weekly piano lessons?;
, Your budget will determine what kind of lessons you can afford, and how frequently you can afford them. Some of the online tutorial sites offer free lessons, while many online instructors charge for their time. Online lessons with an individual piano instructor often cost around $30/month.Also, remember to factor in other costs, such as paying for sheet music and for piano tunings (if you have a physical piano).
If you have a very limited budget, consider learning the basics via YouTube. There are many free videos available to learn basic skills, however they are not interactive.

, Whether you are inclined to learn to play the piano by video tutorials, written online tutorials, or by working with an online piano instructor, you should evaluate the websites and instructors, and check out multiple options before making a decision. There are a plethora of instructional websites, and it will be well worth your time to evaluate the sites before you commit to one for instruction—especially if the lessons are expensive.When evaluating sites and instructors, consider:


The qualification and skill of the piano instructor, website creator, or lesson-provider.
The online technology. If you find a website with poorly made videos or that uses antiquated media players, move on to a better option.
The marketing intent of the website. While many websites are designed to effectively instruct piano players, others are purely commercial and only want to sell a product, such as an online subscription or an instruction manual.

"
"
Search online for piano instructors.,
Find a qualified teacher.,
Work out a subscription level.,
Begin regular sessions.",How to Learn Piano Online2," If you decide that you want to work one-on-one with a personal piano instructor online, you should begin looking through search engines. Many accomplished performers and pedagogues teach online lessons—some may setup face-to-face lessons over a webcam, while others may send weekly instructional videos and lessons.Apart from search engines and other typical resources, consider reaching out to your friends. Social media is a great source for reviews and insights to help you decide on the right online service or teacher. Look at what your musical friends are reading, commenting on, or sharing online.

, If a website offers instruction from more than one teacher, take free trials or interviews with 2–3 teachers that spark your interest. Look at the instructors’ credentials, experience, education, and biographies. If a site only has one piano instructor, ask for a trial lesson before you commit to the lessons.


Don’t underestimate the importance of scheduling and availability. It’s important that you find an individual teacher who can work with you online when your schedule permits.

, Online piano instructors may have different levels of service they provide. For example, a “basic” level may provide fewer face-to-face instructional meetings and fewer online resources than a “premium” or higher-level service. Talk with the instructor: describe you level of experience, level of interest, budget, and available time, and see what they suggest.


Always keep your personal budget in mind while negotiating with your instructor. You don’t want to strain your financial resources just to purchase a higher-level subscription.

, Learning to play the piano takes a substantial amount of time, and the sooner you start, the quicker you’ll be able to master the basics. Familiarize yourself with the instructor and their methods. Consider doing some of the very basic work (e.g. learning the notes, their positions on the keyboard and on the musical staff) outside of the lessons, so that you’re not paying for unnecessary instruction.


If the lessons are over a webcam, make sure to start on time and set the computer near your piano, so you can see it as you play.

"
"
Find a trusted website.,
Investigate the logistics of the website.,
Choose a level of access that suits your goals.,
Start with the basics.",How to Learn Piano Online3," There are many sites that offer online piano instruction. Find one that works for you by looking at several sites, and comparing their features. Great online sites may offer users the opportunity to ‘sample’ or ‘try’ lessons before buying a subscription or paying for lessons. Examine the site and the piano lessons to confirm that they seem professional, thorough, and genuinely educational.


Since any individual can start a piano-instruction website, you may want to take some time to vet the website for security issues. Look at the site’s security policy. In the anonymous world of the internet, this is extremely important—you want to be sure that the person who created the website—and who you may be paying for their service—is safe.

, In the first couple weeks of lessons—or even before lessons start— familiarize yourself with the technology that the website uses for instruction. You may need to download a new media player or use audio or video files you’re unfamiliar with. Also familiarize yourself with how the website handles the logistics of scheduling and paying for lessons or instructional material. Consider:


Does the site let you schedule a set of lessons up-front? You don’t want to keep having to add things to your calendar and then forgetting.
Can you get discounts when purchasing packs or lessons in bulk?
What is the site’s cancellation policy?
When making a payment, how secure is the site?
In the event of technical problems, how responsive and extensive is their customer support mechanism?

, Many websites that provide piano instruction will offer different “levels” of subscription, ranging from “basic” access, with limited features, to “premium” access, with extra perks and bonus features. Consider if you need the extra features, and choose the level of subscription which best suits your goals.


If you’re indecisive, start with the cheapest and most limited subscription level. You can always upgrade to a “premium” level, but it may be difficult to downgrade to a cheaper level.

, Must instructional websites will route you from simple lessons—such as identifying keys on the piano and playing a couple of scales—to more complex lessons, including playing with both hands simultaneously and learning all 24 major and minor scales.If the option is available, it could also benefit you to learn some music theory. Even if you’re not planning to compose your own music or to analyze chord structures, having some theory knowledge will help you to better understand the music you’re playing.

Remember the first half of the poem.,

Remember a single word for each line.,
Listen to recordings of the poem.,
Add a small alteration to remember leap years.,
Ball your hands into fists and place them together.,
Count the months working with your knuckles and grooves.,
Do not count the knuckles on your thumbs.,
Remember that months that land on a knuckle have 31 days.,
Understand months that land on a groove have 30 days, excluding February.,
Try an acronym.,
Use a mnemonic device.,
Find ways to connect months.",How to Memorize How Many Days Are in Each Month," There is a common nursery rhyme used to teach children the days in the months. The first line reminds you how many months contain 30 days.The first line goes, ""30 days have September, April, June, and November.""
You can remember, based off this line, that September, April, June, and November each have 30 days. You may have to repeat this line quite a few times to successfully commit it to memory.;
, The second half of the poem reminds you that February is a short month, and which months have 31 days. The line goes, ""When short February's done, all the rest have 31."" Excluding September, April, June, November, and February, all the months have 31 days.You may have to repeat this line a few times to remember it, as with the first line.
Try repeating the whole poem a few times, after memorizing the first and second line. This can help you commit the whole poem to memory.

, If you're struggling to remember, a simple trick can help. Try to remember a key word from each line of the poem, and find a way to associate that word with the line.For example, the first line goes ""30 days has September."" Try to remember the poem starts with a line containing the word ""September.""
Try to imagine something to do with September that reminds you of the rest of the line. For example, September is traditionally when school begins. You can imagine a young school girl learning her multiplication tables and multiplying 10 times 3 to get 30. This will help you remember, ""30 days has September.""
The next line is ""April, June, and November."" You can try to remember symbols for each month. Let's say you have an Aunt April. You can picture her sitting out in the sun eating a turkey sandwich. June is a traditionally sunny, summery month, and turkey is associated with Thanksgiving, which falls in November.
Continue using tricks like this throughout the rest of the lines of the poem. This can help you better remember it.

, Simple repetition is a great means to memorize poetry. Find recordings of the poem online. A site like YouTube may have recordings of the poem. Play these recordings to yourself over and over again, and try to recite the lines along with the recordings. This can help you memorize the poem.If you cannot find a recording online, use your phone or computer to record yourself saying the poem. Then, play this recording back to yourself while you recite the poem along with it.

, Some people do not struggle to remember the days in February, as it's only one month. However, if you frequently forget the days in February, you can try memorizing an alteration of the poem instead. This alteration goes, ""30 days has September, April, June, and November. All the rest have 31. Save February, with 28 days clear, and 29 each leap year.""You can memorize this version of the poem using the same tricks you used to remember the first version.

, You can also use your knuckles to remember the number of days in each month. To start, ball both your hands into fists. Then, hold both your fists in front of your face. Push your two balled fists together, so your two thumbs and two index fingers touch., You should start with January at the leftmost knuckle. You will count the months by moving across your fists, counting each knuckle and groove as a month.Start with the outermost knuckle on your left hand. This is the knuckle made by your left pinky. This is January.
Move to the groove just to the right of your leftmost knuckle. This is the groove between the knuckles made by your left pinky and ring finger. This is February.
Keep moving across your two hands, naming each knuckle and groove the name of a different month.

, When you reach the knuckle made by your left index finger, move immediately to the knuckle made by your right index finger. Do not count your thumb knuckles, or the gap between your hands.The knuckle made by your left index finger should be July. The knuckle made by your right index finger should be August.

, The months that land on your knuckles are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. All these months have 31 days., The months that land on the grooves of your knuckles should be February, April, June, September, and November. These months all have 30 days.If you do not end up with these months landing on your grooves, you may have done the trick wrong. You may have accidentally skipped a knuckle or groove in the process, or accidentally counted the gap between your hands. Try starting over and going slower this time.

, An acronym can help you remember the names of the months. An acronym is a memory device in which you make up a word or sentence using the first letter in a group of terms you must memorize. This can easily be used to help you remember the days in each month.Remember, the months September, April, June, and November have 30 days. The letters here are S, A, J, and N. You could make a sentence like, ""Sarah And June Nap."" It may be tricky, however, to remember A stands for ""April"" and not August, so you may want to combine an acronym with another memory trick.
The months January, March, May, July, August, October, and December all have 31 days. This leaves you with the letters D, J, M, M, O, J, A. You can think of a sentence like, ""Justin Must Make Diced Apricot Orange Jam."" As many months have the same letters, you should again try to combine this with another memory device.

, Mnemonic devices help you remember complicated information by associating an image with information. For example, you want to remember there are 28 days in February most years. Think about a series of hearts forming the shape of the numbers ""2"" and ""8."" February is the month of Valentine's Day, and hearts are an image associated with Valentine's Day., If you can find ways to make connections between which months have which number of days, it can be easier to remember. Facts are easier to remember if you can make some connection.For example, September, April, June, and November all have 30 days. Is there anything you associate with all these months? Maybe you could think about beginnings. September marks the beginning of school, springtime weather frequently begins in April, June marks the beginning of summer, and the end of Thanksgiving in November is the beginning of the Christmas season.
You may not be able to link all the months with 31 days, as there are so many, but you may be able to find small connections between small groupings of months. For example, January is known to be a harsh and cold month, March weather is often thought of as dreary and rainy, and October contains Halloween, a frightening holiday. All these months have certain qualities that are scary, fierce, or harsh.

Keep in touch with your family.",How to Get Comfortable in a Dorm," Communication is key. Spend some time getting to know one another. Since you have to learn to live together for at least a semester, if not an entire school year, do your part to ensure you and your “roomie” can agree on the most important things.

Share information about your home and family life.
Discuss favorite activities to learn if you have mutual interests.
Chat about why you chose this particular college.
Talk together about decorating and arranging the furniture so it’s mutually convenient and comfortable.;
, You might learn you have some of the same classes or extracurricular activities. Perhaps you are on the same sports teams or work in the same place either on or off campus. On the other hand, you might be totally apart all day and only see each other in your room. Then you could decide to create time to do something together. Determine if you have any mutual interests.
Go to classes or activities together.
Travel off campus to eat at a favorite college hangout, to go to the gym, or to see a movie.
Spend time apart with your own circle of friends.
Respect each other’s space and need to abide by the limited privacy available.

, Remember, communication and respect are very important when you’re sharing a small space. When arguments occur, which is only natural at times, try to agree to disagree politely. Always discuss every aspect of room use with your roommate before making plans.

Communicate. Communicate. Communicate.
Check with your roommate before inviting friends or family members to your room for a visit or an activity.
Discuss everything related to the room, from activities to decorating to study times.

, Put in your best effort to have a friendly, comfortable relationship with one another. If you both learn you really can’t get along, you can usually talk to your dorm supervisor or resident assistant to apply for new roommates. Hopefully, however, you can be cordial and abide by some simple rules of etiquette.

Treat one another with mutual respect.
Gain—or grant—permission for reasonable requests.
Don't do anything to the room, or invite people to your room, without agreeing on it with your roommate, and vice versa.

, While you want your room to remind you of the comforts of home, keep in mind—your roommate wants the same thing regarding making the room reminiscent of his or her home! So the two of you will have to share the space and respect each other’s personal belongings and decorating tastes.

Bring your favorite pillow or afghan, or anything special and reminiscent of your bedroom at home.
Personalize with your own posters, small knickknacks, and family mementos.
Print some of your favorite photos and arrange them in nice frames in your portion of the room.

, You’re going to be in your dorm room for at least one semester, if not the entire school year. You don’t want to feel like a traveler staying in a hotel, or just a temporary visitor. Settle in as if this room is yours at home—because it will be yours for awhile!Unpack your suitcase. You’re not just passing through, so don’t live out of your suitcase!
Arrange your clothes in your closet and dresser, just as you would at home.
Be mindful of space if you have to share portions of a closet or dresser with your roommate.

, One of the best ways to make your dorm room feel more like home is to make your bed as comfy as the one at home! You may be stuck with the mattress and frame provided by the college, but you can enhance your bed with your own touches. You will probably also sleep better if your bed is comfortable, and that’s especially important to get appropriate rest. Make your bed with your own favorite sheets, blanket, and a comforter or quilt.
Add your own pillow, or a pair of pillows from home. You might also add some throw pillows to the mix.
Include a favorite stuffed animal or two, if you have any that are especially meaningful or sentimental to you.
Purchase a wedge-shaped pillow, if you don’t have one already, as you are likely to spend a lot of time sitting up in bed studying.

, This is another way to make your room feel more like home. Add your own touches or accents that remind you of home. Again, make sure you discuss additions to the room with your roommate first. It’s likely he or she also has specific accessories to add, and you should mutually agree on everything first. Try to find out ahead of time if your room has curtains. If not, bring some from home, but discuss decorating with your roommate before hanging them up.
Include a small desk or table lamp, or a wall lamp. You will spend a lot of time studying and doing assignments, so make sure you have adequate lighting.
Determine if you could invest in a room-size carpet or a throw rug or two, and perhaps chip in money together to purchase one or more.
Add plants, either green leafy ones or floral ones. Make sure your roommate doesn’t have pollen allergies, first! In the event he or she does, perhaps you can agree on green plants with no blossoms, so they won't aggravate allergies.
Decide if there’s room to add a cozy chair or two, or a small desk and chair if the dorm doesn’t already provide them.

, You and your roommate will be spending a considerable amount of time in your room. Discuss how you can enhance the ambiance or atmosphere of your room to make it pleasant and inviting. You could try a number of things, as long as you both agree and nothing is objectionable.Rearrange furniture, if necessary, to create a more comfortable living space.
Play music you both agree on, in various genres, depending on your individual tastes and activities of the moment. For instance, you might need soothing background instrumental music while studying, and more upbeat tunes by favorite artists at other times.

, Many colleges won’t allow candles in dorms for safety reasons, but you could enjoy the fragrance of candles through other means. Just make sure you check on the dorm’s policy and never leave any of these items unsupervised. Also check with your roommate regarding allergies to any particular scent.

Try fragrance plugins or wax melters.
Use aromatherapy diffusers with essential oils. Different essential oils have specific therapeutic effects that could prove beneficial during your college experience.

, Dorm rooms are typically small (about 10’ x 10’). You can use some space-saving storage pieces and tricks to make the most of the space and even make it look larger.

Use bright or light colors for curtains and room accents, as long as your roommate agrees.Arrange mirrors and expose the window to let in more natural light, rather than crowding “stuff” in front of it, to make the place seem a little bigger. Rearrange furniture, or opt to remove some for even more space.

, It’s a small room, but make every effort to create and recognize your own space within the space. You don’t have to literally draw a line, but at least figuratively create equal portions of the room for each of you. For instance, if your roommate always puts books or bags in a certain spot, don’t move them and put your stuff there.Share space as equally as possible and don't encroach on each other's space.
Establish boundaries to also respect personal space when you're each studying, sleeping, visiting, or engaging in other activities not involving the other.

, Focusing on the reason for college attendance—your education—will demand most of your time. You will be less likely to feel homesick or distracted by other things. If you maximize your class and study time, and you will likely find some time for recreation and leisure.

Attend all your classes.
Learn efficient study techniques.
Complete your assignments on time.
Participate in or observe sports or other events.

, Always check with your roommate first to find out his or her plans. If the time is right, plan some study or leisure time with friends. Enjoying these moments can also make you feel more at home.

Organize a study group and invite friends to your room to study.
Arrange mutually convenient down time and invite friends to your room to watch a movie, listen to music, or just hang out in your room to chat.
Plan a dorm pizza party, game night, or another mutually agreeable activity.

, If you have a close family, you will likely miss them especially in the early weeks of college. For their sake and yours, make time to keep in touch with them to let them know you miss them and keep them informed about how your college adventure is going.

Arrange regular times to call, Skype, chat on Facebook, or whatever means is mutually convenient.
Send text messages when you’re not in class.
Surprise family members with old-fashioned “snail mail” deliveries of special cards, photos, or gifts.

Understand how your travel insurance works (and buy one!),
Be safe!,
When you arrive, treat your jet lag if you have any.,
Buy a travel book for your new country/town or about the continent (some have South America, Asia or Europe books now) so you can analyze your weekend possibilities and provide with more information you might need quickly in your own language.

,
Have the time of your life!",How to Get Ready to Study Abroad," You can find more information on their holidays, their weather, and their population. Use Google Street to get a real life view of the town's streets. It's good to picture yourself walking there, imagine yourself smiling and having the time of your life.;
, Try to contact a previous participant for your program or a student from the foreign university. Offer to buy them a coffee and ask them any questions you might have about the school/town. Do not forget to ask about the clothing suggestions they might have or any good phrases/traditions to remember.

, A great example would be for a Californian to go to Sweden in the middle of winter. You will need a lot of unusual gear to survive the winter or even the summer. Make it part of your research to determine what is something you will absolutely need. Maybe snow gloves, maybe even a new bikini. Try not to buy a whole new wardrobe since you could use the money to travel abroad or the luggage space but buy the essentials.

, Sometimes even pictures, a small toy, and your favorite candy does the trick. You can always have someone send a care package with any other goodies you suddenly realize you absolutely need. A good tip is to have someone fill a $15 international 4lb flat rate USPS box with trinkets from home. You have to remember most ""American"" items tend to run pretty pricey compared to being purchased in America. A good example is peanut butter, which is pretty pricey everywhere else in the world. If you cannot live with out it, take a little bit to cheer you up when homesick.

, Do not pack something you can only wear twice during your stay. Make sure you take at least a whole week's worth of outfits and think of at least two ways of combining those to create a new one. You will have a whole three weeks of outfits that way. Try to make your combinations so they can be used once in winter and once in summer. Do not take super expensive clothing since you will be using it A LOT and it will deteriorate or get lost but make sure it's good quality to last a long time. Leave enough space to bring some stuff back too. Don't buy souvenirs that are too big but do bring memories from abroad with you. You will miss it when you are back. You can sell your clothes before coming home to make more souvenir money too.

, Some countries are very cash based and will not take a credit or bank card. Some countries will not take foreign cash from the street since it could be counterfeited very easily. It is a good idea to obtain at least $100 in their currency until you can encounter an ATM or get a money transfer (moneygram sends money in 15 minutes). It is also good to take a good credit card, let them know you will be abroad and make sure it is universally accepted. Visa and Mastercard are the most popular cards around the world.

, Set up Skype dates with your friends once in a while to get over the homesick. When you talk, talk about your new town and experiences not how much you wish you weren't there. Sometimes we get hit with culture shock or loneliness and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Remember you will be home eventually though and you have to make your own experience enjoyable. It doesn't automatically happen.

, so you will not stress when you need it most and live in a place you find comfortable not just convenient. It's not a hotel, it is your temporary home so be comfortable, safe and happy.

, Do not do something you would not do if you were home. Just because you are in a foreign country, you are not exempt from rules and morals. Learn the local rules and practice good common sense. Take advantage of your opportunities, open yourself up but do not make yourself vulnerable. Always let someone know where you will be or bring a new friend with you!

, Then go ahead and explore the town. Try to practice your language as soon as possible, learn their traditions. You can always ask why someone does something a certain way and be prepared for people to ask you things they find strange in your country. It is an exchange so be a good representative of yourself and your country! Do not be rude and understand everyone is different.

,, But still study and be safe!

Before getting into any MBA program, consider the type of accreditation the institution holds.,
Consider researching accreditation agencies that promote regional accreditation, professional accreditation, and distance learning accreditation.,
Compare a number of institutions to verify exactly what they offer and whether they suit your needs.,
Do your research and make sure that your MBA program is accredited nationally.,
Decide what type of MBA degree you are interested in.,
Do you wish to earn a degree while working?,
Most online MBA programs select students on the basis of Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), significant work experience, academic transcripts, essays, references or letters of recommendation and personal interviews.

",How to Get Into an Accredited MBA Program," In the United States, business schools are accredited by private, regional and national associations. MBA programs are accredited to provide students and employers with an independent view of their quality, and indicate that the school's educational curriculum meets specific quality standards.;
,


Regional accreditation is the most widely accepted type of accreditation. There are six regional accrediting agencies that grant accreditation.
Two professional accrediting agencies are Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), which accredits research universities, the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), which accredits junior colleges and teaching colleges.
Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) maintains and promotes educational excellence in distance educational institutions. It is the largest accrediting agency of online programs.

, Take your time and choose wisely.

, Attending an accredited program means you are receiving a quality education.

, Some of the major specialized online MBA programs are accounting, economics, finance, marketing, international business. Decide which program is best for you.


Online program generally consists of lectures, readings, assignments, and participation in online discussions. You may need to physically attend some workshops in the campus to get residency hours.

, Consider the course time-is it fitting to your busy schedule? As most students are working employees, they need to find out extra time for these online programs. An MBA online course can be taken on your schedule, giving you a competitive advantage for the future.

Utilize a course management system (CMS).,
Use a blog.,
Post podcasts.,
Remember copyright laws.,
Practice good pedagogical techniques.",How to Put Graduate Course Work Online," Also referred to as a Learning Management System (LMS) or Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), these web-based systems are designed to offer instructors space to post course material online. Students and instructors are required to sign in with a username and password and are only given access to their own courses. Many universities have already partnered with a CMS company. If not, several vendors are available from which to choose.


Learn how to use all of its features so you can use the system to its full extent. Take the time to attend training sessions. Ask an Information Technology staff member to meet with you and help you determine which features would work best for your class.
Train your students how to use this system. Make sure they understand how you expect them to use it throughout the semester: how often to check it, when to post discussion questions, and how to find their grades and assignments.
Be realistic and flexible in your time frames and expectations. Not every student has high-speed Internet at home, or even a computer. While technology can be a great asset to the classroom, it can be tough for these students to access it.;
, You can also post course work through blogs. Blogs allow you more flexibility in design and style, but they are also generally open to the public. If you choose to use a blog, you need to be extremely cautious in what you post and what you ask your students to post.

, Some classes utilize either audio or video lectures, available for students to access throughout the semester. This allows them to listen to or watch lectures until they comprehend the material. It also helps them review. However, do not rely entirely on podcasts. Online course work needs to be learner-centered and interactive.

, Posting course work online still requires you to pay attention to copyright laws. Traditional copyright laws apply to digital reproductions and distributions. Be familiar with public domain, fair use, and copyright laws so you do not distribute unauthorized content.


Anything that is copyrighted by the instructor can be posted online, so feel free to post any of your original materials.
Content provided by publishers or CMS vendors usually contain copyright licensing when purchased. Linking or posting those materials is generally okay.
Linking to other websites or resources is usually permissible. Keep an eye out in case certain websites prohibit this.
The TEACH Act allows certain schools to use copyrighted material under certain conditions. Generally, non-profit, accredited schools can use material in live classroom sessions.

, Many instructors use a CMS because it is a quicker and more cost-effective way of distributing information and resources. But it is also important to consider how your teaching methods will change.


Learn about online collaboration, case-based learning, and problem-based learning (PBL). These allow students to interact with each other and actively engage with the learning process.
Decide what course work will be put online and what still needs to be covered in class. Also consider the way you will cover those materials in class. Involve students as much as you can.
Incorporate interactive elements. Engage students outside of class by encouraging them to interact with each other through discussion boards and chat rooms.

Memorize one page a day.,
Learn some rules.,
Try breaking it up, if it is difficult to pronounce.,
Learn an anagram for the most complex words.,
Read extensively.,
Write the word on a small post-it note or piece of paper and stick them around the house.",How to Memorize Hard to Spell Words," If you try to learn a lot in a day it will be hard to memorize them. Review your previous lists regularly -after a day, after three days, after a week and after a month. Circle words you had difficulty with in pencil and add them to your current list.;
, If a word has '..ible' or '..able' at the end of it and you are not sure how it's spelled; do this for example, ""I'm not sure how to spell learn-able. Oh I know ! I am i able to learn, yes! So I know that 'learn' has 'able' at the end!!""

, For example, if you are finding it difficult to pronounce 'bankruptcy', break it up - 'bank'+'rup'+'tcy'.

, An anagram is a sentence or phrase where the first letter of each word are the letters of the original spelling in logical order. Eg. Arithmetic = A Rude Idiot Thought He Might Eat Toffee In Church. Dictionaries sometimes have suggestions for commonly misspelled words and online sites, such as www.ssynth.co.uk/~gay/anagram.html‎, can help. It is suggested that you try to make one yourself as you are more likely to remember it.

, Choose good quality books that have advanced vocabulary. Regular exposure to the same words will improve your recognition of them and memory of their spelling.

, Put them on the door, on the fridge, on your desk - everywhere and anywhere! Every time you encounter the word, read the spelling and then cover it and practise until you have learned it off. This is a great way to overcome words that you really struggle with.

Act it out.",How to Memorize a Speech," Get a thorough understanding of the most important information in your speech by writing your speech in outline form before writing out in its full, complete form. An outline will touch on all the major parts of your speech, thereby making it easier for you to divide your speech into manageable parts later on.


Your outline should include all major ideas and all major supporting ideas. If you have any special examples or analogies you want to use withing your speech, this also warrants a bullet point.;
, To cement the speech in your head, you need to write it out in its complete form. This includes the introduction, body, and conclusion of the speech.


You should write out the entire speech even if you do not plan on memorizing it verbatim.

, Before using any memorization techniques, you need to speak and hear the speech so that more of your senses are engaged in the memorization practice.


If at all possible, try to read the speech in the place you will deliver it. The acoustics of every room and setting vary somewhat, so reading your speech in the actual delivery location can help you get accustomed to the way your voice will sound from that spot. Additionally, it helps you get comfortable with the layout of the room, making it possible for you to rehearse your movements as well as your words.

, Most of your speech will not need to be memorized word-for-word. As a rule of thumb, though, you should at least consider memorizing your introduction and conclusion word-for-word, or as close to it as possible, while aiming to memorize the key ideas and details of your body without memorizing the body material exactly.


Memorizing the introduction can be a good idea because knowing precisely what to say at the beginning of a speech can help calm you down and ease you into the setting. Memorizing the conclusion is also helpful because it prevents you from accidentally falling into a concluding loop, in which you continually repeat information as you try to close.
Memorizing the full body of the speech verbatim is generally not recommended, however, because a memorized speech can sound stiff and unnatural.

, Regardless of which memorization tactics you use and how effective they are, the most valuable thing you can do for yourself is to practice the speech as often as possible. It's even better if you practice the speech out loud, rather than only trying to recall it in your mind.


For the first couple of practices, you can practice by reading the speech from your notebook or note cards. After the first two to four practices, though, you should start practicing your speech from memory as best as possible. You can refer to your notes when you get stuck, but deliver as much as possible without your notes.
Try to practice your speech from memory for at least half of your practices, if not more.

, Each main idea or major supporting detail should be granted its own part. In other words, if the information was written as a bullet point in your outline, it gets its own part.


If you did not write an outline or do not like the way your information is organized into bullet points on the outline, you could opt to divide your speech by paragraph instead of by bullet point. The idea is mostly to assign one major idea to each part.

, Create a mental image for each part. The more absurd and unique the image is, the easier it will be to recall it later.


For instance, if your speech is about various healthy and beauty uses for organic food products, and a part of your speech mentions that coconut oil can help hair grow faster, you could imagine something like Rapunzel sitting on top of a tower made of coconuts or living in a room filled with coconuts. Rapunzel emphasizes the idea of long hair, while the coconuts help point out the connection to coconut oil. The elements are normal enough but absurd when combined, making it easier to recall them.

, In your speech, you need to weave the mental images together. The easiest way to do this is to visualize yourself traveling along various locations, observing the pictures in order.


The location can be near or far; the choice is up to you. Ultimately, though, you should be able to navigate it well enough in your mind to find your way to your various visuals.
You could choose something as simple as a forest if many of your visualizations seem to belong outside.
Alternatively, you could also use the human body as a map. The images can be “tattooed” onto the body in your mind, and as you travel along the body, you will hit the images in order more naturally.

, With the locations and visualizations set, you need to begin practicing your speech by relying on these visuals for guidance. As you practice, actually imagine yourself traveling from location to location, viewing each image in the order that its corresponding bullet point falls within your speech.


You need to have firm links connecting one visualization to the next. If not, you might forget the order your information is supposed to land in.
In the example with Rapunzel and the coconuts, you could connect that visual to the one before it by ending with the imagined you having your hair ruined, leading the imagined you to seek advice from someone with long, strong hair.

, For small speeches or sections of a speech you want to memorize word-for-word, use the chunking method. Divide the speech into short, manageable chunks that are between two and three sentences long.Take the time to actually mark off each section or chunk of information in your written notes. This can make it easier for you to recall when one part ended and when the next part picks up as you practice, making it harder for you to accidentally forget or leave any parts out.

, Practice reciting the first chunk of information out loud, repeating it until you can recall it completely without referring to your notes.


If you get stuck, do not immediately return to your notes. Start from the beginning and try to say the chunk again. If this fails, spend a few more moments trying to recall the missing information. When you decide that nothing can help you remember it, return to your notes and briefly look up what the missing part consisted of.
When you finish memorizing a chunk of your speech, read through it again to verify that you have it correct.

, Once you finish recalling the first chunk successfully, add the second chunk to it, repeating both until the second chunk can be recited from memory, as well. Continue on in this manner until the entire speech or speech section can be recalled without the use of notes.


It is important that you continue repeating previously memorize chunks so that you do not forget them. Moreover, repeating all chunks of your speech together will help you to memorize how each chunk fits together with the rest.

, Continue practicing your speech out loud. If you have trouble remembering a certain chunk, isolate it and focus on recalling it from memory before trying to weave it back into the speech as a whole.

, While writing and speaking your speech are the two most important practices involved in memorizing the speech, recording the speech and playing it back for yourself can also help.


Use this recording to listen to your speech when you do not have the chance to practice it out loud. You can play it for yourself in the car or play it as you fall asleep, for example.

, Mental images are often the strongest sense to rely on for memory, but these other senses can still help significantly.


For instance, if you say that a certain historical event really made a bang or made a splash, you can imagine the sound of a loud bang or the sound and feeling of something heavy dropping into water.

, If you have a list that you need to recall verbatim, you can use a mnemonic device known as an acronym to recall the items on that list. An acronym uses the first letter of each item in the list to create a sentence or word, which can then be used to recall those first letters.


For example, you can use the acronym HOMES to recall the names of the Great Lakes in the U.S.: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior

, Consider weaving analogies and stories into your speech to illustrate various concepts and ideas. A concrete example can make information easier to recall, and concrete examples can also engage the audience better.


For example, if you deliver a speech about various mental disorders and you know someone in your family or from your past who suffers from a disorder covered in your speech, you can tell a story about that person that illustrates what it is like to suffer from that disorder.

, By incorporating physical actions into your speech delivery, you can help yourself memorize important parts of your speech while also engaging your audience more effectively.


If speaking about a political issue in the United States, you could raise your left hand when talking about what the political left believes and your right hand when talking about what the political right believes.

Pick a poem.,
Read the poem aloud.,
Record yourself reading the poem.,
Set goals.",How to Memorize a Long Poem1," You will be spending a lot of time with this poem, so you want to choose one with a subject that interests you. Your interest will help you remain motivated. For example, a poem with several lines that you already enjoy quoting may be a good choice.Consider choosing a poem with a formal structure. The regulated length of lines and predictable rhyming patterns will make memorizing significantly easier.
Free verse poems are typically harder to memorize as they lack the structure, rhythm, and rhyming patterns that can aid memorization. If you are trying to learn a free verse poem, focus on any line and paragraph divisions that the author has used. Even inconsistent patterns will provide useful markers for your memorization of the full poem.;
, Recite the poem from beginning to end. Speak loudly and clearly to a group or to yourself. If you feel uncomfortable reciting the poem where a neighbor or roommate could overhear, try reading the poem while on a walk or when you are the only person at home. Speaking aloud is connected to greater memory retention., Now that you are familiar with the poem, read it in a manner that reflects how you think it should be read or performed. Before you start, review any lines that you did not know how to read during your recitation. You can use a tape recorder, a computer, or a smart phone to record yourself.


This recording will help you track changes in how you hear the poem and develop ideas for how you would like to deliver the poem once fully memorized. It will also allow you to review the poem in situations where you cannot work with a book.

, There is no clear limit to the amount of information that a human brain can memorize.There are, however, limits to working memory and how much you can learn in a given amount of time.Give yourself specific goals so that you can work with a realistic amount of text each week. These goals will also help you track your progress.


Divide a long poem into sections. You will not be able to work on the full text each time that you look at it. If the author included divisions, use them to establish the amount of the poem you will work with each day or week.
An individual’s ability to memorize, like physical exercises, gets stronger with practice. If you do not feel like you are making strong progress, be patient. If you work at memorizing the poem consistently, you will be able to learn more lines at a quicker pace as you progress."

Focus on your character.,
Practice your monologue until you can perform it with confidence.",How to Memorize a Shakespearean Monologue," Shakespeare’s many plays are full of monologues—if you’re allowed to choose your own, read liberally through the plays to find something you like. If you are not inclined to read several plays, or simply don’t have time, talk to your instructor or friends about popular Shakespearean monologues. Also look for videos or Youtube clips of Shakespearean monologues, and see which hold your interest.


The traditional advice is that the monologue should be appropriate for your own age and gender. However, if you’re looking to make a bold theatrical statement, consider performing a monologue by a character of a different age or gender than your own.
There are entire websites devoted to cataloging all of the Shakespearean monologues and soliloquies. A monologue is a speech delivered by an individual in front of other characters, while a soliloquy is a speech in which a character speaks their own thought aloud while alone on stage, revealing their inner conflict. Both occur frequently within Shakespeare’s plays.;
, If the monologues confuses you or you find the character flat, unappealing, or unlikeable, you are less likely to deliver it in a convincing manner.


It may help you better understand both the monologue and the character if you watch a dramatic production or a film version first. You may be able to find clips of popular monologues on YouTube.

, Shakespeare’s monologues are filled with beautiful and challenging language, but it’s hard to memorize pure language if you don’t understand what it means or what your character is actually saying. Understand the story that is being portrayed in the play and the role that your monologue plays in the overall narrative.
You may need added context to understand the monologue; read the scene that precedes the monologue, and work out any words or phrases that confuse you.
If you’re struggling to comprehend your monologue, find a modernized version of the text online, or ask a teacher or professor for help.

, Shakespeare’s Early Modern English usage can be challenging to contemporary performers, and it helps to memorize Shakespearean language if you know exactly what you are saying. If there is anything you don't understand, don't be afraid to look it up. You will be able to memorize your monologue more quickly if you comprehend the language.


You don’t necessarily need to look up or translate the entire monologue—focus on passages that are confusing or involve puns or other wordplay.
Remember that Shakespeare’s plays are meant to be performed by actors on a stage. The characters speak to communicate to one another; if you understand the emotions and arguments that the characters are trying to convey, you’ll be able to contextualize the monologue., To fully understand the emotions and thoughts you will convey in your monologue, go through the monologue and write down what your objectives are and what tactics your character might use to get what they want.


Study this list of your character’s objectives, and take in to consideration what you want to do to bring these tactics and needs to life.

, Do not just mumble it under your breath or read it silently to yourself. Read it out loud again and try changing your acting choices.


As you read the lines, stand up and move around; you are not going to perform the audition seated, so you should get used to reciting the monologue on your feet.
For example, while portraying Shylock from The Merchant of Venice (the monologue when he talks about revenge) you might first practice talking quietly and intensely, so as to make your point clear—the second time, you might raise your voice with each repeated phrase. Experiment until you feel comfortable and the delivery feels natural.

, This will help you visualize the monologue while you memorize and, later, deliver it. Just by writing and thinking of the words, you help improve your memory of the monologue.Your priority should be on understanding and remembering the content of the monologue; once you understand the content, the lines will fall into place more naturally.
Focus especially on parts that are difficult or tricky for you to learn. Writing these sections repeatedly will help you cement the language in your mind.

, In the theater, a “beat” is a change in topic or thought within a monologue.Write the different emotions during each beat and how tactics change during your monologue. This will help you feel less overwhelmed by the size of the monologue by breaking it down into 5 or 6 smaller, and more manageable, beats.


For example, say your character wants something from another character. Their first tactic might be yelling at them, but then their second tactic might be asking nicely.

, If you have a printed copy of the monologue, you can easily do this with a folded sheet of paper or a note card. Hold the card across the page to block lines lower than the one you are memorizing—then read that line over and over until you know it. You can also leave exposed the line preceding the one you’re memorizing (this is called the “cue line.”) Allowing each line to lead you into the next one will help you memorize them as a sequence and add a conversational flow to your performance.

, Naps have been shown to help aid in short-term memorization; they give your mind a chance to rest and absorb the language you have been memorizing. So, after you work on memorizing a section of your monologue, take a short nap.After your nap, try reciting your lines to see how much you remember. Then (later that day or the next day), learn more lines and take another nap.

, Professionals often find that walking while learning lines helps the memorization process go more quickly—and also helps more of the language stick in their minds.Walk around with the printed version of your monologue and block out lines you’ve already memorized, then test yourself by reciting those lines without the paper.
If you walk as part of your daily routine (whether it’s for exercise or walking to work / school), get in the habit of reciting your lines as you walk. This is especially effective if you’ve spent time memorizing your lines right before you take your walk., Listening to yourself speak will help you find flaws in your monologue, which you can then improve. Listening to any recorded version of the monologue—even your own—will also help you memorize it.


To help with your stage presence and overall performance, film yourself reciting the monologue.Although it can be strange or embarrassing to watch yourself at first, this will help you notice any odd habits you have (a nervous tic, for example) and help you fine-tune your bodily movements and facial expressions.

, Shakespeare’s plays are written in poetic verse—usually in iambic pentameter. This is a metered type of poetry, which begins with an unstressed syllable and then alternates stressed-unstressed-stressed-unstressed. Understanding the poetic rhythm will help the language feel more lyrical and natural to speak.Although rhythm and iambic pentameter are valuable to crafting your delivery, try not to make your delivery sound unnatural or too forced.

, Although this is not directly related to memorization, “blocking” (the timing of your physical movement on the stage) is still an important part of performing your monologue. After you’ve memorized the language of the play, decide what to do with your body. Is your character moving around the stage as they speak? Are they sitting; do they pick up and touch objects while they speak?


Tie your blocking and physical movements to the emotions that your character expresses. If you let the language and emotion drive your physical movements, they will appear natural.
Blocking can help with line memorization, too. If you associate certain lines with specific positions on the stage or physical movements, these motions will bring your lines to mind as well. , This is the single most important aspect of your monologue performance, and should be considered before you worry about linguistic nuances, etc. Try to understand and embody your character’s emotions and motives—what do they want; how do they feel?Avoid thinking of the monologue as merely reciting a list of memorized words. Instead, focus on embodying and inhabiting your character—speak their words with their emotions.

, Rehearse your monologue in the shower; recite it in front of your pets, friends, and family; say your lines over in your head as you buy groceries and go to the gym. Repeated practice will boost your confidence and help you feel less nervous. Plus, you’ll even start to enjoy the monologue and be able to personalize your delivery."

Memorize the list above.,
Since the numbers and the objects rhyme, you can create your own number objects for numbers eleven and up.,
Take the list of things you need to memorize and picture each item in your mind with the number objects.,
Try to recall these things fifteen minutes later by thinking of a number, that number's object, and then the thing you are trying to remember (which is associated with then number object).",How to Memorize a List Using Numbers and Rhyming Words,";
, The more unusual and strange the objects are, the better it is for you to remember it.

, For instance, pretend that you are trying to memorize the following things: cup, rice, turkey, grass, pencil, sad, computer, guitar, needle, rabbit. Now take each item and associate them with each number item so that you picture in your mind: one is a bun - a cup between 2 buns; two is a shoe - a shoe filled with grains of rice; three is a tree - a turkey sitting on a tree; four is a door - a door covered with grass; five is a hive - a pencil sticking out of a beehive; six bricks - a bunch of sad-faced bricks; seven is heaven - a computer sitting on a mass of clouds in front of the golden gate of heaven; eight is a plate - a guitar sitting on top of a plate; nine a glass of wine - needles in a glass of wine (ouch!); ten is a pen - a rabbit writing something with a pen in his hand.

, For example, (if you follow the example shown in this so far) think of the number three: three is a tree. What is sitting on that tree? Check back to see if you got it right. Does it work? I hope so, it sure does work for me!

Move to aid memory.",How to Memorize a Long Poem2," The act of writing information by hand corresponds to greater retention and memory recall. Copy the first line and write it out ten times. After several times of rewriting the line, you will begin to remember the full line. For the tenth time, try to write the line without looking at your previous writing., As you get comfortable with the first line, restart the process with the second line by writing it out ten times. Repeat this each day to add additional lines to the material that you have memorized.


Connect new material to the lines that you have already learned. Review familiar lines that precede new lines to reinforce the larger structure and order of the poem in your mind.

, Periodically take a break from writing new lines to read the full poem. Reading the poem aloud will help you see memorized portions in the proper context of the full poem.

, You will forget portions of the poem if you do not review frequently. Recite the growing portions of the poem that you have memorized either to yourself or to an audience of friends.


Review the lines that you are working on learning while you are commuting, exercising, or running errands. This can reinforce your efforts to truly know the poem by transferring your knowledge between visual and verbal formats regularly. Additionally, this can keep your mind occupied while you perform monotonous tasks.
The more you memorize, the longer review will take. Spend more time on learning new lines, but review memorized portions daily as well. Read the portions that you have memorized aloud before you work on new lines. Occasionally, write them out again to reinforce earlier efforts.

, Once you have completed the full poem in this way, recite it from memory. Put the text of the poem away, so that you cannot see it, and record yourself as you recite it aloud from memory. You may not get the whole poem exactly, but do not look at the poem until you are finished.


Read the poem while listening to this second recording. Note any mistakes and use them to determine which sections of the poem require the most review.
Compare your original and final recordings. Note any different choices in emphasis or rhythm. These changes will help you identify how your understanding of the poem has developed.

, A mnemonic device can be simple to memorize and serve as a guide to help jog your memory without looking at the original poem. By creating a series of associations between parts of the poem, you will make it easier to remember the individual parts of the poem and how they fit together. Memorize the first letters of each stanza so that you can give yourself a hint about a line that you are having difficulty recalling.

, Walking around and performing actions that correspond to the poem can help you memorize the poem, especially once you are working on long sections. The body and mind are linked, so using gestures and movement will lead to improved results as you work on memorization."

If you have a long time, you should still start right away so that you can spread the process over more days and weeks.

, You will be able to memorize more of the poem if you keep it fresh in your mind. Repetition helps with memory, even if rote repetition is not enough.Work on learning new lines during quiet and calm moments. Memorize when your mind is clear and distractions won’t create disruptions.
Work in small chunks of time. You will exhaust your mind if you try to memorize too much at once. Rather than spend an hour trying to memorize the poem, set aside several fifteen minute sessions to learn new lines and review memorized portions.

, After reading the section that you want to memorize, take a nap. Sleeping helps the brain reinforce information that has been learned recently., You can sneak in extra time to review the poem during the minutes that you walk between offices or classes. Exercise improves thinking, and studies have linked aerobic exercise like walking to improved memory."

, Prayer is so powerful, but you will never know just how much God works in your life until you come to Him every day with what's concerning you.

, Say it out loud with the reference (e.g., John 3:16) once at the beginning of the verse, once at the end. This way, the numbers you'll memorize the reference faster.

, Vary the speeds of your recitation. Focus on pronouncing each word clearly.

, If you are memorizing John 3:16, ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son and that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life"", the key words would be ""God"", ""loved"", ""world"", ""Son"", ""whoever"", ""believes"", ""perish"", ""eternal"", and ""life"". Now put them back together with the whole verse.

, Using dry-erase markers, write the verse on a dry-erase board. Make sure you can read what you wrote. Read the verse a few times, then erase 2 words at a time. Keep saying the verse until all the words are erased. If you were able to say the verse perfectly with no words on the board, give yourself a pat on the back.

, Recite verses in your head while you're at the supermarket. Say them out loud as you walk your dog. When you think you have it down, recite the verse(s) for your family and friends!

, Post these around your room in places you go most (your bed, above your light switch, your bathroom mirror, etc.)

Split your paragraph into short phrases that make sense to you.,
Mark these short phrases onto a copy of the script you have to learn so you can clearly see them.

,
Read the first phrase out loud.,
Then without looking at the script, try to repeat it again.

,
Now, read the first and second phrase out loud slowly, whilst reading them on the paper.

,
Read them without using your script.

,
Keep adding phrases until you know the whole script.

Make a schedule.,
Memorize a little bit each day.,
Break the essay down into parts.,
Read the essay out loud to start learning it.,
Test yourself after reading.,
Start from the end if going from the beginning is not working.,
Break up your study session to memorize quickly.",How to Memorize an Essay1," Plan out how long you have to memorize the essay. If you have more time, you can study a little each day for twenty or thirty minutes. If you only have a day or two, you can memorize it in thirty-minute chunks with an hour or two break in between., Start early when you need to memorize something. Give yourself one day for every paragraph or page. Master one section each day. Once you have memorized two sections separately, try putting them together., Memorization is easiest when done in small chunks. Break the essay down into small sections. Depending on the length of the essay, each section might be a few sentences, one paragraph, or even one page., Reading the essay out loud is important because it forces you to read and speak every single word in the essay. This will help you remember it., After you have studied the text for a while, put it down, and recite as much as you can from memory. At first, you may not remember much, but every time you practice, you will recall more and more.Use a partner to test you on what you've memorized. If you miss a word or forget a line, they can prompt you by telling you the next word or two.

, If the essay is long, you may find it easier to start at the end. Begin by memorizing the last sentence or paragraph, then move backwards to the sentence or paragraph right before that one., If you only have a short time to learn the essay, you should study it in small doses with breaks in between each session. Use memory boosting techniques, such as visualization and walking back and forth, to help make your memorization more effective.For example, you might study it for fifteen minutes and take a ten minute break before studying for another fifteen minutes.
Try writing out the essay once or twice. This can improve your memory.Avoid cramming the night before. Memorizing something in one session is not the most effective way to learn it. Repetition in small chunks will help more than cramming the essay all in one long session.

Let's say that your list is: Fish, Queen Elizabeth, The Louisiana Purchase, A dust mop, and Harry Potter.

,
Imagine that you walk through your front door into the living room.,
Picture a great big giant fish in your living room (or something to that effect.),
Picture yourself walking into the next room, which is the Kitchen.

,
Picture Queen Elizabeth eating tea and crumpets (She's British, remember?),
Lets say that after your Kitchen is the Dining Room.,
To sum it up, you basically need to picture yourself walking through your house, with one of your words in that room.

Memorizing letters is also another useful way to memorize a list.

,
For example, say that your list is: Darren, Andrea, Xavier, Ellie and Sam.

,
Take a good look at the names first.,
Then, take the first letter of each name/word.,
Memorise the acronym- DAXES, for example, could be memorised by thinking of axes, then adding the letter D in front.

,
Now, whenever you need to remember that list, remember the acronym, and from that, you will remember the names/words.",How to Memorize a List in Order3,",, Make sure that you are familiar with the names and spellings.

, In this example, this will be DAXES- D for Darren, A for Andrea, so on.

Visualize parts of the essay.,
Use memory palace techniques.,
Link passages to physical movement.,
Give yourself cues if you will present the essay.",How to Memorize an Essay2," Associate different parts of the essay with images. You might imagine the essay coming to life as you recite it. When you need to recite the essay, recall the images to help you remember the words.For example, the first part of the essay might be about tiger conservation, so you might visualize tigers as you go through this part. The second part may be about their habitat, so you might think about a jungle.

, Imagine a room or building that represents your essay. For every main point, place a piece of furniture inside. Associate each piece of furniture with a point you have to remember.For example, if the main parts of the essay are about family, cooperation, and communication, you might imagine a photograph (family), a table (cooperation), and a telephone (communication).
When you need to recall the essay, imagine yourself walking from the photograph to the table and then to the telephone in the proper order.

, Gestures can help you memorize parts of the essay by associating words with movements. You might tap out a certain pattern when you start a paragraph, or gesture outwards to emphasize a particular word.Pacing can help improve recall. Some people even find doing a simple dance to be useful as they try to memorize the essay.

, As you memorize the speech, give yourself a prompt or cue that can remind you which part goes where.Practice hand gestures with your speech. Put certain gestures at specific spots in the essay.
If you are allowed to use flashcards, you might write the basic outline on a series of cards. Glance down at these as you go along.
You might ask a friend in the audience to give a signal if you are forgetting a line.

Reduce it to an outline to remember the main points.,
Make flashcards if you want to learn quotes.,
Draw the main ideas of the essay if you are a visual learner.",How to Memorize an Essay3," Write an outline of the essay's main ideas, concepts, and arguments. Make sure you only include the most important information, and organize it in the correct order. You might memorize the outline instead of the entire essay., If you need to recall quotes from literary or academic essays, write the quotes on flashcards. Memorize the quotes one at a time. Make sure you also learn the author, year, and any other information that may be tested., Sketch out a flowchart or map of the main ideas of the essay. Put the thesis in the center of the chart, and draw lines out to its supporting ideas.When you need to remember the essay, you can redraw the chart to help you remember all the different pieces you need to recall.
You can also draw images in your chart or sketch out the main events of the essay in comic form.

Understand how short term memory works.,
Know the limitations of compensating for poor short term memory.,
Keep your brain active.,
Seek out brain exercises.",How to Increase Your Short Term Memory1," Your short term memory can be thought of as the “holding tank” your brain uses to temporarily hold information while determining whether to filter it out (and forget it) or move it along into your long-term memory.It is often said that your short term memory can hold about seven items of information at one time, for a period of time of typically 10-15 seconds (but even up to a minute).People sometimes associate the concept of short term memory problems with the kind of amnesia you might see on a daytime soap opera, but it is more an issue with taking in new information and effectively determining its need for long-term storage.;
, Jotting down notes, keeping a voice recorder handy, or tying strings on your fingers might help you make it through your daily routines, but they won’t facilitate any improvement of your short term memory.The only route to increasing your short term memory is through brain exercise and techniques to improve your focus and association skills.

, Like any other part of the body, brain inactivity can lead to weakness and decline. A more active brain is a more healthy brain, and a healthy brain is better with short term memory.


Interact with people. The simple act of having a conversation with someone can help keep the brain more active. Even better would be to play chess, do puzzles together, or anything that challenges your brain to work harder.Stimulate your mind when alone as well. Don’t just sit in front of the TV. Read a book; even better, write a book.

, There are many games and tests, some of which you can set up with items in your junk drawer, that can give your brain a good (and enjoyable) workout. Sitting down to do a few puzzles or other brain exercises twice a day can be enough to keep your memory powers from stagnating.Use flash cards. They worked in elementary school, and they can work now. Specialized memory card games are great, but even trying to remember a series of playing cards can work.
Do test games such as laying everyday items out on a tray, then covering the tray and trying to remember everything on it. Add items as your recall improves.
There are a wide range of books and games with brain exercises available for purchase, as well as convenient online resources. Try out different options and see what works for you.

Read through your script once.,
Divide up the parts by scenes.,
Do step two, for all of your other scenes.

,
Once you've learned all of your lines in all of your scenes, it's time to memorize everything, and remember it!,
Break your script down into manageable chunks.,
Get a piece of notebook paper.,
Continue rewriting and speaking the section.,
Move to the next section.

,
Repeat the above steps until you have memorized all your lines.

","How to Learn All Your Lines for a Play, in One Day"," Read every part that has you in it. Once you've read it a time or two, listen to your music (If you even have any.), and memorize that.

, Say, you're in scene Act 1 Scene 1, and you have about 20 lines. Go over each paragraph. (Line.) Start with one line, then two lines, and so on. Once you have memorized one line, go on to the next one, read it about five times, then read that line, and the one before it. And so on, until you have memorized all of your lines, in said scene.

,, Do what you have done in steps two and three, only not in paragraphs, in scenes. If it's hard to do all together, read scenes one and two, over and over again, take a break, then move on to your other scenes.

, Try not to do more than two lines at once.;
, Write down your line, speaking it as you write it. This will help your mind process the line in four ways—reading, writing, speaking, and hearing.

"
Focus on what you want to remember.,
Use all your senses.,
Utilize mnemonics.,
Try “chunking.” Chunking is process related to mnemonics that involves breaking up a string of data into more digestible pieces.,
Lay out “memory bait.” When you have too much information to process into short term memory, try focusing on particular parts of the whole to create a foundation in your mind for creating additional memories on the topic.",How to Increase Your Short Term Memory2," Often people who assume they have a short term memory problem actually have a focus problem. Do you always forget your waiter’s name because you never actually pay attention when he gives it?


Some theorize that because 8 seconds is roughly the minimum time it takes to transfer a short term memory to long term memory, you should narrowly concentrate on an item you want to remember for at least that period of time.Block out distractions. If you want to remember that waiter’s name, put down the menu, ignore the restaurant’s mood music and your kids’ complaints, and look at and listen to him when he gives it.

, We’ve all experienced a scent or sound that triggers a memory from long ago. Utilizing your senses when adding to your short term memory enhances focus and builds associations that serve as markers for future recall.


When you meet someone new and want to remember his name, engage as many of your senses as you can. Listen carefully and look directly at him as he states his name; repeat it immediately afterward; shake his hand and take notice of his grip; and even take notice of his cologne if possible. The more sensory associations you build, the more firmly the memory is encoded.Repeating a name, or anything else you want to remember, out loud is always a good way to help strengthen a particular short term memory. Listen to yourself saying the word or phrase, and keep doing so with regularity.

, Do you remember learning “Roy G. Biv” in school to keep track of the order of colors in a rainbow? This acronym is one type of mnemonic device, a visual or verbal memory technique that allows you to build associations among pieces of information.


Construct colorful, even silly visualizations to help encode a short-term memory. For instance, picture a pile of trash falling onto your head when the clock strikes six to remind you to take out the trash each evening.Singing the “ABC Song” to the tune of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” is a familiar childhood mnemonic that uses an auditory cue. For more examples of mnemonics using number, color, and other associations, see How to Improve Your Memory.

, Perhaps the most common example is using hyphens to break up the string of digits in a phone number, because three groups of 3, 3, and 4 numbers is easier to remember than a string of 10.Remembering a grocery list might be a challenge, but can be made more manageable by grouping the items by category -- dairy, produce, meat, etc. Six smaller shopping lists is easier to recall than one larger one.

,


For instance, if you need to memorize a list of major U.S. Civil War battles in order, pick out a handful of key ones and commit them to memory. With those firmly established, the additional information will be more likely to “stick” to the existing memories -- or to follow the bait into your memory banks, so to speak."
"
Eat a brain-healthy diet.,
Address existing health conditions.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Keep blood flowing to your brain with exercise.",How to Increase Your Short Term Memory3," By and large, the healthy, balanced diet you should strive to achieve for overall health is also what is needed for a healthy brain that is better primed to encode memories. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, add in lean proteins and whole grains, and cut back on saturated fats, sodium, and sugars.


Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, soybeans, and walnuts, seem to be particularly beneficial to the brain and thus memory-building.There are omega-3 and other nutritional supplements marketed as good for the brain and memory. These are an option, but it is usually considered better to get your vitamins and nutrients through food.
Drink plenty of water as well. Dehydration negatively impacts the brain along with the rest of the body.

, In the same way that a healthy body fosters a healthy mind and therefore healthy memory abilities, unhealthiness and illness can hamper your short term memory.


Any circulatory problem that affects blood flow to the brain -- high blood pressure, for instance -- can have a negative effect on short term memory. But other conditions like diabetes, thyroid problems, cancers, and so on can likewise have an impact.Depression can also negatively impact memory abilities, particularly because it can impede your ability to focus.
Some medications are known to have short term memory problems as part of their side-effects. If a person finds out that their medication is a factor in memory issues, they can always talk to their doctor about it.
Practically anyone who thinks they may have short term memory problems worries about Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Short term memory loss is indeed one of the first signs of Alzheimer's, but the significant majority of people with short term memory problems do not have that condition.Even if you do have the misfortune of finding out you have some form of dementia, nourishing and exercising your brain and body, and working with your medical team to develop the best regimen of medications for your specific case, offers the best chance to delay onset of the disease.

, A nightly pattern of 7-9 hours of sleep each night will allow your brain and body to adequately rest and recharge.There is some thought that “sleeping on a memory” -- focusing on something you want to remember before falling asleep -- can help firmly establish it in your mind. The brain continues to work even while you sleep.

, Regular exercise, even as simple as walking, increases blood flow to the brain, thereby supplying it with more of the oxygen and nutrients it needs to be healthy, strong, and more capable of increase in short term memory.Walking in particular is a good activity for establishing a memory because it gives you time to focus on the memory while also benefiting from the increased blood flow.

Write down the numbers 1-10 on a piece of paper and place the keyword for each next to it, from memory.

, For example, we have a simple shopping list: a dozen eggs, a box of salt, a box of rice, a half dozen bananas, a loaf of bread, a grapefruit, shoelaces, 2 bars of Ivory soap, maple syrup, and a box of pretzels.


A dozen eggs is your first item. Bun, you remember is your first word. Think of taking a bun in your hand and banging it down on a carton of eggs until every egg is broken. Or think of taking an egg, shell and all, and putting it between two buns and biting into this egg sandwich!
A box of salt is your next item. Shoe is your next key word. Think of pouring a box of salt into a shoe. Think of scooping mounds of salt off the ground with your shoe. Think of salting your shoe and eating it!
Flea is next, for a box of rice. Think about a flea using a grain of rice like a weightlifter.
Half a dozen bananas. Key word-Door. Think of six doors shaped exactly like big bananas. Think of peeling the doors. Think of throwing bananas against the door until they are squashed.
Loaf of bread. Key word-Hive. Think of a bee hive made of a loaf of bread, with bees swarming around it.
A grapefruit. Key word-Sticks. Think of taking pointed sticks and driving them through a grapefruit-and imagine the grapefruit juice squirting in your eyes.
Shoelaces. Key word-Heaven. Think of angels dropping shoelaces out of the sky. Think of an angel tying her shoelace and breaking it.
Two bars of Ivory Soap. Key word-Gate. Think of an iron spike gate with two bars of soap stuck on the spikes. Think of making soap from an elephants tusk-of ivory.
Maple syrup. Key word-Pine. Think of a huge vat of syrup being poured over a pine tree. Think of dipping a pine tree in maple syrup and stirring it.
Box of pretzels. Key word-Hen. Think of a hen laying a pretzel-shaped egg. Think of pretzels all over the ground, with hens running over them and crumbling them.

, Next to each one write the grocery item it stands for.

Work out.",How to Improve Your Focus and Memory," The key to focus is, rather obviously, the ability to drown out distractions. Since the average office worker is distracted once every 3 minutes, it’s important to eliminate distractions before beginning a task.Such awareness will go a long way toward gaining focus.


Tune out distractions by removing brightly colored images out of your field of vision, such as on a computer screen. Some people find that removing the dock (the bar at the bottom of the screen) from the desktop helps with focus.Get comfortable before performing a task. Discomfort will draw attention away from what you’re trying to do.
Put away your phone. If you don’t have any calls or texts scheduled for a block of time, turn it off before you start a new task.;
, Not only that, but this one-at-a-time philosophy ensures that you move more slowly through your day, preventing careless mistakes. You can keep yourself from committing to too many tasks at once by prioritizing your tasks at the beginning of the day.

, If you’re in a setting with too many people or objects and you can’t get a task completed, it’s time to find a new spot. Moving off by yourself when you’re in a crowd automatically reduces the number of distractions in your vicinity. And if it’s possible, take a walk or get in the car and relocate to an entirely new place. Such movement will change your perspective and remove distractions.

, White noise is that fuzzy sound we hear on the radio when switching between stations. It’s a simple sound that literally drowns out noise, isolating you in pretty much any environment. Some apps and websites provide white noise generators, but you can also purchase machines that look like alarm clocks that do the same thing. In a pinch, a fan or blow dryer can accomplish the same goal.


Research has varied results when testing white noise.Experiment with your own preferences while taking notice of your stress levels and ability to focus., If you’re in a setting conducive to wearing headphones—an office job, the gym, public transport, etc.—putting on a set is the perfect way to focus on a task. Not only can you turn on any noise you need, it’s a signal to others that you want to be left alone.


For example, headphones are the perfect place to turn on white noise, music, even a podcast. Just make sure your music isn’t distracting and that your podcast isn’t too interesting!

, Playing memory card games like we did when we were kids is a good place to start, but you might want to move on to more complicated puzzles like you can find in smartphone apps like Luminosity.


Look for challenging individual puzzles that you can play when you have downtime. It’s especially helpful to search for puzzle apps and install them on your phone.
Real-life games are also good for your brain. The daily crossword and Sudoku are a challenge, and traditional puzzles work too—the higher the piece count, the more the challenge!

, Adding reading into your daily routine can slow down memory loss in old age. When you read, you are triggered to imagine things outside your experience, which keeps your brain active. Reading also relaxes a busy mind because it creates something to focus on. , It‘s tempting to use a calculator for even simple math—after all, every cell phone and computer has one built in. But performing math in your head boosts your working memory, the part of your brain that stores memories for immediate use., When you don’t have a schedule to follow each day, your mind struggles to balance daily tasks. You lose focus because you’re trying to remember all the things you need to accomplish, which results in forgetting your tasks. A regular schedule can eliminate this struggle.


Storing your to-do list on paper instead of in your head frees up space in your brain for focus and memory. Write down your schedule at the beginning of each day.
Eat at regular intervals. If your mind can depend on specific mealtimes, you won’t be distracted by an urge to find food.

, Healthy eating is good, but there are actually specific foods that boost your memory. They include, not surprisingly, vegetables—green ones—as well as berries, cherries, walnuts, and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids.Dark green veggies like broccoli and leafy greens have been shown to assist in memory retention. Cabbage, though lighter in color, is also on the list.
Omega-3 fatty acids improve a host of cognitive functions such as depression, mental health, and memory. You can find them in algae and fatty fish, like salmon and sardines. They are even being studied to determine their role in reversing brain function loss due to aging., Adults need 7.5 to 9 hours of sleep every night to steer clear of sleep deprivation.Lack of sleep results in loss of sharpness not only in memory, but creativity, problem solving, and critical thinking. You really do focus better if you get enough sleep!

, Go to bed and get up at the same time everyday (even days off). A sleep routine regulates REM sleep, when your body does most of its repairing.Turn off the TV long before bedtime. Stimulation from a TV or computer screen keeps your mind busy instead of helping it shut down for the night.
Take a bath before bed. A drop in body temperature triggers the need for sleep; adding aromatherapy products (candles, oils, etc.) may increase this effect.Stop reading in bed. Again, doing something that stimulates the brain right before bed does not help you get in sleep mode, especially in the space where you need your mind to switch off quickly.

, Physical exercise can actually improve memory. One study at the University of British Columbia found that different types of memory are bulked up by different types of exercise, whether weight training or aerobic.You already knew exercise is good for the body overall, but now you know that if you want to improve your memory, you’ve got to get moving.


Develop a weekly exercise routine. Start small and gradually increase both the frequency and duration of workouts.
Join a gym and incorporate weekly visits into your schedule. Most gyms have a staff of personal trainers who can tailor a workout to your needs.
Grab a friend to help you stay motivated. Knowing someone is waiting on you for their weekly workout will help you get out the door.

4 - R. Notice we broke the letter R into four dark lines to remind us of the number four.

5 - L. We drew the dark lines of the number five in the shape of an L, to remind us that five is L and L is five.

6 - G. No trouble here-number six looks like the letter G, and the letter G looks like the number six.

7 - K. Notice that the K is drawn half dark and half light. The dark half of the K looks like the number seven has fallen down. Turn the article a quarter turn clockwise and the dark seven in the K will be standing upright.

8 - F. We stuck F inside the Top loop of the number eight because it forms and odd enough looking symbol to remind you that eight is F and F is eight.

9 - P. No trouble here-nine looks like a backward P, and P looks like a backward nine.

, Easy. The letter T sounds like the word Tea.

Two=N=Navy. Think of two Navies with their two ships painted with the number two on them.

Three=M=Ma. Three Ma's greet you when you come home from school. All three look exactly like your Ma. So you yell ""Ma, Ma, Ma.""

Four=R=Red. Four red rhymes with forehead. Think of four red heads of hair.

Five=L=Lid. Think of five lids of different sizes running around looking for the right size pots to fit onto.

Seven=K=Key. Think of the number seven with seven keys on it, jangling along while it hops on one Leg.

Eight=F=Fuzz. Think of stuffing the number eight into a huge pile of fuzz. Think of eight with fuzzy whiskers.

Nine=P=Pa. Imagine your Pa shaped like the figure nine. You say to him, ""Pa, watch your posture.""

, When you can say all nine letters and numbers in two minutes, you're doing fine.

,, We substitute the letters TS for the number Ten. But TS isn't a word, so we drop in a couple vowels-and TS becomes ToeS. Get the idea?


How about the number Eleven? What key word can you make out of it? Again, remember that the number One is the equivalent of the letter T. So the number Eleven becomes TT. Stick in a vowel and TT becomes ToT-our eleventh key word, meaning a small child.
Now let's see what we can do with the number Twelve. The number One is T. The number Two is N. Put them together and you have TN. Stick in a vowel and you have word number Twelve-TiN. (Of course we could have made the word ToN, but it wouldn't have been a picture word. TiN you can see, ToN you can't see.)
How about the Thirteenth key word? Again, the number One is T. The number Three is the letter M. Put them together and you have TM. Here again, we could make TM into ToM or TiMe-but neither is a picture word. So we'll try TiMer, a stopwatch used for timing sporting events.
One more example should clear up any questions about this system. Number Fourteen is equal to the letters TR. TRain should do it.

This is how the first twenty key words and numbers turn out to be: One=Tea, Two=Navy, Three=Ma, Four=Red, Five=Lid, Six=Guide, Seven=Key, Eight=Fuzz, Nine=Pa, Ten=ToeS, Eleven=ToT, Twelve=TiN, Thirteen=TiMer, Fourteen=TRain, Fifteen=TaiL, Sixteen=TiGer, Seventeen=TicK (The bug that bites you), Eighteen=TaFfy, Nineteen=ToP (The kind you spin), Twenty=NoSe



, Say, ""What is Nineteen?"" The letters TP must come to mind if you remember the linkups. What do you make of it? Look at the list to see if you're right. Try 20. Two is N and the number Zero is always S. NS becomes what word? Look at our list to see if you've come up with the right answer.

, The number Eight is F. The number Five is L. FL suggests what word. It's short. Its second letter is a vowel. Write out your word and check the list that follows to see if you got the right word. Notice I said the ""right"" word, the right word being the right word for you. Remember, you can always come up with your own picture words.


This is how the last eighty key words and numbers turn out to be (in groups of ten):

Twenty-one=NeT, Twenty-two=NuN, Twenty-three=NaMetag, Twenty-four=NuRse, Twenty-five=NaiL, Twenty-six=NiaGara (Falls), Twenty-seven=NicKel (The coin), Twenty-eight=NiFe (It's really kNife, but it sounds like NiFe. This is because no other word could be found for the NF combination.), Twenty-nine=NaPkin, Thirty=MiSt,
Thirty-one=MiTt, Thirty-two=MiNe (A coal or gold mine), Thirty-three=MuMmy, Thirty-four=MiRror, Thirty-five=MaLlet (A wooden headed hammer), Thirty-six=MuG, Thirty-seven=MiKe (A microphone), Thirty-eight=MaFia (Think of a mob of gangsters with guns), Thirty-nine=MaP, Forty=RaSp (A large rough type of FiLe),
Forty-one=RaT, Forty-two=RiNk, Forty-three=RooM, Forty-four=R.R. (A railroad), Forty-five=RoLl (A bun or pastry), Forty-six=RaG, Forty-seven=RocK, Forty-eight=RaFt, Forty-nine=RiP (A tear in a sheet), Fifty=LeTtuce,
Fifty-one=LoT (A piece of ground), Fifty-two=LiNe (String or clothes line), Fifty-three=LiMb, Fifty-four=LuRe (A fishing lure), Fifty-five=LiLy, Fifty-six=LeG, Fifty-seven=LaKe, Fifty-eight=LiFt (British for elevator), Fifty-nine=LiP, Sixty=GaSpipe,
Sixty-one=GuT (intestine), Sixty-two=GuN, Sixty-three=GuM, Sixty-four=GaRter, Sixty-five=GoaL (a football goal PoSt), Sixty-six=GoGles (Eye-glasses), Sixty-seven=GooK (A gooey mess of some kind), Sixty-eight=GaFf (A spear for hooking a fish), Sixty-nine=GuPpy (A minnow, or small fish), Seventy=KiSser (Slang for a face),
Seventy-one=KiTe, Seventy-two=KiN (Think of a special relative of yours), Seventy-three=KiMono (A loose robe or gown), Seventy-four=KeRenel (A grain of corn), Seventy-five=KiLn (stove or oven), Seventy-six=KeG, Seventy-seven=KicKer, Seventy-eight=KoFee (It's really coffee, but koffee sounds the same. KF is hard to make into a picture word), Seventy-nine=KiPper (A fish), Eighty=FiSt,
Eighty-one=FooT, Eighty-two=FaN (A machine for cooling the house), Eighty-three=FeMale, Eighty-four=FiRe, Eighty-five=FiLe (A fingernail file), Eighty-six=FiG, Eighty-seven=FaKir (Think of a turbaned Indian standing before a cobra), Eighty-eight=FiFe (A flute), Eighty-nine=FoP (Think of a dandy dresser), Ninety=PoSt,
Ninety-one=PiT (A peach or plum pit), Ninety-two=PeN (A writing pen), Ninety-three=PiMple, Ninety-four=PeaR, Ninety-five=PaiL, Ninety-six=PiG, Ninety-seven=PicKle, Ninety-eight=PuFf Adder (A poisonous snake), Ninety-nine=PoPcorn, One Hundred=TiSSue.



, If you remember more than half of the words these numbers represent, you're doing very well. With time and a little practice you'll soon know all one hundred numbers.

, The three things this code involves is: One-Be absolutely confident that you can remember any name quickly, Two-Pay attention to each person you meet (I don't mean that you should stand and stare at people until they feel uncomfortable, but do talk and be friendly while you do your people-watching.), Three-Link up or associate the name with the way he or she looks or acts.


Suppose you meet a Mr. Silverman. You look him over and note-among other things-that he walks very straight. That his hair is gray-or silver. Imagine yourself pouring a vat of liquid silver over his head so that it runs down all over him, hardens, and stops him in his tracks. You've just made him a silver man. Picture him that way.
Or how about a Mrs. Saltinstall? You notice that she smiles a lot and has beautiful white teeth. Imagine her gargling with salt water. Imagine her getting to big a mouthful of salt, sputtering, and running off to her car. She jumps in it and it stalls. These two sounds-salt-stall-or just one of them, will recall her name to you the next time you see her.
How about a Mr. Franklin? Try this name yourself first, then see if some of your associations are the same as mine, even though they don't have to be the same.

Imagine Mr. Franklin flying a kite-the way Ben Franklin did. Mr. Franklin mentioned that he likes to eat-so I imagined him eating a three-foot long Frank with lint all over it. (Don't worry about calling him Mr. Hot Dog the next time you meet him.) Since Mr. Franklin says what's on his mind-I knew that he was frank-or outspoken.


We'll try one more-a Mrs. Mussel. Mussel sounds like muscle. Mrs. Mussel is skinny, about ninety pounds. That's what stays in your mind after you've looked her over. You imagine her flexing her right arm muscle and you're amazed that the muscle is huge-bigger than all the rest of her.(Another thing to remember is to get action into your mental pictures. Things in motion are easier to see than things that stand still.)

With a few weeks practice you'll be excellent at remembering names; check out the tips for more info on practice.

These courses last 4-5 sessions and typically cost between 200-250 dollars.
These training courses are offered at the Headquarters of the Fire District (FDNY) you’ll be applying to work in. Training courses can also be offered at other organizations or schools accredited by the FDNY.New York city code states that high-rises must employ one FSD during regular business hours. In the FSD’s absence, a DFSD is required to take their place on-site. Most NYC buildings employ a single FSD, and many DFSDs.FSDs (or DFSDs) are required to be on duty where there are more than 500 people in the building he or she supervises.;
, In order to show this, applicants are required to show two pieces of personal identification. These items of identification can include a driver’s license, passport ID photo, and personal birth certificate., Since the FSD training course will be conducted entirely in English, it’s necessary that participants can speak conversational English.As part of this requirement, applicants will need to be answer questions—in English—given during the course of the examination.

, Participants in the training course are required to have worked for three to five years (depending on the FDNY you’re applying to work in) in a different fire-prevention job, or in a job using building-service equipment.It’s also acceptable to apply for the FSD training course with a combination of fire-prevention and building-service-equipment jobs.

, This is separate from the FSD Written Exam. Once you’ve attended and passed the FSD training course, you will need to complete your training by taking a Graduation Test. Participants must pass with a 70% in order to move on and take the FSD Written Exam.


There is a $25 fee, to be paid before the Graduation Test., FSD Written Exams are usually offered at Fire Department Headquarters, in whichever FDNY you plan to become an FSD. For further information, you can contact FDNY Headquarters at 718-999-2000.Otherwise, look online for FDNY headquarters and firehouse locations., The Written Test should be applied for separately from the FSD training course (which you will have already completed).

Try to schedule the test within 3 weeks of FSD training completion., The FSD written examination is a rigorous exam, and test-takers have 500 minutes (8 hours, 20 minutes) to complete the 100-question exam. The Exam will cover material including fire-safety and evacuation procedures, and equipment use, safety practices, and fire-safety inspection procedures.


You should have received a FSD textbook when you passed the FSD training course. Use this as your primary study tool.

, There are multiple websites that offer sample practice FSD examinations. Take advantage of this opportunity, and complete the entire 500-minute practice exam online.

, Pace yourself on the FSD written exam. 100 questions in 500 minutes means that you can take 5 minutes on each question. Although some may take longer, try to stick to a 5-minute-per-question average. You should plan to take the full 500-minute exam time. Also plan to answer every question on the FSD written exam, even if you’re not confident in your answer.


If you fail the FSD Written Exam, you will have one more opportunity to pass the Exam.If you fail the FSD Written Exam twice, you may have to go back and re-take the training course. The training course Graduation Diploma is only valid for one year following training completion., Once you have successfully passed the FSD Written Examination (on either your first or second try), you will receive a document called a Certificate of Completion.You’ll need to have this document in hand before you go on to complete the On-Site Test and complete your FSD requirements.

, Although you will have passed the FSD Written Exam at this point, you’ll still need to complete one final portion of the FSD qualification process: the On-Site Exam. You’ll apply to take this at Fire Department Headquarters, in whichever FDNY you plan to become an FSD.


To complete the application, you’ll also need to submit a copy of the Fire Safety plan (for the building you’ll be working in as an FSD) to the FDNY Hi-Rise unit.Plan to complete the application within 4–5 weeks of having completed the FSD Written Exam., Since you’ll be taking the On-Site Test in the specific building that you’ll be working in as an FSD, study the building—and its Fire Safety plan—closely. You’ll want to be aware of fire hazards in and around the building, and the building’s built-in fire suppression equipment (sprinkler systems, etc.), This will be administered (over the course of several hours) by an FDNY inspector. You will be expected to have detailed knowledge about the structure of the building, the fire-evacuation scenarios and how to extinguish fires in the building.To pass the test, you will also need to be familiar with the building’s fire-alarm panel and how to operate the elevator.If you fail the On-Site Test the first time, you’ll be permitted to re-take the test once. The application for your second Test must be submitted within one year after receiving the Certificate of Completion from the FSD Written Exam., A Certificate of Fitness is awarded when an individual has passed both the FSD Written Examination and the On-Site Test.

Select a training package.,
Consider how you learn best before selecting one of these packages.,
Evaluate what kinds of guarantees the training package offers.,
Ask others who've passed the exam already what course materials they used, and found successful.",How to Pass the CPA Exam1," There are many high-profile vendors who offer tales or guarantees of success, and a price tag to match. Some offer ""classroom"" settings, and some offer voluminous books. Some give you the option for self-study or guided study.;
, Are you better working alone, or in a classroom setting?

, Can you retake the class at no or reduced cost if you fail to pass the exam? What are the conditions that apply?

Take notes at the time your homework is assigned.,
Ask your teacher to write the instructions on the board.,
Approach your teacher after class.,
Consult other teachers at your school who teach the same subject.",How to Do Homework You Don’t Understand1," Most teachers explain homework instructions at the time the assignment is given. If the instructions are verbal, write them down in your notebook or planner as your teacher explains the assignment. If the instructions are written, listen for any additional instructions or hints your teacher may give and take notes on those.


Review the homework assignment immediately, even if the dismissal bell is about to ring and you’re eager to leave. Ask your teacher for clarification if you don’t understand the details of the assignment.;
, If your teacher talks too fast, or you feel distracted at the time he or she explains the homework, ask your teacher to write or post the instructions where you can see them. This allows you to gather information needed to understand the assignment at your own pace.


In the short-term, this generally works best for assignments with easily summarized details--e.g., problems 1-35, odd numbers only, on page 82 in your textbook. For more complex assignments, you can ask your teacher to put the information on the board, but they may decline and offer to explain it to you after class instead.
If you consistently have trouble copying down the details of your teacher’s assignments, consider approaching them after class one day, explaining your difficulty, and asking if your teacher would be willing to start writing the details of future assignments on the board so you can copy them down without feeling rushed or panicked.

, Ask your teacher for clarification on homework instructions. If you don’t understand how to do your homework because the instructions aren’t fully clear, clarify the assignment instructions with your teacher or instructor after class ends.If you’re worried about arriving late to your next class, you can usually ask your teacher to write and sign a note explaining your tardiness to your next period’s teacher. Alternatively, you can try approaching your teacher after school ends, but this can cause a problem if your teacher leaves early or if you need to catch a bus home.
At most colleges and universities, and at some high schools, your instructors will generally have office hours posted in a syllabus or on an office door. During these hours, they’re usually available to help students with questions. You can try stopping by if you need quick clarification, but for more detailed questions, it might be better to schedule a specific time to meet., If you don’t understand the homework because your teacher explained the assignment in a way that doesn’t make sense, ask other teachers if they can explain the assignment differently.This often works best if you approach a teacher you already know, whether you know them from a previous year’s class or through an extracurricular activity. If you don’t know any other teachers, consider asking a friend in another class to introduce you to their teacher instead of approaching that teacher on your own.
Don’t worry too much about hurting your teacher’s feelings or pride. A good teacher will want what’s best for their students. That being said, be sure to avoid insulting your teacher’s ability to teach when asking for help since that may hurt your long-term relationship with your instructor.

Choose a study group.,
Look online.",How to Pass the CPA Exam2," Sometimes, studying on your own can be difficult—there are distractions, questions that seem to have no answer, and times when you just need the support of your peers.

, A Google search for ""CPA study groups"" is a good place to look.


Check out accounting forums to find people in your area who are looking to form study groups for the exam.
Social media sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook offer connections to study groups. Log in, and in the search field, enter ""CPA"" and you'll see a list of all CPA-related groups.

Ask for help from classmates.,
Check with your siblings or school-aged relatives.,
Ask for help from your parents.,
Consult a tutor.,
Email your teacher.",How to Do Homework You Don’t Understand2," Your classmates are ideal sources for helping you understand your homework, especially those who already completed the assignment or excel in the subject. You can ask your classmates for clarification on the instructions or for help in understanding the material itself.


Nowadays, it shouldn’t be too difficult to contact a few classmates through social media or texting. If you’re too young for social media accounts or your own phone, you can ask a parent to call one of your friends’ houses, instead.For help with the instructions, you’ll usually need to ask someone in your class. For help with the material, however, you might also be able to ask friends in another class who are covering the same information at the same time; in fact, their teacher may have presented the information from a different perspective, allowing them to introduce that fresh perspective to you, too.
For bigger assignments, you might even try organizing a study group for the homework assignment., If you aren’t able to get help from your classmates, older siblings and cousins can be your next best option, especially if they’re only older by a year or two. The information should still be somewhat fresh in their minds--they may even use the same principles in their current grade level assignments--so they might be able to answer any questions you have about the material.


You might also consider asking relatives who are the same age as you. It’s possible that they’re covering the same material now, or that they’ve covered it a few weeks sooner than your class has.

, While the information may not be as fresh in their minds as it would be for a sibling or cousin, your parents will still know a lot, especially if you’re learning information they use regularly or learning about a subject they enjoy.


You can ask other members of your extended family, too, such as aunts, uncles, and grandparents. Some individuals are better than others at certain subjects, and might be able to explain your homework and the subjects you’re studying in a way that helps you understand them better. For example, if you’re struggling with English, ask family members who love to read if they can help you understand your assignment.

, This option won’t be available to everyone, but if you have access to a private tutor or if your school has a tutoring center, you should definitely consider asking them for clarification on the homework material. They should be willing and able to help; after all, a tutor gets paid to help students.


Send an email or call your tutor if you have a question but aren’t scheduled to meet with them the evening you have it.
You can also ask your tutor if they have any advice on an assignment that isn’t related to the topic they tutor you for--e.g., you might ask your chemistry tutor for help on a math problem.
The worst that can happen in either scenario is that your tutor will say they are unable to help you.

, If your instructor has provided your class with an email address, and you’ve exhausted your other options, consider sending them an email asking for clarification. Try to be as specific as possible when explaining what part you don't understand, whether it deals with the instructions or the material itself, and ask direct questions that can clarify your confusion.For instance, you might type, ""I'm confused about which problem set I need to do. I thought you said the problems were on page 86 of the textbook, but there aren't any problems on that page.""
Understand that your teacher may not be able to respond right away. Even if they don't, you've at least communicated your desire to understand to your teacher, which may encourage them to spend more time on the material in future class sessions.

Read your textbook.,
Review past assignments and handouts.,
Use the Internet as a resource.,
Play games that help you better understand your homework.",How to Do Homework You Don’t Understand3," In many cases, homework assignments reflect what you’ve recently been learning in class. If you don’t understand the homework because you’re not familiar with its topic, review your class textbook to gain a better understanding.This can be especially helpful when your teacher assigns problems from your textbook or from a related workbook, but even if the assignments come from a completely different source, you can still review your textbook chapter on the same topic for additional insight.
Don't be afraid to do unassigned problems from your textbook, too. Some textbooks may have answers to even-numbered problems, for instance, in the back of the book; if your teacher assigns you the odd-numbered problems from the same chapter, do a few of the even-numbered ones and check your answers to increase your understanding of the material.If you don’t understand the way your textbook explains things, you can also go to the library and look at their collection of textbooks on the same subject. One of those might present the material in a clearer way.

, Many teachers will return assignments with corrections on them. If you have any related to the homework you’re currently working on, consult these past assignments and your teacher’s noted corrections, and try to figure out what your past mistakes were. Understanding where your processes have gone wrong in the past might help you figure out how to approach the current homework.


On a similar note, many teachers also pass out handouts related to the class material. Keep these handouts and refer back to them while doing the assignment. They may contain helpful supplementary information that isn’t in the textbook or your notes.

, If your textbooks and study materials aren’t providing you with the information you need to understand your homework, search for tips and guidance online about how to complete your assignment. For example, if your teacher assigned an essay about the subject, but you don’t know how to write essays, look for essay tutorials and sample essays that can help you get started.


For math and science problems, you could also search for free online video tutorials about the subject.For vocabulary, math problems, historical dates, and other related information, try typing the question directly into a search engine. An explanation of the material might pop up among the results.For literature assignments, you can often find online study guides or discussion guides for the work.
You may also look for a computational problem solver for math problems, or an online translator for foreign language problems. Just make sure you choose a resource that provides explanations so that you're understanding the material, instead of only getting the assignment done., Playing interactive games about topics you don’t understand can be a fun, effective way to enhance the learning experience. For example, if you’re struggling with understanding algebra homework, search online for websites that offer several free math games that can help you grasp algebraic equations.You can find interactive games on a variety of topics--from language arts to biology and everything in between.
This might work best during your grade school and middle school years. Once you start learning more advanced concepts in high school and post-secondary school, you’ll likely find fewer games dedicated to the subjects you’re studying.

Work on homework as soon as possible.,
Minimize distractions.,

Turn in your assignments.,
Review corrections when you get homework back.",How to Do Homework You Don’t Understand4," You should ideally work on any homework assignment the same day you get it, even if it isn't due until a week later. That way, you'll learn early on if you don't understand it, and you'll have more opportunity to get the help you need before the due date.The same idea also applies to homework due the following day. Working on it during study hall lets you know if you’ll need clarification before you leave school. Working on it earlier in the evening, rather than right before bed, gives you the chance to contact friends, ask an older sibling or parent for help, or email your tutor or teacher.

, This is good advice for any homework you complete, but it's especially important when working on homework you don't understand. Turn off your phone, sit in a quiet area without noise from a TV or radio, and dedicate your full attention to your homework.The exact location doesn't matter as long as it's relatively free of noise and tempting distractions. You'll need your full concentration when tackling difficult problems.

, While this won’t be applicable to every homework assignment you get, for math problems and science problems, show your work instead of only showing your answers. You may get partial credit if part of the work is accurate, but even when that isn’t the case, your teacher can still highlight where your process went wrong and provide you with the precise information you’ll need to understand the same type of problem in the future.


That said, you should still keep working at a problem until you think you’ve arrived at the right answer--or, at least, at an answer that could be correct.
If you know something went wrong or know which part of the process you don’t understand, you could also consider writing a note for your teacher to that effect. For instance, you might draw an arrow pointing at a formula you don’t know how to use correctly, with a note saying, “I know something went wrong here, but I couldn’t figure out my mistake.”, Always work on every piece of homework you get, and turn in every piece of homework, even if you didn’t fully understand it. Your teacher doesn’t expect your assignments to be perfect. They do, however, expect you to put effort into your education, and that means doing the work they assign to you.


Also keep in mind that many ideas build on each other as you progress through the material, so if you fall behind on earlier assignments, you may not learn the material you need to understand future assignments.

, When you get homework back with corrections on it, redo the incorrect work following your instructor's advice. Ideally, keep going over the corrections until you can solve the problem accurately and understand your previous mistakes.Even if your teacher doesn’t provide detailed instructions, reviewing your returned assignments will at least confirm which parts you were able to understand and which parts you’re still a little lost on. You can then approach your teacher, tutor, parents, or classmates with questions on those parts you still need help with.

Sit away from the teacher.,
Get your materials out.,
Take a few notes for the current class.,
Start working on your homework.,
Be ready to hide your homework.,
Don't look too distracted.",How to Do Homework in Class1," Sitting too close to the teacher or the front of the class can increase your chances of getting caught. It's better to sit towards the back of the class to minimize your chances of being noticed. It can also help to sit near other people, allowing you to blend in better.


The closer you are to your teacher, the harder it will be to hide your homework.
Think about where your teacher usually walks during class and try to sit away from them.;
, When you come into class and sit down, you will want to get both the current class material out and the homework that you need to finish. Having both of these out will help you work on your homework, while making it look like you are taking notes. Try keeping your homework hidden in a notebook or textbook.

, It can be a good idea to take a few notes for the class you are in, before moving onto your homework. Adding these notes can make it look like you are paying attention and doing the class work, even though you're working on your homework. You might also try occasionally taking a few notes during class to keep this impression strong.


Have your regular class book and material out on top of your desk.
Try to make it look like your focus is the current class material.

, Once you've taken a few notes, you can begin to work on your homework. Get your homework out and place it on your desk in a way that allows you to easily hide it again. Work on your homework for a few minutes before switching back to taking a few more notes for your current class.


Keep an eye out for your teacher. You may need to hide your homework quickly.
Don't get too involved with your homework. Remember, you are trying to look like you are just taking a few notes.

, You may need to hide your homework at any moment. You might try casually shuffling papers, pretending to get a new page of notes started. Maybe you can subtly slip your homework away, putting it under your current classwork. Whatever method you choose, practice and be ready for hiding your homework quickly and casually.

, Although you need to focus on getting your homework done, focusing too intently can be a giveaway. If you are not paying enough attention to your class, your teacher may notice this and investigate. Take occasional breaks to avoid drawing too much attention to yourself and getting caught.


Put your homework away and pay attention to the teacher for a few minutes.
Try asking questions and answering questions during class.
Every few minutes, look away from your homework.

Some students find it effective to use a day planner or a calendar to stay organized, while others prefer simple notebook paper or composition books. Use whatever fits in with your own organization style, and list out each night of homework in the same place.


It's common to quickly write out the math problems you're supposed to do at the top of your notes, or scribble down the page number of the English reading on a textbook page, but try to recopy this information into a specific homework list so you will be sure to remember to do it.
Write down as many details as you can about each assignment. It's good to include the due date, corresponding textbook pages, and additional instructions from your teacher. This will help you plan your night of homework more effectively. Also, it's a good idea to write about your homework in a planner.;
, It's important to spend a bit of time before you dive into your homework to make sure you understand the skills expected of you in the homework assignment. When you get a list of problems to complete in math, flip through and read all the problems, looking for potentially difficult ones. Do the easy questions first and move to the harder ones later. Look through a reading assignment to get some sense of how long it will take, how difficult the reading will be, and whether or not you'll need to complete any questions as a result of it.


Homework doesn't have to wait until you get home. Look through an assignment as soon as it's been given, so you'll have the time to ask your teacher any questions you might have before you leave school for the day.

, The best way to do homework is in a quiet space without distractions, where you'll be able to spend however much time you need to do your homework comfortably. Whether at home or elsewhere, a quiet spot is necessary for a good homework session. You might want a snack and drink just in case.



At home, a desk in your bedroom might be the best place. You can shut the door and tune out any distractions. For some students, though, this is a good way to get distracted. You might have video games, computers, guitars, and all sorts of other distractions in your bedroom. It might be a better idea to sit at the kitchen table, or in the living room, where your mom can call you out for procrastinating. You'll get it done more quickly without the temptation of distraction.

In public, the library is a great place to study and do homework. At all libraries, it's a rule that you have to be quiet, and you won't have any of the distractions of home. The school library will often stay open after school ends, making it a good option for finishing up homework before heading home, or your school may even have an after-school study spot specifically for the purpose.try to switch it up. Studying in the same place too often can make work more difficult. Some studies have shown that a change in environment can make your mind more active, since it's processing new information. You'll be able to vary your routine and remember what you learned more effectively.

, At the end of the school day, when you're getting ready to start on your homework, try to figure out what the most important assignments are and put them in the appropriate order to give yourself enough time to complete everything you need to do. This is especially important if you've got multiple assignments, or some assignments that aren't due the next day but will take multiple days to complete. You've got to divide your time appropriately, making prioritizing an important step.



Try starting with the most difficult homework. Do you really hate the idea of getting into the algebra homework? Does reading for English take the longest? Start with the most challenging homework to give yourself the most time to complete it, then move on to the easier tasks you can complete more quickly.

Try starting with the most pressing homework. If you've got 20 problems to do for tomorrow, and 20 pages to read in a novel for Friday, it's probably better to start with the math homework to make sure you'll have enough time to complete it. Make homework due the next day the priority.

Try starting with the most valuable homework. Your math homework might be difficult, but if it's only worth a few completion points, it might be less important to spend a lot of time on it than the big project for Social Studies that's due in two days. Devote the most time to the most valuable assignments.

, There are only so many hours in the day. Set aside a specific amount of time to devote to each assignment in your homework, based on how long you think each assignment should take and how much time you have to work on it in the evening. Give yourself enough time to complete each assignment and do other nightly chores.


Set an alarm or a timer to keep yourself honest. The less time you spend procrastinating and checking your text messages, the more quickly you'll be done. If you think you can finish everything in a half hour, set a timer and work efficiently to finish in that amount of time. If you don't quite finish, give yourself a few extra minutes. Treat it like a drill.
Keep track of how long you usually spend on particular assignments on average. If your math homework typically takes you 45 minutes to finish, save that much time each night. If you start plugging away for an hour, give yourself a break and work on something else to avoid tiring out.
Schedule 10 minutes of break time for every 50 minutes of work time. It's important to take study breaks and give your mind a rest, or you'll work less effectively. You're not a robot!

, It's distracting and difficult to go searching for a ruler or a protractor after you're in the middle of your geometry homework, and it can be difficult to get back into it after going on a hunt that takes a half hour. If you've planned effectively, you should know exactly what you'll need to complete the assignment and can set up everything in your study space you'll need.


Once you go into your space and start working, try not to leave until you've got a break scheduled. If you want a drink, get it now before you start. Hit the bathroom and make sure you'll be able to work for the amount of time before your next break, uninterrupted.

, Put your phone away, get away from your computer, and make your environment as quiet as possible. Giving homework your undivided attention will actually make it easier, because your mind won't be balancing different tasks at the same time.


It's common that students will try to multi-task, watching TV or listening to the radio or continuing to chat on Facebook while also trying to do homework. It'll be so much more fun to do those things after you're already done with your homework, though, and your homework will take half as much time if you're focused on doing nothing but your homework.
Check your phone or your social networking sites during your study break, but not before. Use these distractions as a carrot, not as a pacifier.

, Finish each assignment completely and check it off your list before moving on to the next item. It's usually better to finish one thing completely, so you can put it out of your mind and move on to other things. Focusing on individual tasks helps to keep you focused. Put all the other assignments out of your mind and focus on the task at hand. Maybe you could even ask a close friend or family to help you.


If one assignment proves challenging and time consuming, it's okay to switch for a while to something else. Just make sure to save enough time to circle back and give it another shot.

, Set a specific amount of time you will spend every hour doing something besides homework, and stick to it. Be sure you set how long after the start of the hour, and how long you will take. Don't let your break be too long though! You could start doing something and not want to go back to work!


try to figure out what works best for you. Some students might like to start their homework immediately after school to get it done as quickly as possible, while it may be better to give yourself an hour to relax before starting in on it and decompress from the long school day.
While it may seem like a better idea to work straight through and finish, it's possible that the quality of the work you're doing will start to suffer if you don't give your mind a rest. It's difficult to think hard for more than 45 minutes at a time on a particular subject. Give yourself a rest and come back refreshed.

, Don't let breaks balloon out into longer and longer breaks, or ""being done."" It can be difficult to want to go back to working after you've let yourself take a break, but try to find the end in sight and work hard until you get there.


The first fifteen minutes after a break are your most effective minutes, because your mind will be cleared and ready to work. Give yourself a pep talk and dive back in, refreshed and ready.

, Put a carrot at the end of your homework, like a new episode of your favorite show, or a chunk of video game time. Make it something that you didn't get to do during your study breaks, so it'll be more attractive to keep working and finish completely.


If you have trouble staying focused, get a parent, sibling, or friend to help keep you honest. Give them your phone while you're working to avoid the temptation to check it, or give them the video game controller so you won't be able to plug in for a few minutes of alien-hunting when you're supposed to be doing your homework. Then, when you're finished, show them the finished product and earn back your fun. Make it impossible to cheat.

, As tempting as it may be to bull-rush through your math homework to get to the Halo at the end of the tunnel, slow down and do it effectively. There's no sense in doing it if you're just doing it wrong to get it done. try to let the homework take as long as it needs to take to make sure you do it correctly.


You can make yourself take enough time by having your gate-keeper (the person with your phone or video game controller) check over your homework for quality when you're done. If you know you're not going to get it anyway unless it's done right, you won't have any reason to rush. Slow down and do it right.

, When the last problem is done, or when the last sentence is written, don't just slam your book close and jam your homework into your backpack. Take a short break and return to your homework with fresh eyes to read it over and look for obvious mistakes. Fixing spelling errors, typos, or obvious addition-errors is a great way to give yourself the extra points you deserve. If you go to all the trouble to do it, you might as well take a few extra minutes to make sure you do it right.

, It's a lot easier to come up with reasons to do other things, and avoid doing your homework. But if you struggle to finish and find the time to complete your homework on a regular basis, this kind of procrastination is probably to blame. The easiest way to steal extra time for your homework? Just do it. Now.Do you really need an hour of TV or computer after school to decompress? It might be easier to just dive into your homework and get it done while the skills are still fresh in your mind. Waiting a couple hours means you'll have to review your notes and try to get back to the same place you already were. Do it while it's fresh.
If you've got three days to read an assignment, don't wait until the last evening to do it all. Space it out and give yourself more time to finish. Just because you've got a due date that's a long time away doesn't mean it wouldn't be easier to finish now. Stay ahead of the game. Try either waking up earlier or going to bed later. But don't get too tired!

, You'd be surprised how much time you've probably got hidden throughout the day that you might be able to use more effectively. A long bus ride is a great opportunity to do some of your less-intense homework, or at least get started on looking through it to plan how you'll do it when you get home.


If you've got to read a bunch of stuff for homework, read on the bus. Pop in some headphones to white noise that'll drown out the shouting of other students and tune into your book.
The bus can be distracting, or it can be a great resource. Since it's full of your classmates, try to get other students to work with you and get things done more quickly. Work together on the math problems and try to figure out things together. It's not cheating if everyone's doing the work and no one's just copying. Also, you might make some new friends while you're at it!

, Sometimes passing periods are quite long, as much as 10 minutes. If you get to your next class quickly without dallying in the hallway to talk to your friends, you can steal as much as an hour throughout the school day to work on your homework in between classes. Imagine knocking out an entire math assignment the day it was assigned and not even having to bring your book home.


Don't rely on this time to finish homework just before it's due. Rushing to finish your last few problems in the five minutes before you need to turn it in looks bad in front of the teacher, plus it doesn't give you any time to review your homework after you finish it. Rushing is a good way to make mistakes. And always check difficult problems you had trouble with.

, If you've got an hour to kill before sports practice, you could spend it messing around or you could spend it finishing your homework. Don't make excuses that there aren't enough hours in the day if you spend some of those hours wasting time waiting for something. Use your time wisely and you'll be racing through homework in no time at all!


Work on your homework while you're waiting for a ride, while you're killing time at your brother's soccer game, or while you're waiting for your friend to come over. Take advantage of any extra time you have in the day.

, The first, best, and most important resource for homework help should be the teacher who assigned it. If you struggle with an assignment the night before it's due and it ends up taking a long time, don't keep beating your head against the wall. It's okay to stop when you can't figure something out after a serious effort and ask your teacher for help. However, many teachers find this annoying and ask students to at least try.


Asking for help with your homework isn't a sign that you're bad at the subject or that you're ""stupid."" Every teacher on the planet will respect a student that takes their homework seriously enough to ask for help. Especially ask if you weren't there that day!
Asking for help isn't the same thing as complaining about the difficulty of homework or making excuses. Spending ten minutes doing half your math problems and leaving most of them blank because they were hard and then telling your teacher you need help isn't going to win you any favors on the due date. If it's hard, see your teacher ahead of time and find the time to get help.

, Many schools have after-school tutoring services or help desks for students who need a little extra help with their homework. It can be very helpful to have someone to look over your work, sit with you while you complete it, and keep you working diligently.


If there's not an organized homework help group at your school, there are many private tutoring organizations that work both for-pay and non-profits. Sylvan Learning Center and other businesses have after-school hours that you can schedule appointments at to get help studying and completing your homework, while community centers like the YMCA, or even public libraries will often have homework help hours in your area.
Getting help doesn't mean that you're bad at your homework. All variety of students visit tutoring centers for extra help, just to make sure they have enough time and motivation to get everything done. It's hard being a student! There's no shame in extra help. Imagine being afraid to ask for anything! You wouldn't be able to ask in restaurants, shops, anywhere!

, Find other students in your class that you look up to and work on your homework together. Help each other out by working on your homework at the same time to keep each other honest, and pool your resources.


Make sure that your group study sessions don't cross the line into cheating. Dividing up an assigned so your friend does half and you copy each other's answers is considered cheating, but discussing a problem and coming up with a solution together isn't. As long as you each do the work separately, you shouldn't have any problems.

, Use your parents, older siblings, or other relatives as a resource if you struggle with your homework. They've all been there and been through what you've been through, even if it was a long time ago. Having something to listen to your ""This math is so hard!"" complaints can be a helpful release, even if they can't quite clue you into the proper approach.


Some parents don't necessarily know how to help with your homework and might end up doing too much. Try to keep yourself honest. Asking for help doesn't mean asking your parent to do your work for you.
Likewise, some older relatives have outdated ways of completing specific tasks and might suggest forcefully that something you learned in class is wrong. Always use your teacher's approach as the correct approach, and discuss these alternative ways of completing an assignment with your teacher if necessary.

This will allow you to break your workload up into discrete, manageable sections.Gather all your assignments together and make a list of all you need to get done. Seeing the assignments clearly laid out will give you an idea of how to pace your work.;
, On your first day of vacation, take a half-hour to plan out your study schedule for the summer. This simple exercise will dramatically reduce the stress you feel as you approach your summer homework. A well-planned schedule will make it so you never have to wonder if you’re getting behind., Plan to devote one to two hours a day, five days a week, to studying. If you split up your assignments into the number of weeks you have to complete your work, you’ll never get off track.If your assignment is to read a book, total up the number of pages in the book and divide it into the number of days in your summer vacation. For example, if the assigned book is 360 pages long and your summer vacation is 90 days long, divide 360 by 90, which equals 4. That means you have to read 4 pages per day to finish the book over the summer. Not too bad!
If your assignment is to complete four chapters of a math textbook, look at the practice problems for the four chapters and add up the total number. Then divide that number by the number of days in your summer vacation. For example, if there are 225 questions per chapter, that means you need to complete 900 problems over the summer. Divide 900 by 90, which equals 10. That means you need to complete 10 math problems a day to complete all four chapters by the end of the summer.

, If you have more than one subject to get done over the summer, try breaking up your days into different subjects. For example, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday you might do reading assignments, and on Tuesday and Friday you might work on math problems.

, Use that time to work on assignments that you may have missed or to work ahead so you don’t have to feel stressed out on your days off.


For example, if you’re flying somewhere for a family vacation, that’s a perfect time to get a chapter read or a few math problems completed.

, It’s inevitable that you’ll have to miss a few days of school work for birthdays, parties, or vacations. Include these in your schedule up front so you can plan around them from the get-go.For example, if your family is planning on taking a four-day vacation over the Fourth of July, mark these days off in your calendar since you probably won’t get any work done.

, Having summer homework doesn’t mean you need to sacrifice your entire vacation. Taking the first week off just means you’ll need to squeeze in a small amount of extra work every other day—probably just ten minutes or so.A week off at the beginning of the summer will give you a welcome break between the end of the school year and the start of your summer workload.
Try to do something fun to unwind during this week off.

, Since it’s summer, you won’t have daily access to teachers like you do during the school year. However, this shouldn’t stop you from reaching out for help when you need it.Before the summer, ask your teacher if you can contact them over the summer if you have questions. Most teachers will be happy to help you, and if they’ll be unavailable they can point you to someone else who can answer your questions.
If no teachers are available, ask your parents or other students who are working on the same summer assignments.

, Write down your weekly goals on index cards and pin them next to your desk or on your door. If you meet your goals, give yourself a small reward.For example, you might write “Read chapters four and five” on your index card. When Friday comes and you’ve met your goal, you might reward yourself with a movie.
Don’t skip this step. Even little rewards will help to keep you motivated throughout the summer.

, Choosing a specific date by when you plan to finish all of your summer homework will give you something to look forward to. Depending on how much work you have to complete over the summer, you can set this date to one or two weeks before the new school year starts."

Make a concept map.,
Create a comparison chart.,
Write out concept cards.,
Make a summary sheet.,
Gather all of the sources you will need.,
Use your textbook as a source.,
Pull from your notes.,
Use your homework to guide you.,
Use your previous tests to guide you.,
Split your information into subjects.,
Try these examples to help you organize your study guide.,
Don’t jam too much information into your study guide.,
Keep your study guide’s visual presentation simple.",How to Create a Basic Study Guide," Concept maps or branching diagrams are a way of mapping ideas so you can easily follow information from general to specific. Concept maps are best for people who learn visually, allowing you to draw connections between things.


An example of a concept map would be placing the title of a chapter at the center of the map, with lines going to each main topic addressed within the chapter. Each topic could then have lines going to supporting evidence, providing you with an easy visual map of the content in the chapter.
These study guides resemble flow charts and involve using broad ideas with branches to subsidiary ideas.
Concept maps let you arrange your information spatially, in an expanding web, instead of in a linear format like most study guides.
Start with a main topic in the center, then draw branches from it with each supporting piece of information.;
, Comparison charts are an easy way to organize information you want to compare. This method is most effective if you are trying to establish similarities and differences between facts, theories or subjects.


Comparison charts let you see relationships between specific characteristics or categories.
Comparison charts are particularly helpful in science classes where you may be trying to identify relationships between organisms.
A good use for a comparison chart may be identifying the similarities and differences between the American and French revolutions or something with both coinciding and differing elements.
Create a table with the topics listed in a column followed by columns for various pieces of information that relates or differs from each.

, Concept cards are well organized flash cards. They should usually be made on index cards that are three inches by five inches or larger. Concept cards are great for helping you memorize material and quiz yourself on subjects like math, science or history.


Write the key idea or concept on the front of the card along with the category (if there is one) and the source you used to gain the information.
Write the most important content pertaining to the idea or concept on the back of the card.
Summarize information to make it easy to go over as you study.

, The easiest and most common form of study guide is the summary sheet. Simply start by summarizing important parts of your notes. Summary sheets are excellent for people will learn well by reading over material. They are particularly useful for history and literature classes with little memorization required.Use titles for sections that are meaningful to you to help you understand the concepts.
It is one of the most thorough forms of study guide and is great to cover large amounts of material.
This method may not be time effective as you may include material that is unnecessary.

, You will be putting together information from a number of sources, so start by getting them together. The better prepared you are when you begin, the easier the study guide will be to write.It will be much easier to assemble your study guide once you have all the sources you will need within arm’s reach.
All of your assignments and class materials can be valuable when putting together a study guide.
Gather your previous tests to look for areas you may have struggled with.

, Most classes are accompanied by one or more textbooks that are invaluable resources when creating a study guide. Textbooks can help you clarify subjects, organize materials and find definitions of important terms.Go back through the sections you covered in class or for assignments and look for important concepts.
Make a note of bold or italicized words as they may be important to the subject or cover information you may need to know for your exam.

, Taking good notes in class can help you to retain the information covered, but they can also serve as important parts of your study guide. Your notes can serve to aid in your organization of material as well as to know what areas your teacher thinks are most important. Go back through your notes and highlight or underline information that seems important.
Focus on big concepts or parts that you think are especially important based on the lectures and ensure that information makes it into the study guide.
Identify areas that you may not be sure about through your notes. Research things you are uncertain of in your textbook and make sure to include that content in your study guide.
Class handouts are also valuable sources as they show what the instructor felt was important.

, Homework assignments can show you what your teacher felt was important as well as providing an idea for what type of questions may appear on the exam.Pay close attention to things you got wrong on the homework. Begin by including those portions in your study guide.
Homework can also serve as a reminder of all the material you covered over a long semester. Use it to help structure your guide.

, The tests you have taken thus far in the semester were designed to test your understanding of the material, so they can be great review tools.


Topics covered on previous tests will probably be covered again in a final exam.
Even if the new test has nothing to do with the old one, they can serve to show you what types of questions your teacher will ask and how they expect them to be answered.

, Now that you have all the material you will need to assemble your study guide, it’s time to organize it. Organize your study guide in a way that makes sense to you and is easy to follow.If you are being tested on a portion of a text book, you may want to divide your material into what chapter it appears in the book. For instance, organize your study guide by chapter with supporting information, or large concepts such as nations for world history or regions of the body for anatomy.
Once you have identified what broad topics the information must fall into, use that to begin the framework of your study guide.
As you fill out portions of the study guide and identify areas you are less certain about, focus on those areas in your research.

, Dividing information into easy to follow segments is important to make your study guide useful. Here are examples of dividing information from various subjects into segments that may be more manageable.


The American Revolution can be divided into time periods on a summary sheet such as “the 1750s, 1760s and 1770-81” or by events such as the Sugar and Stamp Acts, the Boston Tea Party and the Declaration of Independence, followed by supporting information for each category.The Periodic Tables can be divided into flash cards to help you memorize the abbreviation for each element.Academic psychological approaches can be divided into a concept map. Start with a center circle called “psychological approaches” with branches coming from it for the dynamic approach, humanistic approach and social learnings.Viruses or other biological concepts can easily be organized into a comparison chart. If you are using viruses, list them on the left hand column, then create columns for aspects of a virus such as means of transmission, symptoms and treatments.

, Your study guide is supposed to help you understand complicated subjects, so keep it easy to understand and follow and don’t be afraid to leave out things that don’t matter.Be very picky about what information you include in your study guide to avoid making it too daunting to use.
You don’t need to cover topics you are extremely comfortable with in as much depth. Instead focus on areas you are unsure of.
Regardless of what format you use, combine information from each source into single sections regarding each topic. For instance, if your test is on the American Revolution, include everything pertinent from your notes, text book, homework and tests about Alexander Hamilton into one section of the study guide.

, You want to be able to reference your study guide easily and frequently, so make it as easy to read and follow as possible. Use spacing, underlining and highlighting to differentiate between topics and make it easy to find what you need.


Use neat, clear handwriting to ensure you can read everything you put in the study guide.
Choose the right type of study guide for the material so it’s easy to find the information you’re looking for.
Be uniform in the way you divide or separate sections so you can easily identify when one topic is complete and you’ve begun on the next.

Choose a binder.,
Make subject dividers.,
Put new assignments at the front of your binder.,
Move completed assignments to each subject section.",How to Create a Homework Binder1," The first thing you must do is choose a binder to use for your homework. There are many types of binders to choose from, so pick the version that works the best for you. A large three-ring binder with pockets on the inside of the front and back is ideal for homework.


You might also consider a binder that zips shut, so you can’t lose any papers.;
, You can purchase binder dividers or simply use a piece of cardstock to divide each section. Label them with all of the subjects that you are assigned homework. It can be very useful to color code your subjects, math is blue, English is green, etc.Using dividers with pockets can make it even easier to store your assignments.

, When you are handed an assignment, place it at the very front of the binder. All uncompleted assignments should stay at the front no matter what subject it is. This makes it much easier to find all current assignments.

, Once you have finished a worksheet, you can move it to the subject section. This makes it easier to hand in assignments for each class. When you get to that class, you can turn to the subject in your binder and it will be right there.


For example, when you finish a math worksheet, put it in the math section of your binder.
You can also place returned homework assignments in the subject section.

Estimate.,
Use inverse operations.,
Plug solutions back into equations.,
Solve using a different strategy.",How to Check Math Homework1," If you have an general idea of what your answer should be, you can compare the estimate with your solution to verify that it makes sense. Estimating usually involves  rounding to place values that make the number you are working with easy to calculate in your head.For example, you might need to calculate 824+288{\displaystyle 824+288}. Round each number to the nearest hundred. 824 rounds down to 800 and 288 rounds up to 300. Add together your estimated numbers: 800+300=1,100{\displaystyle 800+300=1,100}.

You can estimate before you start the actual calculation, or after. Once you complete the actual calculation, compare it with the estimate to check for reasonableness. For example, if you calculated 824+288=1,812{\displaystyle 824+288=1,812}, you know your answer may not be correct because 1,812 is much larger than the estimate of 1,100. If you calculated 824+288=1,112{\displaystyle 824+288=1,112}, you can assume that your answer is correct, because 1,112 is close to the estimate 1,100.
;
, Inverse operations are operations that undo each other. You can think of them as opposites. Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. Multiplication and division are inverse operations, too.If you do a problem with any one of these operations, you can use its inverse operation to see whether your calculations make sense.

For example, you might need to calculate 48÷6{\displaystyle 48\div 6}. In division, when you multiply the quotient (the answer) and the divisor (the number you are dividing by), your product will be the dividend (the number being divided into). So, if you calculate 48÷6=8{\displaystyle 48\div 6=8}, you know that your answer is correct, since 8×6=48{\displaystyle 8\times 6=48}.

You might need to calculate 7×9{\displaystyle 7\times 9}. In multiplication when you divide the product (the answer) by either factor, the quotient is the other factor. So, if you calculate 7×9=56{\displaystyle 7\times 9=56}, you know your answer is incorrect, because 56÷9{\displaystyle 56\div 9} does not equal 7. The answer is 63, because 63÷9=7{\displaystyle 63\div 9=7}.


, In algebra it is easy to check your solution by plugging the value you found for the variable back into the original equation. When working the equation, make sure you use the  correct order of operations to solve.

For example, if you are solving the equation 4(x−3)=28{\displaystyle 4(x-3)=28}, and you find that x=10{\displaystyle x=10}, plug in 10 for x{\displaystyle x} in the original equation to see if that makes the equation true. So, you would calculate:4(x−3)=28{\displaystyle 4(x-3)=28}4(10−3)=28{\displaystyle 4(10-3)=28}4(7)=28{\displaystyle 4(7)=28}28=28{\displaystyle 28=28}Since this equation is true, you know that your solution x=10{\displaystyle x=10} is correct.


, Often there is more than one way to solve a problem. In school, your teacher often wants you to use a particular strategy. That doesn’t mean, however, that you can’t check your work using a different strategy.

For example, if you are trying to find the area of a rectangle that is 4 units long and 5 units wide using the formula Area=length×width{\displaystyle {\text{Area}}={\text{length}}\times {\text{width}}}, you can check your work by drawing an array.

If you are doing multiplication, you can check your work by doing repeated addition.

Put only homework assignments in the binder.,
Take the binder to and from school every day.,
Put assignments in the binder right away.",How to Create a Homework Binder2," This may seem silly to you, but the binder can easily get bogged down if you put more than just homework in it. Including notes, handouts, and other paper in your binder can make it easy to lose your actual homework., Your binder will only be useful to you if you actually have it at school. When you have finished all of your homework each night, place your binder in your backpack before you go to bed. This will ensure that you always have your homework with you to turn in each day.


At the end of the school day, make sure you put the binder in your backpack before you leave for the day.

, As soon as you are handed the homework, immediately put it in the binder. This way you will always know right where your homework is and how much you have to do. You also won’t lose it in your notes or other handouts.Remember to keep all unfinished assignments in the front of the binder.

Ask your parents.,
Compare answers with friends.,
Talk to your teacher.",How to Check Math Homework2," The easiest way to check your math homework is to ask your parents to look over it when you are finished. If your parents don’t remember how to do the type of problems you are working on, you should try to teach them yourself! There is no better way to learn how to do something than to try to teach it to someone else.If they still have trouble, they can look online to refresh their memory.

Some good sites for going over how to do math problems quickly are Math is Funand Virtual Nerd., You can do this after school or before school if you have time. You can also call your friend in the evening and go over your homework together. If you both found the same answer, you know that your work is likely correct. If you found different answers, you know that at least one of you is wrong, and you can try to find the correct answer together.

When you compare your answer with a friend, make sure you are not just changing your answers without learning where you made your mistake. If your friend found the correct answer, have him or her show you how to solve the problem.


, Sometimes teachers give you free time in class. If they do, use this time to begin your homework. This way you can ask them if you are doing it correctly.

If you do your work at home but don’t feel confident about it, talk to your teacher as soon as possible the next day. They can quickly check your work, and you might have time to correct your answers before turning it in. Likely, you will get credit for trying your best.

Use a calculator.,
Use online tools.,
Use the back of your textbook.",How to Check Math Homework3," It’s helpful to have a good calculator at home. If you are in middle school or high school, you should have a scientific calculator. After you complete your work with pencil and paper, you can complete your work on a calculator and compare your answer. Since the calculator will always be right, if your answer doesn’t match, you know you need to work the problem again.

Work through your problems first, and only use the calculator to check your answers. You need to show your work so that your teacher knows you understand how to solve the problems.

If you don’t have a calculator, you can find a number of online calculators by simply searching for them on Google.


, Besides calculators, there are a number of online tools that can check your math work for you. Make sure you try to complete the problems on your own before using these tools.

For algebra, you can use an equation calculator, like Symbolab.For geometry, you can simply type what you are looking for into Google, and a calculator will pop up. For example, if you are finding the area of a triangle, type “area of a triangle” into Google. Then insert your known values into the calculator (such as base and height), and Google will supply the answer.

There are a number of converters online. Math is Fun has a unit converter that can help you convert from one unit of measurement to another, such as inches to centimeters.Convert Me has conversion calculators for most measurements, including speed, temperature, and capacity., Textbooks often have an index in the back that reveals the answers to problems. These are usually organized by Unit, topic, and page number. Often these indexes will only have the answers to odd-numbered problems.

As when using a calculator or online tools, try doing the problems on your own first, then check your answers.

Separate all your homework from most important to least important.,
Get the work done.,
Study right away for any tests or quizzes you missed.,
Hand in your homework.",How to Catch up on Homework You Missed While Absent1," If you know that you're going to be gone for a long period of time, get your homework and books beforehand if possible. This will insure that you have nothing to worry about when you get back.;
, If you don't, you will forget. If your school/class has a homework website, check it to see what homework you missed. If possible, ask a friend to collect your missed work for you.

, Talk to your teacher(s) about the homework you missed, as sometimes the teacher will expect you to do it, and other times, if the assignment is a minor one, you may not have to make it up at all. If you have multiple teachers, it's strongly suggested to talk to all of them, as they all have different expectations. For example, some teachers will give you as many days as you were gone to get your homework in, whereas others will not.

, Start by sorting your homework from bigger assignments to smallest. Finishing bigger assignments first assures that if you have good study habits, your homework will be done in no time. Also, keep in mind the due date of each assignment. It's better to finish the homework that's due tomorrow than the homework that due in a week.

, Instead of going home and watching TV or going on Facebook, finish your homework. Make a deal with yourself, such as each assignment done gives you 1 hour on the computer, etc. This process of rewarding yourself motivates you to do your homework. Remember that even though you're on a tight deadline to get everything in, that you should put time and effort into doing your assignments.

, Some teachers expect you to come to them to make up tests and quizzes, because they would like you to learn responsibility.

, Every day you get assignments done, make sure to turn them in. Do that so you don't have loose papers filling up your work space. If you're going to finish the work, you might as well turn it in, right? Late marks are better than no marks at all.

Say no explicitly.,
Repeat yourself.,
Call your classmate’s request cheating.,
Articulate the consequences.,
Read your school’s academic conduct code.,
Avoid physical confrontation.",How to Deal With Classmates Who Want Answers to Homework1," It can be difficult to say no, especially when you want to seem friendly. Avoid giving an incomplete, impotent, or unclear refusal.Practice direct statements like these in advance: “I don’t want to give you my answers,” or “I won’t let you use my work.”


You may accidentally encourage your classmate to apply more pressure if you soften your “no” in an attempt to be friendly. Avoid using statements like “I don’t know” or “this may be a bad idea.” Instead, trust the clarity and power of a direct “no.”
Do not provide a complicated answer, just say no. A complicated explanation that emphasizes unusual circumstances may seem friendlier or more helpful, but it can provide an opportunity for your classmate to challenge your refusal and to ask again.;
, Prepare to say no a second or third time. Your refusal is simple, but it may take your classmate a few attempts to understand that you are serious. Politely let them know that your answer is final but acknowledge their persistence. You can say “I know this is important, but my answer is not going to change,” or “I know that you are worried about grades, but I never share my answers.”, Be direct and specific the first time your classmate asks you to share your answers. Tell them “What you are asking is cheating, and it is wrong.” Your classmate may try to convince you that their request is not cheating. You can make your position clear by saying “I see your request as wrong, regardless of how you view it.”

, Remind your classmate of the repercussions of cheating. Teachers know and look for common cheating habits.Punishments for cheating can range from failing an assignment, to failing a course, to being expelled. Make clear that these consequences could affect both your classmate and you if you facilitate their cheating. You can say “You are asking me to take a risk, and the potential penalty is too big.”


Remember that the long term repercussions outweigh the immediate pressure. A school year can seem like a very long time, and you may worry about awkward situations if you disappoint a classmate. If you say no to a classmate, you may feel uncomfortable for a few days or weeks. If you are caught cheating, the consequences can last for years.

, You will be able to explain why you will not share your work when you are familiar with the specific rules of your school. Your teachers, school administrators, and parents are all concerned about cheating and work very hard to uphold these standards.Pay careful attention to your school’s rules regarding plagiarism. Plagiarism can seriously damage your academic record. Since what counts as plagiarism may not always be instinctive, speak with your teacher to clarify confusions that you may have. Your teacher will appreciate the opportunity address these questions before potentially plagiarized work is submitted.

, Some classmates may refuse to take no for answer. If you are physically threatened, share your answers to avoid immediate danger. Once you are free of immediate danger, contact a school official or a police officer and explain the situation to your teacher. Stopping bullying is a more immediate concern than cheating.

For the quickest results, use an online typing tester.,
Alternatively, open a word processor and set a timer.,
Start the timer and start typing.,
Divide the number of words by the number of minutes.",How to Calculate Words Per Minute1," Today, the easiest way to figure out how many words you can type per minute is usually to use a program online specifically made to test this. It's easy to find dozens of these programs with a search engine term like ""words per minute typing test."" Though there are many of these types of programs available, most work the same way: you type a list of words within a certain time limit and the program uses your performance to calculate your WPM.


One great program for this is available at 10fastfingers.com.The test on this page is simple: just type each word on the screen, putting a space between each, until the minute timer counts down.
In addition to learning your WPM, this typing test will also tell you the number of mistakes you made and tell you which percentage of test-takers you scored in.;
, You can also determine your typed WPM manually — for this, you'll need a computer program you can type in (like a word processor or notepad program), a timer or stopwatch, and a source of text you can copy.


Set the timer for any length of time (in general, the longer you test yourself for, the less vulnerable you'll be to fluke performances.)
Your text should be long enough that you won't reach the end before your timer finishes.
If you don't have a word processor installed on your device, you can access one for free with a Google account at drive.google.com., When you're all ready to go, start the timer, then begin copying the text. Try to be as accurate as you can — if you notice a mistake while you're typing a word, fix it, but you don't need to fix mistakes in words that you've already finished. Keep copying the text until the timer goes off, then stop immediately.

, Now, finding your WPM is easy. Divide the number of words you typed by the number of minutes that you originally set your timer for. The final answer you get is your WPM.


Note that nearly all modern word processors have a ""word count"" feature, so you don't need to count your words manually.
For example, let's say that we type 102 words in 1 minute and 30 seconds. To find our WPM, we would divide 102 words/1.5 minutes to get 68 WPM.

Find an ideal study environment.,
Schedule study time.,
Prioritize learning.,
Use the summarization method.,
Try practice testing.,
Look for connections.",How to Be a Successful Learner1," Finding a quiet area free from distractions is integral to productive studying and successful learning. Over time, the mind will associate actions and outcomes with environments and adjust its functions accordingly. Establishing a regular study spot, by this logic, will condition your brain to focus and retain information better in this setting. If you don’t already have a preferred study space, some choices to consider are:The library
A park
A quiet café or restaurant;
, To manage your time effectively and learn as much as possible, schedule blocks of time during the week to be devoted to studying and review. These study blocks should be 50 minutes long, or shorter if you lose concentration earlier than that. Fit these appointments around the rest of your schedule, but aim to hold them at times of the day when you are most productive., To be a successful learner, you must put studying before other commitments when necessary. If it comes down to a choice, extracurricular activities, social engagements, and fun hobbies must come second so that your studies can get your full attention. Identify the distractions that keep you from studying the most and work out a way to schedule them in during your free time, or to keep them from being a hindrance to your work.For instance, if social media is a distraction while you are trying to study, download an app to block it out (e.g. Freedom, a Windows, Mac, and Android app which keeps users from connecting to the internet for up to 8 hours)., As you study, use the summarization method to cement your learning. At the end of a unit, chapter, or study session, write out a summary of what you’ve learned, which can also serve as notes to review later. This process will allow you to re-evaluate and retain the knowledge that you have absorbed, and pinpoint certain points that you haven’t grasped fully. For example, after reading a chapter in a U.S. History textbook, you could summarize the Eisenhower Era to reinforce what you learned.

, An effective method of learning new material is frequent practice testing, or self-evaluation, to gauge your knowledge. As you read or study, compile a list of questions to quiz yourself on the material later. You can also look online for test preparation resources like trivia and practice quizzes, available across different subjects, age groups, and learning levels.For instance, the Ohio Department of Education website provides practice tests and sample test items in different subjects for grade 3-12., A good way to absorb learning material is to connect it to other subjects that you relate to, particularly things that might seem unrelated on the surface. The process of forging these links will provide a more in-depth survey of what you’re studying and develop associations that will make things easier to remember. Apply the principles of a domain that you are well-versed in to the topic at hand and write out a brief argument, for your own purposes, about why these two areas are similar.As an example, if you are well-versed in auto-mechanics and enjoy fixing cars, write about different branches of government as if they were various part of a car, and note how they work together to make things run.

Go to your teacher(s) or refer to your syllabus and find out what material you have missed.,
Next, ask for the assignments from your teacher(s).,
Next, ask to copy notes.,
Copy the notes by hand.,
Create your list.,
Turn in assignments as you complete them.,
Reward yourself after every assignment is completed.",How to Catch up on Homework You Missed While Absent2," By finding out the concepts you have missed you can determine if you need to set up tutoring times. It is important to search for a tutor immediately as they can be hard to find. If not, you may find yourself being slowed down by trying to complete an assignment you do not understand.

, When writing down missed assignments be sure to separate assignments by subject. If you put them into one big list you may feel overwhelmed and later even unmotivated. Write do the assignments in the order of the due date. When learning the material it will be easier to go in order as the students who were not absent did.

, Try to pick someone reliable. Such as, someone who is academically motivated, pays attention in class and attends school the most. By picking this type of person you have a better chance of getting complete notes.

, Just making photo copies will make it difficult for you to remember later on if there is a test. Writing material down is proven to help students remember information. This may seem like adding more work but it will essentially save you time in the long run.

, Put your homework assignments on one paper. Again, split up by subject and mark when the due dates was so you know the order. Put a star by the major assignments. Most importantly, don't forget to put easy assignments on the list too. These can be done in no time and when you complete them, mark them off right away. Marking off tasks on a list can help to motivate a person to complete all the tasks.

, Teachers are more likely to give extensions if they student working hard to catch up.

, Give a bigger reward to the bigger and harder assignments. This will motivate you to complete the harder assignments.

"
"
Create doubt about your answers.,
Express appreciation.,
Sympathize with your classmate.",How to Deal With Classmates Who Want Answers to Homework2," Make your classmate less likely to want your answers by stressing your uncertainty about your work. You can express a lack of confidence in your answers, even if you are certain that they are correct, with a few practiced statements like “This unit is over my head, I doubt I got many answers right,” or “Do you understand the new ideas? I’m a little bit lost.” This may make other students think twice about trying to use your answers.


Minimize confrontation by presenting your work as incomplete or sloppy. You can say “I did the assignment wrong and haven’t been able to fix it,” or “I didn’t complete the assignment and I need to ask to copy someone’s work, too.”
Discuss difficulties with your peers. Talk about the subjects that challenge you and in which you hope to improve rather than topics in which you excel. This can help you balance your reputation as a good student with a sense that your work may not be suitable for copying.

, Accept your classmate’s interest in your work as a compliment. Peers may use praise in an attempt to manipulate you, so acknowledging the compliment can disarm their attempt to pressure you.Be prepared with a gentle reminder of the dedicated work you did to succeed, like “I’m flattered that you think my work is good, I study very hard.” If they continue to push, say “I worked hard and it is unfair that you get the answers without doing the work yourself.”

, You do not need to condone your classmate’s attempt to cheat, but you can try to understand why they feel the need take advantage of your success.Say to your classmates “I won’t give you my answers, but I understand how stressful this class is.” Emphasize that you are willing to help them manage the stress of homework.


Anticipate cheating around test times. Due to the high value placed on providing specific answers for assigning grades, stress can increase before major tests. This may make cheating seem more attractive. Before a test or major assignment, encourage a student that may ask you for answers or offer to study with them. This may reinforce proper study habits and discourage cheating.

"
"
Explain rather than cheat.,
Propose collaboration.,
Express interest in the work of your peers.,
Direct conversation to the homework assignment.,
Guide the study group.,
Encourage your peers to repeat the collective study effort.,
Tell the teacher that a study group has formed.",How to Deal With Classmates Who Want Answers to Homework3," You can reinforce your own understanding of the subject by helping your classmates improve their understanding of the homework or lab work. Start by asking “Was there a specific part of the assignment you had trouble with?” You can also diminish the number of classmates that look to you for answers if they know that your help requires that they work.


Ask your classmate about their study habits. You may be able to explain how they can do homework more effectively.

, Offer to work with the student that will not leave you alone. You can involve other students in a discussion of the more confusing parts of the assignment. Say “I find this subject difficult as well,” and focus on discussing the challenging points of the assignment. Be ready to answer their request for help with an alternative: “I won’t give you answers, but we can try to work together through a problem I didn’t finish.” Or answer their request by asking about their work: “Show me your work for the parts you did complete.”


Pay special attention not to emphasize the depth of your understanding. Your goal is to work with the student, not to give them answers. Make sure that they are actively involved.

, Ask “What parts of the assignment were you comfortable with?” Make sure you ask questions of each member of the group. While discussing the assignment, be sure to ascertain the depth of your peers' understanding. This conversation is the start of a potential study group that can make your classmates less dependent on your help., Once the conversation gets going, direct the group to the first step of the first problem. You can say “Hey, that sounds like a good way to solve the first question.” Make sure that everyone is involved, even if it slows the process down. Interject small pointers in order to direct the group to the right answer, and give everyone a chance to understand each step.

, Encourage the impromptu group to work together. Point out that they are covering challenging points. Use your grasp of the topic to steer everyone to a consensus and then confirm ""Yeah, that's what I got.""

, If you would like to work with them, offer to organize the study group. If you would like to continue studying independently, say “Hey, you guys can keep working together! With this study group, you can be sure that you’ll always complete your homework.” Praise their efforts and minimize your role so that they will be confident even without your leadership.

, The teacher’s recognition will help solidify the group, and it will emphasize each student’s responsibility for participating. Make your collective intentions clear and accept any guidance or help that your teacher may offer. Many high school teachers approve of study groups, and in college they are often the norm.

Use an online test.,
Alternatively, grab a stopwatch and copy a long stretch of text into a word processor.,
Start the stopwatch and start reading.,
Divide the number of words by the time it took you to read the text.",How to Calculate Words Per Minute2," If you're trying to figure out how many words per minute you can read, once again, your best bet is generally to use an online speed reading test program. These are a little less common than typing speed tests but plenty of good ones can still be found with search engine queries like ""reading words per minute.""


One great program is available at readingsoft.com.In this program, you time yourself while you read a text of predetermined length. Once you finish, the program calculates your WPM based on how quickly you reached the end.

, As above, it's also possible to find the WPM you read manually. To do this, you'll want to open a word processor, paste a page or two of text into it (preferably something you haven't read before), then get ready to start a stopwatch.


Before you begin, use your word processor's ""word count"" feature to determine how many words are in your text selection. Record this number — you'll need it at the end.
A good place to find long text selections you haven't read before is on your favorite news website. Since the news is constantly updated, you won't have to wait long to find something you haven't read yet.

, When you're ready, start timing yourself and begin reading the text at your normal reading speed. Unless you're specifically trying to see your maximum reading speed, you shouldn't rush yourself — this won't give you an accurate picture of how fast you read in your day-to-day life.

, Stop the stopwatch as soon as you read the very last word in the text. Now, just use the same formula as above to find your WPM: # words/# minutes.


For example, if it took us three minutes to read a 1,100-word news article, we would find our WPM by dividing 1,100/3 = 366.7 WPM.

Grab a stopwatch and find a speech with a known number of words.,
Time yourself as you deliver the speech.,
Divide the number of words in the speech by the minutes it took to deliver.,
Use a recording of a natural conversation for a more accurate WPM.",How to Calculate Words Per Minute3," Figuring out your WPM while speaking is a little more difficult than the two methods above. Most noticeably, there aren't any good online programs that can make the calculations for you. However, with a little effort, you can still find your speaking WPM manually. Start by copying a speech (preferably a reasonably short one that you haven't read before) into your word processor, then finding the number of words in it with the processor's ""word count"" feature. You'll also need a stopwatch for this test.


A list of major historical speeches is available at historyplace.com.Many of these speeches (like, for instance, George Graham Vest's ""Tribute to the Dog"") aren't well-known by the general public, making them great for this test.

, Start the stopwatch and begin reading the text out loud. Talk at your normal speaking rate — again, unless you're trying to figure out your maximum speaking rate, going quickly has no purpose. Speak with a moderate, conversational pace, pausing whenever feels natural.

, When you finish the speech, stop the stopwatch. Once again, your WPM is given by dividing the number of words in the speech by the number of minutes it took for you to speak it.


For example, if it took us five minutes to deliver a 1,000-word speech, we would find our WPM by dividing 1,000/5 = 200 WPM.


, The test above is alright for determining your WPM, but it's not perfectly accurate. The way we speak when delivering a speech is a little different than the way we speak when we're actually talking in our day-to-day life — many people, for instance, deliberately talk more slowly and clearly when reading aloud. In addition, since you're reading from a written text, the test is also partly a test of your reading speed and not your natural speaking speed.


To get the most accurate results, you'll want to record yourself speaking to someone else in a semi-casual setting for a long, uninterrupted stretch of time, count the words manually, and divide by the number of words by the number of minutes. This is fairly painstaking, but it's the most accurate measure of your actual speaking speed.
One good way to get yourself talking for a long stretch of time is to gather a group of friends and tell them a long, detailed story that you know well and have told before. This way, you won't need to pause to remember how the story goes — you'll only be limited by your natural speaking speed.

"
Use visual learning techniques.,
Experiment with hands-on learning.,
Try auditory learning.",How to Be a Successful Learner2," To see if a visual style of learning suits you best, try different methods that favor seeing and observing things. Watch demonstrations of things in person or online (e.g. a YouTube video detailing how to fix a leaky pipe), or enhance your reading by highlighting text or making note cards. Other visual learning techniques may include:Consulting maps, graphs, or charts
Making lists
Drawing illustrations
Using post-it notes

, Determine if tactile learning is the best fit for you by getting involved with a topic that you are learning about. For example, if you are learning about a city's history, visit some of the key landmarks that you read about (e.g. visiting the Mark Twain House in Connecticut while learning about the author). Some other types of hands-on learning methods to try are:Interviewing people about a subject (e.g. interviewing a veteran about their experience in the armed forces)
Acting things out (e.g. pretending to be a character from a historical text)
Conduct studies or experiments (e.g. growing a plant as a science project)

, See if auditory learning works for you by seeking spoken instructions or explanations about learning material. Try audio books or taped lectures as a means to learn about something new (for instance, learn about anthropology with audio resources). If possible, seek out experts or fellow learners to discuss a topic with and share ideas."
"
Get enough sleep.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly.,
Communicate with your teachers.,
Set goals.",How to Be a Successful Learner3," Not getting enough sleep can affect your concentration and cause memory problems, hindering your learning process. A healthy sleep schedule should be kept up as lost sleep has a cumulative effect on your mind and body. As a general rule, the required amount of sleep for optimal functioning is:9-11 hours a day for children
8.5-9.5 hours a day for teenagers
7-9 hours a day for adults

, As a general rule, eating healthy will improve your overall well-being, both mentally and physically. Improve your capacity to learn by consuming healthy, “smart” foods that aid with concentration. Make sure to eat a well-balanced breakfast every day, avoid high fat foods, and try to add learning-friendly foods to your diet, such as:Omega 3-rich fish (e.g. salmon)
Whole grains
Avocados
Blueberries
Dark chocolate

, Regular exercise is a key component to concentration and learning potential. If possible, exercise right before studying, which will raise your focus for 2-3 hours. If your concentration starts to fade while reading or studying, take a 15 minute exercise break to renew your energy (e.g. a quick walk around the block).Exercise also releases endorphins and serotonin, which boost mood and fight depression.

, Get the best learning experience possible by keeping an open line of communication with your teachers. Reaching out will let a teacher know that you appreciate their time and wisdom, and that you should be taken seriously. Ask questions at appropriate times (e.g. after class), visit during office hours, and follow-up by email to confirm that you have absorbed what they told you., Setting clear goals for your learning process will keep you motivated and organized. Be realistic about your goals in terms of time and complexity. For instance, if you want to learn the theoretical component of how to drive, aim to read and retain one chapter of the driving manual per week.

"
Start at the beginning.,
Find out the exam boards of the subjects you are taking.,
Don't work anywhere near your computer if possible.,
Contact your teacher.",How to Revise for Your A Levels1," If you feel you don't know where to begin revising, go through your previous work and text books about the subject. Skim through them and look for the areas in which you would feel least happy about popping up in your exam. Take a note of these because those are the ones you should revise for first!;
, Then you can download the syllabi from their websites to revise from.

, You will only end up going on Facebook or Youtube. If there are websites you want to revise from, print off the pages you need. Do not work in a busy environment, this will distract you and you won't concentrate on the page you are reading. Study groups are a dangerous area; only form one of these if you are sure you won't end up chatting about the weekend gossip, however they can be very helpful if you don't understand an answer to something. Ask a friend about something you don't understand, as they may be able to explain it to you in a way you do understand. Work in a clear space, believe it or not, this helps you relax. In a cluttered space with unnecessary items everywhere, it's easy to feel cramped and unable to work, so clean your area before you settle down to work.

, It is best to do this by e-mail. Organize a study group if you can handle it..or just ask one friend who is in the same boat as you, that's what friends are for.

Set up your notebook.,
Make notes.,
Come up with questions.,
Cover the notes and test yourself.,
Review the notes.,
Write a summary.",How to Revise for Your A Levels2," Take an A4 sized notebook and draw a wide margin on the left side of the page, using a ruler and pen.


Then use the ruler and pen to draw a horizontal line about 1/4 of the way from the bottom of the page.

, Use the right hand side of the page to make notes on the topic you are studying, whether it's history, physics or languages.


Try to use clear, straight-forward language to keep your notes concise and easy-to-read.

, On the left side of the page, write down some questions relating to the information on the right side of the page.


Coming up with your own questions will help to clarify the meaning of the notes, reveal the relationships between ideas and allow you to commit the information to memory.
The questions could be something like ""In Hamlet, how does Shakespeare explore the theme of death?"" or ""In the War of the Roses, what significant events led to the Battle of Bosworth?""

, Cover up the right side of the page and try to answer the questions, in your own words, without looking at your notes.


You can either do this out loud, reciting the information to yourself, or you can write the information out quickly (using only key words) on a scrap piece of paper.
This part of the exercise is very important, as it will test your memory and help you to identify gaps in your knowledge.

, Uncover the notes and go through them again, checking for any information you might have missed.


Try to reflect on the significance of the information -- why do you need to learn it? How can you apply it to other things? Where does it fit in with the information you already know?
Repeat the covering up and reviewing process as many times as necessary, until you feel comfortable with the material.

, Once you are confident that you have learned the notes well, write a short, concise summary at the bottom of the page.


You can then use this summary for reference every time you review your notes.

Take the SAT on your chosen test date.",How to Register for the SAT," If you are in your first year of high school, you can start to prepare yourself for the SAT by creating an SAT plan. This could be an outline of high school courses you will need to take to get into college, according to the course levels offered at your high school, and when you plan to take your SAT in your junior or senior year.During your freshman year, you can start to think about taking SAT Subject Tests in your sophomore year, which are hour long tests that focus on specific subject areas. The SAT Subject Tests will allow you to distinguish yourself when you get to the college admission process in your senior year and provide a more complete picture of your academic background. There are 20 SAT Subject Tests given in five subject areas: English, history, languages, math, and science.;
, If you are taking any courses that relate to the SAT Subject Tests in your second year of high school, you should consider taking the SAT Subject Tests. You should plan to take the applicable SAT Subject Test once you have finished a class in a certain subject as the subject material will be fresh in your mind.You can access free practice questions for the SAT Subject Tests here: https://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/sat-subject-test-preparation.
You can also download a free booklet to help you prepare for the SAT Subject Tests here: http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/sat/sat-getting-ready-sat-subject-tests-2015.pdf.

, Most high school students take the SAT twice, once in their junior year and once in their senior year. Taking the SAT twice will allow you to improve upon your initial score and give you a better chance at a high overall SAT score. You should take the SAT in the spring of your junior year so you have time to prepare for the SAT during the first half of the school year.You can take the SAT or up to three SAT Subject Tests on one test day. If you decide to take both types of tests, you will need to do so on different days.
If you feel your initial scores on the SAT in your junior year are high, you can send them to colleges you are interested in attending and to scholarship programs. This can be seen as a sign of interest and may qualify you for campus visits programs and information sessions in your area. You may also be considered for scholarships and funding through certain college admission programs.

, If you are not satisfied with your junior year SAT scores, you can plan to take the SAT a second time. Most seniors do this at the beginning of the senior year. Often, students who take the SAT more than once can improve their score.You can access the My SAT Online Score Report online to determine your strengths and the areas you need to improve on for the SAT.You can also decide if you want to take the SAT Subject Tests again in your senior year to improve your scores for these tests.
Once you complete your SAT a second time, and earn scores you are happy with, you should send your SAT scores to colleges and universities by December or January to ensure you meet the application deadlines.

, The SAT is offered seven Saturdays a year. If you cannot attend a Saturday test date due to religious reasons, there are also Sunday test dates available. Most registration deadlines for the SAT are set three to four weeks before the test date. There are also late registration deadlines, which are usually two to three weeks before the test dates.The current SAT registration schedule for the U.S. is available here: http://studypoint.com/ed/sat-test-dates/. However, dates can shift every year so check the schedule and choose a date during the year you would like to take the SAT.

, Online registration is quick and easy. You can register online via the College Board website. You will need to create a free profile, state where you would like to take the test in the U.S., select a test date, and enroll in the test date.If you would like to register by mail, you must get an SAT Paper Registration Guide from your school’s guidance office. You will then need to complete the guide and mail it in before the registration deadline for your chosen test date.

, When you register online for the SAT, the only option for payment of the registration fee is via credit card. The basic SAT registration fee is $43. If you are planning on taking the SAT with Essay, the fee is $54.50. If you end up doing late registration for a test date, there is an additional fee of $28.If you are registering by mail, you can pay by check.
There is financial assistance available for students who cannot afford the registration fee in the form of a registration fee waiver. More information about the SAT fee waiver application can be found on the College Board website: https://sat.collegeboard.org/register/sat-fee-waivers.

, Once you have paid the registration fee and received a receipt with your SAT test date, you should then prepare to take the SAT on the chosen date.


Make sure you show up for your test date. If you miss your test date without letting the SAT registration program know, you may need to re register and pay another registration fee to take the SAT at another date.

Keep track of time.,
Answer the easy questions, then the hard ones.",How to Score High on the SAT or PSAT," If you've taken the PSAT or SAT before, establish your baseline score. For the PSAT, multiply your score by ten to get an estimate of how well you might do on the SAT. If you've taken the SAT, set your goal slightly higher than your baseline score. It is most important to make it realistic. If you haven't taken the PSAT or SAT, visit College Board and obtain a copy of the Official SAT Practice Test and print it. If you don't have access to a printer, try to get a copy of College Board's SAT preparation booklet from your high school guidance counselor (they are the same).


Find a quiet area in which you can work for approximately four hours without interruptions.
Take the SAT practice test under the same conditions as the exam

Time yourself on the sections
Take at most two minute breaks between sections
After finishing three sections, take a break for ten minutes.


Follow the directions on how to grade the test and convert the section scores to a scaled score. You can use these scores as your baseline for goal setting.
Find average SAT scores for freshman at colleges to which you're applying. You can find this information at college admissions offices or online.
Set goals that are challenging but realistic.;
, This is the most important step in scoring high on the SAT and PSAT. Since the length of the test is about four hours, it is quite difficult to solve all the questions unless you are well prepared. The only way you can prepare for the lengthy test is by practicing tests of similar duration in a similar setting. Use College Board's practice study tools to prepare for the SAT. ""Question of the Day"" and ""Word of the Day"" may be useful, but be sure to practice the questions and exams.

, It is important to set a high, but realistic goal. Don't try to answer too many questions, because if you push to answer them all, you may be get more questions wrong. Note that you aren't penalized for questions you don't answer, but are penalized for wrong answers. Therefore, you need to fine tune a strategy that takes into account both the wrong answer penalty and the no credit/no penalty scoring for unanswered questions. (The strategy to skip every question that raises the least little bit of uncertainty is probably not in your best interest.)

, Move quickly (but carefully) through the easy questions (which are in the beginning), but steadily and slowly through the harder questions. Don't answer questions 16-20 in each section unless you have at least five minutes left. In that case, look at the last questions and choose two you like best, and try to answer them.

, If you can eliminate at least one of the answers, always guess. If you rule out answers that make no sense, you dramatically improve your chances of getting the question right. Many math questions have absurd answer choices that absolutely can never be true (negative numbers when positive are required, wrong units).

, Bring a watch, even if there's a clock in the room. Set your watch to 12:00 so you can quickly figure out how much time has elapsed and how much you have left. If you use the room clock, you will waste time looking up and calculating the time elapsed. Instead, spend your time and brain power actually answering questions.

, Each section progresses from easy to hard, so usually you should answer them in the order in which they appear. There are some questions that appear on every test that are giveaways. Since the easy questions are worth the same amount as the hard questions, it is better that you answer easy questions correctly while missing the hardest ones rather than giving all the time to answering a mere few of the difficult questions.

If you have the time problem, the best you can do is to do at least one test every day to understand the structure better and practice using your calculator.
If questions are too hard, identify the field where you have knowledge gaps. Review material you had in class, and read through a textbook once more. Most of the test books have theoretical material too. Understand the explanations in the answers, and hire a tutor if you need it.

, If you did not cover a given section of the math knowledge in school yet, become a self-learner! Dive into the SAT study books and your textbook, and talk to a teacher if you need to. You can also hire an SAT tutor or go to an SAT prep class, and ask for attention on that particular area of weakness.

You are not penalized for wrong answers.
The SAT is an aptitude test, meant to determine your reasoning and verbal abilities. It has three sections, including a required writing component, and penalizes wrong answers.;
, More so than an IQ test or perhaps even the SAT, the ACT, because it focuses on what you’ve learned, is is conducive to intensive preparation. The more targeted learning and studying you do beforehand, the more likely you are to score well.


Some experts suggest that you should prepare consistently for 6 months before taking the ACT., This is one of the four sections in the ACT, along with Reading, Math, and Science, all of which are multiple choice. You also have the option to add the Writing section, which requires an essay.


The description of this section of the test as well as the others (along with sample questions) draw from the official ACT website.You are given 45 minutes to complete the 75 questions in the English section, which focuses on standard writing usage and rhetorical skills.
It includes 5 essays or passages, with a set of questions that refer to that passage.
The question breakdown is as follows: punctuation (10-15% of questions), grammar (15-20%), sentence structure (20-25%), rhetorical strategy (15-20%), organization (10-15%), style (15-20%).
Sample questions, based on the excerpt of the following passage: ""I grew up with buckets, shovels, and nets (1)__waiting by the back door__; hip-waders hanging in the closet; tide table charts covering the refrigerator door; and a microscope (2)__was sitting__ on the kitchen table. ...""; Q1) A. NO CHANGE; B. waiting, by the back door,; C. waiting by the back door,; D. waiting by the back door; Q2) F. NO CHANGE; G. would sit; H. sitting; J. sat

, You have 35 minutes to complete its 40 questions, where the focus is on reading comprehension.


It includes four reading subsections, each with either one or two passages to read, followed by questions based on the readings.
Each of the following topics are covered in one (and only one) of the reading subsections: Social Studies, Natural Sciences, Literary Narrative / Prose Fiction, and Humanities.
The focus is on understanding what is directly stated (main ideas, main details, event sequences) and what is implied (cause-and-effect, context, narrative voice) in the readings.
Sample Question 1 (reading passage excluded for space reasons): The fourth paragraph (lines 31-37) establishes all of the following EXCEPT: F. that Abshu had foster brothers.; G. that the Masons maintained a clean house.; H. how Mother Mason felt about the location of their house.; J. what Abshu remembered most about his years with the Masons.
Sample Question 2: It can reasonably be inferred that which of the following characters from the passage lives according to Abshu's definition of a life fully lived? A. Mother Mason; B. Father Mason; C. Abshu as a child; D. Abshu as an adult

, Here, you have 60 minutes to answer 60 questions that emphasize math skills typically taught before 12th grade.


The questions breakdown is as follows: pre-algebra (20-25% of questions), elementary algebra (15-20%), intermediate algebra (15-20%), coordinate geometry (15-20%), plane geometry (20-25%), trigonometry (5-10%).
You need to have basic mathematical formulas memorized and basic computational skills to complete the section.
Sample Question 1: A car averages 27 miles per gallon. If gas costs $4.04 per gallon, which of the following is closest to how much the gas would cost for this car to travel 2,727 typical miles A. $ 44.44; B. $109.08; C. $118.80; D. $408.04; E. $444.40
Sample Question 2: What is the value of x when 2x + 3 = 3x – 4 ? A. –7; B. negative one fifth; C. 1; D. one fifth; E. 7

, During the 35 minutes available, you will answer 40 questions focused on interpretation and problem solving utilizing the natural sciences.


The test presents multiple sets of scientific information in one of the following forms: data representation (charts, graphs, etc.) ; research summaries (45-55%); conflicting viewpoints (15-20%). Multiple choice questions follow each set.
From the information provided, you need to be able to make generalizations, draw conclusions, and make predictions.
Sample Question 1 (reading passage excluded for space reasons): According to the information provided, which of the following descriptions of Europa would be accepted by both scientists? F. Europa has a larger diameter than does Jupiter.; G. Europa has a surface made of rocky material.; H. Europa has a surface temperature of 20°C.; J. Europa is completely covered by a layer of ice.
Sample Question 2: With which of the following statements about the conditions on Europa or the evolution of Europa's surface would both Scientist 1 and Scientist 2 most likely agree? The surface of Europa: A. is being shaped by the movement of ice.; B. is covered with millions of meteorite craters.; C. is the same temperature as the surface of the Arctic Ocean on Earth.; D. has remained unchanged for millions of years.

, If you choose to take this part of the test, you will have 30 minutes to write an essay on a given topic in order to demonstrate your composition skills.


The writing prompt is meant to be an issue relevant to high school students, and will ask you to write about your perspective on the issue.
Sample Writing Prompt: Educators debate extending high school to five years because of increasing demands on students from employers and colleges to participate in extracurricular activities and community service in addition to having high grades. Some educators support extending high school to five years because they think students need more time to achieve all that is expected of them. Other educators do not support extending high school to five years because they think students would lose interest in school and attendance would drop in the fifth year. In your opinion, should high school be extended to five years? In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write about either one of the two points of view given, or you may present a different point of view on this question. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.

, There are numerous ACT preparation guides and practice test workbooks and websites available, most of which must be purchased of course; you can also find free resources as well, though.The official ACT website offers official prep tests and a printed prep guide for purchase. If you’re looking for free help, if also offers practice questions and a free “Question of the Day”.

, Set aside a specific time each day for ACT prep, starting well ahead of time (perhaps up to six months ahead of test day).


Try to replicate the test conditions while you prepare. Find a quiet place (try playing classical music if total silence bothers you) and use a desk/table and chair. You won’t be sitting on a couch when you take the test.
Focus on one subject at a time. Perhaps do one topic per day. You will be answering questions one subject at a time, after all.

, You want to be ready for all parts of the exam, but it you struggle with math more than the other sections, for example, dedicate more time to it. Focus a little extra study time and a few more practice tests on it.


Don’t give up on a section in which you struggle. Even being able to give more educated guesses will help -- remember, you are not penalized for guessing on the ACT.
Some experts contend that the ACT has a more challenging math component, while the SAT has a more challenging vocabulary component.So, if you are comparatively strong or weak in one of those areas, and have the option of taking either test, you may want to consider switching from one to the other -- or taking both.

, For most people, the best way to prepare is to take practice tests -- lots of them. Take practice tests specific to the ACT so you can study and get comfortable with the format at the same time.


Try timing yourself when you take a practice test section (perhaps do one section a day). If you don’t finish within the test time limit, keep going until you do finish to give yourself a better idea of how much time you need to shave off your test-taking for the real deal.
As the test day approaches, try taking your practice tests at the same time of day as you will take the real test. Prepare your mind and body for test time.

,


Keep close track of time. Be rigid. Use a timer. There is no wiggle room on test day.
Skip over difficult questions. If you don't understand or know the answer to a question almost immediately, leave it for the end of the test time. But make sure you leave time to at least guess on blank questions at the end. Remember, there is no penalty for wrong answers, and you'll probably luck out and get a few right by guessing.
Practice your neatness. This may sound silly, but you need to be able to fill in the multiple-choice bubbles neatly and completely to ensure that your answers are properly recorded by the scoring machine. Use a pencil for your practice exams and train yourself to fill in bubble sheets quickly but neatly. Find some extra bubble sheets and practice just your technique on those if necessary.
If you finish practice sections early, make use of the extra time to go over answers and tidy up your bubble-sheet filling. You won't be able to move ahead to the next section on test day, or do anything else but wait for the time to expire, so get in the habit of maximizing every second you have on each section.

, The math section focuses on the use of reasoning skills to solve practical problems, requiring knowledge of basic formulas and computational skills. Complex formulas and extensive computation are not included.You may use an approved calculator, but check the official calculator policy before test day.
You are not provided with the formulas you will need to use to answer the questions, so memorize essential trigonometry, algebra, and geometry formulas. (Calculus is not included on the exam, and trig coverage is limited.) Consider using flash cards to help you memorize the formulas.
Prepare for introductory algebra elements such as variables, polynomials, quadratic equations, and factoring.
Study also more advanced algebra concepts such as quadratic formulas, fractional coefficients, and equations involving radicals.
Know essential coordinate geometry equations for slope, distance, midpoint, parallel and perpendicular lines, conics, and so on.
Also prepare for plane geometry topics such as angles, perimeter, plane figures, area, surface area and volume, etc.

, This section tests on mechanics such as punctuation, grammar, and sentence structure, along with rhetorical skills (strategy, organization, and style). You are not tested on vocabulary, spelling, or rote recall of grammar rules.The 75 questions in this section are grouped into five provided essays or reading passages. Some questions will refer directly to underlined portions of the passage; others refer to the entire passage.
Often you will be given options on changing an underlined phrase to improve the mechanics or style, usually with a “no change” option as well. Make sure you are particularly adept at placement of commas, colons, semi-colons, and dashes.
Noun-pronoun agreement is another area upon which to focus, especially because these rules are often ignored in everyday usage. For instance, we might commonly say “The team needs to get their equipment loaded on the bus,” while it should be “its equipment” because team is a singular noun., The reading section specifically examines your reading comprehension skills by way of four reading passage sections (each with one longer or two shorter passages), each followed by multiple choice questions that test your ability to understand the passage(s).Often the test presents the subject matter of the passages in the same order: prose fiction, social science, humanities, and natural science. Therefore, skim through the sections before beginning the test and work from your strongest to weakest subjects.Do the same as you prepare.
You may also want to practice reading the questions first before the passage(s), to give you a better idea of what to prioritize when reading.
Recalling specific facts from the passage(s) is typically not essential. Rather, you need to be able to quickly understand big-picture concepts.

, This section assumes coursework in Earth/physical sciences and biology, and emphasizes interpretation, evaluation, and problem-solving skills. Calculators are not permitted, nor are they needed.This section essentially tests you on your science reading comprehension. It presents scientific information in one of three forms (see below) and asks several multiple choice questions pertaining to each presentation.
Data representation sets contain charts, graphs, and/or tables. Make sure you are adept at interpreting such data -- you may want to practice making charts, etc. as part of your studying.
Research summary sets provide descriptions of related experiments and ask you to develop hypotheses and/or draw conclusions. Thus again, reading comprehension is critical.
Conflicting viewpoint sets ask you to analyze and evaluate inconsistencies in related hypotheses. As per an example on the official website, short passages by two scientists who disagree on the existence of liquid water on Jupiter’s moon Europa are followed by questions that require you to understand each argument and draw conclusions regarding areas of agreement and disagreement., If you choose to take the optional writing test, you will be asked to write a single essay that demonstrates skills emphasized in high school English classes and introductory college composition courses. Two points of view will be presented on a topic, and you will then write on the issue, taking one side or the other or staking out a third position. Your point of view is irrelevant; your skill in writing an effective, persuasive essay is very relevant.Generally speaking, you will want to employ the five paragraph essay format -- an introduction, three paragraphs of supporting evidence, and a conclusion.
Make your introduction brief, as there is no time to waste. Present a clear, concise thesis statement that lays out your position.
Provide supporting evidence for your position in the three main body paragraphs. Utilize specifics from the question prompt to indicate your reading comprehension skills. It is often advised to raise and rebut a contradictory viewpoint to yours in at least one of the paragraphs.
Make your conclusion even more brief than the introduction; use it to summarize and restate your interpretation.
Prepare by regularly drafting practice essays, and consider asking teachers or other effective writers to critique your work. Look into How to Write an Essay Outline and How to Answer a Writing Prompt as well.

, Ask people who have recently taken the test for insights on what was covered and not covered, for example. Don't expect your test to be exactly the same, but it can help prepare you for patterns you may find. For example, in each section:


Math: Brush up on SOH CAH TOA. This method of remembering sine ( = opposite over hypotenuse), cosine ( = adjacent over hypotenuse), and tangent ( = opposite over adjacent) in trigonometry seems to frequently be a useful way to earn a few points on the math section.English: Study comma placement rules. ACT test-makers seem to have a thing for commas, as comma questions appear with regularity on the test. Usually the correct comma placement is no comma, it seems, so that might be your default answer when you're not sure.Reading: Write in your test booklet. There's no rule against this. Underline, star, or otherwise note significant parts of each passage. The focus is on comprehension and interpretation, so practice ""gutting"" short readings by quickly identifying their main focus, interpretive elements, and so on.Science: Play a matching game. On the ACT, the Science section is very similar to the Reading one, just with all science topics in the readings. One way to avoid falling for a ""trick"" answer to a question is to read the question and try to answer it in you own words without looking at the answer options. Then, see which option best matches your answer.Writing: Write what they're looking for. You can't write a perfect essay in 30 minutes, so don't try. Focus on presenting a clear argument with clear evidence in a clear, concise manner. Clear enough? Test scorers look for 1) Positioning (strength of your stance on the topic); 2) Examples (use of relevant supporting evidence); 3) Organization (effective paragraph and overall structure); 4) Language Command (sentence structure, grammar, word choice).Practice writing as little as possible while achieving these goals.

, If it hasn’t been made clear already, you cannot successfully prepare for the ACT the night (or even week) before.


If you have been preparing long and hard, resist the urge to do a final cram the night before. You’re more likely to fry your brain and hurt your results on test day. Trust your preparation over the long term.

, Yes, the test is important for your future, but try not to obsess over it. Stimulate your mind and body to keep both sharp for test day and to take a breather from test preparation.Exercise is good for the body and mind, and thus a beneficial distraction. It will help keep you energized as your approach test day.
It is not a waste of brainpower to think about or work on non-ACT ideas or projects. Indeed, they will help keep your mind stimulated and ready for action on test day.

, Good nutrition and sufficient sleep during preparation and leading up to test day will benefit you far more than sacrificing one or both in the name of a little more study time.

, Know where you need to be, when you need to be there, and what you need to bring (ID, pencils, approved calculator, etc.) well beforehand.

Know Your Options: Contrary to popular belief, most colleges and universities now accept SAT or ACT scores.,
Know the Test: While the SAT will certainly be challenging, there is a strategy to taking it.,
Study, But Don’t Stress.,
Rest, Eat, Breathe, Relax.,
Pace Yourself.",How to Take the SAT with Abbey Road," Start Early: The sooner you begin familiarizing yourself with the SAT, the better chances you’ll have of doing well on the test. You won’t have to worry about cramming or stressing about retaining information at the last moment. Sophomore year is a good time to start, either by taking an SAT prep. course offered by Abbey Road Programs, your high school, or another organization or by independently studying using an SAT preparation book. You can also take the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT), which can give you a good idea of what to expect on the SAT and where you rank compared to other students nationally.;
, So which one should you take? Well that depends on your strengths. The SAT tends to emphasize vocabulary, so if you love words and reading, it’s the way to go. If you tend to do better in math, you may want to look into the ACT, which places less emphasis on vocabulary. That said, be aware that ACT math is more advanced and will test all the way up to trigonometry. The ACT also has a science section – the SAT does not. There are some other key differences, but these details may give you a good idea of which test you’ll be better suited to take.

, First and foremost, know the format and details.


Format: The test contains 3 hours 45 minutes of timed sections, but is likely to last four to four and a half hours including administration time.
Sections: The SAT is about composed of three main sections (Critical Reading,Mathematics, and Writing) divided into nine subsections, plus one experimental subsection that will not count toward your overall score (200 to 800 points are possible for each section, for a total possible score of 2400). The subject matter of each subsection will not be presented in order! In other words, you may encounter a math subsection, followed by a reading subsection, followed by another reading subsection, or something different entirely. There’s no way to predict the order in which the sections fall, with the exception of the essay, which will come first. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect for each of the main sections:

Critical Reading: 70 minutes total. Two 25-minute subsections and one 20-minute subsection, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions that test your vocabulary and questions about short and long reading passages that test your reading comprehension.
Math: 70 minutes total. One 25-minute multiple choice subsection with 20 questions; another 25-minute subsection containing 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-inquestions that require test-takers write their answers inside a grid on the answer sheet. One 20-minute multiple choice section with 16 questions.
Writing: 60 minutes total. One 25-minute essay subsection graded on a scale of 1-6; two multiple choice subsections (one lasting 25 minutes, the other 10) that test you on sentence error detection and improving paragraphs.
Experimental: 25 minutes total. One of the subjects will have a fourth, unscored subsection, but because College Board wants to get an accurate idea of how well you do on the experimental portion, you will not be able to tell which one it is. It could fall under any of the three main sections and come at any time during the test (except the essay), so try your best on all ten subsections.


Question Difficulty: There are three levels of difficulty for questions: easy, medium and hard. The questions in the first third of each section are easy, those in the second third are medium, and the last third are hard (Reading comprehension questions will not follow this pattern).
Scoring: You receive one point for each correct answer in multiple choice sections. One quarter of a point is deducted for each incorrect answer, but there is no penalty for leaving a question blank. This means you should be able to make a very educated guess if you’re having trouble on a multiple choice question. Otherwise, leave it blank. Unlike multiple choice questions, there is no penalty for incorrect answers on grid-in questions because the test-taker is not limited to a few possible choices, so if you’re crunched for time, you can make a guess without it affecting you negatively. These points (including your essay score) will be added up to make a “raw score”, which will later be converted to your individual section scores.

, Studying doesn’t have to be a soul-draining experience. Do be diligent in your studies and test preparation, but make sure you remember to give yourself a break! You should not spend the month before the test locked in your room, pouring over test prep. books and cramming. Schedule time to study, but give yourself breaks, get outside, and have fun, too.

, Make sure you get plenty of sleep the few nights before the test. Don’t cram the night before the test! If you haven’t retained concepts before this point, you’re not likely to absorb them so close to the test. You may want to have a light review of vocabulary and math concepts, but frantically studying probably won’t help you. Eat a balanced breakfast the morning of the test, and make sure you use the restroom before the test begins, or you’ll have to wait for designated break times (you will have three 5-minute breaks during which time you may use the rest room and consume snacks and beverages). Make sure you relax and stay calm during the test. If something goes horribly wrong during the test, you can always cancel your scores. But remember there are only a certain number of tests offered each year, so it’s good to make each time you take the test count.

, Every question on the test is worth the same amount (one point), so spend your time making sure you get the easy and medium questions correct and save hard questions for last. Rushing through the test to get to the hardest questions will likely drag your score down.

Pick the books you'll read wisely: If given the option to contribute to the list--some programs allow students to determine much of what appears on the QE list--try to maintain a balance between books or authors that you have encountered before, and those that you are potentially less familiar with.,
Understand your list(s): At most universities, QE lists are organized according to 2 or 3 categories (i.e.,
Develop an organizational system: Many students dive right into reading the books/articles featured on the QE list.,
Designate days off: Although many QE advisers recommend that students read a book a day, this schedule is difficult to maintain after a few weeks.,
Don't take too many days off in a row: When reading-fatigue starts hitting, try not to go too many days without reading.,
Create graphics throughout the process: A few weeks into the reading process, make it a point to begin connecting the dots between texts.,
Become a friend of taxonomy: Generally, QE questions will ask you to characterize several related themes/moves/etc.",How to Study for a Qualifying Exam (in English)," The more books that you can get on the list that you have some experience with, the better. This will help to cut down on the time you have to invest reading significantly.;
, critical theory, rhetorical theory, composition and pedagogy). Take some time at the beginning of the QE process to talk with your adviser about what he or she hopes you will get out of reading each section of the list. This might help give you some idea of how the questions will be organized on the exam itself.

, Although it is difficult to discern at the outset what you will learn as you read--this is part of the mystery (and value) of reading so many texts--there are certain key elements that comprise nearly every ""scholarly"" text: main argument, key questions, key examples, memorable passages, ""the take away."" Develop a template (a table) for reading the texts on your list, and use this template throughout the process.

, Instead of trying to read every day, plan ahead for days off. I recommend that you give yourself a one day break every week.

, It may be tempting to take a long weekend (or week for that matter), but getting back on track can be difficult. Breaks in moderation are healthy, but long breaks can be demoralizing. The more time you spend away from the texts, the harder it will be to get back. Instead, if you sense that you are slowing down, simply reduce the reading load for a couple of days. You will still feel accomplished--""yay, I managed to read something""--even if the pace is slowing down.

, The best way to do this is to begin to visualize the argument that you might make. Although it may be difficult to predict what question(s) you will be asked on the exam, drawing connections on paper will prepare you for the kind of outlining you should do at the beginning of the exam itself.

, in the specific sub-field that you are studying. One of the key strategies that you can use to prepare for this process is to begin organizing authors/texts in taxonomies: ""these three authors talk about this issue, while these three authors present the issue this way.""

Go to class.,
Take notes.,
Do the readings.,
Collect your notes from class.,
Find a quiet place to study.,
Review class materials.,
Look for potential topics (questions) by creating an outline.,
Understand the structure of an essay.,
Outline your answers.,
Recognize different types of questions.,
Revise your answers.",How to Prepare for an Essay Exam," It may seem obvious, but the first step to acing an essay exam, is to attend class. In doing so, you’ll not only be able to hear the instructor’s perspective on the subject, but will be able to participate in class discussions, which can help to further your knowledge of the subject. More importantly, students that regularly participate in class are constantly involved with the material and are more likely to remember a greater portion of the information.Actively participate. It’s important to find a participation method that works for you, whether that’s asking thought-provoking questions or commenting on the reading.Active participation just means involving yourself in some way, so even if you don’t feel comfortable speaking at length in front of your peers, try to ask a question every now and then.
Free yourself from distractions. Put away your cell phone or tablet and concentrate on listening and taking good notes. Now is not the time to work on homework for another class or to catch up with friends on Facebook.;
, Another important benefit of attending class, is the notes you take. Although some instructors will provide outlines, there is no substitute for your own notes, as you know your learning and studying style best. In preparing for your essay exam, this will prove to be one of your most valuable tools, so do yourself a favor by going to class and taking good notes.


Always have a notebook on hand. It is helpful to use one notebook per subject or course, so that you don’t confuse yourself when looking back.
Be sure to date your notes so that you can quickly reference or find the subject material covered on the exam.
If you struggle with taking notes, ask the instructor if you can record the lecture. You can then go back and listen to the recording and either take notes at your own pace or review any parts of the lecture, which will be relevant for the exam.

, Completing reading assignments not only helps to prepare you for class, but saves you double the effort later.In other words, you won’t have to cram for the exam if you’re keeping up with the readings, which will make preparing for the test less stressful.


Take notes on what you’ve read and have questions ready for class.
Follow the schedule for reading assignments. Typically readings are broken out in a way that is both manageable and topical. If, however, you find yourself unable to keep up with the readings, speak with your instructor about a schedule that suits your particular needs. For example, if readings are assigned for every other day of class, you may need to break it out such that you are reading a portion every day.

, Having your notes and any other class materials in one place, helps the review process go more smoothly.


In addition to having one notebook per course, it may be helpful to also have an individual course binder or folder, which contains all course materials.
Take your organization to the next level by categorizing according to exams. Don’t throw away previous notes or materials from past exams. They may come in handy for midterm or final exams. Instead, organize the materials as if they were chapters, with chapter one being the first exam and so forth and so on.

, Free yourself from environmental distractions, such as loud noises, the TV or radio. For some people, it helps to have a designated study space at home. Others may prefer to go to the library or to a local coffee shop.


Limit phone calls and any other distractions such as texting. It might help to turn your phone and other devices to silent mode while you’re studying.
The TV should always be off while you’re preparing for an exam.
If you want to listen to music, be sure it’s something that is relaxing or peaceful. Also, keep the music at a low level. Otherwise, music can easily become a distraction.

, Once your materials are organized, you should begin the review process. Research has shown that reviewing new material within 24 hours of hearing it increases your retention of that material by about 60%.In other words, don’t wait until the night before the exam to review your notes. Spread out studying over the course of several days.


Get into the habit of reviewing class materials after each course. This will help to ease anxiety leading up to the exam, as you won’t have as much to review and will be able to clear up any questions that arise, prior to the big day.
Cramming doesn’t work. Multiple studies have shown that spacing out learning was more effective than cramming.What’s more, cramming only increases the feeling of desperation which leads to panic, and then to test anxiety. , When you study a large body of information, you should study from concept to detail, not the other way around. It will, in fact, be much easier to learn the details if you take the time to learn the concept and theory first.In other words, an outline helps you to organize a large amount of information, making it easier to identify specific topics, which could serve as essay questions.


Creating an outline will also come in handy when drafting essay responses, so give yourself some practice and start with your class materials.

, Familiarize yourself with how to Write an Essay. A good essay should have an introduction, a body and a conclusion.

, Keeping your topics in mind (from the review stage), draft an outline to potential essay questions. Try to come up with a topic sentence and then arrange your supporting material, underneath, using bullet points.


Don’t wait until the night before to outline answers. As you’re studying and organizing your class materials, come up with potential questions along the way. You can then go back and review and revise as necessary.
Some instructors do specify a word count for essays. Don’t focus on counting words though. Write what you can and look for opportunities to flesh out your answers without being overly wordy.

, Like any other test, essay exams are comprised of various types of questions. It helps to know ahead of time, what you may encounter so that you can practice answering each one. Here are some examples:


Identify - typically short and direct answers will do.
Explain - requires a more detailed answer.
Compare - look for connections.
Argue - address this from your own perspective.

, Practice makes perfect. Once you’ve created an initial draft of your responses, review what you’ve written. Look for opportunities to expound upon or clarify the content. Most importantly, be sure you are directly answering the question that has been asked. If you’re not, go back and review the corresponding materials.


This is a good opportunity to proofread your work and to look for any grammatical errors as well.
Have a friend, parent or peer look over your essay as well. It is often helpful to have a fresh set of eyes review your work and provide feedback.

Calmly start the test, taking one question at a time and allowing each question to hold your attention completely.,
Get in your car and go buy yourself a treat.

",How to Pass the NCLEX RN Exam," This may seem oversimplified, but the better you do academically, the less stressed you'll be when the actual test comes around. That is, if you learn the material in the first place, you won't be trying to play catch-up in your senior year and beyond.;
, These pre-tests can really show both your weak and your strong points, and give you a point to focus studying from. Also, doing it while you're still in school allows you to get help from your teachers while they are still easily accessible.

, Whatever it takes, if you know your weaknesses, home in on them and don't give up. Eventually, many of them will become clear to you if you come at them from a couple different angles. And 90% of learning is perseverance.

, If you can learn concepts hands on, you will be a lot more likely to remember them later when you study. Look up your patients' labs and find out why they are the way they are. Look up your patients' meds and learn the side effects, proper dosages, etc, even if they are meds you've seen a hundred times. The key to learning pharmacology is (sadly) repetition.

, It is never too early to start reviewing and practicing answering NCLEX-RN style questions. Getting used to the way the questions are worded is one of the best prep tools there is.

, Many independent institutions (such as Drexel University College of Nursing and Health Professions) contract with nursing schools and/or student groups across the United States to provide 4-day review courses to prep for the test. Some even offer reimbursement of test fees if you fail. If your school does not have this opportunity, seek it out elsewhere.

, Your school should be able to help you out with this, but it's very important that you do it soon after graduating, while the knowledge is fresh in your head.

, Use more than one source for review information, and do as many questions as possible before your test. If you want to be confident going into the test, count on answering at least 5,000 test prep questions prior to the test itself. This takes a long time, so budget appropriately.

, Answering that many questions in a row takes discipline and stamina, but bear in mind that you can answer 265 questions and pass the test, so make sure you can.

, Hopefully, your nursing school has already done this for you, but if not, get a review book with a CD-ROM in it, which will allow you to take the test on the computer, which is how you'll actually be taking it.

, This will cut down on stress the day of as you will already know where the test site is.

,,,, They really cut down on the distraction of ambient noise.

, Find the calculator. Complete the tutorial.

Chat about the concepts.",How to Prepare for an Exam," Give yourself more than enough time to review the material that was covered in class. You might want to gauge how soon to start studying by how much material you need to review. For instance, if you have to review material for an entire semester, you might want to start studying a few weeks prior. However, if you are just taking a test that covers material over a few chapters, a week prior or even three to four days may be sufficient.Only you know how long it takes you to study, so you are the best judge of when to start studying.
If the class material is especially difficult for you. Start studying early. Give yourself enough time to truly grasp the material, practice it and then review it.
Get a full night’s sleep before the exam. Your brain needs time to subconsciously digest everything you’ve put into it, so start early so you don’t have to stay up all night.;
, It will refresh your memory of the material and help you remember what you learned. It will also help to make you aware of all the information in your notes, where it is located in your notes so that you know where to find them, and what might be missing from your notes. Decide if you think your notes are sufficient enough to study from. Did you miss any classes? Are some of your notes missing? If so, you might need to borrow someone else’s notes.

, If you’re not a good note taker, or if there are “holes” in your notes, then ask a friend if you can copy his or her notes. Good notes can make all the difference when you’re studying. They can explain content that the book doesn’t explain well or highlight information and make it easier to understand and remember.


If you only have five pages pf notes, but your friend has twenty, then you probably missed some important information. Compare your notes to your friend’s to see where the holes are in your notes.

, One of the easiest ways to begin your studying process is to find out what is on the test directly from your teacher. Many teachers will provide some guidance on what will and will not be covered on the test. Knowing which material the test will cover will help you focus on the main material that you need to study.


Your teacher most likely won't tell you exactly what is on the test, but he or she might give you some pointers by handing you a study guide, or simply announcing what the exam will cover. , This time re-read your notes for understanding. In other words, you are going to study your notes. Start with the most basic information. So, if you’re studying an art history unit on impressionism, make sure you know what impressionism means. Who were the most famous impressionists at the time?


Ask yourself, who, what, where, when for each theme/subject matter that you are supposed to know for the test.
You can look up information online to study from, but the best information to study from is the information presented to the class because the answers will be derived from your classroom materials. Sometimes information on the internet can vary from the information that you are presented in class.
If you are planning to study from information provided on the internet, stick with sources that end with .edu or .gov.

, Yes, take even more notes. You can highlight and underline the information as well, but writing the information down really helps you retain it better. Make sure to write down concepts that you are struggling with or are having a hard time remembering.Break down complex subjects into steps or parts. For instance, if you are trying to learn the order of historical events, list out each event that happened in the order they happened. For instance, first Linus Pauling discovered DNA, then he was awarded a prize. Write down the time frame and the events that influenced each happening. Knowing these side notes should help you to recall information because they increase your level of understanding.

, The syllabus is an outline of everything that you should have learned over the course of the class. It’s a good place to start to understand major ideas and topics that you should be learning from the class. Review it and highlight the titles and subheads. These are the sections that you’ll need to at least review to make sure you understand the big ideas behind the topics.


Some teachers write down the page numbers or chapters that each section of the syllabus pertains to in your book. Take note of those pages because you should definitely review them.

, Then, go through your notes to see if you have any notes at all on those topics. Once again, if you don’t, you should ask someone for notes on those topics, and re-read the sections in the book pertaining to those topics. Anything outlined in the syllabus is usually “fair game” for test material.

, In some books, each chapter has a short review or summary. This is a great place to quickly review and get a gist of a concept. Of course, if you have no idea what the summary is referring to or you need more details to jog your memory, refer to the study guide in the back of the book. Then, re-read those specific chapters or selections in the book that you were having trouble remembering.


You might be able to find a study guide online for the material that you are studying if you are not able to get one from your teacher.

, All of the titled sections of the book from your syllabus should be re-read so that you can pull out important information. While you re-read these sections, keep in the mind the major concepts that you’re supposed to be learning from those sections of the book. Write down important details as you read.


Note the chapter titles and section titles as you read. They are a dead give away to the major concepts that are covered in those sections.

, After you have taken notes from studying all of your materials including the book and your notes, use that information to make flash cards. (Grab an index card, or cut paper into squares to use as a flashcard.) Turn statements into questions.


For instance, if the statement is Linus Pauling was one of the discoverers of DNA, then write on the flash card the question, who was one of the main discoverers of DNA? Write the question on one side, and the answer on the other.Sometimes a question will spark an idea for a follow-up question. When you’re making flashcards, often you’ll be able to see how you may have forgotten to study something. For instance, who were the other discoverers of DNA? This question springs from the Linus Pauling statement because the word “main” reminds you that there were other people involved in DNA’s discovery.
If you don’t know the answer to follow-up questions, then you should research the information and make flashcards for those questions too.
Start making flashcards for the information that you are having trouble remembering or grasping. This is the information that you need to review the most. Then, move on to information that you already know pretty well.
Making physical copies of flashcards is recommended because you have to write down the questions and answers, which is a repetitive process that will help you remember the information. Also, you can carry the flashcards around and use them at anytime. However, there are websites such as cram.com that allow you to make online flash cards.

, Once everything is written down on flashcards, quiz yourself with the cards. Keep reviewing the questions that you get wrong until you get them right. You can carry flashcards around with you and quiz yourself when you’re on the subway or riding in the car. You might quiz yourself for a half hour or so, then take a break. Definitely continue to quiz yourself until your get them all right.If you keep getting certain questions wrong, review your notes and textbook again to see if there is something you’re not understanding.

, This is especially helpful for subjects such as math. Practice doing the questions in the book that you were assigned for homework. Do extra questions in the back of the book. Re-do questions that you got wrong, and try to figure out why you got them wrong. Do practice questions until you feel more comfortable with subject matter.


If you still have more time before your exam, ask for assistance either from a teacher or a friend.

, Scientist's believe that a good night's rest is the key to better test scores.An hour and a half before the exam, start running through all the themes and sub-topics in your head. Like always, check your notes if you get stuck. Use your flashcards to help you commit all the tiny details to memory if they're not already memorized. Stop studying at least 15 minutes before the exam, but an hour is preferable. If you're given yourself enough time to study, you should feel well prepared and relaxed.

, If you have a friend who has taken the test the year or semester before, ask your friend if you can see his or her test. Take note of the questions that were answered and the answers that were marked correct and incorrect. If you are in college, some universities keep past exams from classes on file. Contact your professor about reviewing them.


Although reviewing past exams might not give you the exact questions that will appear on your test, it will give you an idea of how the information will be tested.
It also will tell you how the test will be scored. You’ll know if you should give long detailed answers or if your answers should be straight to the point. If you are able to review a test with answers on it, pay attention to answers that were given high marks and those that weren’t. Also, pay attention to any notes in the margins that the teacher may have written explaining why points were taken off.

, Reviewing past tests can help you understand the format of the test and whether it will be multiple choice, short answer or essay. It also gives you more ideas about how to study. Does it ask for specific information like dates and times that events occurred? Or is it testing big ideas with explanations in an essay format?


If you understand the format of the test, you know what information to pull out and how detailed or open-ended it might be.
You’ll also be able to assess the distribution of points. Is the essay worth much more than the multiple choice? With the past test to review, you can assess what you’ve already studied and re-assess.

, Teachers usually provide more information about the test a day or two before the exam. Sometimes they might even tell you exactly what will be on the test and exactly what will not be, but not always. Your teachers may even provide you with a study guide to study from when they’re giving away this information, and if you don’t go, you’ll miss out on it.

, Get together with a friend or group of people from your class and study together. It doesn’t have to be a formal study group. You can simply review each other’s notes to see what you may have missed, and discuss concepts you think will be covered on the test.

, Ask each other potential exam questions. Use your flashcards to quiz each other, or ask your friend to make up new questions that you didn’t think about. Even if you use the same questions that you wrote on your flashcards, you will find that the experience is different when your friend is quizzing you. More than likely, your friend will hold you accountable for answering the question in its entirety.

, Sometimes you can learn more about the information by simply discussing the concepts in a conversation with someone other than your teachers. It may help you understand the information in a different way, and it might even deepen your understanding. Bring snacks for the group or meet at a coffee shop and make the study group more casual, relaxed, and fun.

Make sure you're really prepared.,
Get a good night's sleep the night before the test, and eat a healthy breakfast when you get up.,
Remember all your equipment such as an extra pencil, ruler, calculator, etc.,
Walk to class.,
Get to class a little early.,
Breathe.,
Tell yourself it's just a test.,
Handle your nerves.,
Read the questions carefully.,
Skip questions if necessary.,
Act as if you're the only person in the room.,
Take short breaks.",How to Stay Calm During a Test," Sometimes you'll feel ready for a test but realize, too late, that you're not as prepared as you thought. If this happens frequently, you may not be studying correctly or studying enough. Revise thoroughly, but make sure you do other things too. If you revise for too long you will become unfocused, so make sure you take regular breaks! Check out the related wikiHows for help.;
, Avoid cramming the night of the exam; if you're too tired come test time you won't remember what you ""learned"" the night before.

, unless they are provided.

, A little brisk exercise will help you remain calm during any stressful situation. If your teacher will allow you to leave the room during the test, run up and down the hall or do some jumping jacks if you start feeling overwhelmed.

, If you get there early, you'll make sure to get your favorite seat. You'll also feel more relaxed if you don't get there just in time or, worse yet, late.

, Before the test, inhale through your nose deeply and slowly. Then, hold the breath for 3-4 seconds and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this several times. If you experience a sudden panic during the test, perform this exercise again.

, Really, it is. No matter what happens, everything will be OK.  

, Make sure you are not too nervous during your exams - you might forget what you have revised and just panic. You have to stay positive. If you are thinking..""Oh, I am never going to succeed in my exams,"" you never will! However, if you believe that you can do it, you will find you can!


Find a way to occupy your feet. Gently tapping on the floor while taking the test can relax yourself because you're moving, and soon your feet will tire from that and you'll be relaxed.
Tighten then relax. Tighten your fists as hard as you can, then slowly release, letting the wave of relief flow over you. This relief is encouraging and it's resting.

, Take in each word as slowly as you can, making sure your brain understands the meaning of it and what you're expected to do. Take deep breaths and play a soft song in your head, or words of encouragement. Start thinking very carefully about what's right and what's not. Then, as slowly as you can, decide on the answer or write out the answer once you're sure. Doing things slowly and carefully will be a better chance of getting the answer right, which relaxes you because you know that you have a higher chance.

, Don't spend too much time on any one question. If you get stuck, skip the question and move on. Don't get too stressed if you can't answer a question. Remember that your grade for the whole test doesn't rely on just one little question. Just skip it and come back to it later; you might find that you can answer it easily after all.

, Don't panic if you notice other students writing very quickly or handing in their tests early. Mind the time, and try to work at a steady rate, but otherwise don't worry about speed. It is not a race.

, Your teachers usually say, ""Take Your time!"" So why not? Answer about five questions, then take about a 5 minute breather. Don't count your time, just estimate it. Make sure you don't rest for too long. Lay down, rub your shoulders, or anything else that's appropriate.

Middle school might be too early for an aspirant to choose a suitable career but preparing for civil services can help them in discovering their aptitude.;
, The syllabus for civil service exams are revised periodically, but the basic structure remains the same with, English, history, civics (polity), geography, science and maths, which are taught from middle school itself. Learning is easier at school since it will be at a pace and level that is suitable for the aspirant.

, Most of the topics for IAS exams are too dry for a child, documentaries and videos can make them interesting.

, Reading fiction and non-fiction books in English and regional languages will increase their knowledge and language skills.

, Sometimes books and newspapers might be difficult to understand, discussing with your elders will help in understanding issues better and in forming and expressing opinions.

, If you are a parent, train the child to face real life situations and in public speaking. These will help them in tiding through aptitude questions, interview and eventually in the job.

, Books, TV and the internet will have its limitations compared to actually seeing and experiencing your country. Use school trips and trips with your parents to observe and understand the diverse cultures, ethnic and social background of the citizens of the nation.

, IAS is a position of power from where you could do a great deal of good things for your fellow citizens. Learn to respect and love your country and its rich and varied heritage. Learn more about the people who have worked for its freedom and well-being and learn the spirit of unity and integrity from a young age so that it lasts for a lifetime in the service of the nation.

, There are a number of different ways of showing connections between sentences. These include:

Find out what's covered.,
Research the topics covered.,
Practice providing verbal answers.,
Be confident.,
Listen carefully.,
Interpret what's being asked, quickly and effectively.,
Get a clear idea of what you're saying before you open your mouth.,
Try to project confidence through body language.,
Try to be clear and concise.",How to Survive an Oral Exam," Ask your instructor or the organization involved what kind of questions to be expected. Ask people who might have taken the exam before. Once you know the potential topics covered and the kinds of answers you'll be expected to give, you can get into the nitty gritty of your preparation.;
, There are two aspects to doing well on an oral exam: knowing your material, and practicing the presentation of it. You need to start your preparation just like studying for any other test. Study the material, arm yourself with potential answers, and know the topic through and through.

, It's been said that ""a perfect practice makes perfection"". Your mind might be fast at getting ideas, when you can't speak them clearly and convincingly, it's no use.


Stand up, act as if you're already in front of the examiner.
Repeat it till you are satisfied with your act. Possibly ask your friends or make the mirror your judge.

, Once you know you're prepared, there is no reason to panic; every examiner wants to see the confidence in your answers. Even if you say the correct words, when your expression shows doubt, you give the examiner chance to pick apart your response. Your boldness in attacking the questions is very important.  Don't fret and don't get bogged with anything; clear your mind off any negative thoughts first and answer confidently.

, A lot of your preparation for oral exams will focus on your knowledge and speaking skills, but don't neglect the importance of close listening. If you mishear your examiner or the question is phrased in a way you don't expect, you'll be on a losing path. Open up your mind and there listen carefully to the question.

, Good listening skills will help you hear how the question is being structured. Interpretation is the meaning you derived from the question. In this step, you don't need to think too much, thereby wasting time. However, you should be sure you understood what you heard and let your mind do the interpretation as quickly as to process the appropriate answer.

, It's okay to take a pause before answering. Your mind might have processed the answer, but if you can't communicate it aloud, you won't do well. Take a beat to plan your answer. Use the proper terminology for your topic. Let the examiner see no doubt in your words.

, Knowing the answer is a good thing, saying it out is another, but your reaction to the question defines your confidence or confusion. Even when you feel that question is tough to remember, smile as if it's something you already knew; the time you spend in smiling (for few seconds) will help you to process further on how to interpret the question.


There are no guarantees, but sometimes in oral exams, you need not know all the answers; your presentation and confidence can sometimes make up for any topic areas you don't know as thoroughly. The way you give answers to both the known and unknown questions will make the examiner feel you know the topic, and just answered less than ideally because you're a human, prone to mistakes.

, You want to be both fluent and eloquent. Don't reply as if you're talking to yourself; reply as if you are teaching the examiner. See them as your student who needs a point clarified. Don't be condescending, but be clear, and avoid rambling on for long periods of time once you've already given an effective answer.

Keep a close watch on the time.,
Avoid letting exam anxiety get the best of you.,
Keep yourself comfortable.,
Make one last attempt at answering difficult questions.",How to Successfully Finish an Exam on Time2," Taking unnecessary breaks will only eat up your limited exam time; make sure you use the washroom, fill your water bottle, and so on, before you enter the examination room or hall. Do your best to focus, and avoid letting your mind wander. If you are finished or convinced that you can’t answer anymore questions, stay and review your exam instead of leaving. Attempting to address questions you don’t know the answer to may leave you with extra marks, while leaving them blank will guarantee you get nothing.

, Check your watch or the nearest clock periodically to keep track of how much of the exam remains; to avoid looking up too often, check only when you finish a question or turn a page. If this is too distracting, take off your watch (or pull out your cellphone, if allowed) and place it directly in front of you. Note how long you are spending on each question and try to stick to the number of minutes you budgeted for each question; if you are taking too long on a question, flag it for later and move on.

, Worry is normal during an exam, but letting panic get the best of you can waste a lot of precious time. If you start to feel overwhelmed, give yourself a moment to collect yourself and calm your mind. To do this effectively, put down your pen or pencil, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing; try to think positive thoughts. Once you feel stronger, resume the exam., Ensure that you stay comfortable during the exam by bringing a bottle of water with you, and a sweater that you can easily put on or remove. Anxiety is linked to temperature changes in the body, meaning that your exam worry can cause symptoms that might distract you and impede your work. Some physical manifestations of anxiety that affect temperature are:


Vasoconstriction: when blood vessels tense up and cause the body to overheatSweating: the body's response to vasoconstriction (to cool your body down)Over-sensitivity: discomfort caused by heightened sensitivity to the hot or cold, Take a final opportunity to complete any questions that you don’t know the answer to, which may at least earn you a few extra points. Have a strategy in mind for completing these questions before you get to them. When “guessing”, remember that:


multiple choice answers that feel familiar are likely to be correct. choosing longer multiple choice answers over shorter ones is usually the best bet.the answers to difficult questions may be found in prior questions."

Commiserating about this kind of academic challenge may also help you relieve exam-time stress.To fully gain from the wisdom of their experience, ask questions like:


”How was the exam divided between different types of questions (e.g. multiple choice, true or false, and essay questions)?”
”What question (s) surprised you most on the exam?”
”Is there an area of study you wish you had focused on more?”

, The best way to ensure that you complete an exam efficiently is by studying as much as you can beforehand. Research has shown that an even mix of studying and practice testing is the most ideal and time-efficient approach to learning.To optimize your studying, try:


taking detailed notes; the process will help you remember the material later.closing or blocking distracting websites, and putting away your smartphone.putting on instrumental background music to perk you up and keep your focus.breaking up broad topics to study them more efficiently.

Write down why you want your GED.,
Go to class.,
Take everything you might need to class.,
Plan to spend time outside of class practicing.,
Get to know your classmates, and exchange telephone numbers.,
Let your instructor(s) know what's going on in your life, especially if something might get in the way of your academic success.,
Speak up in class.,
Don't have side conversations in class.,

Do you want a better job, to set a good example for your kids, get into college, to maintain good cause for the welfare office? It doesn't matter what your motivation is-as long as it's something that you really want. Write your motivation inside the front cover of your notebook and keep it in mind.;
, This sounds obvious, but you'd be amazed at how often learners accept excuses from themselves. Don't let yourself off the hook. Show up, 10-15 minutes before class is scheduled to start, for every single class.

, Pens/pencils and paper are obvious, of course. Add a little personal pencil sharpener to your supplies. Take ibuprofen or Tylenol with you in case you get a headache, take your inhaler or Accucheck if you have one, and take any other medicines you might need. If you're female, carry a pad or tampon--every day, not just some days. Bring a water bottle.

, During this time, write down any questions you want to ask your instructor, so you don't forget them. If you're not sure what to do outside of class, ask your instructor for ideas.

, Plan how to support one another if one of you can't get a ride to class, etc.

, They will often be able to connect you with the right resources so that you can solve your problems and concentrate on academics.

, Ask questions. Make sure you understand each concept as it comes up.

, Turn off your cell phone before you come into the classroom. Don't read the newspaper or other material during class.

, If you haven't mastered the concept being discussed, focus on that concept right now, and don't get out other material. Your book will be there later, but your instructor won't.

, Plan on an absolute minimum of 60 days (2 months) for each year of school you missed or have forgotten. If you dropped out in 9th grade and haven't being studying on your own since then, you're not likely to pass your GED after a 2-week evening class. Expecting yourself to do so is just setting yourself up for failure. Set a realistic baby-step goal, and celebrate when you achieve it. (For example, ""This week I'm going to master those distance-rate-time math questions."")

, GED classes can be stressful, but making sure that spend time on yourself can reduce stress and give you self confidence. Practice good dental hygiene, wear clean, ironed (if possible) clothes, and consider giving up any damaging habits like smoking or drinking before you start GED classes.

, It's okay not to talk to someone, but it's NOT okay to be rude to them or to talk about them.

, It's courteous and responsible, and will help you in many unexpected little ways.

, Steck-Vaughan and McGraw-Hill both have good practice tests online, which you can use for free. If you're not ready for the real GED-level material yet, ask your instructor to help you find good practice material at your level. Make a chart to show your improvement. Also, ask your instructor for feedback regularly.

, Don't fool yourself into thinking you're ""one of those people who only needs 4-5 hours of sleep a night."" Those people are sleep deprived. If you can't sleep longer than that, talk to a doctor.

, The easy way to eat right is to avoid all the processing you can in your foods. (For example, eating potatoes is good; eating potato chips is not. Bread that you can still see the seeds or seed bits in is better than bread made with flour bleached white.) Eat as many different kinds of plant foods as you can. Drink lots of water.

, It's okay to ask for permission to use an appropriate place in the building where you have class. You'll probably get permission, and will impress your instructor(s).

Instead, try rephrasing it in a conversational tone, as if relating a story to a friend.For example, if you're outlining the history of Henry VIII and how he introduced the theory of the divine right of kings of England, write something like ""Henry wanted to be able to tell everyone what to do."";
, If you have a series of words or concepts you need to memorize, take the first letter of each one, and then turn those letters into a phrase. A popular example is “Every Good Boy Deserves Fun” as a way to remember EGBDF – the first five musical notes of the treble clef.Another example is ""My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas"" to remember the order of the planets from the sun, starting with Mercury and ending with Pluto (if you're still including it).

, These aren’t just for learning basic math and vocabulary – you can use them for more complicated concepts like physics, history, or calculus. Try writing a term or concept on one side of a 3x5 notecard and then sketching a picture of it on the other side. Even if the drawing is terrible, you’re likely to remember what you came up with to express the concept visually.For example, if you're making Spanish flashcards and you have the word aceitunas (olives), draw a silly picture on the other side of a tuna fish eating an olive.

, Studying is more effective when you know what you need to accomplish. Start each session with a specific goal, such as learning 30 vocabulary words, solving 20 math equations, or reading two chapters in your textbook., Don’t squeeze study time in whenever you get a chance. Schedule a solid block of time and try to keep this consistent from day to day. If you treat it like any other time commitment, you’re more likely to stick to it.Make 7-9 pm your study time each night if you like to study after dinner. Or try 5-7 pm if you want to have time to relax after dinner.

, Look for a private space, like a bedroom, office, or even a closet with good lighting, where you can go and shut the door. If this does not dissuade parents, siblings, or roommates from bothering you, ask for a couple hours to be left alone so that you can focus without interruptions.Consider getting out of the house and going somewhere where you don’t know anyone, like a local library or a quiet cafe.
Invest in some noise-canceling headphones if you're having trouble finding a quiet spot. Or, if you're able to focus while listening to music, use regular headphones to listen to a playlist that doesn't distract you.

, It’s far too easy to reach over to check the time on your phone and then get sucked into checking emails, texts, and social media. If you’re studying at home, leave your phone in another room. If you’re studying at a library or cafe, put it on silent and leave it in a zippered pocket of your bag where you can’t easily glance at it.

, Even if you don’t mind the background noise, your brain is still listening to it while you’re working, so you’re not focusing as much of your mental energy on studying as you could be., Some work must be done on a computer, but take advantage of any opportunity to do work on paper. This will decrease the chances of you getting distracted by something on the internet.For example, write outlines by hand rather than typing them, find a physical copy of a book rather than an e-book, or make flashcards to quiz yourself rather than using any online self-tests.

, Your teacher has likely seen every possible mistake over the years, so they’re the best person to talk to about your problems with the material. They may be able to talk through the particular issues you’re having, but if not, they can direct you to someone who can, like a classmate or tutor.Ask your teacher for practice tests. They often have these available for students who want to quiz themselves at home, and you’ll get a better sense for the types of questions that will be asked on the real test.

, If you decide you want to get one-on-one help from a tutor, ask your teacher or school administrator if they have a special group of school-sponsored tutors for you to work with. If not, you can look up tutors through tutoring agency websites, or visit a local non-profit organization like the YMCA to see if they offer tutoring., Studying with others can be a great way to remember difficult material since you’ll all be rephrasing concepts into your own words as you discuss them. You might also have an opportunity to teach someone else something, which will help you internalize material better.Ask your teacher if they know of an established study group, or volunteer to form your own. Offer to host the first meeting if you have the space, or direct everyone to meet at the library at a certain time.

, Figure out what specifically is causing you trouble. Once you know what the problem is you can create a detailed plan for improvement. It may help to sit down with a parent, teacher, or friend to look over your exams and see if there are any consistencies.


For example, are you not getting to the last few math problems every time? This could mean you need to learn time management skills for test-taking.
Are you having trouble remembering the order of certain historical events? You may benefit from mnemonic devices.

, It’s easy to think of all the bad things that might happen if you don’t do well on your next test, or to start thinking you’ll never do well on a test again. But this sort of thinking will only serve to distract you. Instead think to yourself, “I didn’t do so well last time, but I’m doing my best to improve for next time.”, It’s easy to talk yourself out of studying or convince yourself you’ll get to it in a few minutes, but these types of thoughts typically snowball until you’ve avoided studying altogether and are out of time.If you’re finding it difficult to get motivated to study, try scheduling study sessions as short as thirty minutes so that it doesn’t seem so daunting.

, Don’t beat yourself up when your mind starts to wander while studying. That’s a sign that you need a break, so take fifteen minutes to walk around the block, grab a snack, or listen to your favorite song. Try switching subjects when you return. It’s okay to be sick of math and need to switch to English for awhile."

Give yourself plenty of time to prepare.,
Think in English.,
Learn English grammar.,
Learn to recognize the parts of speech in English.,
Learn some idioms.,
Read as much as you can in English.,
Write as much as you can in English.,
Take a practice test.,
Buy TOEFL prep books.,
Be familiar with question types.,
Keep on taking practice tests.",How to Study for the TOEFL," Learning a language takes a long time.;
, Do so all the time, while you walk, while you plan your day, while you eat. It will become easier as you practice more.


The best way is to put your skills to use, having conversations with native speakers. There are many sites on the Internet offering pen pals and conversation partners. You can meet face to face or use Skype or other services. You may even meet an English-speaker who wants to learn your language, if you're willing to return the favor.
You can also listen to radio, television, and even podcasts in English.

, Grammar alone will not assure you a good score in the grammar section, but it is important to know

, Nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjections are the primary ones. There are also phrases that function as nouns, verbs, and so on.

, Try Wiktionary for a list of idioms with definitions.

, Magazines, newspapers, and short articles are a good start, but try to work up to reading books. The reading section will be hardest if you don't understand the main idea.

, Don't worry if your writing isn't perfect. Just work on putting together good paragraphs of about 5-6 sentences each. Practice pre-writing, or organizing your writing using an outline or other technique. You will find it easier to write a good piece if you have a plan.

, You can find TOEFL practice online or purchase a test preparation book such as Barron's TOEFL.


Time yourself during your practice so that you learn how long each section takes.
Practice each section of the test and become familiar with it, so that you understand how each section works.
Learn what sort of questions have been asked before, what sort of essay topics have been assigned, and what sort of subjects have been on the test before.
Find out which sections and concepts are difficult and work on getting more practice in those areas.

, A good place to start is 'The Official Guide to the TOEFL Test'. You can also find copies of books online that you can review on the computer. They'll familiarize you with the structure of the test and how the content will be presented.


There are a lot of tips in most of the prep books. Read them and keep them in mind -- they can make the difference between a good score and a great score.

, There are certain types of questions in TOEFL; make sure you know what types of questions will be on test. Here's a very brief rundown:Reading questions -- mainly multiple choice, dealing with vocabulary, detail, purpose, negative factual information, essential information, reference, and inference. You will also deal with where to put information in a sentence, summaries, and tables.
Listening questions -- again, mainly multiple choice, dealing with main idea, detail, purpose, organization and implications. There are also tables and some questions where you give more than one answer.
Speaking questions -- you'll be given a topic to listen about, a little while to gather your thoughts, and then time to speak. The topics will vary from the more academic to the personal.
Writing questions -- you'll be given two tasks. The first one you'll write about for 20 minutes, the second for 30. You must give your opinion and be able to back it up.

, Taking one test means nothing -- you could do really well or really poorly. So take it a few times. Your final score will probably fall in the range of the ones had on your practice tests. And the more you take, the less nervous you'll be!

Have a goal for studying.,
Develop interest in studies.,
Find things to motivate yourself.,
Make a plan.,
Find a good place to read.,
Take only your essentials.,
Understand the fact that reading is not same as studying.,
Read the summary before starting the chapter.,
Speak loudly while reading.,
Have full concentration while studying.,
Revise during this time if you have everything finished.,
Study everyday.,
Consider writing Short Notes.,
Don't take breaks.,
Juggle your study topics.",How to Study Well in Short Time," Use that goal to keep your mind active.;
, Interest is the key factor in studying. Acquire it first before studying.

, Even if you have a goal, you can't go very far without motivation, so watch videos or read articles that motivate you to study.

, Know what you have to do in a certain amount of time. Take a paper and write down the amount of chapters you have to do in a week. Don't keep your schedule too tight!, Studying alone works best when you have limited time. Make sure you don't have any distractions.

, Don't waste time walking around and looking for things you don't need.

, Reading doesn't transfer the information into long term memory.You might understand all the stuff but you will forget it after a day or two. Quickly revise the chapters you studied the day before for the first 5 minutes of your study session.

, It will give you the outline of the chapter so you can study more effectively.

, This will help you remember much more faster than simply reading.

, We already removed all distractions in Step 4 but remember those includes your mobile phones, laptops, PCs, etc. which distracts you.

, This is the best time to revise. One good strategy is to revise all your week's work on Sunday, this will give your mind some rest and you won't forget everything.

, Make it a habit, studying an hour should be must no matter which day it is. It will be tough at first but as time goes it will become a habit.

, Write down important points, formulas, reactions, equations, etc. This is extremely helpful when revising during exams., When you are studying for a short time, breaks are not advised. If you are planning to study for more than one hour then take break after 45 min., Don't study the same subject each day, instead try studying different topics every other day."

Jot down what you should know.,
Take a stab at working through a problem.,
Retry the first concept.,
Move onto the next concept.,
Make and take your own practice test.",How to Study the Day Before a Test1," For math, science, and similar tests, you should have an idea of which concepts the teacher will be testing your knowledge of. Put all of them down on paper so you can check off the ones you learn. This also gives you a way to organize the concepts in your head.

Find some practice problems. Some good places to look are your textbook, on pages you didn’t do in class or homework, or the review section in the back of the book. A study guide would be ideal for this as well.
If you don’t have anything to give you practice problems, you may have to write your own. Though this is more time-consuming, it may help you learn the concept. To write a practice problem, after all, you have to have some understanding of the concept or formula.;
, It is a good idea to go ahead and see how close you are to understanding the theory. This will save you from wasting time on a problem you could already almost solve. Prioritizing your time will mean that when you get stuck, you will have less to look up in your notes and textbook.


After you get stuck, use your notes to work through the problem.
Graded homework is another good place to find solutions to problems like the one you’re working on.

, After you have used your notes to solve the first practice problem, try another one. The goal is to be able to solve each kind of problem without help from your notes. If you can get it on your second or third try, then you can move onto the next concept.


Repeat this process until you have mastered the concept.

, Go down your checklist using the book as you need it to solve practice problems. You want to move quickly down the list, but make sure you are internalizing the formulas you need. It will be much less stressful later on if you have taken the time to memorize everything at first.

, Writing your own test or study guide will help you in more ways than one. First, you have to think about and work through a theory or formula in your head in order to come up with a practice problem. Second, going back through and solving the problems makes you actually walk through the process on paper, and see which methods do and don’t work.Organize the practice test like you did your notes. Have a subheading with each concept or chapter, then give 2-3 practice problems.

Write down the overarching concepts you need to know.,
Write down as many specific terms as you can.,
Cluster similar ideas.,
Learn some names and dates.,
Go back and quiz yourself on concepts you already looked at.",How to Study the Day Before a Test2," Contrary to popular belief, humanities subjects like English and History are not just rote memorization. It is much more important to know the importance of the ideas you read about than simply who said them. Your test will likely have some component of free writing, and this is the space to really impress your teacher.Be aware that it's very difficult to cram for a test that asks you to discuss the importance of themes and overarching concepts, as that isn't something you can quickly quiz with flashcards.
Try to formulate some ""big picture"" questions and come up with answers to them. For example, if you're studying for a History exam, you could try a question like this: ""What are a few of the contributing factors to the start of the American Revolution?"" Then, list some factors and how they helped start the war.

, While learning the overarching concepts is the purpose of a humanities exam, you will likely also be expected to know the names, dates, and terms. Go through your notes and write down as many of them as you can find. You may not be able to learn all of these, but writing them down stores them in the back of your mind in a place you might be able to access later.


For a history test, look for names, dates, eras, organizations, political movements, etc.
For an English test, write down characters, authors, years, major works, literary movements, etc.

, The next step in learning ideas for a humanities exam is developing associations between all the terms. This mental map will help you connect the individual terms to the overall concepts. If you want, you can even draw out a map, or ‘spider web,’ between names and dates to help visualize how they relate to one another.

, Now that you have put together the basic concepts and some of the major terms in your mind, you need to learn some little details. The best way to do this is repetition and memorization. Rote memorization may be tedious, but it’s your only shot this late in the game.


Draw a straight line in the middle of a piece of paper. Write a name or date on the left side, and what you need to know about it on the other.
Fold the paper in half and only look at one side at a time. This is an easy way to quiz yourself.

, Every time you reinforce what you’ve already learned, it becomes more imprinted in your mind. This will make it easier for your brain to access the information in the test tomorrow. However, if it is already late, go to bed and help your brain recover that way.

"
"
Write down the lessons you need to know.,
Use flashcards for vocabulary.,
Write sentences to practice grammar.,
Practice speaking out loud.",How to Study the Day Before a Test3," You want to learn every aspect of a language over time, but you don’t have time for that right now. Don’t worry about becoming fluent overnight, because you won’t be able to. Instead, focusing your learning will help you demonstrate mastery of the concepts that will earn you a good grade.


A few examples of vocabulary sets are kitchen and dining, transportation, and animals.
Some examples of grammatical units are irregular verbs, past tense, or adjective endings.

, Write the English word on one side, and the other language on the flip side. Cutting your index cards in half is a good way to conserve them. After all, you only need a little space to squeeze in a word or phrase.A way to make this even easier for your brain to associate a concept with its word in a foreign language is with drawings. For example, if you’re trying to learn die Gabel, German for fork, drawing a fork on one side rather than the English word fork may help you connect the concept to the German word.

, As tedious as this is, it is the best way to learn grammar. Write a sentence for each tense and/or word ending. Afterwards, you can choose to write more sentences, or to read over the ones you already wrote, partially memorizing them. Grammar is an essential part of languages, so you should spend time on it.

, If you are no longer in entry level courses, your test may involve a speaking component. Luckily, this is pretty easy to do if you are already studying. When you are using flash cards, say the word before you flip it over. Similarly, say the sentences you are writing out loud. This will get you in the habit of saying the words that you will need for the test tomorrow.


Make sure you are pronouncing the word correctly. Some languages are easier for beginners to learn the intonations than others, but your teacher will respect that you have done your best for your skill level.
Speaking out loud in the language will also help you with circumlocution. This is the ability to find ways to describe what you want to say if you can’t remember the word. For example, if you can’t remember the word fork, saying something like “this is a small kitchen tool that is not a spoon or a knife, that you use to eat chicken.” Your teacher may not give you full credit, but may be impressed with your ability to use the language to describe what you mean.

"
Plan what you will study.,
Study in short, concentrated increments.,
Don’t study in bed.,
Get enough sleep.,
Wake up with enough time to get ready.",How to Study the Day Before a Test4," If you have only a few hours to cram for a test, every minute counts. A smart plan of attack will allow you to learn the most important concepts for your test. You’ll have to save learning the little details for the next test, when you plan ahead enough time for studying.

Look at any information the teacher has given you about the test: study guides, the syllabus, etc.
Divide your time according to each unit or chapter you’re responsible for knowing. If one is much bigger than another, adjust your time accordingly.
Jot down where to find book chapters and personal notes for each chapter.
If you know ahead of time what concepts you need to learn, jot them down quickly so you have a goal for each section.

, Try studying for 45 minutes out of every hour, then taking a break. This will help you stay focused and keep your brain performing optimally. Get up and walk around, straighten your back, and don’t look at a computer screen. Try eating a slice of apple or two for a little energy boost., Your brain normally associates your bed with sleep. The first problem with studying in bed is that you will feel sleepy and learn less effectively. The second problem is that you’ll gradually reconfigure your brain, making it associate bed with staying awake. This will make it more difficult for you to fall asleep when you want to.


If you don’t have a desk or workspace, try a kitchen or dining room table.
Couches may be a comfortable place to work, but they may be too comfortable. If you find yourself less alert studying on a sofa, move to a table.

, You might think that studying all night will help you learn more for your test, and therefore it’s a good idea. However, learning every fact in the book won’t help you if you’re too sleepy to take the test. You’re much better off learning what you can and getting a good night’s rest. After all, you may have to accept the fact that you aren’t getting a 100 on this test. Getting enough sleep will help you get the best grade possible.

, You don’t want to wake up so late that you’re rushing to get ready and stressing yourself out. However, you also don’t want to wake up with enough time to overthink the test. Do all your studying the night before, get some sleep, wake up the next morning, and get to school on time.

Get ready to focus.,
If you have been procrastinating online (which you most likely have), then close all the other tabs on your computer except this one and what you need to study (which shouldn't be much).,
Begin focusing.,
Gather all the materials you need.,
Begin by skimming through the entire chapter.,
Next, look at your notes you have and change them if need be.,
Decide how much time you have taken up already: it should be no more than an hour.

,
If you have enough time, go back and look at your classwork and homework assignments.,
If you don't have enough time, then look at your quizzes instead.,
Study your notes next.,
Finally, go on to the study guides your teacher provided or if you created for yourself.,
If it's not too late, then do something quiet and relaxing until 10 minutes before bed (and choose to go to bed as early as possible tonight), such as reading a calming book, knitting, or anything but getting on your computer and losing track of time!

,
10 minutes before bed, review your study guide one last time.,
Go to bed early.,
Get up approximately 10 minutes earlier than normal, and review the bare minimum of your study guide.,
If possible then glance at it again before the test, but don't worry and go berserk about it.,
Good luck!

",How to Study the Night Before a Test Without Cramming," This can take a few minutes to even an hour if you have much to do to get ready. First, ask yourself why you haven't been studying for the past few hours and assess it. If you have been at sports practice or doing other homework, it doesn't matter.;
, ((Note: if quiet music helps you concentrate, turn the radio to a station which plays only classical music. If you can't find one then use Pandora, create a ""Solo Piano"" radio or ""Peaceful Holidays"" radio which will only play instrumental.)) If you haven't been sitting on your bed for more than an hour doing nothing, then skip to the next step. But even if you've been doing nothing you should get up. Stretch, and take a break. Shower if you need to, make yourself a cup of tea or decaf coffee (you won't need caffeine), and be sure to keep a bottle of water handy.

, Close your door, tune out all other noises and turn on the lights. Get comfortable because you will be there a while.

, Choose only the raw study guides, notes, and your book to use, preferably only the things your teacher told you to use to prepare for the test.

, It may seem like a lot of work, but if your test is not that long read thoroughly and completely. This will help you review before you begin studying your study guides and get confused.

, While going through the chapter, take a look at your notes to see if they are correct and complete.

,, These are great ideas to simply review, because bookwork questions are often on the test.

, These questions will almost definitely be on the test and quizzes are shorter than classwork and homework worksheets.

, Read through them once if they fill up more than 5 pages; if they are 2 to 4 pages long then read through them twice. Be sure you understand each concept. If you have fill in the blank notes cover the blank with your hand and quiz yourself using the rest of the sentence.

, If you have a checklist or something your teacher emailed, then definitely fill it out now. If it's already filled out then just review it over and over, and quiz yourself on it.

,, It is scientifically proven that reviewing before bed will make you remember it well.

, Relax and envision an A on that test!

, Don't spend too much time or worry about it.

, If your teacher is laid back then use the 5 minutes wisely, or if not do it at another time, such as during lunch.

Have a short relaxation period before beginning to study for that grueling test.,
Gather up the necessary materials needed to study for that one particular test.,
Study just the 'important' stuff.,
Every once in a awhile, not often, take 10-15 minute breaks, so your brain can absorb all this new information.,
Try not to procrastinate when studying for a test.,
Study for about an hour and then quiz yourself on that information you went over in that past hour.",How to Study Just Enough for a Test," One must have a clear and relaxed head before accomplishing anything drastic. Do whatever you feel like doing before you begin studying for that test, but DO NOT do something that will steer you off course for a couple of hours. Do something quick and to the point.;
, If you don't have the right materials to begin, then that isn't a good indication that you are ready to learn. Being prepared is essential if you want to study enough.

, If your teacher explains to you what the test will consist of, study only what she tells you will be on the test. There is no need to add extra information into your brain and confuse you during the test. It's always an excellent idea to have some background information, but only the right kind of background information can help you.

, You need to relax and not cram all the information into a short time frame.

, That is an absolute, ""no, no"". Procrastination leads into panicking and stress because you didn't quite study enough and you are not freaking out over failing it. You can procrastinate all you want after you are comfortable with the information you absorbed during study time, and sure you will ace the exam.

, That will help to ensure that you already know that information and do not need to waste more time studying repetitive information. Then continue on to the next information you need to memorize.


Once you feel accomplished and absolutely ready to leap at the test, you are probably ready to finally take it! If you have repeatedly quizzed yourself on all the information necessary to be successful for the test and know it, then exceptionally well done job.

Respond to a series of questions.,
Answer questions using written information.,
Practice your problem-solving skills.,
Express your opinions.,
Get lots of conversation practice.",How to Study for the TOEIC Speaking Test1," Part of the TOEIC requires listening to three questions, then responding to the questions quickly. Have your language tutor or conversation partner devise a series of questions regarding everyday situations, then, without knowing the questions ahead of time, answer them.For instance, your conversation partner might ask, “Where did you go on your most recent vacation?” or “What is your favorite school subject and why?”
The time limit for these questions varies from just 15-30 seconds, so answer the questions immediately and succinctly.;
, Part of the speaking portion of the TOEIC involves reading a brief passage, then conversing with a partner about what you read. Have your language tutor or a partner draft several such documents so you can hone your language comprehension and summarization abilities.For instance, you might read a flyer advertising a new film. The flyer might contain information about the show time, the director, the stars of the film, and a brief plot summary. Your conversation partner can then ask you about these details, and you can respond appropriately.

, One of the exercises you’ll be faced with during the TOEIC is listening to a brief statement by someone with a problem. For instance, you might hear a voicemail message left by someone with a flat tire, or someone who has been locked out of their home. You will have to listen carefully to this problem in order to identify it.After listening to the problem, you’ll have to offer an appropriate response. Try several of these problem-solving exercises by first listening to a language partner’s problem, then suggesting a solution.
For instance, using the above example of someone who was locked out of their home, you might reply, “I would call them back and tell them to sit tight. Then I would bring my set of keys to them so they could get inside.”

, Part of the speaking portion of the TOEIC involves expressing an opinion on a current event or other social issue. Practice phrases like “I like public libraries because…” and “I think universal health coverage is a bad policy because…” Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary used to discuss issues that affect society, including taxes, voting rights, and climate change. This will enable you to proffer an intelligent response when faced with these opinion-based questions., Spend additional time with your language tutor in freeform conversation. Engage in question-and-answer sessions similar to those you might encounter in the TOEIC speaking test, but ask questions of your own, as well. The more you practice using English, the more confident you’ll be when it comes time to taking the speaking portion of the TOEIC.Role-playing with your language tutor is of great help in perfecting your English. Act out a situation in which you or your language partner is the owner of a pet store, a star athlete, or a traveler speaking with hotel staff.
Aim to converse smoothly and keep your answers direct.
Always encourage your language tutor to correct your pronunciation when necessary.

Refer to your syllabus.,
Rank the tests by importance.,
Consider your course grade needs.,
Consider studying in order of the test dates.,
Set aside specific study times.",How to Study when You Have Multiple Tests1," You should have a syllabus for each of your classes. Write down every exam date for each of your classes in a day planner or organizer. You should also make a note of how much the exam is worth to the overall course. For example, an entry in your planner might say: History exam #2, worth 20% of the course.If you can't find your syllabus, check the course website or ask the instructor for another copy.;
, Look at your planner to see the day or week that you have multiple tests. Since the exams will most likely be worth different amounts for each course, you should rank the tests by the most important to least important. For example, your list may look like this:Biology test: worth 30%
History test: worth 20%
Algebra test: worth 15%

, Once you've ranked the exams by importance, determine if you'd like to spend more time studying for the most important exam. If your course grades are all around the same grade, you may want to do this. But if you have a poor course grade for the test that is worth the least, you may want to study more for this exam to boost your overall course grade.


For example, if you currently have an A in biology, but have a C- in algebra, you may want to spend more time studying for your math test.

, You could also choose to study by the test date. This is a good option if you have multiple tests spread throughout the week. If you do this, ensure that you plan to study at least a week or two before the exams. Your schedule might look something like this for the week before the exams:


Monday: study for next Monday's history test
Wednesday: study for next Wednesday's biology test
Thursday: study for next Thursday's algebra test

, After you've decided how you're going to study, schedule exact study times and write them in your day planner or organizer. Be as specific as you can with the schedule. For example, instead of just writing, ""Study on Tuesday,"" you could note, ""Study for biology test on Tuesday from 1 to 1:30.""Being specific with your schedule will help you feel organized and prevent you from wasting valuable study time.

Recite a written passage.,
Explain what’s going on in a photo.,
Take a sample test.,
Enroll in a study course.",How to Study for the TOEIC Speaking Test2," Part of the TOEIC speaking test is a recitation test. To prepare for this portion of the speaking test, read aloud from an English-language periodical or newspaper. Have a native English speaker listen to you and correct your intonation and pronunciation.If, as you read, you find that you cannot understand certain words or sentences, ask your language tutor for aid or break out a dictionary to identify the words you don’t know.

, Another sort of exercise question you might encounter on the TOEIC speaking test is the photo description. To practice for this type of question, leaf through a magazine and look at the images. Try to talk about random images for at least 30-45 seconds.If you find that you’re having trouble adequately describing the picture, break out a dictionary and identify the words you don’t know.

, ETS, the company that administers the TOEIC, offers a sample test on its website. To study effectively for the TOEIC speaking section, take this sample speaking test. You can access the sample speaking test at the ETS website., Many institutions offer formal TOEIC preparation classes. These classes can help you become more familiar with both the speaking and writing sections of the TOEIC. Depending on your location, you might be able to get a free or low-cost study course at a church or library. Paid study courses are often available through local colleges or academies. Look for ways to take a TOEIC study course by conducting an online search or inquiring at local educational institutes."

Join an English club.,
Use multimedia.,
Seek opportunities to use English each day.,
Focus on perfecting words you struggle with.",How to Study for the TOEIC Speaking Test3," In an English club, you and others who are studying English as a second language can practice your skills, usually under the direction of a native English speaker or someone who is fluent in English. This will help you polish your abilities, and you might even be able to gain some insight into what the test is like by speaking with people who have taken it.If there are not English clubs near you, start one or locate an English-language chatroom where you can practice your speaking skills.

, Watching English-language shows and movies (especially with subtitles) or listening to spoken English will expose you to new vocabulary and help you get a better sense of how natural English sounds. There are countless hours of both audio and video online. Start your search for useful foreign-language multimedia there.When you encounter new or useful phrases in your multimedia sources, write them down and repeat them word-for-word daily. This will enable you to memorize and deploy them later.

, There are many ways to incorporate English into your everyday life. For instance, you might volunteer for an activity or project where you have to communicate with English speakers. You could also set your phone or computer to display alerts and menu information in English., If there are certain words that you know you have a hard time using or pronouncing, write them on a list. Read each word from the list aloud daily, and make a sentence using each. This will quickly familiarize you with the meaning of the word and its use."

Consider your study style.,
Study early and often.,
Avoid cramming the day of the exam.,
Chunk your study sessions.,
Consider studying in different locations.",How to Study when You Have Multiple Tests2," Seriously think about how effective your study habits are. Write down a list of things you struggle with when studying for exams. Make changes in your study habits to address these concerns. For example, if you find it hard to concentrate while studying, try studying in a completely quiet place. Or if you find that you need light background noise, consider playing soft music while you study.


Do as much as you can to improve your study habits before you begin studying. This way, valuable time will be spent actually studying.

, Cramming, studying for an extended period of time right before the exam, is one of the worst ways to study for a test. You may remember the information for a short period of time, but if you're studying for multiple tests, you're just likely to scramble or forget critical information. Instead, study for short periods of time (about 45 minutes) and study frequently in the weeks leading up to the exam.Short and frequent study sessions helps you recall and relearn information so you're more likely to remember it in the long term.

, If you've prepared for your exams ahead of time, you should be ready to take them. But if you wait until the last minute to study for your exams, you won't actually learn the material you need to know and you'll increase your anxiety. Try to relax on the day of the test(s) so you can recall the information you need.To make you feel at ease before the exam, ensure that you eat a healthy meal and get plenty of sleep the night before. This will help you pay attention to the exam and not just how you're feeling.

, You may find it easier to study several smaller themes for a single exam rather than all of the exam material at once. Breaking the material up into chunks can keep you interested and focused while you're studying. You're also less likely to feel overwhelmed and stop studying.For example, if you're studying for a foreign language exam, you could do separate study sessions for speaking practice, written practice, and reading practice.

, Studies have shown that using the same study spot won't help you remember the material over the long term. Instead, challenge yourself to recall and retain information by studying in different places. While you don't need to study each subject in a different spot, you should change your study spot every day. This can help you recall course material on test day.Similarly, if you always need complete silence to study or think about the course, try having a study group that meets in a noisier place. For example, join a study group that meets in the student commons or cafeteria. This may challenge you to focus and recall information.

"
"
Keep your test information straight.,
Focus on one exam at a time.,
Alternate subjects when you study.,
Consider taking a bye.",How to Study when You Have Multiple Tests3," You might feel as though you've got a lot of information to keep track of, but it is starting to become scrambled. This is a sign that you should step back from studying. To keep your information straight, avoid studying for a different test right before you take another test.


For example, don't study for the British history test that you're worried about right before you take your Western Civilization exam. You might find that you are recalling information for the wrong course and can't remember the information you need.

, It's easy to feel overwhelmed by multiple tests. Remind yourself that once you finish the first exam, you only need to focus on a few more. If your tests are on different days, focus completely on that subject for the day. This will help you give attention to each exam. Once you've finished the exam, you can shift your attention to the next important test.


If your tests are on the same day, try to schedule a little bit of a break. Focus on the first exam, take a break, and then complete your other exam(s).

, If you have two or three tests, you might feel like you can't take a break from studying for something. Treat studying for different subjects as breaks. For example, you could study history for 45 minutes and then switch to studying algebra for 30 minutes. This will shift your mental focus and help you spend your study time more effectively.To give yourself the biggest mental break, you may want to alternate studying for a challenging subject with one that's easier for you.

, If you have 2 or 3 exams or finals scheduled for the same day, talk to one of your professors about arranging an alternate test date. While few instructors may agree to doing this for exams during the semester, your school might have a policy about offering a bye during finals week.To find out your school's policy, check the handbook, ask your advisor, or check with the academic office.

Don't give up if you fail the test.",How to Study for the GED Constitution Test," The Constitution test covers the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the U.S. Flag Code, in addition to the state constitution of the state in which you're taking the test. You can find copies of these documents online.You can find copies of the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence on many U.S. government websites including the Library of Congress.
All of these documents also are available at your local library. Just ask the reference librarian to help you locate them.
If you are an Illinois resident, the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) has a detailed study guide with quizzes that includes relevant excerpts from the primary documents covered by the test, as well as explanations of each paragraph or section of those documents. You can download the study guide from the ICCB's website.
These sorts of study guides can keep you from having to remember everything in each of the primary documents, since they typically focus exclusively on the material you'll need to know for the test.;
, As you read the primary documents, create an outline of each document and write down in your own words what each section or paragraph says. The primary documents themselves include archaic language and legalese, but putting them into your own words makes them easier to understand.Simply the act of writing down the information will improve your memory of it. When you read something, you're engaging in passive learning, but writing it out engages your brain actively and reinforces the information in your memory.
You may have heard that you learn better by teaching. When you write something down in your own words, you are essentially reading the information and then teaching it to yourself, which also engages your brain to encourage the information to solidify in your long-term memory.
You might consider telling someone else, such as a friend or family member, about the information you've learned. Saying it out loud engages other parts of your brain and makes the memory stronger.
It can be beneficial to talk about what you're learning with a child. A child is less likely to know about the things you're studying, so it will be new information to them. In addition, children tend to be inquisitive and will probably ask you a lot of questions.

, You can buy a set of index cards (or cut regular paper into smaller squares – just make sure you can't see through them) and put questions on one side and answers on the back to help you study for the test.Flash cards are particularly helpful for memorizing vocabulary terms, such as ""separation of powers"" or ""impeachment,"" that you'll have to define on your test.
You also can use them for lists of things covered by the documents tested, such as a list of the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution.

, Keeping the information on your flash cards brief increases your ability to memorize it. This is referred to as ""chunking"" by psychologists and other professionals who've studied the ability to remember information.Generally, if you group items into small groups, you will remember more of the information than if you try to memorize it in a long, unbroken stream.
This is why, for example, you typically find it easier to remember your Social Security number than a single string of nine numbers – it's grouped into chunks of three, then two, then four. You may even chunk it further, remembering the last four digits as two two-digit numbers rather than a string of four individual numbers.

, There are a number of mental tricks you can use to make various facts, especially dates and lists, much easier to remember than simply repeating the facts over and over again with no context.Mnemonic devices or acronyms provide you with a single word or short phrase that's easier to remember than the information it represents.
For example, if you want to remember the freedoms the First Amendment protects, consider using the acronym ""RAPPS,"" which stands for the freedoms of Religion, Assembly, Petition, Press, and Speech.
Creating a rhyme or song also can help you remember the information by engaging different parts of your brain.

, Generally, it's best to study at a time and place where you are reasonably comfortable, have adequate lighting, and can be assured of few distractions. Because you'll remember more with repetition, try to carve out some time to study each day, even if it's only for a few minutes.Background music can help you focus by drowning out other noise that can be distracting. Experts may recommend classical music, but that may not work for you – especially if you don't like classical music. You can experiment to find the best music that engages your brain.
Ideally, you should be studying in a place where you're neither too cold or too hot, as these sensations can distract you and keep you from focusing on the material you're studying.
Likewise, adequate lighting keeps you from straining to read, or from squinting under lights that are too bright. Make sure the light under which you study is steady and calm with very little glare on your page or screen.

, The Constitution test may require you to name your elected representatives. The first step in studying for this portion of the test is to learn the offices covered by the test and the individuals who occupy those offices.The basic study guide available from your state's educational department or from school districts typically will list the elected offices covered by the test.
For example, if you're taking the Illinois test, you'll need to know the name of the state governor, the two U.S. senators, and the member of the U.S. house of representatives that represents the district where you live.
A simple online search typically can uncover the names of the individuals who hold those offices, as well as links to their websites, news stories, and other information about them.

, Memorizing random names can be difficult, but learning about the background of the individual associated with that name can make the person come alive in your mind so they are more memorable.Think about how easily you find it to remember the names of your favorite celebrities or professional athletes. Generally, their names are easy to remember because you're interested in them – in who they are and in the things they do.
If you can find some aspect of an elected official's life that interests you personally, you can connect them to that interesting thing to make their name easier to remember.
For example, if you find out one of your state senators has the same dog that you do, you develop a connection with that person that makes it easier to remember their name (and maybe even their dog's name, although that likely won't be on the test).

, A simple way to remember the names of elected officials is to watch videos of them speaking. Particularly if an official has been in office for several years, you typically can find many videos of that person online for free.Videos engage the visual and auditory portions of your brain. It often is easier to remember information if it is associated with multiple senses.
Watching a video of someone is similar to meeting them in person. Typically it's easier for you to remember someone's name after you've met them and talked to them for a bit, and the same concept applies to elected officials.
A video can be an even better memory aid if you can find campaign videos, which typically display the candidate's name repetitively and prominently while they're speaking.

, You will do best on the Constitution test if you understand when a particular elected official was elected and why. Understanding the basic mechanics of the election cycle not only better prepares you to take the Constitution test but makes you a more informed citizen.Even if it's not going to be on the test, find out when the person was elected and under what circumstances, such as if their last campaign was for re-election or if they unseated an incumbent.
Find out the major issues of that election, and compare them to major issues currently in the news. If they made significant campaign promises, find out if they've been able to fulfill those promises since they were elected.

, You typically can find practice tests online, which you can download and print. While you may be able to find study questions you can complete and have scored online, you also should practice with a paper test.If you are taking the Illinois test, you can find practice tests and study guides at www.iccb.org, the website of the Illinois Community College Board.
You may be able to find practice tests and study materials at the websites of school districts in your county, or at local community colleges – particularly those who administer the test.
Look in your public library or ask the reference librarian at your local community college library if they have copies of old tests on file.
Make sure you keep the practice test answers separate from the test itself so you aren't tempted to cheat and look at the answer.
If you don't trust yourself, consider giving the answers to a friend or family member to keep until you've finished your practice.

, Find out how long you'll have to take the test, and use a kitchen timer to set a time for your practice tests. Stick to that timer just as the proctor would in the real test, and don't be tempted to answer questions after it's gone off.If timed conditions cause you problems, consider taking your practice tests under a shorter time limit than you'll take the actual test. This is similar to a baseball player taking a few practice swings with a weighted bat before stepping up to the plate.
For example, if you will have 30 minutes to take the test, practice taking the test with a 15-minute time limit. When you get to the actual test and your time has doubled, you won't feel the same time pressure.

, The best way to ensure that environment is not a factor in your test performance is to simulate the actual test conditions as closely as you can when you take your practice test.Particularly if you have difficulty taking standardized tests, the testing environment itself may make you nervous and cause you to have problems recalling information you'd have no trouble getting right otherwise.
If you question your own discipline to administer the test yourself, you might want to ask a friend or family member to serve as a ""proctor"" for your practice test.

, After you score your test, take note of the questions you missed and make them your primary focus until you know them as quickly and easily as you know the other answers.Look at the methods you used to study the material you missed and see if you figure out why they aren't working. Sometimes even using a different method can shake things up a bit.
Keep in mind that focusing on the things with which you had difficulty doesn't mean ignoring everything else – otherwise, you may find you've forgotten something that previously came easily to you.

, Even if you got a passing score on your practice test, set aside time to review your flash cards each day until the day of the test to keep the material fresh in your mind.Studying in small chunks over an extended period of time will help you retain more information than if you try to cram the night before the test.
You can get rusty over time, though, so make sure you're continually reviewing the information – even stuff you think you already know.
Keep in mind that sometimes reviewing facts you already know can be more difficult than learning it the first time, because you'll get bored going over the same things.
Switch up your study methods to keep yourself guessing, and keep your review sessions brief – maybe 15 or 20 minutes.

, There typically is no fee to take the constitution test, and you can retake it as many times as you need to get a passing score. Look at your scoring report and isolate the areas where you need to improve so you can focus your studies on them."

Know what high school you want to go to.Immaculate Heart Academy and Academy of the Holy Angels have almost the same acceptance requirements.,
Don't stress out too much.,
Get a COOP examination book.,
Get to know and Organize your COOP book!,
Join a summer program!,
Take a COOP class.,
Study on your own.,
Keep your grades up!",How to Study for the Co Op (Cooperative Entrance Exam)," IHA does however consider your grades and Coop where as AHA focuses more on Coop Scores. At AHA, if you do really bad on the coop they will consider letting you retake it. Know the high school you want to go to and what score requirement they have.;
, Too much stress can cause you to procrastinate any studying or constantly wonder and estimate your chances of getting in. DO NOT DO THIS! If you get into the high school or not is a yes or no. Don't imagine yourself as getting the lowest score on the Coop or the highest. Think about it like this: Every student in the Archdiocese of Newark and Bergen County is at the bottom of a mountain. The more you study the better chances you have of getting in. If you climb that mountain as hard as you can you could reach the top.


If you are overconfident here is a tip. But if you are not overconfident at all then don't read this because it might make you nervous. Archdiocese of Newark and Bergen County. That's only 2 counties taking the exam right? No, actually there are about 50 people who come to each school when taking the COOP. Multiply 50 by the number of catholic schools you know... you have some studying to do my friend!

, How else are you going to study? The examination book covers everything on the COOP. It provides study resources if you don't know something, practice tests, practice problems, study tips and even how much time you have for each section on the COOP!


Students in Catholic schools get this around the end of the year in 7th grade. It costs about $20, but beware, because some schools do not let you write in it. Public schools do not offer the examination book but you can still get this book online at Amazon.com.

, The COOP book is has more than just the COOP, it has HSPT, SSAT, TACHS and more. Use colored tabs and marker to mark where exactly everything is.


Mark COOP study tips, COOP practice tests and the pages with practice questions designed especially for the COOP test. Put a tab on Verbal Skills, Quantitative Reasoning, Reading, Math skills, Analogies, etc. After you've marked everything with tabs, skim everything. The first step in studying is knowing what you will be studying.
If you aren't allowed to write in your COOP book buy it from amazon. First off, its cheaper. Second what's the point in carrying loose papers everywhere you take your COOP book? What if you lose a practice test? Or a a set of important questions your teacher told you to write down in COOP class? The point is, writing in your COOP book is more organized and dependable. It could even boost your score!

, There are lots of catholic schools that offer a COOP summer study program. A lot of the schools have it right on their website. Trust me this is one of the main things that helps you a whole lot.

, Some schools offer it while others do not. This is a class the school provides lead by your teachers to study important things on the COOP. In a COOP class you basically do practice problems and then go over it in a group. My advice: check every answer. Write down problems you didn't understand and ask the teacher. Then write down exactly how to do it. After you go over a set of practice problems in a COOP class MARK IT! Mark it with a different colored tab that says COOP review. That way, the days before your COOP you can review everything you learned in that class by flipping to your tabs- a lifesaver isn't it?

, Every day. Take practice tests, practice problems, go over them, PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! It really does help. Also time yourself when you do questions. Go through your tabs one by one.

, Many schools look at your schools before your COOP. So get at least B's if not A's. Plus your grades are more controllable than your COOP scores.

Do Not Neglect Your Health.",How to Study for PCAT," Once you have studied your course materials, it is time for you to implement your knowledge. Practice as many sample papers as you can. The more you solve, you will be able to know the test taking techniques and strategies of the examination. Regular practice will also help you get a control over the atrocities of time. Know your strengths and weaknesses and improve yourself.;
, When you become sure about your abilities, you will be able to concentrate on your studies. It is important that you assess yourself. You will be sure of your strengths and weaknesses as well. Once you are aware of the areas where you are lagging behind, you will be able to able to improve it with practice. On the other hand, do not forget to reward yourself, if you really live up to your expectation.

, If you feel that there are too many chapters in the syllabus and you cannot study all at once, do not get worked up. All you can do is, segregate your study materials in chunks. Chunking will enable you to study in a more efficient way. Once you divide your study materials, there will be small chapters that you need to finish within a short time. Hence, you can concentrate on these chunks and ensure a better preparation.

, When you have decided something in life, make sure that you respect your decision. Only you are aware of your capabilities. Hence, in that case, you will know how much you can study. Try to meet your deadlines and live up to your expectations. Be honest with yourself and then plan accordingly. Do not study when you are bogged down or tired. You will not be able to remember anything when you are tired. Hence, give your mind some rest.

, A specific goal or aim in life is important. Right now, your aim should be cracking the examination comfortably. You need to work hard to make your dream of cracking the PCAT. A dedicated and determined effort will fetch you better result at the end of the day.

, Without proper planning nothing can be accomplished. You should plan well while preparing for the PCAT. A proper planning will enable you to be focused and to be on track. Problems will be there in your life to bog you down. However, you should know how to prioritize. All you should do is, have the right attitude to face your problems with confidence and fight back.

, You will have to find ways to manage the atrocities of time. Proper time management will surely accelerate your preparation by leaps and bounds. If you are able to manage your time, then at the end of the day, you will find that you are not left with any pending projects. Moreover, time management will enable you to be more confident about your examination.

, You are advised to have a focused mind, when you are preparing for a competitive examination like PCAT. Learn to take your own responsibility and take control of the situations. When things go wrong, do not blame it on the circumstances, instead, learn ways to come out of your problems.

, It is time for you to hibernate your usual dilly dallying attitude. Once your examination gets over, you can get back to your normal routine. Procrastination is the thief of time. Stop procrastinating and finish your projects on time. Procrastination will eventually lead you to cramming and you should not cram at any cost. Cramming will not help you as you will not be able to remember anything during the actual examination.

, Be it any examination, revision is necessary. After you have finished reading a chapter, put effort to recapitulate all that you have studied. Revision will help you to look critically at the things that you have studied. You need to retain all that you have studied in your mind, so that you do not face any problem during the actual examination.

, With a healthy mind, you can only expect to ensure a healthy preparation. Hence, make sure that you do not neglect your health. Take proper food and maintain right kind of diet. Do not study at a stretch. Instead, make sure that you take regular breaks. Take a study break after two hours of study. This will rejuvenate your mind and refresh yourself as well. You will be able to retain your interest and get new vigor, while preparing for your PCAT exam.

Identify your goals.,
Make a study plan.,
Begin studying well in advance.,
Gather your materials.,
Choose a study location.,
Go to office hours.,
Organize a study group.",How to Study for Finals1," Before you begin studying, it is important to identify what your goals are. Set a target grade for each exam and think about what you will need to do to achieve that grade.


Be realistic; consider how well you've been doing all year, how good your understanding of the material is and window of time you have to study.
Don't set your goals too low either. Try to push yourself and set your mind to achieving your full potential.;
, Making an effective and realistic study plan is a vital component of doing well in your finals. By planning out your study, you can ensure that you will have all the necessary materials covered by the time the exams roll around, thus minimizing stress and maximizing productivity. Here are some things you will need to consider:


Create a time chart of your current activities. Factor in classes, work, time spent with family and friends, etc. This will allow you to see how much free time you have available for study.
Develop a study schedule that works with your timetable. Use time between classes, commute time and any other free time to slot in some extra study. Keep in mind that an hour of study every day will be more productive than a 5-hour block once a week.
Determine your study goals. You shouldn't just write vague guidelines like ""study biology"" -- your study plan needs to be specific. Break down your study material into specific topics and tasks and fill these into your study schedule. Give 20-minute slots to small, bite-size chunks of information and commit to the idea that you will know that information inside out by the end of those 20 minutes.
Stick to your schedule. A study schedule is no good if you don't stick to it. That's why it needs to be realistic. Factor in breaks and potential distraction when planning, so there will be no excuses when the time comes. If it helps, think of the study schedule like a job. You have no option but to do it. Consider that studying for a certain subject might take longer than you thought, so put in some extra time into your schedule.

, This may seem like a bit of a no-brainer, but the earlier you start studying, the more prepared you'll be come exam time. Starting early ensures that you will have time to cover all the necessary material, time to do practice exams and maybe even time to do some extra reading, which will give you an edge on the day. By beginning to study well in advance, you will also feel less stressed out and anxious and have more confidence in yourself.


Ideally, you should make studying part of your weekly routine throughout the school year, not just coming up to exams. You should prepare for classes by doing the required readings, along with some extra reading around the topic under discussion. Engage with your professors, ask questions about anything you don't understand and take extensive notes, as these will be an invaluable study tool later. After class, review the material and rewrite or type out the rough notes you took during class. This will help you to retain the information much better when it comes to exam time.
Do not procrastinate. Everybody is guilty of procrastination at some point, but coming up to finals you should make a serious effort to avoid it. View your study schedule as being set in stone. By actually doing your study when you say you're going to do it, you minimize the risk of cramming the week or night before the exam. Tempting as it may be to put off study until the last possible moment, cramming so close to the exams is an ineffective way to study. Cramming lowers the chances of you actually retaining any information and dramatically increases stress levels. So do not procrastinate!

, Gather and organize all of the materials and resources necessary for you to ace your exams. Get together your class notes, old tests and assignments, class handouts, past exam papers and relevant textbooks.


Use folders, highlighters and sticky notes to organize the material and make important information easily accessible.
Read through your class notes and underline any key words, formulas, themes and concepts. Your class notes are a valuable study resource as they are more succinct than textbooks and will give you some clue as to what the professor is most likely to emphasize in the exam.
Ask to borrow a classmates notes to compare with your own if you feel there are gaps.
Find some different textbooks from the ones you normally use. An alternative textbook may provide extra information that will make you stand out from the rest of the class, or it might phrase a definition in a way that enables you to fully understand it for the first time.

, Choosing the right location is an important aspect of effective study. The ideal study location will differ from person to person. Some people might prefer to work at home, where they can grab a cup of coffee or a snack whenever they feel like it. Others prefer to work in a library, where they are surrounded by other focused individuals and have minimal distractions. You need to find what works for you. It may be a process of trial and error until you find the setting that works best for you, or you may find that a combination of different locations makes the process less monotonous and easier to stick to.

, Office hours are a service that most students are either too lazy or too afraid to avail of. However, most professors or T.A.'s are delighted to see students taking an interest and will be more than happy to answer any questions or address any concerns that you might have.


Just by making the effort to go to office hours, you are giving the professor a favorable impression of yourself, which might influence their thinking when grading your exam.
Discussing the course material with your professor may also give you some clue as to what he/she considers to be the most important topics on the course, and thus the most likely to come up in the exam. He or she may also be able to steer you in the right direction when it comes to exam technique and what they will be looking for in the exam.

, Study groups can be a great idea for people who have trouble motivating themselves to study. Choose a group of people you like and work well with and organize a 2 or 3 hour study session once a week. In a group setting, you can can bounce ideas off other people, work through difficult problems together, and ask questions that you would be afraid to ask a professor. You may also be able to divide the workload between you.


For example, if you are studying from a textbook with long, complicated chapters from which only key information is needed, you could try taking a chapter each and summarizing its contents for everyone in the group. This way you can get through a lot of information in a relatively short space of time.
When working in a study group, it is important that everyone in the group is at a similar level and has a similar work ethic. Otherwise the study group won't work, as one person may end up doing all the work, or another might be completely left behind. Don't feel bad if you need to pull out of a study group that's not working for you. Doing well is what's most important.

Study in 20-50 minute blocks.,
Take frequent breaks.,
Break up big sections into small, manageable tasks.,
Make effective notes.,
Use textbooks strategically.,
Explain the material to someone else.,
Test yourself.",How to Study for Finals2," If you try to study for long periods of time, you will tire easily and your studying will not be very effective. It's much better to study in short 20-50 minute bursts, as during this short space of time you will be able to concentrate fully, thus maximizing the amount of information you absorb.


After 20-50 minutes studying a particular topic, take a quick 5-10 minute break and then move on to another topic. This way you will stay fresh and won't get bored of the material.
To use this method of studying, you will need to break down your study material into small, easily-digestible chunks. If you give yourself too much material to cover in such a short space of time you will not be able to learn the material properly.

, The importance of taking frequent, short breaks cannot be underestimated. Taking a break allows your brain to process all of the information it has just absorbed and to refresh before beginning again. You should take 5-10 minute breaks between each 20-50 minute study session and a 30 minute break every four hours or so.


Perusing social media sites or watching television is not the best use of your break time. You are better off using that time to eat a healthy snack to refuel your brain, as it consumes glucose while you study.Almonds, fruit and yogurt are all good options.
You should also take a short walk outside to get some fresh air. Oxygen stimulates blood flow, which helps keep the brain in top form. If you can't go outside, try doing some stretches to loosen up your limbs.

, Studying can seem like a very daunting prospect when you've set yourself the goal of learning an entire topic over the course of an extended study session. However, the task will be much more approachable if you break the topic into smaller sections, which can be tackled in small, intense bursts.


For example, if you are studying a Shakespearean text and you set yourself the goal of knowing ""The Tempest"" inside out by the end of the day, the task may seem insurmountable. But if you break your study up into specific tasks it will be much more approachable. Take 40 minutes to study the character of Caliban, another 40 to study the play's major themes, and another 40 to learn some of the most important quotes.
Equally if you're studying a science subject such as biology, don't overwhelm yourself by trying to absorb an entire textbook chapter in one go. Break it up into small, easily-digestible pieces. Take 20 minutes to learn some key definitions, or to memorize an important diagram or experiment.

, Making your own personalized notes is essential for effective studying. Well-structured, organized notes can help you to study much more efficiently, as consulting your own tailor-made notes is much quicker than trawling through a large textbook in search of specific information. By making your own notes, you can highlight essential information, while eliminating any superfluous material contained in textbooks.


When making notes, try to compile the most helpful, easy to understand information from a variety of textbooks, from professor's handouts and class notes. By varying your source material, you will produce notes that are broader in content. This will help you to stand out from your classmates during an exam and increase your chances of doing well.
Try to find a method of making notes that works for you. Some students make flashcards, others use different colored pens when writing, while others use a shorthand. Do what feels right for you, just make sure the notes are legible and well-organized.

, Most college students are bombarded with textbooks, and reading is often a chore they've come to dread. However, reading your textbooks does not need to be as difficult or time-consuming as you think. The key is learning how to read the text more efficiently and effectively.


Before you dive in and read the material in depth, take a minute to survey the material by briefly skimming through the chapters you plan on reading. Read the title of the chapter and look to see if there is an outline which summarizes the chapter's contents. Read any headings, subheadings or words in bold text. Have an idea about what you will be reading before jumping in.
Ask yourself what the most important topics or concepts in the chapter are. You may find that turning each heading into a question is helpful. Develop questions like Who?, What?, When?, Where?, Why?, and How?, which you can answer while you read.
Once you’ve become familiar with what the chapter is going to cover, it is time to start reading. Try to to recognize any important terms or concepts. It is also a good idea to underline or highlight any information you think is important and that you would like to revisit later.
After you have finished reading the text, the next step is to recite the information you learned.Try to answer the questions you developed earlier without referring to the textbook in order to test whether you really absorbed the material. Once you feel you have a complete grasp of the material, repeat all the major topics and terms to yourself. Putting the concepts you read into your own words helps with memorization.
Make notes about the information you just read, including any headings, definitions, key terms or anything else you consider important. While your notes should be brief, they should also be detailed enough to allow you to refresh your memory of the most important concepts when you're using them to study later.
Now that you’ve read the material and taken notes, review everything you’ve learned. Browse your notes to recall the important topics that were covered in the chapter. Try to predict questions that your professor may put on an exam and practice how you would answer them. Make sure you have a strong understanding of what you just read. If you feel confused or do not understand a concept, go back and read over it again., Once you feel that you have a good grasp of the material, ask a friend or family member if you can try explaining the material to them. If you can explain the material in a way that the other person (who hasn't studied the subject) can understand, without getting confused yourself, it is a pretty good indication that you know your topic well.


By putting the information in your own words and talking through the topic without the aid of notes, you are helping to commit the knowledge to memory.
Being able to explain it to someone else also proves that you actually understand the information you have learned, rather than just having learned it by rote.

, Once you have covered all of the material that is likely to come up in the final exam, you should consider doing some practice tests. Doing practice tests is an excellent way to test your knowledge and understanding of the material.


Use end-of-term exams, class quizzes and past exam papers or ask your professor to provide a sample paper. Past exam or sample papers will also help you to feel comfortable with the structure and format of the exam, which can be invaluable come exam day.
Don't worry if the practice test doesn't go as well as you'd hoped. The whole point of doing a practice test is to identify your weak areas, so you can go back and study them some more.

Use image-word association.,
Use acronyms.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Try the ""hide-write-compare"" technique.,
Try turning the material into a story.,
Use analogies.,
Use repetition.,
Determine when to use each method.",How to Study for Finals3," Image-word association works by relating an unknown term or concept to an image you are already familiar with. Associating the unfamiliar material with something you already know can help you to remember that material much more easily, especially if you are a very visual person. As a simple example, if you are trying to remember the term ""dogma"", try picturing a Golden Retriever every time you hear it! , An acronym is a word in which each individual letter stands for another word or term, making a list of words easier to remember. You can make your own acronyms by taking the first letter of a list of words or phrase and arranging them in such a way that they form another word that's easy to memorize. The best example of an acronym that is used in everyday speech is ASAP, which stands for ""as soon as possible""., A mnemonic device works in a similar way to an acronym, except it is used to remember a list of words in a particular order and is usually in the form of a phrase rather than a single word. The phrase can be anything, as long as the first letter of each word in the phrase correlates with the first letter of each word or term you are trying to remember, and that they are listed in the exact same order.For example, some children use the phrase ""Never Eat Soggy Worms"" to remember the order in which directional terms appear on a compass. In this case, North = Never, East = Eat, South = Soggy, West = Worms., This method works similarly to explaining the subject you are studying to someone else, except it can be done on your own. After you have finished learning a particular subject and have written down all the relevant terms and definitions, try covering up your notes and rewriting everything by heart. When you are finished, look at your notes again and compare what your have written. If what you produced by heart is accurate, then you will know that you have a good grasp on the material.You probably used this method to learn how to spell your first words, by reading it, covering it up, then trying to write it out by yourself. Though it may simple, it is actually a very effective method of learning, even at college level., Instead of learning off boring, monotonous lists and facts, try turning your study material into an exciting and engaging story which you will easily be able to recall. Work descriptive facts, dates and locations, and certain key words into your story and write it down or recite it to yourself or others to commit it to memory., Analogies work by comparing and contrasting terms and ideas in such a way as to make them easy to remember. Using analogies is all about recognizing patterns and how those patterns can apply to a variety of things. There are different types of analogy - such as those which relate parts to a whole. For instance, a battery is to flashlight what an engine is to a car. Alternatively, you can have analogies which examine cause and effect. For instance, itching is to scratching what smoking is to cancer., Repetition is one of the most popular study methods. It involves going over information again and again - either through reading, writing or repeating aloud - until the information is fully absorbed. Repetition can be an effective study method, though it is usually necessary to test yourself to ensure that the information has actually been learned. You can read something a hundred times, but you still may not be able to reproduce what you read in an exam situation., While each of these methods has it merits, you will need to experiment a little to find a method which works for you. Also keep in mind that some methods work better for certain subjects than others - how you study math problems and formulas will be very different from how you study an English play.For example, repetition, acronyms and mnemonic devices work best for science subjects like biology, which involve learning lots of unusual and unfamiliar terms, whereas storytelling can be very helpful when studying for a history exam, as you can turn the facts surrounding a certain figure or event into a compelling and memorable tale.Try to choose a study method based on your particular strengths. If you're a quick learner, reciting information and learning lists might come easily to you, whereas if you're a more visual person, associating written material with charts and pictures may help you to retain information more easily.Remember that there is no one, correct way to study - do whatever works best for you.

Eat healthy and get some exercise.,
Get enough sleep.,
Avoid stressful people.,
Say no to distractions.,
Have some fun.,
Visualize doing well.",How to Study for Finals4," The importance of healthy eating and exercise during intense periods of study cannot be understated. Eating right will give you more energy and help to keep you more alert during study sessions, while exercise can help you to clear your head and work out the stress.Try to eat plenty of fresh fruit and veg, lean protein and filling, complex carbs at mealtimes, and try cereal and granola bars or a handful of nuts or raisins for healthy snacks. Avoid sugary snacks which will cause you to crash.In terms of exercise, try to incorporate 30 minutes of exercise into your daily routine, whether it's something fun like a dance class or football game, or something as simple as a walk outside.

, Aim to get a full 8 hour's of sleep every night while you are studying. It may be tempting to stay up late studying, but remember: you're going to need energy and focus in order to study effectively, which you won't have if you've stayed up late the night before. Also remember to get a proper night's sleep before the day of the exam. Your previous preparation can go to waste if you don’t.

, Stress can be extremely contagious, so try to avoid fellow students who are tearing their hair out over the exams, or people who are stressed-out generally. A calm, methodical approach to your work trumps stress every time.

, It can be easy to give in to distractions when studying, but try to remember your long-term goals and be firm with yourself. If you allow yourself to be distracted from studying now, you'll end up trying to cram the week before the exam, which will put your stress levels through the roof. Study in a disciplined and consistent manner and you'll feel much calmer and more prepared come exam time.


While you're studying, turn off your phone and consider downloading a computer program that blocks your access to social media sites. If your friend asks you to go for coffee when you're in the middle of a productive study session, don't feel guilty about saying no.

, Set yourself a rigorous work schedule during the week and try to stick to it as closely as possible. However, you should allow yourself some free time at the weekend to relax and let your hair down. Go out with some friends, see a movie or just hang out with your family. If you've worked consistently during the week, there's no need to feel guilty about having some fun at the weekend... you'll need it!

, Try to visualize yourself feeling confident and relaxed on the day of the exam. Then think about what it would feel like to get your target test grades. Visualization will help motivate you to take the necessary steps to achieve your goals. Remember - if you believe you can do it, you can do it! "

,  Rest may not seem important when taking exams, but it can affect your grade and percentage by a lot.  When you're drowsy and tired and unaware, you don't know what you're doing and write nonsense on your paper.  Make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep the night before the test.  It'll help.

,  Once you get your test, write your name on it, and start immediately.  Don't daydream or talk to others.  You'll just waste your valuable time, especially if your test is timed. Try to do the easy/not so hard questions first, so that you don't just sit there looking at your paper for 5 minutes.

,  Make sure to read the questions several times over until you get the idea of the question.  Try not to ask your teachers too many questions, as this will waste even more time, but ask him/her questions if you just can't catch the question.  If you really don't get it, just give it your best shot.

Stay on topic.",How to Write a Good Answer to Exam Essay Questions," Before you get started, make sure that you have read the essay question twice and that you understand what you need to do. Underline or highlight the most important words or phrases in the question to help you stay focused on answering the question., Teachers and professors use certain key words in essay questions to communicate what they want you to do. For example, an essay question that asks you to “describe” an issue will be different from an essay question that asks you to “argue” a position. Make sure that you identify the key word in each essay question you read. Some of the most common key words include:Analyze: Explain the what, where, who, when, why, and how. Include pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses, etc.
Compare: Discuss the similarities and differences between two or more things. Don't forget to explain why the comparison is useful.
Contrast: Discuss how two or more things are different or distinguish between them. Don't forget to explain why the contrast is useful.
Define: State what something means, does, achieves, etc.
Describe: List characteristics or traits of something. You may also need to summarize something, such as an essay prompt that asks ""Describe the major events that led to the American Revolution.""
Discuss: This is more analytical. You usually begin by describing something and then present arguments for or against it. You may need to analyze the advantages or disadvantages of your subject.
Evaluate: Offer the pros and cons, positives and negatives for a subject. You may be asked to evaluate a statement for logical support, or evaluate an argument for weaknesses.
Explain: Explain why or how something happened, or justify your position on something.
Prove: Usually reserved for more scientific or objective essays. You may be asked to include evidence and research to build a case for a specific position or set of hypotheses.
Summarize: Usually, this means to list the major ideas or themes of a subject. It could also ask you to present the main ideas in order to then fully discuss them. Most essay questions will not ask for pure summary without anything else.

, If you do not understand what the question is asking or if you are unsure about the meaning of the key word, ask your teacher or professor. Do not attempt to answer the question until you fully understand what you are supposed to do. Otherwise, you may end up providing an incorrect answer.Raise your hand and wait for your teacher to come over to you or approach your teacher’s desk to ask your question. This way you will be less likely to disrupt other test takers.

, Use the instructions to determine what to include in your answer. Follow them to the letter and do not improvise or include non-essential information. Professors cite not following the instructions as a main reason why some students do not do well on essay questions., The organization of your answer is important. If the question suggests a specific order for your answer, then your answer should follow that structure.Take a moment to consider your organization before you start writing your answer. What information should come first, second, third, etc.?

, A strong essay question answer should provide a relevant answer while also displaying your knowledge of a subject. Take some time to consider the best way to accomplish this goal with the relevant facts and figures you have learned about in your studies.You may want to make a list of facts and figures that you want to include in your essay answer. That way you can refer to this list as you write your answer.
It's best to write down all the important key topics or ideas before you get started composing your answer. That way, you can check back to make sure you haven't missed anything., The best way to start an essay answer is to rephrase the question in the form of a statement. Opening your essay in this way signals to the professor that you have read and understood the question. Rephrasing the question also helps you to stay focused on providing an answer to that question right from the start.For example, imagine that your essay question asks: ""Should the FIFA World Cup be awarded to countries with human rights violations? Explain and support your answer.""
You might restate this as ""Countries with human rights violations should not be awarded the FIFA World Cup because this rewards a nation's poor treatment of its citizens."" This will be the thesis that you support with examples and explanation.

, Even in a compare/contrast situation, you will need to be very clear what your essay is arguing.For example, whether you argue that the FIFA World Cup should or should not be awarded to countries with human rights violations, you will want to address the opposing side's argument. However, it needs to be clear where your essay stands about the matter.
Often, essay questions end up saying things along the lines of ""There are many similarities and differences between X and Y."" This does not offer a clear position and can result in a bad grade.

, Poor grammar and punctuation can affect your grade on an essay question. Try to use correct grammar and punctuation as you write because you may not have time to go back and proofread your work. If you end up with a few minutes to spare, go back and proofread what you have written.If you are required to write your answer by hand, then take care to make your writing legible and neat. Some professors may deduct points if they cannot read what you have written.

, It is crucial to stay calm when you are taking an essay exam. If you get flustered, you may have trouble recalling important information or you may make simple mistakes.


If you get to a point during the exam where you feel too anxious to focus, put down your pencil (or take your hands off of the keyboard), close your eyes, and take a deep breath. Stretch your arms and imagine that you are somewhere pleasant for a few moments. When you have completed this brief exercise, open up your eyes and resume the exam., Some exams may suggest how much time you should spend on each question or even give you a time limit for each question. Having suggestions and limits like these may help you to budget your time. If you exam does not provide a guide for how much time to spend on each question, develop your own time budget at the beginning of the exam.For example, if the exam period is one hour long and you have to answer three questions in that time frame, then you should plan to spend no more than 20 minutes on each question.
Look at the weight of the questions, if applicable. For example, if there are five 10-point short-answers and a 50-point essay, plan to spend more time on the essay because it is worth significantly more. Don't get stuck spending so much time on the short-answers that you don't have time to develop a complex essay.

, While you do not want to write so fast that you are not thinking about your answers, remember that you are on the clock. Consider the question and plan your answers well, but then try to write your answers as quickly as you can.This strategy is even more important if the exam has multiple essay questions. If you take too much time on the first question, then you may not have enough time to answer the other questions on the exam.

, While it is okay to let your mind wander a bit when you are writing a formal essay, you need to stay focused on the question when you write an essay exam response. Otherwise, you may end up providing unnecessary information and losing points for not including the information that was required.If feel like you are straying away from the question, reread the question and review any notes that you made to help guide you. After you get refocused, then continue writing your answer.
Try to allow yourself enough time to go back and tighten up connections between your points. A few well-placed transitions can really bump up your grade.

Remember to differentiate.",How to Write a Multiple Choice Exam," Think about what kind of evaluation you are creating. Is it a short quiz or a final exam? Maybe you are creating a test to help students review for standardized state exams. Whatever the case may be, knowing the purpose of the test will help you establish how long it should be and the types of questions you want to include.For example, if you are teaching a large college course in psychology, you might give a multiple choice test as a final exam. This will help you determine if students have completed the required reading and/or understood the learning objectives for the semester.
A science teacher, for example, might create a short quiz that requires students to recognize basic formulas. This will help the teacher decide if he or she needs to review material before moving forward.;
, A short quiz only requires about ten to twenty questions. The number of questions may vary depending how complex they are.


For example, a quiz with ten questions that asks for the capitals of African countries should not take much time. A quiz with ten graphs, all of which require analysis and application, will take much longer.

, Based on the purpose of the exam, you will be able to determine what level of thinking you want your students to use while taking the exam. Review Bloom’s Taxonomy to determine which is most appropriate for you test.


Modern American education is moving towards teaching higher levels of thinking according to Bloom’s Taxonomy. Bloom’s Taxonomy details a range of thinking from low to high. Lower levels of thinking require only recall of facts, while the higher levels of thinking require analysis and evaluation of information. If you are writing a quiz, you may opt for lower levels of thinking that ask for recognition or recall. A final exam, on the other hand, should assess higher level thinking such as the ability to apply or critique information.

, Your questions, or stems, should use accurate words so that students know exactly what is being asked of them. The more concise the questions, the better. Avoid vague phrases. Some words or phrases can either make your questions easier to answer or create unwanted ambiguity.
Stay away from words like “never” or “always.” These create absolutes that can be debated.Remember to check for grammatical giveaways. Words like “a” or “an” can give away your answer.Try rephrasing your questions or answers where needed.
Instruct students to choose the “best answer” rather than the “correct answer.” This helps eliminate debate about what is correct or incorrect in the context of your questions.

, Multiple choice questions vary greatly in structure. Think about what format is best for your students and your assessment. For the most part, it is best to create short and precise questions. Most of your words should be in the question to avoid long and wordy answers options.Use negatives when it helps a learning outcome. Some educators advise against creating negative questions, but they can be useful if you need to highlight specific points or misconceptions. For example, “Which of the following statements is not true about the Civil War?” or “All of the statements below are true except ____________.” These questions may be confusing, but they often appear on government tests. Decide if what is most appropriate for your students.
A good question about geography might ask: “Which countries share a border with Costa Rica?”

A) Honduras and El Salvador.
B) Honduras and Nicaragua.
C) Panama and Guatemala.
D) Panama and Nicaragua.



, Your question should match your learning objectives for the subject you are teaching and the depth of knowledge you seek to evaluate. Remember that quizzes tend to evaluate lower level thinking and tests evaluate higher levels of thinking.


Use supplementary materials. Use of graphs or charts can be helpful when creating higher order thinking questions for math or science. Readings and quotations are useful for creating questions for language arts and social studies., There should be only one option that best answers your question. Do not trick students by providing two answers that are equally good.


Avoid frequent use of “all of the above” or “none of the above.” This requires students to know that only two answers are either correct or incorrect.For example, the following question is misleading because two answers are can be correct: “What is the correct use of the verb in the following sentence? Every country _______ good people and bad people.”

A) have
B) has
C) have had
D) has had



, There is only one answer to each question, but the other options should be plausible. Do not include answer options that are completely irrelevant or impossible. Include common student mistakes in your answer options to test for complete understanding.For example, the following question includes options that seem possible because they all include at least one primary color: “Which two primary colors mix to form a secondary color?”

A) Red and blue.
B) Green and blue.
C) Yellow and green.
D) Yellow and purple.



, This adds consistency to your test. Many students tend to believe that the longest answer is correct. This may or may not be the case. Either way, similar answer length will discourage guessing.


For example, the following question includes answers with similar wording, structure and length: “In the prologue, Romeo and Juliet are described as,”

A) ”Star-crossed lovers”
B) ”Star-crazed lovers”
C) ”Star-bright lovers”
D) ”Star-struck lovers”



, The order of correct answers should be random.Students often take multiple choice tests using separate answer sheets. There should not be a visible pattern in correct answers. Obvious patterns will encourage unwanted guessing.

, There are various ways to present answers on a multiple choice exam. The format of your answers may vary as long as it matches your learning objectives.


Conventional styles include three to five options as possible answers to a stem or question. Many educators suggest using this style as it reflects what is most often seen in standardized testing.Alternate choice answers only presents two possible options. This raises a student’s probability of guessing the correct answer. It may be useful, however, in highlighting concepts that are similar or often confused.
Matching formats give students a set of terms on one side and a set of definitions or descriptions on the other side. Students must then match the items correctly. Note that this falls on the lower end of Bloom’s Taxonomy, as it only requires recognition and recall.
A complex multiple choice includes a question and three to five responses, several of which are correct. Beneath the responses are answer choices that list two to three answers as correct. This requires students to recall several pieces of specific information about a given topic.Although the format of the answer is complex, the depth of knowledge it requires is not necessarily as challenging.

, Take the exam and time yourself. Allow students double or triple the time it took you to complete the test. Timing often depends on the level of student understanding, how well students prepare, and the level of difficulty of the exam.If you write an exam for college students studying advanced French, for example, you may only need to double the time it took you to complete the exam. It is generally expected that college students have good study habits and good understanding of a topic, especially at the higher levels.

, All questions might be worth the same amount of points or some may weigh more than others. Decide what is appropriate for the types of questions you wrote., You may have students with disabilities or special needs in your class. This means that you may have to modify the exam itself or the way in which students take the exam. Review any legal mandates for students with disabilities before you administer the exam.


Modify the content of the exam by reducing the number of questions or changing the level of complexity of the questions.
Modify the process by allowing students to use scrap paper, use highlighters, or take extra time to complete the test.

In other words, you only need to be able to recognize the correct answer. You will not need to come up with a word or paragraph of your own. However, knowing the information at a deeper level (such as memorizing definitions) can help you recognize the correct answer when you see it., If you're being tested over books or chapters that you've been expected to read, spend some time with them and make sure you've read through them thoroughly. Re-learn the main ideas and the important arguments from the text and summarize them in your notes.


If you're studying up the night before, don't waste time trying to re-read every word. You won't add anything. Instead, focus on retaining the big concepts from the book, the main points and themes. If you've taken good notes, underlined, or highlighted important passages, this will be much easier.

, You can hit a wall pretty quickly while you're studying if you just read for a couple hours on end. It's hard to remember much of anything by cramming it in without doing anything active. Get up and move around, read out-loud while you study, and take lots of notes. The act of writing can help you retain and remember information more quickly. If you've written an idea, it's much more likely that you'll be able to recall it when you need to on the exam.


Some studies show that studying in different locations can help you retain more information. Study one chapter in your bedroom, one in the basement, another at the library, etc. Your brain can channel the different concepts and connect them to those locations, making it easier to remember what you read.

, Ask your teacher about the possibility of a sample test or an old version of the test on which you might practice. Also look in the textbook, which sometimes offers end-of-chapter reviews that include sample test questions or might even offer sample exams at the end of each chapter. Sometimes these are even more difficult than the regular test and will be a good check for your comprehension.


Recreate the test environment as closely as possible. For example, if you will not be able to use your notes during an exam, practice answering questions without your notes.
Time yourself to see how long it takes at a comfortable pace, and then try taking a sample within the time limit of the class.

, Keep music turned off. Most tests are taken in complete silence, so study and practice in silence to prepare. Don't chat online or check Facebook while you're studying.


Use 15 minutes of video game, Internet, or TV time as a reward for studying 45 minutes. You'll break up the monotony and end up getting more done if you're not distracted by something you'd rather be doing.

, Before answering any of the questions, look over each page to get an idea of how many questions there are, how many points they are worth, and if they are categorized by chapter or topic. This will give you some idea of how long it will take you to finish the exam. It will also help you pull from the right course material you studied.

, Make sure you understand what is being asked. Then look over each of the choices. This helps stop you from making a hasty choice because you did not give yourself a chance to see the correct answer.


Try to answer the question without looking at the choices. Then see if the answer you think is correct is an option.
Be careful of negatively worded questions. These include words like ""not,"" ""never,"" and ""none."" Questions like these can throw students off track, even if they know the material well.

, As you look through answers, cross out those you know are incorrect. This limits the potential answers and increases your odds of choosing the correct one if you don't know it outright.


Cross out any ""throw away"" choices. These are answers that are completely absurd or unfamiliar. They serve as fillers, simply to have a certain number of answers available.
Treat each choice as a true-false question. Read the question with a particular answer in mind. Is it true? Or is it false?
Look at the wording of the question and answers. Sometimes you can tell what the correct answer is by the tense of the word, such as a word that ends in ""-ing"" while all the rest of the choices end in ""-ed.""

, Go ahead and mark the best choice, so you do not leave the question unanswered. Then mark that question by circling it or putting a star or question mark next to it. Work through the rest of the test. When you finish answering all the other questions, go back and try to answer the ones that caused you trouble the first time through the test.


Pay attention as you take the rest of the test. Sometimes other questions will give you the answer you need to a question you are struggling with early on.
Take questions at face value. Teachers rarely try to trick or deceive their students. Do not read too much into the question.

, As you work, make sure you keep an eye on the clock. Most multiple choice tests will have to be done in a given length of time, so make sure you save yourself enough to finish. Neither rush nor dally on the tough ones. Work smart.


If you've got a 50 minute class and thirty questions, you'll know you need to be at least to number 15 by the time half the class has passed. If you're not, pick up the pace.

, Even if you do not know an answer, you have a chance of getting it right simply by marking one of the choices. Otherwise, you automatically lose those points because you did not even bother to answer.

, If you have time left, look over the questions and the answers you chose. It is possible to misread or misunderstand a question the first time through, especially if you are in a hurry.

, A common mistake students make after getting a test back is looking at the grade and either celebrating or becoming depressed, then throwing it away to promptly forget the test entirely. Good or bad, look through it. See which questions you missed, see which questions you weren't sure about that you got right. Take some time to learn from the grade that you got and look for ways to improve your test-taking and your studying for next time.


It's a good idea to save the tests for classes that you will also take finals for. Reviewing the tests is a great way to study for the final exam, and often many of the questions will be straight-up repeats of the information from the regular tests. Hang on to them.

, If you're disappointed in your grade, make an appointment to talk to your teacher about it, not to demand a better grade or to be allowed to re-take the test, but just to find out how you might do better in the class. If you say, ""I thought I was studying right, but I guess I didn't. What do you think I need to work on to be more successful?"" your teacher will notice that you're taking the initiative to do more work.


Talking to your teacher is always a good idea, but complaining about your grade never is. Make sure you find a calm attitude and make an appointment to discuss your grade with your teacher when you're chilled out.

, Lots of students like to compare grades with other students in the class. Try to avoid this, both when you do well and when you do poorly. It isn't anyone else's business who got what and who's ""smarter"" than who. Taking tests is a skill that comes naturally to some and proves more difficult for others, who may be just as bright and skilled.

, You don't have to get an A+ every time. Even Einstein got low grades every now and then. Focus, instead, on improving steadily. A B should feel like a congressional medal of honor at the end of the semester if you started out getting Ds. Celebrate!


It's often common for students to get great grades early in the semester and slowly trail off throughout. Try to be consistent, putting in the same amount of hard work all throughout the semester. Don't let those good early efforts go to waste.

Be positive.,
Try not to think about the coming exam too much.,
Don't push yourself.,
Learn to accept mistakes.,
Find ways of studying which really work for you.,
Listen to your favourite music when you're done for the day or just before you start revising.,
When the exam approaches, don't let yourself think about failure.",How to Think Positive While Studying," It's easier said than done, but you have to believe in yourself and stop being self critical if you're to stand any chance of snapping yourself out of the state you have put yourself in.;
, Just casually go through your notes and don't think about the exam. If you really can't help it, imagine what will happen if you go into that exam hall or classroom and find that the test is easy? Visualization may help here.

, Set out your revision in bite size chunks. The brain remembers things better if you take a break after ten or twenty minutes of solid revision. While you're taking some time out, perhaps treat yourself a little. Have a nice drink and perhaps something to eat. Reflect on what you've just learnt, but don't go over it obsessively. Allow it to sink in for a while before moving on to the next part of your revision.

, You're not going to ace every single mini-revision test that you do - in fact making these mistakes is the most effective way of learning. Make sure you go over what you didn't do so well on thoroughly and then take a break for today. A small failure once in a while does you the world of good in the long run.

, Staring at notes blindly doesn't work for everyone - in fact, the minority benefit from such a technique, as this does not engage the brain at all. Find out what kind of learner you are: audio, visual, or kinesthetic.


For audio learners, record your notes on tapes or CDs, and maybe put them on your MP3 player. There are helpful podcasts and other soundbites that you can download from various sites with helpful facts that will help you to revise. Maybe even make up a song using some of your facts, whatever works for you.
Visual learners may benefit from colourful diagrams, post-it notes and spreadsheets. Once again you kind find such resources on the web - make sure you pay particular attention to revision or teaching websites.
If you're a kinesthetic learner, think of creative ways that will help you to learn. Write a story about your favourite TV or book characters informing somebody about the topic you are trying to revise, or draw a comic strip. Team up with a friend and take it in turns to say facts about a certain topic. Give your parents or another family member a talk on what you've been learning about. Aim to keep your brain as active as possible.

, This will put you in a good mood for the task at hand.

, Just imagine going into that exam and finding it as easy as anything. You will succeed if you think positive. If you believe you can do well, you will do.

Arrive early to choose the best seat for you.",How to Take a Test," When you get the exam, look it over carefully first.Listen for any additional comments the teacher gives on questions and write in changes when appropriate. Take note of any special comments written on whiteboards., You don’t want to end up answering something that wasn’t actually asked simply because you didn’t read the question thoroughly.


When you are stressed about a test, sometimes the tendency is to read too fast and try to get through the test as quickly as possible. But this is when careless mistakes happen. Slow down, take your time, and read each question thoroughly.

, If you are required to read a long excerpt (several paragraphs), you should read the questions first before you start trying to answer them. Then, as you do the reading, you will know what to be looking for specifically., There is nothing worse than getting a question marked as incorrect simply because the teacher couldn’t read your handwriting. Remember that your teacher has many tests to grade, so the less time s/he has to spend grading your test, the happier s/he will be and this might reflect in his or her grading choices.For example, drawing spaghetti-line intersecting lines from column A to column B is likely to be marked down by a teacher who also has 74 other tests to mark.
Similarly, print don't write; you don’t want to get something marked wrong just because the teacher can’t decipher your sloppy handwriting.
Don't make your Ts look like Fs; spell out True and False.

, You might get partial credit, if you did everything right but just made a silly mistake right at the end. Partial credit is always better than no credit. So show your work as you go so your teacher can see that you know at least some of the material and got it right.


This step is only useful for solving math questions on an exam.

, Keep a rhythm of underlining words you don't know and circling questions that you get stuck on. Never come to a complete halt – you should always be writing, reading, or turning a page.The important thing is not to get frustrated and just quit. You only have a limited amount of time, so you need to make every moment count.
If you struggle with a particular problem or section, skip it! You can always come back to it later. And this way you’ll be making the most of your time to ensure you get through the entire test.

, A good rule of thumb to follow when writing an essay for an exam is the rule of three. It usually works better to discuss (or list or...) three things about the subject. Include many more and you get bogged down in too much detail. Any fewer and you are probably leaving something important out.

, It is important to move through the test in a way that will benefit you and make the most of the time you have. Don’t just start the test and hope you finish in time. If you have both multiple choice and essay questions, do this:


Read the essay questions first. Write down any notes, but, do not answer them yet.
Begin answering the multiple choice questions. While you are doing so, your brain will be gathering information contained in these questions that will help you answer the essays. If needed, write brief notes that you can use later for the essays.
Once you have all the multiple choice questions answered (and, you will have checked one box for each of them), then do the essay questions, beginning with the easiest.

, When it comes to multiple choice questions, it is always better to guess than to leave it blank. A blank answer is an automatic wrong answer, while a guess (especially an educated guess) gives you at least a chance at getting it right. Here are some tips for answering multiple choice questions:


The longest answer is usually the correct answer because the correct answer requires more qualifying language to be indisputably correct than the incorrect answers.Answers that contain words like always or never are almost always incorrect because most truths don’t exist as absolutes.
Try eliminating one or two answers that you know for a fact are wrong. There is almost always one answer that is obviously incorrect and then another one or two that you can guess about. Eliminating wrong answers will greatly increase your chances of guessing the right answer from the remaining choices.
Pay attention to the answers of surrounding questions. Even randomly generated tests tend to not repeat answers often. So, if you know the answer to number 1 is A and the answer to number 3 is also A, it is highly unlikely that the answer to number 2 will be A as well.

, Get started on the questions that are worth the most points first, all other things being equal.This will ensure that you are able to answer all the higher point value questions that matter more, rather than wasting time on the questions that count for fewer points.

, If you finish early, look through all your answers again. Give special attention to questions with underlined words. Don't stop working until the final bell.If you finish early, maybe you missed answering all the questions. Go back and make sure there are other questions (like on the back side of a sheet), up on the blackboard, on sheets you dropped on the floor, etc.

, You may only be getting half your answers right, but, that could be a passing mark, even a top mark depending on the curve. If you quit trying, you will fail.


Tests can be daunting, but you almost always know more than you think you do. Once you get in there and start taking the test, you will remember a lot more.
If you struggle with a section, simply move on and come back to it later. Wasting time on something that you don’t remember at the moment might mean that you run out of time before you can answer questions that you definitely know the answers to.
Also, sometimes there will be hints for the question that you are stuck on later on in the test that will jog your memory. Keep moving through the test and come back to the parts that gave you trouble at the end.

, You could get caught, and get a zero. Or worse. Don't write notes to yourself on your body, where it can be found (instead, use the strategy in #2, above). If you copy wrong answers from a neighbor, teachers are quick to notice this. And forever after teachers will know you as ""The Cheat.""


Spend the effort you might devote to cheating on doing the best possible job you can honestly. If you fail, use the experience to motivate yourself for the next test.

, This might mean that you will not concentrate and you will not get the grade that you were expecting to get. Also, if the teacher catches you talking, s/he might give you a failing grade and you will not be able to retake your test.


Taking a test is not the time to talk to your friends. You need to dedicate all of your brain space to the test in front of you. This will help you be more successful.
Many teachers consider talking during a test as an attempt at cheating, even if you were not discussing the test. So don’t do it.

, Teachers will usually spend a lot of time in class emphasizing certain subjects that s/he really wants you to know. These are typically topics that will be on the test. Make sure you thoroughly study anything that your teacher took great pains to teach you in class.


Additionally, if your teacher gives you a study guide for the test, make sure you can answer questions about everything listed on the study guide.
If your teacher took the time to make you a study guide, that means s/he is serious about testing on these topics. It can be a great hint for you in knowing what to study.

, Ask your teacher to stay after school with you. If s/he can, ask him or her to go over the stuff that is most confusing to you. This will make a big difference on your grade!


Teachers remember who goes the extra mile by asking for help or really trying and this can impact their grading choices when they grade your test. If you are really putting out a lot of effort but your teacher never sees it, that doesn’t help you very much.
Make sure your teacher sees all the work you put in by asking him or her for help and talking to your teacher about what you’re struggling with.

, While studying just before the test, write down very basic notes on what you find hardest to remember. Just before the test, memorize these notes; this will load them into your short term memory. Once you get the test paper itself, regurgitate (that is, write) this information as notes into the margin of the test.For example, many exams require that you know various formulas, whether they are related to math, science, or some other field. If you have to memorize a lot of formulas, commit them to memory immediately before the test and then write them down in the margins as soon as you begin taking the test.

The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr² (with r being the radius).
Commit this to your short term memory and then write it down immediately when you get your test.



, If your exam is early, then the process will help wake you up. Also, it will make you feel more professional and alert while working on your test. Keep in mind that you don't want to be uncomfortable. Layer, so that you won't be distracted by an overly warm or cold room.


Try to prepare what you will wear the night before. If you pick out your outfit ahead of time, you will have more time in the morning to focus on eating a good breakfast and running through your notes again. You want to save all of your brain work for reviewing for the test the morning of, not deciding what to wear.

, Cramming into the wee hours, then trying to be sharp for the test is a really bad idea. It is important to be well rested when you take a test.Lack of sleep can seriously affect your brain function in areas of memory, perception, and the level of cognitive capacity at which you can function.So getting a good night’s sleep the night before a test is crucial.

, Your brain functions better when it has all the nutrients it needs. Eat a good breakfast (or lunch, depending on when your test is) before you take the test. This will help you perform at your best while taking the test.


There are also certain foods that are thought to be good “brain food” to take before a test like bananas, peppermint, and other superfoods., Bring everything you need: pens, pencils, erasers, calculator, etc. Don't expect others to provide these items for you. Your teacher and your classmates may not have extras all the time and you don’t want to be forced to take a test without an item you need.


Pack your backpack the night before so that you know you’ll have all of the items you need. You don’t want to rush around in the morning and accidentally forget something crucial.

, If you don’t have assigned seating, come early to class so you can pick a great seat. You want to be away from windows, heaters, and away from any other distractions like a noisy hallway or another student you know will be distracting with their behavior. When you get there early, you get to choose your spot."

Not having enough water will make you more tired, so be sure to drink some water before going into your exam. As a side note, don't forget to hit the bathroom before the exam, so you're not having to go while you're taking it.Cold water will wake you up more, so stick to ice water or a bottle of water from the refrigerator., You can't think your best on an empty stomach, so you need to eat before you go to your test. Don't eat anything too heavy, as it can make you sleepy. Pick something that centers on protein with some carbohydrates on the side for a boost.Try some yogurt with fruit, for instance.
Another option is a few links of chicken sausage and whole grain toast.
You could also try some hummus with carrot sticks. If you're pressed for time, try a protein bar or shake.

, If you choose to drink caffeine to give you a boost, make sure to do it about 30 minutes before the test so it has time to kick in by the time you take the test.Caffeine will usually only give you a boost if you don't drink it every day, so use it sparingly.Keep your caffeine consumption under 400 milligrams for the day. A single cup of coffee has about 100 milligrams.

, A shower can energize you, jumpstarting you to alertness for you exam. However, the trick is to employ a hot and cold technique to increase your alertness after you're done cleaning off.Turn the shower all the way to cold for about 30 seconds, then turn it back to as hot as you can stand it for the same amount of time. Finally, turn it back to cold for another 30 seconds. The process of turning it hot and cold will make you much more awake.

, To help you wake up for your exam, do some light exercising right before. Getting your blood flowing helps you be more alert and ready to do your best. You don't need to run a marathon. Just spend 5 to 10 minutes walking briskly, doing some jumping jacks, or jogging in place., Sleep is essential to your health and well-being. It can increase your chances of being sick, raise your blood pressure over time, increase negative moods, and affect your concentration and memory. In fact, getting a good night's sleep is one of the best things you can do to do well on a test you have to take., If possible, keep yourself cooler, temperature-wise. Dress down for the classroom you'll be in. Staying cold can keep you alert, so take off that sweater and put in a t-shirt. If you're too warm, you're more likely to get sleepy., Just like light can wake you up, it can also help you stay more alert while you're taking your test. To help you get as much light as possible, try to set up by a window. You'll get light from both outside and inside, and the natural light can help keep you awake., Chewing gum can help keep you awake. It actually helps oxygen flow to your brain, making you more alert for your exam. Pop in some gum during your exam to help you pay better attention, though make sure you chew quietly so you don't disturb the whole room., If you feel like you're having trouble concentrating, take a few seconds to refresh your brain. Just looking away can help some, but taking a few deep breaths is even better. Getting more oxygen to your brain can make you feel more alert., If your teacher will let you leave, take a quick bathroom break. Splash some water on your face to give yourself a break. Another option is running outside to get a breath of fresh air. Even just walking around can make you more alert., When you're tired, a test can seem overwhelming with all the answers you have to give. The key is to calm yourself down. Take a few deep breaths to make sure you're calm, and then just take it one question at a time., You're going to be very sleepy and tired, and that can cause you to miss things in the questions. With every question, make sure you are reading it thoroughly and that you understand it completely before you answer. That way, you won't make careless mistakes.If you have to, try moving your lips as you read. You can't read the question out loud, of course, but pretending to do so can slow you down enough that you pay more attention to the question.

, When you get to the test, try tackling the hardest parts first. Your brain will be the most alert and ready at the beginning of the test, and you may wear down later on little sleep. Therefore, try to tackle the hardest or most important parts first, so that you have enough brain power to get through them.Another approach is to work on the parts you know best first. That way, you can breeze through them without making mistakes. However, you may have a harder time when it comes to the parts you find more difficult.

, You may not have perfect recall when you're working on little sleep. However, that doesn't mean you should skip questions completely if you have an idea of what to answer. Instead, try to write down what you can remember for short answers or take an educated guess from the list of choices.Most teachers will at least give you partial credit if you get part of the answer right.
To take an educated guess from a choice of answers, start by crossing out the answers you know are wrong. If you can't figure out the answer, just pick one between the ones leftover.

, When you are tired, you're more likely to obsess over the questions you can't answer at all, trying to figure out the answer. Instead of obsessing, just skip the ones you don't know for now. If you have time at the end of the test, go back to the ones you skipped to see if you can figure out an answer., Your handwriting may suffer if you've stayed up most of the night. Make sure you are writing clearly. You can't get credit for an answer that your teacher can't read, and if your handwriting isn't the most legible anyway, you'll need to pay special attention when you're tired., If you have time at the end, always go back over your test. Tiredness makes you careless, so you need to look for silly mistakes. Read through each question and answer to make sure you answered the whole question and that you didn't skip part or misinterpret it.You don't need to change answers if you read the question correctly. Your gut instinct is usually best.

, Now that you've finished your test, go home, and get some sleep. You can't make up for all the sleep you lost, but getting a good night's sleep the next night is essential. You need to work to reset your sleep schedule to your normal one.Not getting enough sleep consistently causes a sleep deficit. In turn, your health can suffer greatly over time because your body doesn't have the time it needs to recover.Some studies have shown that consistent sleep deprivation is similar to being intoxicated.

Take deep breaths.,
Write down your worries.,
Do a simple recall.,
Use any time available as extra study time.",How to Study for Five Minutes Before a Test1," You only have five minutes left, but don’t focus on that or worry about how badly you might do on the test. Clear your mind and try to think only about the material you remember learning that you will be quizzed on., During a study of highly anxious ninth graders taking a biology final, it was found that the students who took a couple of minutes to write down what they were worried about with the test did better on it than those who sat quietly during those couple of minutes. This technique tends to work especially for people who are constant worriers, because worrying clouds your thinking and causes you to miss questions that you may actually know., Make a quick list of the biggest points from the material: characters and plot, formulae, or important dates and events. Try to do it from memory, but if you can’t, glance at your notes for a couple of minutes first and then get writing., You may actually have more than five minutes if you remember about the test early enough. You could use the ride to school, lunch, recess, or between classes, before the class that the test is in."
"
Choose the information you’ll speed-read carefully.,
Memorize from flash cards if you have them.,
Say the skimmed information out loud.,
Flip to the back of the chapter or packet and read the review questions.,
Read the study guide.,
Repeat your notes to yourself.,
Make up rhymes, songs, or mnemonics.,
Make a list of important details.",How to Study for Five Minutes Before a Test2," Since you don’t have a lot of time, focus on the bits that you think will most likely be on the test or that will get you the most points. Read the bolded words in the text and their definitions. If there aren’t any bolded words, then skim for other important information to review – dates, events, etc.If you are taking a math test, review the formulas during your skimming session. Make sure you understand how to solve problems using the formulas., For definitions or math formulas, flash cards are a great way to review. Flip through them as quickly as possible and try to say the definitions or complete the formulae without looking at the back., Repeating information out loud is very helpful for remembering it. If you made flash cards, repeat the information on them out loud, since you will most likely not be able to use them during the test., This is a great way to get you focused on what you need to remember for the test. Keep in mind the big points that are covered in the questions, and write them down., If your teacher has given you a study guide, this is great news! Read it carefully. If you have time, read it again. And again. If it is a study guide with questions, hopefully you already answered the questions. Most likely, the material in the study guide is what will be on the test., Whether using the chapter review questions or a study guide, try focusing on the most important questions and repeating the answers to yourself quickly., A good last minute memorization technique is to use one of these devices for the answers of your review questions. Musically inclined students may find it helpful to make up a rhyme or song to memorize information. A mnemonic device is any memory association tool you use to help yourself remember something; the most common kind is a name mnemonic such as ROY G BIV for the colors of the rainbow (Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet) , Depending on the subject, make a quick list of important dates, characters, plot points, or formulae. Anything that you can take from memory will be a helpful review in five minutes."
"
Choose a friend you trust.,
Talk about the material.,
Ask questions and pay attention.,
Quiz each other.",How to Study for Five Minutes Before a Test3," Studying out loud is a very helpful way to remember information. If you hear information and talk about it, you’re more likely to remember it. Just make sure you choose a friend who probably studied and understands the material., Ask your friend if the two of you can exchange notes so you can read theirs quickly. After your friend has told you what they remember learning from studying, repeat what they say out loud, in your own words. Doing this will help you to better recall what you studied while you’re taking the test. , If you’re not sure about what something your friend said means, ask about it. Keep asking questions until you understand it. Relate what you know already to what your friend is saying, and have a conversation about the test material. Figuring out what to stay focused on together will be helpful for the both of you., Using your notes, ask each other some basic questions on what you think you should know for the test. Give each other a little pep talk too about how great you’ll both do! "

Plan review sessions beginning at least a week in advance of each exam. Ideally, you'll do several mini-reviews well in advance, gradually increasing the time in which you study, rather than trying to cram everything into one mega session the night before the test.;
, This seems like a no-brainer, but actually paying attention while you're in class will help you immensely once exam time comes. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you'll just ""absorb"" knowledge; be an active learner.


Listen carefully, because teachers often give hints like ""The most important thing about this topic is..."". Or they may just place emphasis on certain words and issues. This is the real key to testing well. The more you absorb the information early on, the less studying you'll need to do.

, This is easier said than done, but learning how to take good notes will help you immensely once it comes time to study. Write down everything your teacher writes on the board or puts up in slides. Try to record as much of what the teacher says as possible, but don't allow taking notes to distract you so much that you forget to listen.Review your notes daily, right after class. This will help reinforce the information you just learned., Too often, it's easy to view studying as something that only gets done at the last minute in a huge overnight cram session. Instead, try setting aside some time every day to study. Scheduling it just like another appointment or class may help you stay motivated to continue the habit., Ask your teacher what format the test will be in, how it will be graded, if there are any opportunities for extra credit, and if they would be willing to talk to you about highlighting in your notes, what the most important broad subjects will be, etc.

, Keep anything and everything away from where you are that may cause you to get distracted. Jumping up to read a text message on your phone or periodically checking social media is ill-advised whilst studying.

, Studying in a dark room is not recommended. Add lamps at night, or in the daytime, open the window coverings (open the window a little, too). People tend to study and focus better in a brighter, oxygenated room with little noise.

, While many students believe that they're good at multitasking, such as studying with the TV on or while chatting online with friends, research suggests that this is not true for the vast majority of people.For better studying performance, eliminate distractions such as TV and loud music with lyrics. Rapidly swapping attention between studying and watching TV makes it more difficult for your brain to prioritize information acquisition., Music's effect on memory performance varies between individuals. Some studies have found music to aid the memory performance of individuals with ADD/ADHD, while reducing it in individuals without the disorder. Classical music appears to be the most effective in enhancing studying performance.You must determine whether you're better off with or without it. If you do enjoy listening to music whilst studying, make sure you're actually concentrating on the material you have to study for, and not the catchy tune that's playing in your head.


If you absolutely must listen to music, find instrumental music so that the words in the music don't interfere with your studying.
Listen to background sounds from nature in order to keep your brain active and prevent other noises to distract you. There are several free background noise generators available online.
Listening to Mozart or classical music won't make you smarter or keep information in your brain, but it may make your brain more receptive to receiving information.

, What do you intend to accomplish during this session? Setting a concrete study goal may help you. Creating study plans is also a good idea. If 3 out of 5 lessons are easy and can be finished fast, finish them first, so you can spend quality time on the difficult lessons without fretting. Also, keeping a folder for your exam reviews is a good way to keep organized.

, Go through your notes and rewrite the most important information. Not only will this give you a more focused way to study, but it creating it is another form of studying! Just don't spend too much time on the guide itself: you need to have time to go over it too!

, Rewriting your notes is great if you're a kinesthetic learner. Mind mapping is the most effective way of doing this. Also, when you re-write something, you will probably think about what you are writing, what it's about, and why you wrote it down. Most importantly, it refreshes your memory. If you took notes a month ago and just found out that those notes will be relevant in your exam, rewriting them will remind you of them when you need it for your exam.


Don't simply copy your notes over and over again. This tends to lean towards memorizing the exact wording of your notes instead of the actual concepts. Instead, read and think about the contents of your notes (such as think of examples), and then re-word them.

, This can help you tell if you have remembered what you just studied. Don't try to remember the exact wording from your notes in your answer to yourself; synthesizing that information into an answer is a much more useful tactic.


It can also help to say the answers to your questions out loud, as if you were trying to explain it to someone else.

, If you missed questions on previous work, look up the answers and understand why you missed these questions. This is particularly helpful if the exam you're studying for is cumulative or comprehensive, meaning it covers things you also covered earlier in the course.

, Don't study when you're really tired. It's better to get a good night's sleep after studying for a short time than to push on at two in the morning. You won't remember much and you're likely to see a performance drop the next day.

, Don't cram. Cramming the night before is proven to be ineffective, because you're taking in so much information at once that it's impossible to memorize it at all — in fact, you'll hardly retain anything. Studying before and going over it multiple times really is the best way to learn the material. This is especially true with things like history and theoretical subjects.


Always study when you have the chance, even if it is only for 15 or 20 minutes. These short study periods add up fast!
Study in chunks of 25 minutes using the Pomodoro Technique. After that make a break of 5 minutes; repeat the process 3x, then make a longer pause of 30-45 minutes.

, If you're a visual learner, using pictures can help. Auditory learners should record themselves saying notes and recite it afterwards. If you are a physical person, lecture to yourself (out loud) while also using your hands or moving around; this way it will be easier for you to memorize.

, Subjects such as mathematics require a lot of practice with problem sets in order to become familiar with the processes required. Subjects in the humanities, such as history or literature, may require more information synthesis and memorization of things such as terms or dates.


Whatever you do, don't just re-read the same set of notes over and over again. In order to actually learn, you need to take an active role in knowledge creation as well as information review. Try finding the ""big picture"" among what you've taken down or reorganizing your notes by theme or date.

, Ask yourself: What is my teacher most likely to ask on the exam? What materials should I focus on to give myself the best chance of knowing what I need to know? What trick questions or wrinkles could my teacher introduce that might throw me for a loop? This may help you focus on the most important information, rather than getting stuck on things that might not matter as much.

, If you need help, ask someone who is good at these subjects. Friends, family, tutors, and teachers are all good options. If you don't understand what the person helping you is communicating, don't be afraid to ask them to elaborate.


Asking teachers for help conveys your commitment to the material and can be helpful in the future as well as with your exams. Always remember to ask your teacher if you do not know what she is talking about or if you need more information. The teacher will probably be glad to help.
There are often resources at schools and colleges that can help you cope with stress, answer study-related questions, give you study tips and other forms of guidance. Ask your teacher or visit your school's website to learn how to use these resources.

, You need some time to have fun and it is better to study when you are feeling relaxed than to exhaust yourself studying all day! Carefully structure your break and study time. Usually, 20-30 minutes of study and then a 5 minute break is the most effective method.


If you have trouble bringing yourself to study, instead of long uninterrupted sessions, chunk your work into 20 minute periods, taking a 10-minute break at the end of every period.
Make sure that you structure the chunks logically so that you're not breaking up concepts across chunks, as this may make it more difficult to remember concepts in their entirety.

, Self confidence is important; focusing on how little you've studied or how badly you think you will do on the exam just distracts you from working on achieving success. However, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't study hard. You still need to work at it, even if you have confidence in yourself. Confidence just keeps away roadblocks to success.

, Arrange study dates at a library with your friends to compare notes or explain things the other one might not understand. Working with other people can help you cover gaps in your own knowledge and also help you remember more information, since you may have to explain things to them or have conversations about the topic.


If you ask for help from others, don't joke around. Concentrate on what you are doing.

, If you're stuck on a subject, do not be afraid to call a friend and ask for help. If your friends cannot help, ask a tutor for help.


If you have time before your exam and find that you're not understanding material, ask if your teacher will go over it with you.

, Children in elementary school (in the UK, primary school) require on average 10-11 hours of sleep for optimal performance. Adolescents, on the other hand, typically require at least 10+ hours. Poor sleep has been found to accumulate (referred to as ""sleep debt""); in order to make up for prolonged poor sleep habits, several weeks of daily optimal sleep may be required to return to optimal performance.


Don't consume caffeine or any other stimulating substance within 5-6 hours prior to sleeping. (However, if a doctor prescribed you a stimulant to take at a specific time, take it at that time regardless of when you fall asleep, and ask your doctor before changing anything.) Such substances reduce the efficiency of sleep, meaning that even with sufficient sleep time, you may not feel well rested upon waking.

, Eat a balanced breakfast full of lean protein, vegetables, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants. A sample breakfast might include a spinach omelet with smoked salmon, whole wheat toast, and a banana., If your exam is a long one, bring a snack with you if you're permitted to do so. Something with some complex carbohydrates and protein, such as a whole-wheat peanut butter sandwich or even a granola bar, will help boost your concentration when it begins to flag., Give yourself at least five or 10 minutes to gather your thoughts before starting the exam. This way, you can get settled in and have time to relax before the test starts.

, If you don't know the answer to the question, do the next one and come back to it at the end. Struggling and concentrating on a question you don't know the answer to can be time consuming, which makes you lose valuable marks.

, If you have a grammar test or English, its good to make flashcards to remember definitions of a word. You can take it to school and just flip through them before your exams start.

Sort the supplies beforehand.,
Keep things simple and short.,
Use diagrams and charts if you retain visual information better.,
Scribble information on post-it notes or even plain paper.,

Use acronyms.,
Try using stories.,
Use a mind map, which is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks, or other items linked to and arranged around a central key word or idea.,
Use color.",How to Take Exam Notes," You may prefer visuals, audio, colors, maps, etc. or a combination of any such things. Rely most on these approaches when breaking down the information that you need to remember and apply in the exam.;
, Ensure that you have the appropriate stationery supplies to make taking notes easier and more enjoyable. If you have the right tools, the revising is more enjoyable.

, For example, there is no need to be lengthy. Take rough notes instead of writing sentences. Use abbreviations, equations, and symbols as often as possible.

, Some people are visual learners; others prefer reading, writing and/or verbal learning. However, don't take these divisions to an extreme––most people learn best using a combination of the techniques rather than relying on a single approach.

, Hang these distilled pieces of information beside your study area, or in areas where you spend most time or carry them around with you. When you feel like testing yourself, revise the information and look to your notes to see if you memorized it correctly.

, This way you have key information staring back at you every day leading up to your exam. It’s not a proven method, but it is in your face!

, Acronyms are great when “chunking” a set of points that are related, but be sure to keep it simple.

, Stories are useful depending on what you try to memorize, but going back to basics, My Very Excellent Mother Just Sent Us Nine Pies and she is a nice mother, because her pies help me remember the order of planets in our Solar System - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. It may seem silly for some people, but if it works for you, then use it.

, Mind maps are used to generate, visualize, structure, and classify ideas, and as an aid in study, organization, problem-solving, decision making, and writing.


Spider diagrams work too.
It is recommended that you don't make lists as these might slow you down and you won't be able to remember information from a long list that isn't linked well.

, Use highlighters or different colored pens to make things stand out. Color is a good way of sorting information and visually recalling it.

Look up unfamiliar words.,
Look for examples.,
Learn about prefixes and suffixes.,
Write your own sentences.,
Use the words in real life.",How to Study for a Vocabulary Test or Quiz1," Make sure you actually understand the definitions of all of your new words. If you don't understand the words in the definitions, you won't really know the true meanings of the words, which will make it much harder to remember your vocabulary., Even if you understand the definition of the word, you might not understand exactly how the word is used. This is why it's useful to search for sentences that contain the word.Try doing a simple Google search for your word. You'll probably find lots of different sentences that use your word in different ways. Write down the ones that best help you understand how to use the word.
You can also try searching your word on YouTube. You may find a song that contains your word.
If you're having a hard time understanding the meaning of the word from its context in sentences, try performing a Google image search. You may find that the pictures that show up for your word will help you understand its meaning.

, These are word parts that come at either the beginning or the end of a word. Words with common prefixes or suffixes often share similar meanings. If you learn prefixes and suffixes, sometimes it's possible to figure out what a word means, even if you're not sure at first. Here are some examples:""Dis"" means not, or in absence of, as in distance, disengaged, or dissolve.
""Mis"" means negative, or bad, as in misread or misfit.
""Ous"" means full of, as in dangerous or fabulous.

Less means lacking, as in mirthless or guileless.
Other common prefixes and suffixes include mal, mega, super, extra, equi, sub, post, ism, ness, ment, and many more., Once you have a good understanding of how other people use the word, try your hand at writing some unique sentences with it. The more sentences you can write, the better.Be sure you truly understand what the word means in your sentence. If you're not sure, look for more examples.
Don't just change a word or two in your example sentences. This exercise will be much more valuable if you think up sentences that are entirely unique.
Your sentences should be specific enough that the context will help you remember the definition of the word. For example, instead of just writing, ""She looked dejected,"" write, ""She looked dejected after her boyfriend broke up with her."" This is even more important when you are dealing with words that may have multiple meanings.
Try to use the word in as many different ways as possible. For example, if it's a noun, use it in its singular and plural forms. If it's a verb, use it in present and past tense.

, The best way to truly learn new vocabulary words is to incorporate them into your everyday speech and writing. As you are studying, try to consciously use these words in place of simpler or more common synonyms.Even if you don't use the words in conversation, use them in some way. For example, you can try using your new vocabulary words to describe articles that you read in the newspaper or you can try to incorporate them into your next book report.

"
Read through your list multiple times.,
Write the words down.,
Use flashcards.,
Repeat the words aloud.,
Keep the words visible.",How to Study for a Vocabulary Test or Quiz2," Start with a list that contains your vocabulary words in one column and their definitions or translations in another column. Cover one column and read through the other word by word, trying your best to remember what's written in the covered column. The more times you do this, the more you will remember.It helps to read through the list both ways. Start by reading the word and seeing if you can remember the definition. Then read the definition and see if you can remember the word.
If you can easily remember some of the words, consider making a separate list that contains only the words you are having a hard time with.
After you've done this for a while, take a break and do something that does not involve your vocabulary. Then return to your list and make sure you haven't forgotten anything.

, For many people, writing down the vocabulary words and their definitions helps cement them in their memories. If this is the case for you, try writing each term and its definition several times., Flashcards are a quick and easy way to review your vocabulary and separate the words into different categories. You can also review them pretty much anywhere, which makes finding time to study a lot easier.Reviewing your flashcards at the gym is a great way to multitask, and it takes advantage of the stimulation that occurs in your brain when you exercise.
For a more interactive approach, have someone else quiz you with your flashcards.If you don't want to make flashcards, you can get similar benefits from online games. Search for one that already contains the words you are studying or one that allows you to input your own vocabulary.

, Saying the vocabulary words out loud can help just as much as writing them down for some people. This is especially helpful if the words are difficult to pronounce. Once you become comfortable with saying the words, you will be much more likely to remember what they mean (and how to spell them).It may also help to record yourself while you repeat your vocabulary words out loud.
You can also try explaining the words to other people. If you're confident enough to teach others your vocab words, then you should know them really well.

, If you're really struggling to remember some of your vocabulary words, consider writing them down on sticky notes and posting them in places where you will see them all the time. This will help keep them fresh in your memory.If you are studying foreign language vocabulary, try labeling items around your house with your new vocabulary.
If you are studying native language vocabulary or more abstract foreign language terms, just post a list of the most challenging words on your bathroom mirror, on your refrigerator, or in another highly visible place. Make a point of reading through the entire list every time you see it.

"
"
Draw a picture.,
Replace the words in a song.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Create associations.",How to Study for a Vocabulary Test or Quiz3," If you have a visual memory, a simple picture can really enhance your vocabulary list or flashcards. Try drawing something that will remind you of the word's meaning. For example, you could draw a picture of a happy face next to the word ""elated.""This may be even more effective if you try to incorporate the picture into the word somehow. For example, you could draw devil horns on the word ""malevolent"" to remind you that it means ""evil.""

, If you're having a hard time remembering the meaning of a word that has a much easier synonym, it may help to train your brain to associate the two. Think of song lyrics that contain the synonym and repeat them to yourself over and over using your new vocabulary word in place of its synonym. If you do this enough, you should have a very easy time remembering that the two words mean the same thing.For example, if you need to remember that the word ""jubilant"" means ""happy,"" try changing the words to ""If You're Happy and You Know It"" to ""if you're jubilant and you know it, clap you hand.""

, A mnemonic device is simply a word or sentence that helps you remember something. When you use a mnemonic device for a vocabulary word, you should try to use the sounds in the word to remind yourself of its definition.For example, if you need to remember the meaning of the word ""perilous,"" you might decide that it sounds something like ""pear is lost."" Use this sentence to create a short back story that you will remember. It can be as ridiculous as you want, as long as it will lead you back to the definition of the word. Your story could be, ""I was hopping across a high balance beam on one foot while holding a pear in each hand. I lost my balance, and the only way I could prevent myself from falling was to drop one of my pears."" This silly story should help you remember that the meaning of ""perilous"" (pear is lost) is ""dangerous.""
If you can't think of a mnemonic device yourself, search for a mnemonic dictionary online. It will give you several suggestions for how to remember the meaning of your word.

, Another great trick to help you quickly remember your vocabulary words is to associate each word with an object or person. For example, you might assign a different vocabulary word to each item of furniture in your living room based on its appearance. You can also do this with people by assigning a word to each of your friends on Facebook based on their personalities, for example. As long as there is some kind of reason for the association, even if it's silly, this will help you quickly recall the meaning of each word."

Calm yourself down.",How to Study for an English Exam at the Last Minute," If your teacher gave you a study guide, great, you can use it to guide your studying. If not, you'll need to use a syllabus. A syllabus is helpful because it gives you an overview of what you studied. If you don't have a syllabus, you'll need to make your own outline., If you have a syllabus, use it to map out what you studied. If you don't, think about the major ideas or works you've studied in the testing period, whether that it is major grammar ideas, such as parallelism, or major works of literature, such as Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre.


You can create a visual diagram by creating boxes of major ideas and then showing how they are connected with lines to help you visualize what you need to study.However, you can also just create a list of the major ideas with space underneath each one to add sub-ideas. For instance, your list for the study period might include Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, along with poetry by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Underneath those headings, you might list main themes, characters, and ideas.

, Once you know what you need to study, write out a short list of how long you can spend on each area. Base this list on how long you have to study.For instance, if you have 6 hours to study, and you have 18 topics, then you can only spend about 20 minutes studying each topic.

, Once you've made a list of major topics, decide which ones you know the best. Maybe you're great at parallelism, but you're having trouble with gerunds. Alternatively, maybe you have Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet down cold, but you're having trouble remembering the details of Aphra Behn's The Rover. Focus your attention on what you don't remember, not what you do.It's better to review everything at least once if possible. However, if you just don't have enough time, stick to what you don't know.If you do have time to review everything, note what you need to focus on as you study., If you're teacher or professor is big on facts and figures, you may have a section of multiple-choice or short answer questions. You may see this type of exam if your English class is a grammar class. However, literature exams are often based around essay questions. The professor or teacher will expect you to know the heart of the material.


One way to judge what the test will be like is to use past exams and quizzes. Do a quick review to see what kind of questions she likes to pull out.
Once you know what kind of questions she likes, use that to plan for your exam.

, Put your phone away. Turn off your computer if possible. If not, try using an app that disables the internet or certain sites for a period of time to help remove distractions. Turn the television off. Clear your workspace so that only your notes and what you need to study for the test are on it., This type of music, which has 60 beats per minute, activates both sides of your brain. Because it increases your brain activity, it helps you retain information. Try turning it on low to listen to while you're studying., Don't try to cram it all in at once. If you try to study the same thing for 5 hours in a row, your brain is going to stop absorbing information. Instead, try switching subjects every 20 to 30 minutes. If you must focus on your English exam by itself, switch topics within the subject. For instance, try studying Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice for 20 minutes, then move on to Shakespeare's Othello., If you've taken good notes in class, now is the time to use them. Often, your professor will bring up key points in class, so by studying what she said, you'll have an idea of what's on the exam., You've already mapped out a main outline. Now, try to fill it in with more details. If you're studying novels, try filling in the main characters and their story arcs. Write out the main plot of the story in basic terms, as well as the main ideas. Use your resources to help you.

, If your class is more grammar-based or if you reviewed types of literary devices, try making flash cards. Write the term on the front, and then write the definition or explanation on the back. Use them to review the ideas, then quiz yourself by making yourself give the definition from the term on the front. Only check yourself after you've given an answer., If your class has followed a particular timeline in literature, try creating a visual timeline. Map out the books from the earliest to the latest, adding main ideas under each novel or poem. Use it to see what themes are common in the period you are studying.

, If your English class has a textbook besides novels, take the time to skim it. Don't read everything. Look at the major headings to help you remember major ideas., If you're having a hard time remembering every novel you read this year or semester, try using a summary website that provides synopsis of stories. Just be sure that the version you're reading about is the same version used in class, as sometimes translations can have different character names. The full summaries that go chapter by chapter can be too long for a review, but even the short summaries can help jog your memory., If your professor or teacher provided you with review questions, take the time to answer them. Not only will it help you review the material, but also, writing it down can help solidify it in your brain. Plus, it helps you think through difficult questions before you get to the exam.For instance, maybe your teacher wants you to write on the use of words related to sight in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. If you don't want to answer it fully in review, at least make a list of the major ideas so you'll be ready when you take the test.
If your exam will be grammar-focused, try working through the problems the teacher gave you. Diagram a sentence, so you are sure you remember how to do it., Maybe you learn best by hearing things; in that case, reading your notes out loud may help. Maybe you're a tactile learner. In that case, try writing down major ideas. If you're a visual leaner, try drawing maps of the novel's plot to help you remember the it., Friends can be distracting if you get off topic, but friends can also help you retain information by encouraging it to come alive. If you're just reviewing facts and names about Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd, you may find yourself falling into monotony. However, if you take some time to discuss the plot and what you liked and didn't like about Hardy's novel, it will come alive, bringing back details you may have forgotten., You still need breaks, even if you are pressed for time. Your brain gets tired after so many hours, so take at least a 5 to 10 minute break every hour. Get up and move around. Stretch your legs. Go outside for a few minutes. Get a cup of tea. Just make sure to disengage your brain from what you're studying., As tempting as it is to stay up all night, it's important to get as much sleep as possible before a test. Your brain will not function well if you haven't gotten enough sleep. Getting enough sleep will allow you to better recall the information you've already learned in the class, even if you weren't able to review that information or cram new information into your brain.Don't forget to set your alarm. You don't want to miss your test.
If you have a hard time getting up, try putting your alarm clock or phone across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn off the alarm., Although breakfast is important, you don't want to eat breakfast all of a sudden if that's not your normal routine, as it could upset your stomach. Additionally, don't change to a new food for breakfast that may make you need to leave your exam halfway through because your stomach is complaining. Keep it simple, and close to what your normally eat., If you feel yourself getting stressed before tests, take a few minutes before class to calm yourself down. You can even do it after your teacher hands out the test, as that is when you're likely to be the most stressed.Take a few minutes to breathe. Close your eyes for a few moments. Concentrate on your breathing. Count to seven as you breathe in, and then count to seven as you breathe out.Look at your test. Tell yourself that you are going to do well. Remind yourself that you worked hard throughout the semester, and you're likely to remember what you need."
"
Make a study schedule.,
Start as soon as possible.,
Ask your teacher what things she/he want you to study.,
Get some sleep.,
Make time for breakfast.,
Avoid the last minute cram session.,
Study right after waking and just before bed.",How to Study for a Test1," Time management is key to studying for a test or tests. If you plan out your time, you'll feel less rushed and hurried. You'd be able to avoid a Sunday night, 3 AM cram session. Plan out the week before the test to use your time most effectively.


Analyse how many things you have to study and try to calculate how much you have to study each day/week to cover everything. You can quickly test how long it takes you study one page and calculate the amount of time you need to study everything afterwards.
Try to study over the course of a week, not just one night. Revisiting the information moves it from short-term memory (the kind that disappears almost immediately) to long-term memory, where you can retrieve it for later.Ideally, take a look at the content a little bit every day.;
, If you start on top of things, you'll never have to worry about catching up. Read the textbook assignments, do the homework, and go to class. The studying you do on your own time will then be that much easier.



Organize a notebook and folder for the class. Keep all your papers together when you need to pull them out three months later. Keep your syllabus accessible to use it as a rough outline for the class. Don't forget to keep up the studying on a daily basis, don't leave it for the last minute!

, Remember, any little detail on a test can become a question!

, Alright, so we already covered how you should sleep instead of changing your normal routine to wake up early to study because it can ruin your REM cycles.Get as close to 8 hours as possible. Your grades (and parents) will thank you for it.


Before you go to bed , hit the hardest concepts. Then when you do hit the hay, your brain has hours and hours to let it sink in. The fluff can be tackled mid-afternoon -- let the difficult stuff stew overnight for maximum retention., Studies show that students who eat breakfast before a test do better consistently. But you want to keep it to something light and healthy -- focusing on that lump of eggs, bacon, and cheese in your stomach won't do you any favors. Stick to fruits, veggies, whole grains, and light dairy products.


In fact, research says that your diet the week before the test matters, too! Students that were placed on a high-fat, high-carb diet did worse than those loading up on fruits, veggies, and complex, whole grains. Do yourself, your body, and your mind a favor by eating right. By eating right, you can get the right nutrients that your body needs, and you will be able to retain information better., Studying the night before the test will make it even more difficult -- you'll be sleep deprived, groggy, and your mind will not be firing on all pistons. You don't want to gather heaps of information in one night; it's impossible to absorb that much info at once.Straight up, you'll do worse.


If you don't see the logic, believe the science. Studies show that late-night crammers get average grades.If you're looking for a C, cram away. But if you're looking for something a bit better, avoid it.

, In the morning, your mind is fresh and clear. Though you wouldn't think it works this way (so simple!), your mind seems to have more room to absorb information right when you wake up.At night, your brain secretes chemicals to cement the information into your memory, so studying right before bed (and when you wake up) is a safe bet. When you know the patterns of your brain, you can take advantage of them!


Research shows that the closer the information is taken in relative to sleep, the more it'll stay in. So review right before bed! What's more, it also shows that getting a good night's rest leads to greater levels of retention. Remember how we said don't cram? There you go."
"
Mentally prepare yourself.,
Create a schedule.,
Keep reinforcing your basic concepts.,
Visualize yourself as a topper.,
Stick to your schedule.,
Eat and sleep well.,
Move on to other topics only when you are 100 percent sure of the current topic.,
Solve sample papers.,
Days 1-3: Just finish off three simple topics, even if you have a load left.,
Days 4 and 5: Keep on solving sample papers and just take regular breaks.

,
Days 6 and 7: These are the most crucial days, since over working or under working could lead to mishaps.,
Wake up early.,
Inside the hall.,
Keep calm.,
Mark carefully.",How to Study for a Tough Olympiad," So you've got about 2 or 4 weeks to the Olympiad. You need to be ready to work hard and cover all topics in the limited time frame you have.;
, A typical schedule has 5 study days followed by a day for testing yourself and a day for rest and recap. However, you could modify it to suit your needs. You will have to stick to your schedule for the remaining time

, Since most Olympiads are concept-based and objective (multiple choice question type), all you need to do is reinforce the basic concepts which you already know. So, for example, if it is a mental ability Olympiad, you need to stick to cubes, matrices, number and letter sequences, blood relations and so on. If it's a varying Olympiad i.e. if it has many subjects covered, you will have to study all the concepts thoroughly.

, The key to performing well in any Olympiad is being confident mentally. Keep visualizing your success, and it will come to you.

, Cover at least 85 percent of the topics that are needed. Your priority list should be in such a way that you study the high weightage topics first, and then the ones with lower weightage. so clearly, in a varying Olympiad, you need to finish off mental ability first and then maths, followed by science and languages at last.

, You've probably read this enough times, but one cannot emphasise enough the importance of eating and sleeping well. You DO NOT need to study late at night in order to do well. Sleeping helps brain to retain any new information (boosts memory) and also helps balance out any stress. Waking up early is better since the mind is fresh.

, Most people just try to complete the syllabus, but it is more advantageous if you cover fewer topics which you are completely sure of, since you will be able to answer all or most of the questions from the topic correctly.

, Almost all Olympiads have online sites where you can get previous year papers for minimal costs. if you do not have access to these, you can always ask your friends to create mock papers, and then solve them within the time frame of the actual Olympiad.

, 3 topics are the most you can do.

,, Solve as many sample papers you can, and keep thinking positive. Periodic revision is also very important, as it will help you to recollect information faster.

, Wake up early and go through all the formulae and equations you need. Have a balanced breakfast, make sure you have all materials you need (HB pencils, ball point pens, erasers, calculators if allowed) and go to the exam with a positive mind.

, Once inside the hall, make full use of the reading time, reading at least 3/4th of the paper. Leave 5 minutes of your reading time to try to remember the topics you learnt.

, Most people are unable to complete the full Olympiad in time because they are too busy stressing out. Learn some quick meditation techniques and use them whenever you start feeling stressed. Don't worry, you'll manage to finish the paper in time.

, Most of the Olympiads today are OMR sheet types, where you need to darken circles. Once these circles are darkened, it is really hard to erase the mark and re-mark, since the OMR reader considers even a small dot as an answer. So, you need to check where you mark twice before you mark."
"
Assemble a study group.,
Choose a few different places to study.,
Take breaks during your study time.,
Go for power foods.,
Make it fun.,
Separate the content into parts.",How to Study for a Test2," According to Duke University, the most effective study groups have 3 or 4 people. One of them should be deemed the leader, or representative -- they'll keep the group on track. Bring some snacks, some music, and agree on content beforehand. Talking about the content makes you read it, see it, hear it, and speak it -- way better for memory.It's a good idea to spend the first part of your session working on concepts. These often get ignored. Have a discussion on the concepts of that week's material or the major points on the test. When you have a discussion about it, it'll be that much more interesting (and memorable). Then, work on specific problems. When you've covered the concepts, the problems will be more likely to fall into place., Recent research has shown that your memory improves if you take in information in multiple environments. Scientists aren't exactly sure why, but it has something to do with enriching the information and making associations with multiple sets of stimuli (encoding the information deeper).At home, at the library, it's all good!


If you can study where you take the test, do so. If you've heard of context-dependent memory, you know what this is about. Your brain is more likely to remember information in the environment it learned it in.So if you can bring your study group into the classroom, do it!
Avoid getting distracted by your environment and use background noise to block out distracting noises.

, Whether your study period is at home or at school, make sure you take some time off of your notes. Get a drink of water or walk or grab a snack. But be sure your break is only a few minutes, about 5-10. Don't make it too long, or you'll set off task and won't study!


Remember, you're only taking a break because your brain needs to set the information it's already ingested. Your attention will improve, and your recall will be much, much better. You're not slacking -- you're simply studying the best way for your brain.Use your breaks to stand up and go for a walk. Go out and get some fresh air, your brain needs oxygen in order to perform best.

, Recent research has shown that cocoa is superfood for the brain. Dark chocolate has a similar effect, but make sure it's over 70% cocoa. So grab that cuppa or that bar and feel guilt-free!Coffee and tea -- a little bit of caffeine -- doesn't hurt either.Staying energized is a big part of absorbing information. Just don't go overboard and crash a few hours later!
Fish, nuts, and olive oil (all things high in Omega-3s) are also brain super foods. Have the meal before your test high in these and your brain will be ready and raring to go., Write the information on note cards and then decorate them. Make sure the cards do not have a whole essay of information or they'll be impossible to decipher. You can quiz yourself, others, and work with them as you're waiting for the bus, walking to class, or just killing time.


You're also more likely to remember something if you associate it with a crazy story.Trying to remember that the only war that took place during one president's term was WWI and it was Woodrow Wilson? Well, Woody's initials are WW, so imagine him on top of the world with one of those giant foam fingers. Or one giant Wilson volleyball, painted to look like the Earth, bouncing between the US and Germany. You know, whichever.
Graphs and pictures are much easier to remember than boring, drawn-out sentences. If you can make it more interactive and visually pleasing, do so. It'll pay off.
Use mnemonic devices too! Your brain can only remember so many things (the magic number is 7, it seems), so if you can lump a whole bunch of information into one word (think Roy G. Biv), you'll be able to maximize your memory., The easiest way to do this will be with your handy highlighters. Use yellow for vocab terms, pink for dates, blue for stats, etc. When you're studying, take time to hit all the different types of information, so you brain doesn't saturate with numbers, dates, or hard-to-process information. You wouldn't practice basketball by shooting lay-ups all day, would you?


That way, when you study, it should be fairly easy to see the larger concepts versus the finer details. When you're scanning, just focus on the big stuff. When you're really getting into it, delve into the details.
Studying different types of material in one session has shown to leave deeper, longer-lasting impression on the brain. It's the same reason musicians do scales, pieces, and rhythmic work and athletes do strength, speed, and skill drills. So in one afternoon, attack all those colors!"
"
Take a pre-test.,
Review that morning -- if it calms your nerves.,
Get in the zone before class.,
Show up early.,
Do the easy questions first.",How to Study for a Test3," This is useful for two reasons: A) You'll be less nervous when the actual test rolls around (which can be rather detrimental to your grade) and B) you'll do better. A recent study at UC Berkeley showed that students who were tested on information they just learned actually did better than those who were asked to document what they were learning.So write up a pre-test and have your friend do the same! Then you can grade it for each other and reap the benefits. And if you can get your study group in on it, all the better. The more real it feels, the more prepared you'll feel and be when test day arrives.

, This is good for the exact same two reasons as stated in the previous step. You want to be as calm and relaxed as possible, and reviewing right before the test will do that. What's more, you'll retain the information (remember how the brain is clearer right when you wake up?). So on your way to class, whip out those flashcards for the last time.


Only hit up the simple stuff (only revise simple concepts). Trying to wrap your brain around the large, difficult concepts when you have ten minutes on your walk won't do you any favors. You'll end up psyching yourself out -- the opposite effect of what you want! Just prime your brain for the content.

, Some people go so far as to meditate before class. Yoga helps, too! Anything that relaxes your breathing and gets you in the zone will be helpful. What would get you in the right place?


Consider listening to classical music. Though it doesn't make you smarter like some people (used to) believe, it can improve your memory. If you want to get super specific, listen to music that's 60 BPM. That's when the benefits will be highest. Natural background noise generators that let you play rain, wind, water or a calm fire crackling have the same beneficial effect and help you getting in the zone.

, If you're running, running, running, you'll be stressed out, even if you know your stuff. Show up early, get out your materials, ask a friend questions (and have them do the same), slip in some gum, and settle in. It's time to rock this bad boy.

, An easy way to get stressed out and lose your cool is to focus on questions you don't know the answers to. You start worrying about the clock and thinking about how you didn't study enough. Don't fall into the trap -- move on to what you do know. Then you can hit the hard stuff dead on.


The more time you spend on a question, the more time you risk second guessing yourself. You want to trust your intuitions. You worked hard! Never doubt yourself.Ensure that you revisit your work afterwards

Being sure that you are keeping up with concepts and how they relate to one another will help with your overall understanding of how each process works together.


Review notes after each class to be sure you don’t have any questions about the lesson.
Look back at any practice problems in the book.
Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification. For example, if you are having trouble with debt-to-equity ratio, ask your professor for help.;
, Accounting terms and processes are set up to be as logical as possible. Understanding why certain things are done in certain ways will give you a stronger insight into what to do to tackle each individual problem.


Create flashcards that define terms AND what circumstances you would use them or see them in.
Answer any discussion questions in your text book and come prepared to ask questions in your class.
It can also be helpful to talk problems out with a classmate or tutor to be sure you understand why it gets solved a certain way.
The CPA exam in particular will have many simulations or case studies that will ask you to sort through terms to get to your answer. , Once you can see why things are done, it’s time to focus on learning how to do them.


Review old homework assignments. Rework problems you may have missed or may not have fully understood at the time.
Work through problems with a partner, discussing the methods you used to solve it to help each other understand more deeply how the process works.
Familiarize yourself with key terms and what they mean.
Be aware of terms like retained losses and accumulated deficits that can easily be confused.

, Before you start to workout a problem, take a moment to think about how you will organizing the information to best help you come to a solution. Having a clear method for solving problems can help you keep things focused and relieve stress during an exam. Some longer task based questions are giving in long paragraphs and can have several sections. Practice identifying the relevant information and listing it in on a separate piece of paper.


Make sure you understand all the parties involved, the length of time, the situation being described as well as contract or payment terms.
Make a list of related facts or amounts.
Some questions will contain information that is not needed and simply there to throw you off.

, Most students and professors would agree that if you are taking the CPA exam that the Financial Accounting and Reporting section is by far the most difficult and that it requires a rigorous amount of studying to pass. Whatever the exam, it may be best to start with the problems and concepts you know will be challenging so that you can spend the appropriate amount of time on them.

, Questions on the exam may not be exact copies of the once from homework assignments. Making sure you have a clear understanding of key concepts will make you more confident when you come to questions that might approach the material from another angle than ones you’ve previously encountered.


Try some practice questions from a source outside of your textbook.
If you encounter any problems you can't work, this might help highlight areas where you may need additional practice or help from another student or your professor.

, Giving the chapters in the book a thorough reading will allow you to walk into class with at least some understanding of the day’s lesson before the professor delivers her lecture. You’ll also be more aware of concepts you don’t fully understand, which will allow you to pay particular attention to those parts of the lesson as well as come ready with prepared questions to help you clarify anything you still don’t understand.


Take notes on the chapter before you go into class.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions. That’s what your professor is there for!
Take time to review notes after class.
Revisit anything you are still having trouble with by rereading sections in your textbook or going over notes from the day’s lesson.

, Once you understand more about the how and the why, the best way to prepare for the test is to hone your skills by practicing what you have learned. Websites like offer modules covering all of the essential concepts in financial accounting.


Keep track of your time.
Multiple choice questions should only take you a couple of minutes to solve.
If you are taking the CPA exam, task based questions can take anywhere from one to two hours.
Try to mimic the testing environment. If the test will be on a computer, try taking your practice test online. If you'll have to write everything long hand, try and find a test out of your text book or print one out from a website.
The American Institute of CPA's has an online sample tests. , Trying to study in an environment with too many distractions can make it difficult to focus, especially when working out longer problems or attempting to to understand difficult concepts.


Go to a library or find a quiet room in your own home.
For those that don’t mind a bit of white noise, a quiet coffee shop or diner might do the trick.
Find a place that is comfortable and free of too many distractions.
You’ll have a lot of materials so be sure you have a large work area.
Some libraries have quiet study rooms with large tables that can be reserved for a few hours at a time.

, Make sure you have everything you need organized in front of you so you don’t have to keep interrupting your studies to search for materials.


Have all your class notes with you and organized by topic or chapter.
Mark the relevant chapters in your textbook with Post-it notes so you can easily flip to the information you need when you need it.
Have some extra pens and pencils handy.
Have any old homework assignments or exams with you. You may want to refer back to problems you missed and try to rework them.
Gather any practice tests you might want to use.
Study guides (like those published by Schaum's) are available in several areas of accounting, and can be used to augment your textbook and class notes.

, If you have taken a previous test in your class, or if your instructor has made old tests available for study, then you can get an idea of the exam format. This will help you to know what types of problems you should be practicing and how quickly you'll need to work to finish the exam in the allotted time.

, Studying for any type of exam takes an enormous amount of focus and endurance. Making sure you eat some healthy foods before and during can help you stay more alert and clear minded. Coffee is fine but avoid having too much.
Be sure to eat a good breakfast.
Foods like oatmeal, almonds, and fruit can provide you with a lot of energy.
Have a bottle of water handy to stay hydrated.
Take a break every hour or so to clear move around and clear your mind.

, Studying with others can be a helpful way to stay focused and more quickly absorb information. You can help each other out by explaining what you learned best and by hearing about how other students have come to understand concepts you may not feel as confident in. If you can find people who are as serious about learning the material as you are, a study group can be an incredibly helpful resource. Find a group of four to six other hard working students
Make clear goals and objectives before each session to help you stay on task.
Make sure everyone is participating either in discussions or by helping to work out problems.

Get about ten sheets of copy (computer) paper, a spiral notebook large enough for the class you are attending, and a three-ringed binder, either large enough for the class you are attending, or to contain notes for several classes, which ever is best for you.,
Fold and cut the copy paper sheets in half, making them 8.5"" x 5.5"".,
Use these sheets to take notes on in class.,
Turn the pages over, or go to another sheet, as necessary, progressively numbering each page in the top right hand corner.,
Remember that as soon you get home from class, if any reading is required to correspond with the day's lessons, it would be worth while to take notes, again on your note paper.

,
Know that as soon as possible, preferably that evening, but before a test is scheduled, rewrite the information you took in class, and any associated reading notes, into a spiral notebook.,
When a test is scheduled for that class, a day or two before the test, rewrite the information from the spiral notebook into the three ringed binder.,
Get to bed at a reasonable hour the night before your test, and get a full night's sleep.,
Understand that what this method works, is your persistence in following the above noted steps.",How to Study for a Test Without Cramming,";
, At the top of the first sheet for that day, write the class you are in and the date. This will help with the organization of your information at a later time. You should never mix up your notes with several classes. Each group of note taking sheets should be kept in the associated book.

, Don't worry about how they look, if you scratch something out, if you have to write things out of order, or upside down. If you find the need to draw instructional pictures, or lines drawn from one point of information to another, definitely do so. This is for your use only, and the only person who needs to understand the information is you.

, By numbering them, if they were to get out of order, you can easily find how they should be organized. Again, do not worry about how things look. The most important thing here is to get the information given in class so you are able to use it at a later time.

,, This spiral notebook should be for this particular class only. There should be one notebook for each class. At this time, just rewrite the information in a more organized manner than on your note sheets.

, At this time, you should take care to make sure all of the information is as organized as possible. Using an outline form can be very helpful.


If there are any associated drawings, for example, a drawing of a plant cell and all of it's components versus an animal cell, include it in your binder in as much detail as possible. Do not worry about your skills as an artist, but concentrate on the accuracy of the information. Also, coloring in items in your drawings will help you to remember how things look. Once you have completed the above steps, put everything away, and don't look at it anymore before your test.


, Make sure you have all of your materials needed for your test; i.e., pens, pencils, calculators, etc.


The morning of your test, get up early and eat a healthy breakfast. Taking a test on an empty stomach, or a stomach without the proper food, is like trying to drive your car 100 miles (160 km) on two gallons of gas. You will move along fine for a while, but will eventually poop out.
Arrive to your test a little early to avoid panic and rushing.When you are in your class at your desk, don't panic about the test. Take a couple of deep breaths and relax. You have done a lot of work preparing for your test, and the information is in your brain ready to be called on.
As you take your test, you will find you will be able to recall the information you wrote or drew. Sometimes, after reading a question, you can close your eyes, and you will actually be able to see your notes in your mind. The idea is, you have seen the information so many times, you have actually stored that information in your brain with out trying to cram it in there.
,


, If you don't do all of the steps, most likely you will not be able to retain the information as well. Good luck! Everybody has their own way of studying.

She knows the syllabus of the course and is best-placed to remind you about what you have been covering in class and how you should go about your studying.Always be polite and don't blame your teacher for your lack of understanding. Say something like ""I don't feel like I understand the topic, can you recommend some reading I can do to help?""
Be sure to show that you are not looking for short-cuts, but that you genuinely want to study and learn.
You could say, ""I know we have the test coming up and I was hoping you could help me identify which areas I need to work more on?"";
, A good way to determine the material in the course that you do and don't understand is simply to look back through all your notes and books for the subject. Read through and think about what you know and what you don't know. Provided that you have taken good notes in class, they will be one of the best resources for reviewing what has been covered.Mark down any areas that you have particular trouble with and try to rank them by difficulty.
When you go through the notes and books make it an active exercise. Underline, highlight and annotate key passages to make sure you are actively engaging with your notes.
Doing this will help you avoid passively glossing over material. If you don't take an active approach, there is a danger that what you are reading won't sink in., One of the best ways to see what you do and don't understand is to try and teach the material to someone else.This tactic forces you to put ideas into your own words, so it will be very clear what you have a handle on and what you don't.For example, if you're in history class and the test will cover ""causes of the American Revolution,"" ask a family member or friend if you can explain the causes to them. Give the other person your textbook or class notes. When you find a place that you have difficulty explaining, or ""teaching,"" ask them to make a note of it. Then you will know what you need to study for the test.
Talking with someone else about issues you're having studying can also be very helpful. A fresh perspective may be just what you need to clarify those last few points.

, An excellent way to see what type of questions you will be asked in an upcoming exam is to obtain past exams through your teacher. If your teacher gives you a past exam, you can use it as a way to test your knowledge and conduct practice tests. Having a good understanding of the type of question and the format of the exam will be useful for your studying.This is especially the case when you feel like you don't understand the material.


Seeing questions written down on a past test will help to get to grips with the sort of knowledge that the exam is testing.
The questions will be different but the past test can help you determine what kind of questions you will be asked.
You may be asked general questions which require a broader but less detailed understanding, more specific questions which require fuller understanding of a more limited topic, or both.

, If you are taking a class and are struggling with the material, don't wait until the exam comes around before taking steps to improve your understanding and your work. It's important to be an active learner rather than a passive learner. This means actively working through your notes from class and seeking extra help or clarification at the time rather than putting it off.


By being active you are using the information and material that you are learning more frequently.
More frequent use of information will make it easier for you to access it in your memory when the test arrives.Try to spend ten minutes looking over your notes from each class within 24 hours of the class., This may not be useful to you the night before the big test, but participating in your class will make it far easier for you to really get a grip on the material being covered. You can ask questions, participate in class discussion, and get active in group activities., Once you have a clearer picture of the material you need to study it's important that you get down to it and don't waste any time. You really don't want to be trying to cram at the last minute if you can avoid it. Ideally you should start serious studying at least a week or two before the test. Of course this will vary depending on how much you need to cover, but it's better to have extra time than not enough.You may have to experiment a little to find the right schedule for you. Some people will find they can keep their concentration for longer than others.
Try to study for between 40 and 90 minutes at a time before taking a short break of 10 or 15 minutes. Keep the break relatively short so you don't get completely out of the studying mindset.Having a clear and visual schedule written up will help you keep track of your work and visualise your progress as you can tick off the parts as you do them.

, It's essential that you find a place to work where you can really concentrate and be free from distractions and disturbances. There are no fixed rules for this and what works for you might not for somebody else. Ensure it is free of electronic devices and other obvious distractions. You can break your working environment down into sounds, sights, smells, and comfort.


Find the right level of quietness for you. Some people work well with some light background noise, others prefer total silence. Find what works for you.
You need good lighting to avoid eye-strain and fatigue. Try to avoid working somewhere with potentially distracting sights and lights.
You have to find a place and way to work that is comfortable, but not so comfortable that you lose focus and relax completely. For example, choose a desk chair rather than a recliner.
Although it may not come to mind immediately, smells can be distracting so try to steer clear of areas that have strong smells, good or bad.Many people believe they're good at multitasking, but it's a myth that you can successfully study and do something else. Find a study space that isn't blaring a TV or loud music, and stay off of IM and Facebook. Trying to ""multitask"" will only end up damaging your concentration and making it even harder to understand the material., One reason people may not understand information is that it seems completely foreign and unlinked to things you already know. This makes it a lot harder to connect to the material.It can be helpful to ask your teacher or your classmates for their perspectives on the material. This may help you make links to things you already know.
Try searching online. You may find a better example or explanation that ""clicks"" with you than the one in the textbook.
Look at the context of information. If you're finding it challenging to understand what you're reading, try looking for contextual clues. Sometimes, this can help you decipher what the text is really getting at. For example, if you're baffled by a chapter that keeps mentioning ""semiotics,"" look at the examples given. You might notice a lot of references to signs, symbols, or meanings, which will give you a clue that semiotics is the study of relationships between signs/symbols (such as language) and what they communicate., Once you are fully prepared it's important that you now stick to the study timetable you have set out. There is simply no alternative to hard work, but if you spend time working efficiently and effectively you can achieve the results you want. Set reminders on your phone to avoid forgetting about any study sessions. If you do miss one, it's not a disaster, just be sure to make up the time elsewhere.


It can be difficult to stick to your schedule so consider asking someone to help you if you find it hard.
A gentle reminder that you ought to be studying from parents or siblings can do the job.Having a clear schedule and putting it up in kitchen is one way to make it clear to everyone in the house when you are supposed to be studying.

, It's important not to get completely bogged down in studying and allow it take over every waking minute of your life. You might lock yourself away for five hours, but it is unlikely that the work you do in those five hours will be as effective and efficient as a more balanced study schedule. Break up your work and be sure to reward yourself for sticking to your timetable.Don't forget to have fun with friends and do physical activities to get your blood flowing again after studying.
Consider taking a short walk after a revision session, or alternatively relaxing with a nice bath or by watching a good DVD., People often get discouraged when they feel like they don't understand a subject. This discouragement can then lead to feeling like studying isn't even worth it because they're just ""bad"" students. Remember that what you don't know says nothing about you as a student. Everyone has areas that they find challenging., If you have tried to work out a schedule and do your studying but the material just isn't making sense be sure to talk to your teacher about it. Ask her if she has a few minutes at the end of class or arrange to see her at the end of the day. Be punctual and ask her for some pointers on where you are going wrong. Bring your books and take notes on what she tells you to focus on.


You should bring your own study materials to show that you have been trying and aren't looking for a quick fix.
Showing that you are committed and hard working will encourage the teacher to put in extra time with you to help.
Be honest with your teacher when you talk to her. If you are really stressed and anxious, tell her that and she will try to help., Studying with friends can be a great way to prepare for an exam as you can use the knowledge each of you has gained and help each other work through difficult material. You will each bring your own ideas, and this can expand your understanding of a topic. If you are going to try a study group be sure to plan out what you will cover beforehand so everyone is prepared and you don't waste any time.Remember that your friend may be very confident, but she is not necessarily right.
Be sure to keep referring to course texts and materials in your study sessions.
If you find that you just end up chatting with your friends you should rethink whether or not the study group is helping you learn and prepare for the test.

, Your parents and older siblings can be a good study resource for you to tap into. This is especially the case if you have an older brother or sister who has already done the class you are doing. Your sibling might have notes you can borrow or might be able to help explain a tricky topic to you more clearly. Similarly, your parents can work with you and help you stick to your schedule.


Flash cards are a very effective way to study, and you can ask your parents or sibling to use these to test you on what you have worked on.Sometimes trying to explain something to someone else will help you get it clearer in your own mind, or highlight areas where you are still uncertain.

Find a quiet place.,
Skim over all the stuff you need to study.,
Divide the material into sections.,
Read the first section (both your textbook and notes) thoroughly.,
Make flash cards for any vocabulary words, significant events, or important people.,
Make a song or mnemonic.,
Read it over again.,
Have someone test you.,
Do not study for the rest of the day.,
Repeat.,
Review.",How to Study for a Test (Grades Under 12)," Do not study with the TV on, your brothers yelling, and your mom banging pans in the background. Go to the library if you need to. The best place to study is somewhere you can be both comfortable and capable of concentrating on the task at hand.;
, Make sure you have no questions.


If you do have a question, write it down and ask the teacher the next day.

, There should be one less section than the number of days you have to study. You will study one section per day, and review on the last day.

, You should read it at least two times. It might help you to read it out loud at least one time. The more senses you use (sight and hearing as opposed to just sight) the more you will remember it.

,


For vocabulary words you should have the word on one side and the definition or translation on the other. ex. fleur-flower; pivotal-of great importance.
For people, you should have their name on one side and a description of what they did and why they are important on the other. ex. George Washington-The first president of the United States and the commander in chief in the Revolutionary War
For events, you should have the name of the event on one side and a description on the other. ex. Revolutionary War-The war in which the American colonies won independence from England.

, If there is any information you are having a hard time remembering, make a song or mnemonic to help remember it easily.

, Read through that section of textbook and notes one more time, in addition to reviewing your flashcards, songs, and mnemonics.

, It can be a friend, parent, or sibling. If all you have to study is vocabulary words, you could use your flash cards and test yourself.

, Go outside, play video games, go to bed if you want. Just do NOT study.

, The next day, do the same thing with the next section. You will do this until you finish all the sections, and it is the night before the test.

, Now that it is the night before the test, you should:


Review all your flashcards, mnemonics, and songs.
Reread your notes and textbook.
Have someone test you.

Know the test format and subject material.,
Set aside a specific place to study.,
Set aside a specific time to study.,
Make sure you are well-rested.,
Use the Cornell System when taking notes.,
Think about what questions your teacher might ask you.,
Use your recall column or sub-notes to study.,
Use your notes to make a flow chart or concept map.,
Highlight any important vocabulary terms.,
Think of applications of the material.,
Read your textbook or articles using the survey method.,
Make reading questions.,
Read each section carefully.,
Stop and recall your questions and answers.,
Review the chapter.,
Do any practice problems that are in your book chapters.,
Highlight any important vocabulary.",How to Study for a Science Exam," This is the best place to start, as you don't want to study things that won't be covered on the exam.


This will help you frame your studying so you can gather all relevant readings, notes, handouts, and labs.
This will also help you decide how much time you need to allot to studying for the exam.
Knowing the format of the exam will help you know what techniques would be best to study for the exam. For example, if the test is a practical exam you will know you need to spend time during labs making sure you understand the material.
If it's a written exam, it may focus on vocabulary, processes, and problems so you should spend time practicing these.;
, Your study area should be quiet and free of distractions. Your study area should have good lighting, ventilation, a comfortable chair (but not too comfortable), and a space large enough to spread out your materials.
Avoid areas that are distracting. Your area should be free of a telephone, stereo or television, and friends/roommates.

, Do this by dividing your work into small range goals.Try to study in one hour intervals with short breaks in between.
The average person can pay attention for approximately 45 minutes, so spend that amount of time preparing for your test and the last 15 minutes of your hour reviewing what you have just studied.

, You will retain material better if you have enough sleep.


Seven to eight hours of sleep per night is ideal for adults.
While it is tempting to cram for an exam or pull an all-nighter, you will retain information more efficiently if you budget your time and get enough rest.
Set a time to go to bed and wake up and stick to it.

, This is a method of note-taking that takes a ""do it once"" approach. Use a large, loose leaf notebook. Only write on one side of the paper, so you can spread your notes out in a map later.
Draw a line 2.5 inches from the left side of your paper. This area will be the recall column, where you can add terms and notes for studying.
During lecture take notes about general ideas, skip lines to show the ends of concepts, use abbreviations to save time, and write legibly.
After lecture, review your notes and use the recall column to dot down ideas and key words that are easy for you to recall. When studying, you can use these as your study guide.

, Teachers usually emphasize many things they have discussed in class, and these things usually appear in tests.


Pay attention to large topics covered in class.
If your teacher has provided a study guide, you will need to review notes about each of the topics on the guide.
Think about what kinds of questions where on previous exams. What kinds of problems, essays, or vocabulary questions were asked?

, These will help you recall important concepts and keywords.


Start with material you want to learn best.
Begin with larger general ideas and boil them down into more detailed aspects.
While reviewing, make note of any discrepancies in your notes or any questions you have. Address these with your teacher before your exam.

, These can help show the direction of a collection of steps or related concepts.


Sometimes it helps to organize your ideas visually.
For questions where you have to outline a process, a flow chart is a good tool to use.
If you think you might be asked compare/contrast questions, a Venn diagram can help you outline the similarities and differences between two concepts.

, You will need to know meanings of scientific terminology for a science exam.


Make flash cards to help you recall these.
Have a science dictionary handy to look up words you don't remember and don't have in your notes.
You can study vocabulary using your flash cards or notes when you have a spare 15 minutes. Waiting at the doctors office or for the bus, for example, is a good time where you can study these.

, Relate what you learn to practical daily life and what you already know.


Science is a very practical subject with many areas of practical applications.
Making such connections will make the material relevant to you and easier to recall.
This can be a very personalized way for you to remember material if you can relate the subject to your own personal interests.

, This allows you to quickly assess what is in the chapter or article and what information is most important.Read the title first to help your mind prepare for the subject.
Read the introduction or summary. Focus on the author's statement of the most important points.
Notice each boldface heading and subheading. These help you break up the information into important subtopics.
Notice any graphics. These should not be overlooked. Many times, pictures or charts can be replicated for your notes and can be handy tools for recalling information.
Notice reading aids. These are bold faced type, italics, and end of chapter questions. These will show you what points are emphasized in the chapter and can help you recognize keywords and key concepts.

, Turn the boldfaced heading of each section of a chapter into as many questions as you think will be address in that section.The better your questions, the better your comprehension of the material will be.
When your mind is actively searching for answers to your questions, you will comprehend and retain the information you are reading more effectively.

, Keep your questions in mind as you go along.Look for the answers of your questions in the text and make notes of your answers in a notebook.
If you are finding that your questions aren't answered, make new ones and re-read the section again.

, You should do this after each time you finish re-reading a section of your textbook chapter.Reciting concepts, ideas, and answers to your own questions enhances your comprehension of the materials.
See if you can answer the questions you made from memory. If not, refer back to the text. Repeat until you can recall the answers to your review questions.

, See if you can answer all the review questions you made for the chapter.If you can't remember all the answers to the questions you made, then go back and find the answers and review that section again.
Go over your questions several times at the end of a chapter for reinforcement.

, You may encounter math/science related problems on your exam.


Textbooks often provide very good practice problems to work through. They usually have an answer key in the back so you can check your answers.
Chances are if there are detailed problems and and answers in your textbook, you are likely to encounter similar questions on your exam.
Compare the problems with those your teacher has provided on worksheets or in notes. See if there are any differences in how problems are phrased or written between your textbook and other materials.

, You may have to know keywords for your test.


Make flashcards with science words and definitions. You can practice these when you have a free 15 minutes.
Make sure your textbook and notes match for the correct definition of vocabulary terms.
Ask your teacher for clarification if you don't understand a term.

Make flash cards.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Quiz yourself.",How to Study for a Quiz1," Create flash cards by hand or online. Whatever method you use, however, make sure that you create your own flash cards. Creating your own flash cards creates neural pathways. These neural pathways will help you retrieve the important information you learned at a later date.Make your flash cards by writing down key concepts and ideas on one side, and the answers on the other side.
Mix pictures with words on your flash cards.
Study your flash cards in small 15 to 20-minute sessions.;
, Acronyms and mnemonic devices are a great way to memorize difficult information. String together words to make a memorable phrase or sentence. Each word in the phrase should start with the letter of the piece of information you are trying to remember.For example, the phrase “Never eat shredded wheat” is used by students to remember the order north, east, south, and west appear on a compass.

, Test your knowledge by reviewing the practice quizzes at the end of each chapter of your textbook. Review the information that you got wrong on the practice quizzes. Re-take the practice quizzes until you get every answer correctIf your textbook doesn’t provide practice quizzes, then create your own. Create open-ended questions based off of your notes and the textbook. Open-ended questions will force you to write out your answers, which will help you retrieve and apply your knowledge during the quiz.
Alternatively, have a friend create a practice quiz for you.

This method is to applied when you have sufficient time to read before the open book exam.,
Start studying for exams beforehand as open book exams are all about how you retrieve or apply a concept and thus don’t expect to find quick answers by reading the book or notes during the open book exam as your time will be limited.

,
Collect your Resources: Get your textbook, related reference materials and class notes (if you have any).,
Familiarize the Test Portion: Know your syllabus and tick the chapters for the exam.,
Start Preparing: Now you will find the textbook easier to read and you can skim through it and can focus on doing problems.,
Organize your knowledge: Similarly study for other chapters and write down important points from both slides and book in pictorial manner (you can also include page numbers for key words).,
Now your chapter maps and mind is organized enough to write an open book exam.

",How to Study for a Bookkeeping Exam1," The method emphasis the fact that open book exams are not the same as ordinary closed book exams and thus would require a different study approach. Here are the steps that will guide you to prepare when you have sufficient time before the exam.;
,, If your teacher uses slides to teach than get your subject slides too to read. (A Computer will be required to read the slides or any other thing that can read slides/presentations)

, Now start with first chapter, Break up the chapter into co-headings. Now go through your slides for the first chapter in a quick succession and note down important formulas or points in pictorial manner and in compact fashion so that you can easily revise and remember things positioning. You can also underline the important concepts and theories in the textbook for easy retrieval during revising. Maintain a notes book to note these down and number each page number which will help you when you create the easy retrieval guide index.

, Try remembering important formulas and concepts as it’s always good to remember then just noting them down as it gives you a time advantage during the exams as you no longer have to search for the formulas and concepts. Practice by questioning yourself of what possible questions could be asked and how you would interpret it. Note down your mistakes to avoid them during the exam. Note down your mistakes, possible questions and interpretations in your notes book to get an advantage during the exam.

, Maintain an easy retrieval guide index for easy accessing of concepts and formulas during the exam. Here is how to make an easy retrieval guide index:


Firstly write the chapter name and number. Under the heading write down the important concepts and formulas and index the page numbers where they are available. This will allow a quick retrieval during exams.
You can distinguish between concepts, headings, subheadings and formulas by designating some symbols to them which in turn will allow a quick specific retrieval. For example formulas can be given a star symbol and concepts can be given a flag symbol.
Also index the Page numbers of notebook pages under the respective subject headings and write the page numbers in a different colored pen to help you realize that the point is present in your notes that you created. You can put a cross symbol besides the mistakes or possible danger points in your notes to help you stay alert on not making mistakes.

"
Review your study materials.,
Study in advance.,
Discuss the information.",How to Study for a Quiz2," Don’t just go over your study materials once, but three or four times. Repetition is key here. Review the information until you have grasped the important concepts.For example, if you made flash cards, review these once a day for a week before your quiz day. As you review your flash cards, repeat important concepts and dates out loud.

, Try not to wait until the last minute to study for your quiz. Study at least one week in advance. This way, you have enough time to review your notes and flash cards more than once. It will also give you time to ask your teacher questions to clarify concepts you don’t fully understand.For example, if you have a quiz on Tuesday, begin reviewing your notes and creating flash cards the Tuesday before.

, Discuss the information you are learning with friends or family members. Story telling can be very useful here. By presenting the information to your friends in the form of a story, you will connect the information with visual imagery. This will help you recall important information during the quiz.If you need to learn about an important person for your quiz, for example, then tell your friends an exciting story about the person.

"

Find a quiet place.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Review your material before sleeping.",How to Study for a Quiz3," Investigate multiple places to see if they suit your studying needs. The area you choose should be in a quiet place, and away from loud, central gathering areas, like the kitchen table or living room. Finding a study area that you can rely on is also important because studying in the same place every day will improve your concentration.Developing the habit of studying in the same, quiet place at the same time every day will improve your concentration significantly.

, Playing games online, surfing the web, texting, and checking your social media accounts are distractions that have nothing to do with studying. Put unnecessary materials, like phones and computers, away when studying for your quiz. Only bring your basic studying materials with you, like your notes, textbook, flash cards, paper, and pens.If you take notes on your computer, print out your notes before you begin studying.

, Before lying down to sleep, review the toughest material the night before the quiz. This will make it easier to recall the information the next day during the quiz. Try to get a good night’s rest, as well.Make sure you get at least seven hours of sleep the night before the quiz.

Collect your Resources: Get your textbook, related reference materials and class notes (if you have any).,
Familiarize the Test Portion: Know your syllabus and tick the chapters for the exam.,
Start Reading (R): Start reading your slides and notes to get a brief review about the concepts and formulas involved.,
Take Notes (N): Here notes’ taking is very much different from the one in Method-1.,
Revise (R): Now as you have organized your preparation, simply workout the old or previous year question papers.",How to Study for a Bookkeeping Exam2," Though this method doesn’t allow a full throttle performance that you could have achieved by Method-1, but still we will help you prepare for the best in a short amount of time. In this method we will be using a R-N-I-R approach.(Read-Note-Index-Revise)

, If your teacher uses slides to teach than get your subject slides too to read. (A Computer will be required to read the slides or any other thing that can read slides/presentations)

, Check out the syllabus and consult your friends and teachers about chapters which are the most important to know for the exam. Prioritize your chapters based on their importance for the exam and start with the one at the top. Anyhow we will be reading all chapters so you need not worry much about prioritizing while reading, but this will help when it comes to revising as you never know what can happen in an open book exam.

, After this you’ll have an idea on what the subjects are about. Now go to your textbook and just skim for the important points and mark them. Books usually contain lots of explanations and stories so skimming is a good idea in order to save time.

, In this step write down the summary of the chapters in a pictorial manner along with the page numbers if possible which will in turn become the Indexing (I) part of your preparation. Pictorial representations will simply boost your preparation and will eventually fill up the lack of preparation time.

, While a maintaining an exam environment as mentioned in “Final Call” step of Method-1. Check with the solutions released with the paper. Note your weak points and eradicate them by revising them again. In case you missed something in your Indexing then do note them after the trial test while studying. Reevaluate your performance and preparation by writing more such trial open book exams.

Ask your teacher about the nature of the exam.,
Start off with a positive attitude.,
Use memory games.,
Test yourself frequently.,
Take breaks and reward yourself.",How to Study for a Big Test1," This will help you direct your studies logically. If it's an essay exam, for example, you may want to write practice essays. If it's multiple choice, you may want to test yourself before the exam. If your teacher has not explained his or her format, it's perfectly acceptable to ask about the format at some point during class., You want to go into studying feeling positive. A good attitude can help you keep up your stamina throughout the studying process. It can also set the tone for a productive studying session.Think positive. Remind yourself of your skills and abilities. Think of studying as a way to build up your skill set and learn more.
Avoid catastrophic thinking when studying. Try not to engage in thoughts such as, ""I should have started studying earlier. What's wrong with me?"" Instead, think something like, ""I wish I started studying a little earlier, but it's okay. I'm still on track to succeed.""
Do not compare yourself to others when studying. Keep the focus on yourself and your abilities rather than comparing yourself to others in your class.

, Memory games can be an effective means to memorize difficult information. You can, for example, make up a sentence to help you remember a list or equation. A common memory game is the sentence, ""Every Good Boy Deserves Fun."" This helps students remember the five notes in treble clef (EGBDF). See if you can come up with similar memory games on your own., This is far more effective than simply re-reading the textbook. As you study, find ways to test yourself on the information. This will help you retain information later in a test setting.For example, you can write down questions for yourself to answer later. If the teacher offers any practice tests, always take them.
You can also use things like flashcards to help you memorize names, dates, and vocabulary.

, No one can study for hours on end without a break. You will study far more effectively if you give yourself breaks and rewards throughout the studying process.Take short breaks to do something you enjoy. For example, after 50 minutes of studying, you can allow yourself to go on Facebook for 10 minutes.
Reward yourself. You'll be more motivated to get through a study session if you reward yourself with, say, a slice of pizza afterwards.

Grade your example test questions and identify any gaps in your knowledge.,
Have a study partner quiz you on the key points the day before the test.",How to Study for a Science Test," A free study option is always a study area in your school library, where you can be surrounded by other students who are focused and diligently working on their own study materials. Many school libraries will have quiet areas or zones for studying and encourage students to use the school space to prepare for tests.If you are planning to study with a partner, you may be able to book a private study room where you can discuss the test and share review materials. This will ensure you can talk to your study partner without disturbing anyone around you. Talk to the circulation desk at your library about booking a study room or look at your school’s library website for more information on booking a study room.;
, If you prefer to study in the cozy atmosphere of a nearby coffee shop, be sure to bring headphones with you. They may come in handy if you are around people who are talking loudly or having a conversation close to you that is distracting.


Some coffee shops are known for their quiet environment, especially if they are located on school campus and are frequented by many students. Consider choosing a coffee shop that is known for its student friendly atmosphere, rather than a coffee shop that is loud, bustling, and often crowded. This will ensure you will be able to get work done without being constantly interrupted or distracted by noise and chatter around you.

, Some students prefer to study in the comfort of their home in their bedroom or in a room in the house that is free of distractions. You may want to set the scene if you are studying at home to make it the most study friendly.This could include telling everyone in the house that you are studying and shutting the door. Or, you could turn off any distractions, like the television, a radio, or your cellphone, and place them out of reach. This could then help you to focus on studying for the science test.
While it may be tempting to lie in bed as you study, data has shown that studying in bed can lead to distraction and difficulty turning off your brain when it’s time to go to bed. Instead, study at a desk in your room with a desk lamp so you get enough light and can focus on your study materials.

, Good class notes from your teacher’s lectures and class discussions can be great study tools for tests and exams. Look over your class notes and check if there are incomplete sentences or any confusing statements. Clarify anything you missed in class or are still confused about with your teacher so you can better prepare for the upcoming test. If you have an incomplete chemistry formula written down, for example, you should clarify the complete formula with your teacher or a peer.Focus on recent class notes, especially the notes made in your most recent class, as they will likely contain important information you can use to prepare for the test. One of the best ways to make your class notes more instructive is to use visual diagrams and representations, such as the scientific process of condensation. Drawing out scientific processes can help you to better visualize them and remember them later.

, Use a highlighter to go through your class notes and identify any key points that seem relevant to the test. Marking important concepts with a highlighter will allow you to easily scan your notes and digest complex information through the key details or points.For example, you may have notes of the process of condensation from your chemistry class or notes on the digestive system from your biology class. These processes can be detailed and contain a lot of information that can be challenging to remember. Using a highlighter to identify key points can help you to focus on the most important details in the process without getting overwhelmed by information.
In your notes on the process of condensation, for example, you may start with a definition of condensation: “The process of changing water vapor in the air into liquid water.” Rather than highlight the entire sentence, you may highlight the terms “water vapor” “air” and “liquid water”. This will help you remember the key terms of the definition so you can recall it easily when you take the test., Your teacher may provide a guide for the test that contains example questions or a list of key points that are going to be on the test. Make sure you have a copy of the study guide and use it when preparing for the test.You should clarify the form of the test, such as multiple choice, short answer, or true/false. The form of the test will then help you better prepare for the test. If the test is multiple choice or true/false, you may want to focus on memorizing key definitions, examples, and concepts. If the test is short answer, you may want to practice writing out short answers that explain key definitions and concepts.
An example study guide for a test on condensation, for example, may contain questions like, “What is the process of condensation?” “How is condensation different from evaporation?” “How can we demonstrate condensation in an experiment?” Though these questions may not be the exact ones used on the test, they will likely point to key concepts or points that you should study in preparation for the test.

, Flashcards can be useful for studying difficult concepts, especially if you are trying to remember key definitions and terms. You may decide to use a color coded system to separate key definitions from key concepts and write them on different colored flashcards.


If you are creating flashcards for a test on the process of condensation, for example, you may write the definition of condensation on a green flashcard and the difference between condensation and evaporation on a yellow flashcard. You may then write the definition for evaporation on a green flashcard and the use of a pressure temperature graph on a yellow flashcard.
Separating definitions from concepts can allow you to test yourself on different things using the flashcards, but still ensure they remain separate as you review them. The color coding can also help you distinguish between a definition and a concept.

, Recent studies have shown that studying information in chunks, also known as spaced repetition, can help you to better retain information and access it later during a test. Rather than try to memorize the entire condensation process or the complete digestive process in humans, you can break up the information into smaller sections or chunks and study each section over a period of time.Break up your study materials into chunks using a highlighter or a pen. You can also cover the information around the section with a piece of blank paper so you are only focusing on the one chunk, instead of the surrounding information. This will prevent you from getting distracted and allow you to stay focused on one section at a time.

, Once you have reviewed and organized your study materials, you should create a study schedule. A study schedule will allow you plan your study time in the most efficient manner possible and avoid procrastinating or wasting time. Try to plan your study schedule at least one to two weeks before the test. This will give you more than enough time to prepare and will ensure you stick to your study schedule.The study schedule should include one to two studying methods and indicate how many hours a day you will be studying for the test. Try to plan out exactly how much time you will allot to each method and ensure you are able to cover all the information required for the test within the allot timeframe. Keep in mind most people can concentrate well for 45 minutes before losing interest or zoning out. Take breaks between study sessions if you plan to study for more than 45 minutes at a time.
For example, on Monday night, you may do a twenty minutes session using the chunking method, followed by a review of key definitions using flashcards for twenty five minutes. On Tuesday night, you may do a review of the previous night’s studying and then move on to a new section in your notes. Once you complete a twenty minute session using the chunking method on a new section, you may do another round of review of key concepts with your flashcards for twenty five minutes. You may then continue this pattern until Friday, and do a big review day on the weekend, taking breaks between study sessions so you can digest the information in your study materials.

, Once you have spent at least one week studying for the test, you should gear up for the test by doing example questions. These may be example questions created by your teacher in a study guide or you may create your own example questions.Create enough test questions to fulfill the structure of the test. For example, if your teacher tells you the test will have ten multiple choice questions total, you should create at least ten to fifteen practice multiple choice questions. If your teacher tells you there will be four true/false questions and four short answer questions, make sure your example test questions follow the same format.
For a test on the process of condensation, for example, you may create test questions that cover the major concepts and definitions for this process, such as: “What is the definition of condensation?” “How does water vapor turn into liquid water through the process of condensation?” “What is the difference between condensation and evaporation?” “What is an example experiment that illustrates the process of condensation?”

, Once you have completed the example test questions, you should look over them and grade them. You may want to enlist a study partner to grade your example test questions for you, such as a peer or a family member. If you are studying with a peer in a study group, exchange test questions with them so you can grade each other.When you grade your test questions, note any questions that you got wrong or could not answer. These gaps in your knowledge can be helpful to identify, as you can then focus on filling these gaps when you review your study materials again.

, To boost your confidence and ensure you do not have any lingering gaps in your knowledge, have a study partner quiz you using example questions. If you don’t have a peer nearby, ask a family member, a friend, or a spouse to act as your tester.Have your study partner read the questions out loud and then respond to the questions out loud. Vocalizing your answers can help you to remember them better and ensure your brain is full of relevant information that will help you ace your science test.

Make studying a priority.,
Put the test into perspective.,
Confide in others.,
Be proactive about dealing with setbacks.",How to Study for a Big Test2," Do not put off studying. This will only make the exam more stressful. You will better retain information if you space out your studying over a period of weeks. In the weeks leading up the exam, make sure that you make studying a priority.Study a little bit each day. Stick to brief 20 to 50 minute study sessions in the weeks leading up to the exam.
Review your notes after class. Read over your notes right after class or at least on the same day that you took them. This will help you better remember information you learned during lectures.

, It's important to know what the stakes are. You want to understand how serious the exam is, and how much it will affect your final grade. However, try not to let the serious nature of the exam overwhelm you.If you need to pass the test to pass the course, then it is understandable that you might be feeling worried. However, keep in mind that if you do not pass the exam, then retaking the course is still an option.
Try your best, but understand you may not do as well on the exam as you hoped. A grade that's less than perfect might be upsetting, but remember that it is not the end of the world. You can always learn from the grade and set a goal to do better on your next exam.

, It's a bad idea to keep any stress you're having bottled up. If you're nervous about an exam, let friends and family members know. Venting can help you get stress out of your system.Are you close to other students in your class? If so, talk over your concerns about the test with them. It's likely that other people are dealing with the same levels of stress and may be able to relate.
Vent to your close friends and family members. These people can support you as you prepare for the exam, and may even have solid suggestions for coping.

, If you're struggling with test materials, it's important not to panic. For example, if you are struggling to understand an equation that will be on a math exam, then beating yourself up will only make it worse. Instead of flying into panic mode, be proactive. Seek help to overcome this setback.Talk to your teacher, a tutor, or other students. Find someone who can help you address the issue and receive a good grade on the exam.
Deal with the issue head on. Panic and avoidance are unlikely to help with your stress level.

Find a productive study spot.,
Vary your study spots.,
Minimize distractions.,
Arrange your notes by topics.,
Create an outline of your notes.",How to Study for a Big Test3," You will want to stake out a few study spots you can come to as you prepare. Figure out what to look for when you're seeking out a space to study.Look for a quiet area that's free of outside distractions. Your dorm room, for example, may be a poor spot to study as you'll be tempted by your television, computer, and other entertainment devices.
Look for quiet spots away from loud noises. Is there a quiet coffee shop on campus? Is there a place in the library that's somewhat removed? You don't want to try to study in a place that may be interrupted by loud noises and gatherings.

, You should not study in the same spot every day. It can be draining to stay in the same spot for hours on end. You may retain more information if you break up study sessions between multiple study spots.Pick several suitable places to study, whether at home, around town, or on your campus.
Switch up where you go to study. Try a different spot every day or every few days. You can even change study spots in the middle of a session if you begin to feel restless.
Changing your study spot may actually help you better retain information. Your brain may learn to associate material with a particular environment if you only study in one place. You may have trouble remembering that information after leaving that location.

, Many people feel they study more effectively with music in the background, or while periodically texting friends. This is actually not the case. You’re far more likely to retain information if you study without outside distractions.Do not bring any materials you don't need to a study session. If you don't need your laptop, for example, leave it at home. It may be a good idea to leave your cell phone behind or at least power it down while you study.
Study groups can be effective, but if you choose to study with friends, pick friends who are focused. Do not study with friends who are likely to distract you.

, You will retain information better if you study it in a logical fashion. People tend to learn best if they study from concept to detail. Break your notes up into the different concepts they cover.For example, if you're studying for an English exam, organize your notes by different genres of literature or fields of literary study.
Do not jump in and try to remember every detail of a poem. Instead, learn the overarching ideas of a particular school of thought and then learn the specific ideas of different literary scholars.

, This can help you have an overview on hand to guide your studies. Once your notes are arranged in a logical fashion, read through them. Highlight and underline important details and make a brief outline reviewing the notes you took throughout the semester.You can outline your notes based on major topics. In a big lecture class, it's not uncommon for the professor to discuss a major idea over the course of many class periods.
You can also work on circling, highlighting, or underlining any information you'll need to have memorized. This includes things like names, dates, and vocabulary terms. You can write down this information on a separate piece of paper and use it to make note cards or flashcards later on.

"
"
Create a schedule that's doable for you.,
Study in 20 to 50 minute increments.,
Target different material in each session.,
Keep up with other aspects of your daily schedule.",How to Study for a Big Test4," It is important to be consistent with your studying, so make a schedule you can reasonably stick to. If you just plan on studying every day, then you may struggle to actually find the time. Look over your daily obligations and find pockets of time when you can reasonably study.Avoid cramming. You never want to end up cramming for a test at the last minute because you will not be able to cover everything you need to know in a short space of time. You won’t remember as much information from cramming either. In the weeks leading up to the test, make time to study so you do not end up having to cram for the test.
Look for free time during your day. Maybe you have a break between classes from noon to 3 each day. You could spend an hour during this time studying. Look at your weekends as well. If you like going out on weekend nights, maybe you could plan to study for a couple of hours every morning.
Write up a schedule for yourself and stick to it. If you study a little each day, you won't be overwhelmed when the big test arrives.

, Studying for hours on end can make you burn out. Instead of large study sessions, break up sessions into manageable chunks.Break up your study time into 20 to 50 minute sessions. Take short 5 to 10 minute breaks in between sessions.
Set a timer for yourself and follow this routine strictly. If you study for long periods of time, you're much less likely to retain the information you've learned.

, You do not want to study one subject for an entire study session. If you plan to study for a few hours, move between different topics and materials during this time.For example, you might start your study session by re-reading a short story for a test in your English class and then read over your notes on a poem that will also be on the test.


On a test, you will never know what kind of materials you will be presented with. You may have to switch between one subject and another quickly.
If you switch up what you study during study sessions, this closer matches the environment of an exam. It also prevents you from burning out on a certain subject.

, Do not neglect basic care when studying. People do better on exams if they are eating right, exercising, and getting adequate sleep.Add exercise to your daily routine. Aerobic exercise may improve brain processing, so make time in your day to go for a walk, take a bike ride, or do a workout video.
Make sure to get enough sleep each night. Studying when tired, or taking an exam when tired, can diminish your grades. Teens need 8 to 10 hours of sleep a night, while young adults need 7 to 9.Eat right in the weeks leading up to an exam. A diet in healthy fruits, vegetables, fats, and proteins will give your brain and body the fuel necessary for success.

Understand exactly what you will be tested on.,
Study in advance.,
Gather any materials you have for review and study.,
Try to study at the same time every day, and in blocks of time that will be similar to the test.",How to Study for a Leadership Exam1," If you are completing a leadership class, the exam will likely cover what you learned in class. If you are taking a leadership exam for education credentials, your state will provide test criteria.;
, You do not want to cram the night before the leadership exam. Spend at least a few weeks preparing for the test.

,


Organize your notes, handouts, books and other materials that may have been provided when you registered for the leadership exam or took classes that led up to the exam.

, For example, if the leadership exam is 3 hours long, set aside 3 hours a few days every week to study.

"
"
Look for study guides provided by the testing administrator.,
Take sample tests.,
Use flashcards.,
Study in groups.",How to Study for a Leadership Exam2," The test administrator will often provide tutorials and other preparation materials.

, Review leadership exams from previous years and take a practice test if one is available. Many will include actual questions, correct answers and scores.


Try to take a practice test before you begin the process of studying. That way, you will be able to identify the areas of the test where you really need help.

, Many people learn by using flashcards to test themselves on concepts and questions that they will need to answer on the leadership exam.


Write the question on one side of a large note card, and a brief answer on the other side. As you study, pull out one flashcard at a time to test yourself.

, Some people study better with others.


Get together with others taking the exam and talk about your areas of strength and weakness. You can help each other better understand and prepare for the parts of the test that most intimidating.

Remember to take frequent breaks while you study.,
Listen to music while you study, if that helps you.",How to Study for a Leadership Exam3,", It is easier to remember the specifics once you have mastered the larger ideas.

, Summarizing what you review will help you remember what you know at exam time.

, Get up and walk around once in a while, and go outside for some fresh air.


Stay hydrated while you study and have snacks that are high in protein and complex carbohydrates. Try fruit, peanut butter or nuts to keep your brain energized.

, Keep the volume low and listen to something that soothes or motivates you.

"
"
Focus on hypothetical situations.,
Prepare for questions on orientation and training.,
Explain your theory on how to develop people.",How to Study for a Leadership Exam4," Your leadership exam will require you to state how you would respond to specific problems. For example, determine how you would create a positive culture in a negative environment.

, For example, be ready to answer how you would orient a new teacher in a school or raise the performance levels of a teacher who is struggling.

, In addition to answering multiple choice questions, you will need to write short essays on topics such as development, leadership and education.


Be specific when you practice your essays, but write within the time and word count limit.

Determine what banking information you will be required to know understand.,
Understand how the test will be organized.,
Consider purchasing a study guide.,
Use good study habits.,
Ask others to quiz you.,
Keep a cool head.",How to Study for a Banking Exam,"


Most banking exams are not designed to require test takers to understand and be familiar with all processes and procedures of a bank, but rather to focus on one or two specific areas. Narrowing the scope of material with which you will need to become familiar--for example, taxation--can make studying for a banking exam much more manageable.
Many banking professionals become certified through the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency. This agency requires bankers to pass exams which focus on investment procedures and protocols. If you are interested in becoming ""FINRA"" certified, familiarizing yourself with these processes is essential.;
,


No matter what banking subject matter you will be tested on, the organization of the test will be quite similar. Banking tests are typically divided into sections which evaluate your general awareness, reasoning, and objective skills.

,


You may want to consider buying a study guide to aid in your test preparation once you have identified what material you will be tested on. Other employees at the financial institution where you work may be willing to sell you their study guide if they have already taken the particular exam.
If you are unable to find a study guide to buy or borrow from someone you know, you may be able to find one for sale on the Internet. In addition, colleges, universities, and other institutions of higher learning may sell study guides in their bookstore or provide them for use in the library.

,


Banking exams are not as challenging if you spread out the material you need to learn or review over several days. In contrast, trying to memorize large amounts of new material the night before a banking exam can be stressful and hamper your concentration and ability to do well on the test. Set aside at least 30 minutes each night for a week or two before the banking exam to prepare. Each night, review what you learned the day before, to further cement the information in your head.

,


Work with others who have already taken and passed the same exam. Once you feel you have a solid grip on the material, ask them to sit down with you and quiz you on various topics.
Ask these individuals about what they recall when they took the banking exam. Determining what style of questions (short answer, oral, or multiple choice) are on the test can make a big difference when it comes to preparing for any test.

,


For best results when studying for a banking exam, try to keep a cool head. Stressing or worrying about your success or failure will not be beneficial in the long run. Instead, focus on learning the required material as well as you possibly can.

Quiz each other.",How to Study a Week Before an Exam," If you still live at home with your parents, be sure there is a quiet room (your bedroom, a den or playroom) that you can use to be alone and complete your studying. Libraries, quiet coffee shops, and parks are nice locations outside of home that college students and adults (as well as older high school students) could use for studying., Think about your schedule for the week. When are you not in class? How much time is left after your other responsibilities that you can use for studying? Mark times on your calendar or planner that you will dedicate to studying for your exam, and be sure not to wait until the last minute., If you are extremely busy with non-school responsibilities, then you may have to actually shift some other responsibilities to a later time (like the week after the exam) or ask for help from others so that you allow yourself enough time to study. If you have other class assignments due before the test, be sure to make studying for the test a priority, especially if the exam will be worth more for your grade than the other assignments., Keep your textbook, notes from class, and notes you’ve taken outside of class all together. Know what is going to be on the test by paying attention to what the teacher says in class, and prepare for what to study accordingly., This is especially important if you live with others or have responsibilities such as your own family to care for. Designate certain times for studying, and send out a type of “do not disturb” message to the people you have daily contact with. This way, they know to give you space and not disrupt you while you are studying.

, If your teacher has given you a study guide, this is great news! Read it carefully. If you have time, read it again. And again. If it is a study guide with questions, be sure you answer all of the questions. Most likely, the material in the study guide is what will be on the test., If the type of exam you’re studying for is a big general one (like for a certification or license, or college admission – such as the SATs or PRAXIS) instead of for a specific class, then you should be able to find practice tests on the web or available for sale. It’s definitely worth your time to use these and take notes based on questions you have trouble with, so you can focus your study sessions on topics you need to review more., If you’re about to read something new, or to start reviewing, it’s important for you to get your brain ready. There are several important ways to do this:


Scanning. Flip through what you’re supposed to read and look at headings, pictures, charts, diagrams, and/or bolded words.
Make predictions. After scanning through some assigned reading material, make some predictions about what you will be learning. What is this going to be about?

, You should have a mission when you read. Find out from the teacher what you’re supposed to be looking for or figuring out while reading. If you have been given a study guide, pay attention to the reading portions and give those most of your attention.


For older students, the purpose may be left up to you to determine. Determine what the purpose for the reading is before you begin., If you are allowed to (some public schools don’t allow writing in the textbooks), you should highlight or circle and underline phrases and words that stand out to them and write questions and notes in the margins.


Another way for you to be able to mark the text without marking up public textbooks are to make photocopies of stories or sections of the text. , While reading, make connections between the text and yourself (This reminds me of the time that I…), or the text and another text (This reminds me of this other book…), or between the text and the world (This sounds like what happens when…).


Making connections is extremely important for long-term remembering of what you read in a text. , After reading, you should ask yourself, what’s the gist of what I read? Jot down notes of the most important parts of what they read, such as the main idea and some supporting details., Reflect on what you have read. Look over your highlights, the pictures and headings in the text again. Take notes in class that are in your own words.


Writing notes in your own words is very important, both for comprehension and to avoid plagiarism in on the test., For memorizing vocabulary definitions, math formulas, or important dates, make some flash cards with index cards or pieces of paper. You can quickly look at them for review, and simply making them will also help you to remember the important points., A good memorization technique is to use one of these devices for the answers of your review questions. Musically inclined students may find it helpful to make up a rhyme or song to memorize information.


A mnemonic device is any memory association tool you use to help yourself remember something; the most common kind is a name mnemonic such as ROY G BIV for the colors of the rainbow (Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet) , Sometimes studying with a large group can be more distracting than it is helpful. But, talking about test material out loud is a very helpful way to remember information. If you hear information and talk about it, you’re more likely to remember it.


Make sure you choose one friend who is motivated to study, who hopefully understands the material, and who you feel comfortable talking with about the test material., Have conversations with your friend about what each of you remembers from studying on your own, and try to “teach” each other what you each remember. Doing this will help you to better recall what you studied while you’re taking the test. Also, your friend may remember some things that you had forgotten about before talking with them., If you’re not sure about what something your friend said means, ask about it. Keep asking questions until you understand it. Relate what you know already to what your friend is saying, and have a conversation about the test material. Figuring out what to stay focused on together will be helpful for the both of you., Take turns asking each other questions from the study guide, flash cards, or your notes. The person answering the questions should try to answer without looking at their own notes. This can be a great way to review, and you’ll each be glad you spent the time on this after you get your good scores back!"

Look at it.",How to Stick to Your Study Schedule1," Why do I want to create a study schedule? What are my grades? Would a schedule help me? Those are very important questions that you NEED to ask yourself. Write them down and answer them. Put them somewhere near so you will always be reminding yourself of those D's and F's and turn them into A's and B's.;
, You don't need to spend half of your day with your head in the books, just a nice amount for you to have good grades. You can do this so:


Write down all of your subjects that you need to study on a daily basis
For each subject, write how many times a week you'll study it, and how much time you'll spend on it that day. For example, if you just want to go over some stuff in your History class write 3x a week for 20 minutes. Now count all the time together and divide by 7 (exam. 14 hours : 7 is 2 hours daily) and that's how much time you'll need to study per day.

, It will probably be really hard to study for 5 or 6 hours daily so try to reduce the amount of study time if you know you won't do it. You may also consider getting help, like joining a small study group or getting a tutor. If you don't have a study group at your school, you can make one. .


Also ask a smart kid in your Math class to help you with Geometry if that's your problem. And if nobody wants to help you, you can get a tutor as I mentioned before: https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Tutor .In those cases you will need to study so you will stick to them and a study schedule will be used only for refreshing what you've learned in class.

, Try to make it on thick paper so it won't just rip apart. Also, make it very appealing. Decorate it with colorful paper and cut out small shapes. Write days of the week and names of the subjects in sparkly colors and just make it perfect for you. Maybe you like it in black and white, purple and green, gold and orange - YOUR CHOICE!

, Are you happy with your schedule? There is still time to change the amount of study time and the look of it. Otherwise you can start the studying!

"
"
Start studying.,
Think about when you can and can not study.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Reward yourself!,
Don't forget about your social life.,
Enjoy your new, fresh, amazing grades and not to mention the happiness of your parents.",How to Stick to Your Study Schedule2," The best way to stick to start studying. If you do so you will feel very proud, but also find out your weak points.

, If you're studying for an English test, but you know that there is a new episode of The Big Bang Theory on, what will you do? Probably turn on the TV and say that you can study later, or just think to yourself that you can multitask and end up just watching the show. So choose your time wisely!

, Turn off your phone and put it in another room so you don't get tempted to check Ethan's Facebook status or text Stacy and Jenna. Don't study in front of a turned OFF computer because it's just a temptation for your personal business.


If you need to study on the computer, make a promise to not go on YouTube, Facebook or post a Twitter status saying : ""Uggghh studying!!!! :'("" because... Just don't!
Also, if you like studying with music, don't. You'll end up singing and dancing, which does not count as studying. Ask your family members to leave you alone for an amount of time, and say that you're busy if anyone calls you.

, If you spent three hours a day studying for a big test, don't feel bad making yourself a nice hot chocolate with tiny marshmallows, lying in a comfy couch, wrapped in your favorite cozy blanket watching Orange is the new black. If you're a girl and you Aced that Math exam, give yourself a manicure or have a Spa day at your own home. If you're a guy and you just got an A in History and English, invite a buddy over and you two can watch the game together. Or just eat. It's basically the same if it's delicious, right?

, Believe it or not, you can have both. After you've done your homework you can go out shopping with your friends or play a game of soccer. If your assignment is nicely done, resting on your desk, go and have a sleepover with your bestie or go to the cinema. If you don't like that kind of stuff you can exercise in your free time. Good grades and a hot body? Well don't mind me!

, Just follow all the steps and you are guaranteed to get better in school.

Learn to pay attention to the time.,
Distribute your time across the exam.,
Try to complete the questions you know well before the stipulated time.,
Be attentive while writing the exam.,
Allow yourself a cooling time before starting the exam.,
Remember to revise the answers.",How to Score Well in Competitive Exams," Time management is the key to covering the ground in any kind of examination effectively. While writing a competitive examination, be more careful with your time. After allocating a bit of time for revising, distribute the rest of the time to the questions to be answered.
, Don't allocate more time to any of the questions than is needed. If you are not getting the answers even after the stipulated time suitable for that question, don't spend any more time on that question; instead, move on. Proceed to the next question and remember to come back if you have time., That way you will have more time for questions covering subject-matter you are less familiar with. Always follow the pattern of answering the questions that you know really well first, then proceeding to the questions that you don't know that well., Take care when answering multiple questions. Most often the competitive exams contain multiple choice questions. You need to be extra careful while answering multiple choice questions. Read the questions thoroughly, taking care to not miss important points.

Read through the options. Select the one which is the most apt. Sometimes options are given in such a way that two of the options may look similar. In that case, be sure to choose the correct one, knowing that the similarity is on purpose. Take extra care while choosing such an option.

, Go back through all the questions after completing the exam. That way, you can decide which questions should be answered first and how much time needs to be spend on each article., Though you have carefully answered the questions, faults may occur. The final half hour of the exam should be dedicated to revising the answers. Look if you have missed any of the questions that you know."

, Like on the bus, the car on the way there, or even at homeroom before you get to that subject. If the subject is after lunch then eat your lunch then study outside or in the bathroom

, If you don't get one, then just skip to the other one. Then come back to it.,"

Do not forget the writing sample.,

Practice for at least fifty hours.,
Schedule the test appropriately.,
Show up prepared.,
Start with the easier questions.,
Give the proper amount of time to each question.,
Do not leave any empty bubbles.",How to Score Higher on the LSAT," The format and types of questions on the LSAT aren’t a secret, and you can familiarize yourself with what to expect. The LSAT is comprised of five sets of multiple-choice questions, separated into 35-minute sections.At the end of these sections, a final 35-minute section goes toward a writing sample, which isn’t scored but is sent along with your LSAT score to each law school to which you apply.One of the five multiple-choice sections isn’t scored either, but this section mostly includes newer questions, which the governing LSAT board tries out for future iterations of the test.;
, The LSAT doesn’t actually measure knowledge of law proceedings but merely the types of skills necessary to succeed in law school. The three major types of multiple-choice questions on the LSAT include:Reading comprehension questions - These measure your ability to comprehend complex texts with accuracy while drawing conclusions from the content.
Analytical reasoning questions - These questions test your ability to comprehend the relationships between certain objects and to draw rational conclusions from the structure of those relationships.
Logical reasoning questions - These questions measure your ability to analyze and evaluate ordinary-language arguments, as well as your ability to complete them.

, The Law School Admission Council (LSAC) is the body that administers the LSAT, and they offer a free online sample test, which you can find here.This sample test is the actual LSAT from June of 2007, so you can see the exact types of questions you can expect.Don’t panic if you do poorly and run out of time on your first sample test. This is normal.
Other sample tests are available online and through official LSAT testing centers. You should also look into these tests, so you can take several with fresh questions that you don’t already know.

, The LSAT is a test of time management on the questions just as much as it is in logic and comprehension. Finding the strategy for questions that both maximizes correct answers and time efficiency is essential. Try different ways of approaching the different sections to find out what works best for you.


For example, when it comes to the long texts in the reading comprehension sections, some students prefer to closely read the text before reading the questions, whereas other students prefer to read the questions associated with the text before reading it., You can find numerous logic puzzle tests online and in official LSAT tutoring locations to help develop skills related to the analytical and logical reasoning sections of the LSAT. Practice these often in addition to the examples you see on the practice tests.

, If you’re not happy with your scores on the practice tests, then consider taking a prep course or investing in official LSAT study guides. Though these materials usually aren’t cheap, you may see substantial differences in your scores when you have some help as opposed to going it on your own.

, Though the writing sample isn’t scored as part of the actual test, it’s still submitted to law schools along with your application, and therefore, weighed in the admission process. The writing sample for the LSAT takes the form of a decision problem wherein you must choose between two courses of action or positions on an argument.The question will be formulated in a manner that makes each position defensible, so there’s no right or wrong answer, only how well you can back up the position you choose.Practice writing these types of samples with a focus on clear, concise, and precise arguments that you have organized logically.
You can find two official practice topics from LSAC here., It’s just as important to practice under the real-world conditions of the LSAT as it is to practice with accurate question types. Acing reading comprehension doesn’t do any good if you spend all 35 minutes on two questions. As you get more comfortable with the format and different question types, ensure that you hold yourself to the same time constraints as you’ll experience during the actual test., As you prepare for the LSAT, expect to give yourself a full fifty hours of study time and practice tests to prepare for the real thing., You can find the schedule of available LSAT test dates here.If you have an LSAC account, you’ll receive your score by email around three weeks after your test date, so remember to coordinate when you take the test with the due dates for applications at your respective law schools.

, As with any other test you’ve taken over the years, you’ll perform better with a full night of sleep the night before and a good breakfast the morning of the test. You can’t concentrate of long text passages and logic questions if you’re tired and/or hungry.

, Every question on the LSAT is equally weighted, and you receive points for correct answers, but you do not receive deductions for incorrect answers.On a test where a 65% puts you in the 75th percentile, this means that maximizing the number of questions you answer correctly is more important than agonizing over individual questions where you get stuck.This also means that you shouldn’t be afraid to skip questions where you get stuck and come back to them after less time-consuming ones.

, While you might not end up doing each question in order, ensure that you focus completely on each question when you get to it. Some of the questions have “trap” answer choices, which are specifically meant to be more difficult for students rushing through the test.Additionally, do not try to get creative with regard to how some of the answers could apply. Use the process of elimination for each answer, focusing on why answers are wrong rather than how they could be right., As previously stated, you are not penalized for answering a question incorrectly.This means that in the final minute of each section, you should fill in any empty bubbles from questions you skipped or haven’t gotten to.Even if you fill in ten bubbles at random, you have the odds of getting two right and potentially increasing your score by two points."

, If it's a week before the exams, aim for around 3-4 hours of good, solid revision. This means you'll have around 21-28 hours to revise in that week. If it's the night before the exams, aim for no more than 4 hours that day, so as not to stress yourself out.

This will help in interacting with others who are also planning on similar careers and thus lead to the exchange of ideas and information.;
, The quality of teachers is of utmost importance, as IELTS depends heavily on the expertise of trainers. Foreign nationals who have experience in teaching are more suited for the role as the students can imbibe the accent and pronunciations more accurately.

, The strength of the class is another consideration, as this will determine the individual attention that each student receives. An institute which has several sessions with a concentrated student group in each will be more effective in the training process.

, Moreover, some centers provide added facilities which can be very useful. These include career counseling, interactive sessions with experts from various fields, discussions with representatives of colleges, institutes and so on. While looking for an IELTS center these perks should be kept in mind.

, Location is very important. Lastly, the location of the center, the timings of classes and the expense involved are other important factors to consider, specially for those who wish to undergo training simultaneously with work, college etc. The center should be conveniently located and the timings should be such that you are able to extract maximum from the course without unnecessary stress which may have adverse effects.

Don't give up.,
Never study a day before the exam.,
Never feel nervous, stressed or tense!,
Don't stay awake all night.,
Look at the positive side of exams.,
Make sure you follow a plan, because it helps you to build your studies more effectively.,
Do not let the negative comments of other people effect you.,
Don't waste your time.,
Forget social networking site for exams.,
Don't think too much about it at the day before exams.,
Forgot all the tests you gave earlier.,
Don't harm your health.,
Change your attitude.,
Visualize.",How to Stay Positive for Exams," That's the least thing you can do. If you give up, you are not being mature enough to think about the consequences of failing your exams and future.;
, A lot of students feel ""stressed"" because they leave everything for the last minute. Start preparing months or weeks before, so you wouldn't consume a lot of information in one day in your mind, because you would be in a hurry to finish all the syllabus, and therefore, it would be impossible to remember everything in a few hours. Leave the last few days for revision, so you would have everything prepared for the exam.

, It's just an exam. There's nothing to be scared of. If you plan your study time well and be prepared, you would go for the exam very confident. Exams are not something to be ""stressed"" or ""tense"" about. There are other serious problems in our world which are considered as ""stressful."" Exams are nothing compared to these situations. If you start preparing weeks / months before, you wouldn't have problems.

, Sleep and let your mind relax for sometime. It helps a lot.

, Think about the results you want to achieve and your future career. Your exams depend on your future. The more qualifications you have, the better chance you will find a great job! So, think about exams in this way. Your exams are important events in your life, because they are the key to the next stage in your studies / life. Every exam you do helps you to grow up more which should make you more confident during your studies. Therefore, if you feel like giving up or starting to feel nervous or panic, calm down and think; think about these benefits of exams and the effects that they will leave in your nearby future. If you look at the negative side of exams, there is a risk of forgetting the points in your exam, and you don't want to receive a bad result, do you?

, Take away / switch off the things which may distract you; your mobile phones, computer, games, etc, because it would be difficult to concentrate, and start working! If you do this everyday or frequently, you would get used to it and it becomes a routine, which helps you improve your studies faster! And by the way, you don't have to lock yourself in your room 24 hours to study! It is very important to take a 1 -hour or 2-hour break after hours of studying. Divide your studies between different times of the day, for example; 2 hours in the morning, 3 hours in the afternoon and 2 hours in the evening. During your breaks you can take the initiative to do other things which help you relax, but when it is time to study, don't waste time!

, Your life depends on your actions and not what others tell you. You are mature enough to realize what is good or bad. Every person teaches us something in our life, whether if he is a good or bad person. So, look at the negative comments of people as a ""lesson"" or ""guide"" in your life, because they teach you to do the opposite, because if you follow the negative comments, you might regret it later in life.

, If at this current moment your priority is to study, work on it. Study, study and study. Because you cannot bring back the time you waste. If you waste time, you might regret it later, so make sure to make the right choices.

, Throw away the things that distract you, yes ""throw away"".

, It will just increase your stress and will only harm you.

, Be positive there. Don't think about previous exams like ""I had bad marks there"" get a new start there are lots of exams going to come so stay positive.

, Especially your diet. Your body also supports you during the exams so you need full potential for that.

, Jump from negative to positive attitude. Even a slight positive attitude helps.

, Think of the exam time. You scored good marks and are happy after the test. This can calm you down.

Read actively.,
Summarize chapters after reading them.,
Take notes.,
Explain the material to someone else.",How to Retain Information when You Study for a Test1," You won't retain information if you just casually read the material. When you're re-reading for a test, or reading new information, do so actively. This will help you remember the information better when a test arrives.It's easy to read a whole page and realize you took in nothing. If you notice your mind wandering, return it to the text.
Ask yourself questions when you read. For example, ask, ""What is the main point of this section?"" It can help to underline as you go and write down notes in the margins.;
, You shouldn't study in one big session. You will end up feeling overwhelmed. If you summarize each chapter as you go, you will better retain the information later. When you finish a section of a textbook, close the book for a moment and briefly summarize the information in your head.You can also summarize the information by writing it down, which may help you remember it better.
You can also recite the information to yourself out loud, as this may also help you remember it.

, Many students take notes during class. While this is a great tactic, you should also take notes while you're reading and studying alone. Putting the information into your own words as you go will help you remember it better later on.Try to take notes actively. Do not just, for example, copy down definitions and concepts into a notebook. Try to phrase them in your own words. This will help you better understand, and therefore retain, the information you've learned.
You should also make sure your notes stay organized. Use headings to label the notes by chapter and section. You should also date the notes, especially notes you take in class.

, If you're studying with another student, it can actually help to explain the information. Study groups can be helpful. If someone is struggling with a concept, having you explain it to them may help both of you better understand and retain the material.If you don't know anyone in your class, you can always ask a roommate or friend if you can explain the information out loud to them.

Write out information by hand.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Make associations with the material.,
Make flashcards.,
Test yourself on the materials.",How to Retain Information when You Study for a Test2," Copying information over and over again can help commit it to your brain. When you write, you will be actively thinking about the words you're reading. If you're really struggling to retain a particular concept, vocabulary word, date, name, or other aspect of your course material, try writing it down a few times. You may remember it better later on.If you don't like handwriting, you can also type out your notes again and again. Just make sure to pay attention to what you're typing.
You can also try copying your own notes. You may understand terms better if they're already phrased in your own words. This can help you retain the information later on.

, Mnemonic devices are means of associating new information with phrases, terms, or images. Many people use mnemonic devices to help them commit new material to memory. For example, ""Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain"" is a mnemonic device many use to remember the colors of the rainbow, as the first letter of each word in the sentence corresponds to a color of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.If there isn't a well known mnemonic device for the material you're trying to learn, you can make up your own. Have fun and be creative. Make up a visual you can easily remember and use to recall information later.

, In addition to mnemonic devices, you can make other associations that help you retain information. You can make visual associations in your mind, for example, or look for certain patterns.For example, say you're trying to remember John Steinbeck wrote East of Eden. You have a friend named Eden and a friend with the initials J.S.
In order to remember this information, picture your friend with the initials J.S. standing next to your friend Eden. Imagine the two of them holding compasses pointing in the direction east.

, Flashcards are a wonderful way to help you retain information. They are particularly helpful when trying to remember things like dates, names, and vocabulary terms.You can make flash cards by writing information on either side of the card. For example, say you're making flashcards for vocabulary terms. Use index cards. Write the definition on one side and the word on the other.
If you don't want to make physical flashcards, there are many websites that allow you to make flashcards online.

, Testing yourself is one of the best means to retain information. Merely re-reading or studying the information is not as effective as actually testing yourself on the materials. In the weeks leading up to the exam, test yourself frequently.You can make up your own test by writing down questions as you re-read your notes and course materials. Think of questions that are likely to be on an exam. When you get done reviewing, try to answer your own questions.
You can also see if your professor provides practice tests. You should take any practice tests your teacher offers, as this will help prepare you for the exam.
If you have any old quizzes lying around, try retaking them.

Keep a folder where you keep all your notes, past papers, and old quizzes.
Keep your study area organized. If your study area is very messy, this can affect concentration. Tidy up your study area after each study session.

, You will not retain information if you try to cram it in all at once. Instead of studying for hours on end, stick to reasonably timed study sessions with breaks in between.Keep yourself on a schedule regarding breaks to make sure they don't take too much time. You can, for example, agree on 50 minutes of studying and then 5 minutes of break time.
Make sure to time your breaks. A 5 minute internet break can easily turn into an hour internet break unless you're diligent about setting a timer.

, You cannot retain information unless you're getting a solid night's sleep each night. Make sure to go to bed at a reasonable hour, and aim for a full night's sleep each day.Sticking to a sleep schedule will help you fall asleep faster. If you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day, your body's natural circadian rhythm will adapt.
You should also engage in a relaxing ritual before bed each night. Try reading a book or taking a warm bath. Avoid electronic screens, as these can make sleep more difficult.

, Regular physical activity can actually increase your brain's ability to retain information. Aim for half an hour of aerobic exercise a day to maximize your ability to recall information.Pick a form of exercise you enjoy, as you'll be more likely to stick to it.
If you're very busy, see if there's a way to incorporate exercise into your daily routine. You can, for example, bike to class instead of walking or taking the train.

As soon as you register for the exam, mark your calendar or agenda so that you can plan out how much time you need to give yourself to prepare.;
, Based on how much time you have until the exam, decide how much time you are going to give yourself to prepare. Most students take anywhere from 1-3 months to prepare in advance of the exam.


The amount of time you want to spend is highly individual. Think of your schedule leading up to the exam: Will there be any holidays? Does your family have any trips planned? What will your school schedule be like? Choose an amount of study time that can accommodate your schedule. Generally speaking, if you have a busier schedule, it would be best to give yourself more time to accommodate for any days that you are simply too busy to study.

, On this calendar you will mark all of the days you plan to study, as well as all of the days you plan to give yourself a break.


Mark any days that already have something planned, like work, a sporting event, a trip, or a social event, so that you can account for that when planning your study session for that day.

, Perhaps you decide that you want to give yourself one day off of studying per week, at least until the weeks immediately leading up to the exam. Somehow mark those days by writing “Day off” or “Rest day,” for example., The entrance exam is important, and you do want to devote a good deal of time to studying. However, you have other obligations and events going on in your life, as well. Decide how much time you can realistically spend studying each day.


Perhaps you can devote 1-2 hours of studying every day or most days. On the other hand, maybe your schedule is a bit crazy due to a part-time job or a sports schedule, and you can only devote 30 minutes some days but a few hours other days. Plan the time out as much by the day as you can.
Note how much time you plan to spend studying on each day leading up to the exam on your calendar.

, Entrance exams usually assess all of the knowledge you have gained in your entire schooling up to that point, unless they are for a particular course, in which they will assess all of your knowledge on that subject. It can be hard to pick and choose what is most important to review.


It might be most beneficial to focus on the topics or subjects with which you struggle most. Reviewing everything you have ever learned will be tedious and likely impossible. Instead, have confidence in your strengths and focus on your weak areas to review and improve for the exam.Consider all of the subjects or topics that might come up on the exam and organize them in an order that makes sense. That could be chronologically, sequentially, or by some other method.
Try asking friends who have already taken the entrance exam you will take for information about what topics came up on their exam. Yours likely will not be the same, but their insight can help you focus your review topics.

, Go through your calendar and mark every day with what you plan to study. Having it planned out already will save you from wasting time trying to decide what to study down the road.

, Studies show that your study environment should work for you, so choose somewhere that you will be able to focus and avoid distractions. Study environments are highly individual.Make sure that this room has a desk or table at which you can sit or perhaps a comfortable chair. Having comfortable and useful furniture will help you maintain your study habits because you will not have to move to a more suitable place.
Studies have also shown that it is helpful to rotate where you study. Find more than one good study spot, if you can., While this is not necessary, having a test preparation book for your specific entrance exam can help to familiarize you with what types of questions are asked, how they are worded, and what exam scorers are looking for in answers.


It will also help you to focus the topics you should study. These test preparation books often use discontinued exams from previous years.
You can also check for online test preparation courses. Sometimes, you can find those courses or e-book versions of the test preparation books for free.

, For each individual study session, you should have a specific topic that you will study. Be sure to have with you everything that you need to study in order to help you stay on task.


Notes from classes
Old homework assignments, essays, and projects
Scrap paper
Pencils, erasers, and highlighters
Computer or laptop, only if necessary (otherwise, it could be a distraction)
Snacks and water

, There are different styles of learning, and knowing which style of learning best suits you will come in handy as you study.


Visual learner: You learn best by seeing things, so videos, PowerPoint presentations, or even just watching someone work through something on paper or a chalkboard helps you learn.
Auditory learner: You learn best by hearing things, so listening to a lecture or to a recording of a lecture can help you study.
Kinesthetic learner: You learn best by doing things, so being able to work through problems in hands-on, experiential ways helps you.

, Once you have realized what style of learning best suits you, tailor your study habits to fit that so that you learn best.


For visual learning, try re-writing your notes or turning your notes into charts, graphs, or maps. You can also turn your notes in semantic maps instead of traditional outline notes.
If you are an auditory learner, it might help you to read or repeat your study material out loud. Participating in study groups with other people who are preparing for your same entrance exam could also help, due to opportunities for discussion about study topics with others.
For kinesthetic learning, find a way to incorporate movement into your studying. For example, you could sit on a stability ball so you can gently bounce, or you can read over your notes or textbooks while you walk on a treadmill. You might also find it helpful to chew gum while you study, but be mindful that you may not be allowed to chew gum while taking your exam.

, No matter what type of learner you are, it is important to take breaks and not to overdo your studying. Stress can actually cause you to not store new information and make you unresponsive to learning and reviewing, so be sure to give yourself breaks.Set the timer for about every 30 minutes of studying. When you have studied for 30 minutes, take a 5-10 minute break by taking a walk, going outside for some sunshine, or going to the restroom.
Also set a timer for, or at least keep in mind, what time you want to stop. If you have marked on your study schedule that you will study for 90 minutes today, then stick to that time.

, You will be much more likely to remember and really absorb the material you are studying if you can make it fun and joyful.Color-code your notes
Play review games with a parent, tutor, friend, or study group
Act out what you are studying
Make videos or recordings of the study material using props

, In addition to reviewing material, one of the best ways to help you prepare for the exam is to take practice versions of it. Often, the practice tests are old, discontinued versions of the exams. This has many benefits:


You will become familiar with the question wording and style.
You will be able to hone how much time it takes you to answer questions. Be sure to time yourself while taking the practice exam according to the amount of time you will have when taking the real exam.You will be able to narrow what kind of information might show up on your exam.
You will have a control against which you can measure your progress as you continue to study and prepare for the exam.

, As the exam gets closer, it will be really beneficial to think positively about the outcome. Thinking positively will motivate and energize you to do your best.


Get in the habit of thinking positively by practicing positive self-talk. As you think about the upcoming entrance exam, be gentle and encouraging toward yourself. A good rule of thumb is to speak to yourself the way you would like to speak to others.If a negative thought comes to mind, then take the time to think about it rationally. Push it away with thoughts about yourself that are positive. For example, if you think to yourself, “This is too complicated,” then you can rebut it with the thought, “Yes, it's challenging, but I'll attempt it from a new angle.”, Catastrophizing is when you irrationally believe that a situation is far worse than it actually is.As you prepare for your entrance exam, it will be easy and tempting to have thoughts like, “I'm not going to pass this exam, which means I won't go to college, and then I won't be a successful adult.” However, this is catastrophizing, and you should avoid having these types of thoughts.


Catastrophizing truly limits your opportunities in several areas of your life, because it sets you up for the so-called “self-fulfilling prophecy” in a negative way. If you tell yourself that you are not good enough to pass the entrance exam, then there is a good chance that you might actually do that—because you told yourself for so long that you are not good enough to pass it.In the scenario where you do find yourself catastrophizing, take steps to combat it. Begin recording the moments when you find yourself doing this, and after a week or so, look for patterns. Does it only happen when you are studying a certain subject that will be on your entrance exam? Does it only happen when you are practicing a particular question type, like essays? Pinpoint when it seems most likely to occur, and practice that positive self-talk when those moments arise to combat the catastrophizing., A helpful tool for doing this will be the practice tests: Notice which questions trip you up the most. Then, come up with strategies for handling those minor issues while you take your exam.


Skip really challenging questions and come back to them later. Just remember to skip that question on the bubble sheet, if necessary.
Use the process of elimination. Eliminate answers that are definitely incorrect or bogus, and make your answer choice from the remaining options.
Go back and reread the question or related reading passage to double-check your answer.
Read all of the answer options before selecting one. You may see one that you think is correct, but there may be a more correct answer further down the list.
Practice highlighting or underlining important parts of the questions and reading passages. This will help you pull out key details when answering questions later.
Read the questions before the reading passage. Then, you will know what information to seek.

, As a youth or teenager, you still need at least 8-10 hours of sleep per night.Getting this amount of sleep helps you to relax and reduce stress, which will overall calm you down and aid in your ability to focus.


It is also important to try to have a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at around the same time every day. This helps your biological clock, or your circadian rhythm, to maintain consistency with making sure you get quality sleep., You probably built into your study schedule days to take off or rest from studying. When those days arrive, it is very important that you actually take that time off. You need that time to decompress, calm down, and enjoy your life outside of studying., You can use the breathing exercises any time, but they will also come in handy during the exam if you feel yourself getting too stressed out.


Calming Technique: Inhale for a count of four through your nose. Next, hold the breath for two. Lastly, exhale the breath for a count of six through your mouth.Equal Breathing: Inhale for a count of four, and then exhale for a count of four. Both your inhalation and exhalation should be through the nose. Repeat as necessary to calm down.Simply focus on making your exhales longer than your inhales. This is a simple trick to help you relax without any specific counting patterns while breathing., Meditation is excellent for reducing stress and calming nerves. Additionally, yoga provides a great avenue for meditation while also being somewhat active.To meditate, find a quiet place and sit comfortably. Gently rest your hands on your knees, and simply try to clear your mind of your issues and worries. Guided meditation tools are very helpful, but it works just as well to focus on your breathing and on clearing your mind for 10 minutes.

, Almost any type of exercise is fine, but be sure to stick to forms of exercise that you know how to do so that you do not get injured.


Running/jogging
Walking
Swimming
Bicycling
Sports—tennis, soccer, horseback riding, et cetera

, It is completely normal to be nervous, but it is a good idea to try to turn that into excitement about your exam.No one is ever really excited for an exam, but here are some positive thoughts you can have to help psyche you up for it:


“Now I have the opportunity to show everyone how much I know!”
“I've been working so hard at relearning these math equations. My math teacher will be so proud!”
“I've worked so hard to prepare for this exam. I know it will all pay off!”

, Double-check your information and be sure you know exactly where your exam will be taken and at what time you need to arrive. You often have to arrive early in order to allow time to check in and get to your assigned room.

, Give yourself enough time to get up, shower (if you prefer morning showers), have a hearty breakfast, and get to your exam location.

, Put everything you need for your entrance exam into your backpack or other approved bag, if you are allowed one.


Pencils and erasers
Pens, if allowed or needed
Calculator, if allowed or needed
Bottle of water
Snacks

, Complex carbohydrates are great for sustained energy, because they take more time for the body to break down. Enjoy a dinner with a balance of complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats.


Plan for a breakfast that is higher in healthy fats and protein than carbohydrates; however, do not entirely eliminate the carbohydrates. The combination of the healthy fats and the protein will keep you feeling full longer and will not cause you to have an energy crash in the middle of your exam., When your nerves are high and you are trying to cram at the last minute, your brain likely will remember little to nothing of that last-minute review. Give yourself the night off to relax or do some calming., Go to bed as early as you can to make sure you get at least eight hours of sleep, though 9-10 hours of sleep is more highly recommended. That way, when you wake the next morning, you will feel well rested and calmer.

Think about what you like to do in your spare time, what subjects in school you like the best, and what sort of jobs you can imagine yourself doing in the future. Then write a list of what your top interests are. Try to write as many as you can think of., When you don't have any responsibilities to tend to, such as school, chores, or a job, what do you do? Ask yourself this question and be honest to yourself about what you like doing most when you have free time. You likely spend your leisure time doing things that relate to your interests., Brainstorm careers that might be good for you given these interests. For example, if you like math and like figuring out how things work, engineering might jump to mind. If you like people and you're good at figuring out what motivates people, psychology might be something to consider. This is essentially like giving yourself an aptitude test.

, Think long and hard about what you're good at and what you're bad at. What subjects in school do you really do well at? Are you good at memorizing, or do you learn better with hands-on activities? Think about both the abstract things you're good at, like deducing conclusions from facts, and the concrete skills you have, like making speeches or doing geometry. Write these things down on paper., Sometimes it can help to get an outside opinion. Ask someone who knows you well what they think you're particularly good at. You may be surprised at the things they list that you might not have thought of., Things that give your pride are probably going to be things that you're both passionate about and good at. You want your eventual career to be something you're passionate about and good at, so thinking about what makes you proud is a good place to start., As you're listing what you like to do and what you're good at, you might start to notice patterns. If you don't see a pattern, it's okay. You can even ask a friend to read over your list and see if they see a pattern. Look for things that your strengths and interests have in common with one another.


Maybe you seem to be good at logical reasoning and math and you have an interest in cars and the way things work. Maybe you have an interest in meeting people and connecting with others and you're good at reading people and getting people to open up.

, The day before the test, you want to go to sleep somewhat early so you're not too groggy in the morning. The morning of, you want to drink plenty of water and eat a full, healthy breakfast. This will get your brain working at its best., Avoid caffeine before taking the test, as it can increase anxiety. Take deep, slow breaths when you need to. Take the test slowly. There's no rush. If it helps you stay calm, skip the questions that you're unsure about the first time around, so you don't get needlessly frustrated with tough decisions., Before you answer a single question, read the directions carefully, so you know exactly what you're doing. The test should include instructions that are very clear, which means you'll have no trouble figuring out what to do if you read them carefully. If you don't understand any of the instructions, ask for clarification., Attempting to influence or sway results won't get you anywhere. The test is meant to give you an idea of what major or career path you might excel at, so just be as honest with your answers as you can. Trying to answer questions in order to get a certain result will just make the test pointless.

, If you know your weakness is math, don't ignore it because it's hard; work on it! Seek help from your teachers, parents, friends, or anyone else if you don't understand it.

, Studying 15-45 minutes every day is much better than studying for 5 hours the night before you have to take the test.

, Although there are many tips to help you get the verbal questions right if you don't know a vocab word, the best way to guarantee you will get them right is by knowing your vocab. Besides that vocabulary is very important. Want to go to college? Grad school? Get a job? Be successful? Guess what you're going to have to know. That's right, vocabulary.

, Practice timing yourself because the SSAT is a timed test. If you like to spend a lot of time on one math question, for example, doing this is especially important, so you get in the habit of skipping the ones you don't understand. You can always go back to them after you finish all the easy questions.

The most common nursing school entrance exams are:National League for Nursing Pre-Admission Exam (NLN PAX)
Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS)
Health Occupations Basic Entrance Test (HOBET);
, Nursing school entrance exams are different. Knowing the parameters of each test will allow you to focus on specific areas while studying. For example, the HOBET exam gauges your social skills and ability to cope with stress while the TEAS test is simply gauging your basic math, reading and science skills., You can purchase study materials from any reputable bookstore or online resource. Ask the academic advisor at your prospective school for any recommendations for study guides. Use these materials to make flash cards and notes and absorb as much about the test material as possible. Also, you can form study groups if you know other people who are preparing for the same test., Nursing school entrance exams are content driven, which means that they will test what you already know or should know. Techniques that can be successful for studying content include memorization, using acronyms, and using associations. Another type of studying is ""chunking,"" which is breaking a large amount of material down into smaller units instead of trying to absorb everything at once.Avoid cramming. Make sure you give yourself enough time to study. If you have already worked and volunteered in the field, you will likely already know a lot of the information, but don't use that as an excuse to wait to the last minute to study.

, We’ve all heard the phrase “practice makes perfect.” Find a practice test for the type of nursing school entrance exam you will be taking online, in your study guide or at a local community center or college. Taking this practice test can help you identify areas in which your performance was weak and fix it before taking the actual exam.Take as many different practice tests as you can, as they will cover different material.
If you identify areas of weakness, spend additional time studying this material and seek out the help of a tutor.

, Arrange an exam date that will give you plenty of time to study, but will also allow you to submit your application materials, along with the test score, to your prospective school before the submission deadline. It is wise to check your calendar and make sure you do not have any scheduling conflicts on the day of your exam or in the days that immediately precede it. Preparation is a huge part of success on standardized tests and your will want to be sure you have the days leading up to exam free for study and preparation.

, Identify when, where, and in what format your nursing school entrance exam will be administered well before the exam date. Make sure you get a good night’s rest before the exam and leave yourself time for a final review of the materials., Arrive at the testing site at least 30 minutes early on the day of your exam. Bring your picture ID and pencils, if necessary. Do not bring your cell phone, calculator, food, drinks, or any study materials into the exam room.Noise-canceling headphones may be issued at formalized testing centers, as there are often many people taking exams at the same time.

, As is the case with most standardized tests, nursing school entrance exams break down into various sections and the overall exam has a set time limit. Knowing this, plan to spend a pre-determined amount of time on each section and stick to it. Also, don’t forget to allow yourself some time to review your answers in each section before moving on. , The majority of these exams are comprised of multiple choice questions. Read and answer each question carefully. If you get caught up on a question, skip it and come back to it during the review period you allotted for yourself. Never leave questions unanswered. If you don’t know the answer, guess. You may get lucky and get some extra points. You may want to look into strategies for quickly answering multiple choice questions. For instance, first cross off any obviously wrong answers. Answers with absolute qualifiers like ""always"" or ""never"" are typically not the correct answer; however, relative qualifiers such as ""generally"" or ""sometimes"" are usually found in the correct answer., It is wise to give your exam one last perusal before handing it in. You may catch an error or two when reading back over your exam or notice that you failed to answer a question here or there., There are essentially two different types of nurses. Registered nurses (RNs) are expected to complete a two or three year degree, usually after obtaining a bachelor’s degree, are more often employed in hospitals and are expected to take on more important tasks that involve a greater degree of critical thinking and decision making. Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) usually obtain a nursing certificate after about a year of nursing education. LPNs are more often employed in long term care facilities, filling administrative roles and overseeing the basics of patient care (changing bedpans, linens, IVs, etc…).In settings where LPNs and RNs work together, RNs outrank LPNs and undertake more intensive and critical duties.Most nursing school entrance exams offer separate tests for LPN and RN programs.

, Once you have chosen between becoming a RN or LPN, choose one or more nursing schools that can provide you with your desired degree or certificate through the completion of their program. Make sure that the school you choose is an accredited school.
The school will specify which entrance exam is necessary to apply to the nursing program you want.

, Find out the specifics of the test you will take so that you know how to study for it and what material to focus on. The exams typically take between 2 and 3.5 hours to complete.

Study.,
After studying, rest.,
Be prepared to take the test.,
Get to bed early.,
When you wake up the day of the test, make time to go over topics which you are struggling with.,
Have a healthy breakfast.,
Keep calm!",How to Prepare for the MSAs," Studying can help you a lot, though you don't want to cram yourself with too much information. Usually one subject is taken each week, so study the weekend before the test and any extra days you might have to study. Study that one subject and make sure to cover the areas which you have the most trouble with. If you need extra practice, you can get extra work from a teacher, use textbook questions, or play online math games. Remember to not cram your head with a lot of confusing information, especially the night before the test.;
, Your mind needs time to relax and calm itself before taking the test. If you spend all of your time studying, you'll be tired and might end up falling asleep in the middle of the test!

, If you are required to bring something, remember to bring it. Usually the teachers/staff who you are with during the test can provide #2 pencils and erasers, but it's always good to be prepared.

, You will need at least 9 hours of sleep each night. Scientists say that if you get 9 hours of sleep, all the information learned will actually stay in your mind. Sleeping can also rest your mind.

, This will keep the information fresh in your mind. You can do this by making a practice worksheet the day before or using flashcards. There are also flashcard apps so you have all your information on your electronics.

, If you eat a very sugary breakfast, you might have a sugar rush and end up crashing! Eating things such as eggs, fruit, and bread will help you; these are all healthy foods. Make sure to have some water so you can stay hydrated (and not pass out!).

, Don't freak out. If you are nervous, you're not the only one! All of your classmates are stressed too, but keeping calm is the key to getting a great grade.

If you're not planning on attending your program in the near future, you may want to make sure that your scores would still be valid then, or hold off on taking the exam until a later date.When you take the GMAT will depend, in part, on when your graduate school applications are due. The more time you give, the better, but you should take the GMAT a minimum of 21 days before the deadline.Remember that your GMAT scores are only valid for five years.If you plan on attending a graduate program in the next year or two, it's best to begin planning and preparing now for the GMAT.
If your plan is to attend graduate school in three or more years, you may want to wait another year before taking the GMAT to ensure your scores are valid.;
, Every graduate program has different requirements and application deadlines. Some programs may accept late materials if the rest of your application is submitted on time, while other programs have a firm deadline and will consider any missing component an incomplete and ineligible application.Find out what each program of interest will require from you, and what that program's deadline is.
Some schools do not require the GMAT, though many do.Many graduate programs have a minimum GMAT score that they'll accept, though that score will vary from one university to another. It's important to know what your school will require so that you can either cancel a poor score and/or retake the test as needed.
Make sure your program is through an accredited college or university.
You can search for business programs in your area by searching online, or use an online database of schools across the nation through the GMAT website., There are some basic requirements that anyone wishing to register for and schedule the GMAT must meet. In order to meet those requirements, you must:


be at least 18 years old (you may take the exam if you are between 13 and 17 years of age with special permission from a parent or guardian)
not have taken the exam more than five times within 12 months
wait at least 16 days after a previous exam attempt before taking it again
wait at least five years to retake the exam after earning a perfect total score of 800remember that while there is no requirement to have an undergraduate degree to take the GMAT, you must be eligible for graduate school in order to be accepted into a program (which will typically require some type of degree)

, Once you've sent out your program application materials and know the timeline you're working with, you're ready to register for the GMAT. You may register for the GMAT online at mba.com, over the phone (call 1-800-717-GMAT(4628) in the US and Canada, and be prepared to pay a $10 service fee), by mail (print and complete the mail-in form on mba.com and include payment information), or by fax (send it to either 1-952-681-3680 or 1-952-681-3681).You can register for the GMAT up to six months before your test date.
It's best to register at least two to three months before your test date to ensure your registration request is processed on time. Add an additional 15 days if you are registering for the GMAT by mail, as delivery times may delay your registration processing.
The absolute latest you may register for the GMAT is 24 hours before the test date. However, you may only use this last chance registration option by phone or online.
Make sure the test date you choose is at least 21 days before your graduate program's deadline. If your school of choice requires scores to be delivered by mail, add additional time to ensure a timely delivery., You can find a number of study aids online for free or for purchase. The GMAT website is a good source for preparation materials, though any high-ranking, up-to-date study guide should be helpful.


If you choose to use a store-bought study guide, check its reviews online to see what other GMAT test takers have to say about that guide.
Make sure the guide you use is the most up-to-date version.
Spend time preparing for all parts of the test, but make sure you spend extra time on the subject areas you struggle with the most.

, The highest-scoring test takers spent an average of 121 hours studying for the GMAT. Those who scored in the 600 range spent an average of 107 hours studying. Though everyone's progress will vary, it's best to start studying early and develop a regular study routine in order to properly prepare for the exam.Most test takers studying for the GMAT need between six weeks and three months to adequately prepare for the exam.
Knowing your own study habits will be the best way to determine how much you'll need to study, but it's always better to err on the side of caution and spend more time studying.
You'll need to practice on a daily basis in order to do well on the GMAT. If you have very weak math skills, plan on studying for two-and-a-half to three months total.Sporadic studying has been shown to be ineffective in preparing for the GMAT.Once you develop a study schedule, stick with it. Consistency in your preparation will improve your chances of success.

, The quantitative section tests your math skills, primarily in arithmetic, simple algebra, and basic geometry. In addition to testing your knowledge of mathematical concepts, this section of the GMAT will also test your ability to use reason and interpretation.The quantitative section consists of 37 questions, which you'll have 75 minutes to complete.Arithmetic topics include percentages, averages, ratios/proportions, profit/loss calculations, and calculating interest.
Algebraic topics include permutation, probability, quadratic equations, and statistics.
Geometrical topics include coordinate calculations and basic concepts of geometry.

, The verbal section tests you in three basic areas: reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction. Close attention to the passages you will read, the questions asked, and the sentence structure within each question will be necessary in order to do well on this section.The verbal section consists of 41 questions, which you'll have 75 minutes to complete.Reading comprehension passages are approximately 350 words in length and cover topics across social sciences, physical/biological sciences, and business. Each question is interpretive and will require some inference on your part.
Critical reasoning questions evaluate your ability to make an argument and evaluate the arguments of others. You'll read a series of short passages and answer questions on the rhetorical strengths/weaknesses of each passage.
Sentence correction questions assess your ability to follow style and grammar rules in standard written English. You'll read a long sentence that is partially underlined, then answer questions that evaluate the underlined section.
Throughout the verbal section, it's important to remember that colloquial English may not be grammatically correct. If you did not do well in English classes, it may be worth brushing up on your grammar and reading skills.

, This section may be the one least prepared for by individuals taking the GMAT. Unlike the other test sections, the analytical writing section is not factored into your numerical score (between 200 and 800); instead, a score ranging from one to six is attached to your other scores. The business schools you apply to will see the analytical writing score, and it may make or break your application.In this section, you will closely read and critically analyze a written argument.
Do not address your personal views on the topic; you are simply expected to critique the argument that is given to you.
Address the argument's logic, any weaknesses in the argument as it currently reads, and suggest ways to strengthen the argument that might make it more sound and convincing.
You will have 30 minutes to complete this section.

, The integrated reasoning section of the GMAT is only 12 questions, which you'll have 30 minutes to complete. It primarily focuses on your ability to assess multiple sources of data, interpret graphic displays (charts, etc.), analyze a table of information, and make well-reasoned and logical conclusions from the materials you're given., The key to doing well on the GMAT is to know your own skill level and areas of knowledge - and by extension, to know which areas of study will need the most work. You may need to adjust your study habits to include extra focus in your area(s) of weakness, on top of reviewing the rest of the material you'll be tested on.Take the GMAT practice test online. This will be the best indicator of your overall level of preparedness.
You should also download the GMATPrep Software. It's available for free at http://www.mba.com/us/store/download-free-gmatprep-software.aspx.

, The GMAT website offers practice exams online. These will help you prepare for the exam, become familiar with its format, and get a good sense of how prepared you are for the GMAT.Always time yourself while taking practice exams. Remember that you will be timed during the actual GMAT, so it's best to start practicing under time restraints now.
You will lose points on the GMAT if you do not complete any part of the exam, so time management skills are crucial.
Aim to spend about two minutes on each math question and slightly less time on each verbal question.

, Cramming for any exam is a bad idea. Trying to cram for the GMAT is practically impossible. The best preparation for the GMAT breaks up your study sessions into small, manageable blocks. Aim to spend about 45 minutes to 90 minutes on a given day studying for the GMAT., Many college campuses offer GMAT preparation courses, either in person or online. These preparation classes may be beneficial to some, but they can also be expensive. Depending on where your strengths and weaknesses lie, you also may not get much out of a prep course. However, the decision to take a preparation course is a personal one and should be carefully considered.


If you're not sure about a GMAT prep course, consider hiring a personal tutor with GMAT expertise. This can give you a more customized preparation in a one-on-one setting.

, Once you feel you're adequately prepared, it's a good idea to get the most restful night's sleep possible before the exam. A good way to ensure a sound night's sleep is by easing into a relaxing bedtime routine that will help prepare you for sleep.Make sure the relaxing activity you engage in is healthy and will not interfere with your ability to get up early and take the exam. For this reason, it's best to avoid drinking alcohol or staying up late with friends.
Try reading a book, listening to music, meditating, or something similarly relaxing.
Avoid using your cellphone, tablet, or computer before bed, as the glare can reduce your ability to feel sleepy. You may want to avoid watching television to further reduce this risk.

, Sleep is a crucial part of test performance. Being well rested can mean the difference between a successful exam and one in which you're struggling to focus and stay awake.Getting sufficient sleep is the best way to mentally, physically, and emotionally prepare yourself for a big test (after studying, of course).
Most adults need at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Aim to give yourself a little extra sleep the night before the exam to ensure that you are feeling your best.

, Many people set a single alarm to start the day. While this may work fine on a day-to-day basis, it's important to ensure that you arrive at the exam site on time, or you may not be allowed to take the test.Set one alarm for the time you plan on getting up, and another different alarm for about 10 to 15 minutes after the first one goes off.
If your primary alarm clock plugs into the wall, make sure your backup alarm is battery operated. That way if the power goes out, you'll still hear your alarm and get up on time.
Don't rely strictly on cellphone alarms, as your phone may run out of battery in the middle of the night or update your phone's operating software.

, When you arrive at the testing site, it's important to be prepared for the exam. If you forget your ID you will not be allowed to take the exam, and if you forget something crucial like your eyeglasses you may be setting yourself up for a poor performance. Pack anything you anticipate needing the night before the exam, and know in advance what you can and cannot bring.


Make sure you bring your photo ID. You will need this to enter the test site.
Bring your eyeglasses, if you wear prescription glasses.
You are allowed to bring a sweater or light, non-outerwear jacket into the exam in case you get cold.
Any additional ""comfort"" items, such as tissues or cough drops, must be pre-approved in advance. Contact your test center several weeks in advance if you anticipate needing these items.
Personal items like cellphones, watches, and outerwear must be left at home or stored in a supplied locker at the testing site. You will not be permitted to bring these items into the test, and you may be banned from the GMAT if you attempt to violate this rule., The best way to improve your chances of success for any exam is to arrive early. Getting there early will help you feel calmer and more settled when you begin the exam, and it will ensure that you will not be barred from entry for arriving late.You may want to consider having a backup mode of transportation in case of an emergency.For example, if you plan on driving, keep the phone number for a taxi nearby, or make sure your bicycle has air in the tires in case you need it.
Arriving early will reduce the stress and anxiety you experience going into the exam.
Getting there early also ensures that you will have enough time to complete the exam.
Make sure you know where the exam is being held: write down the building's name/address, the room number (if applicable), and anything else you'll need to locate the test site.
Make sure you use the restroom before taking the exam. That way you'll be less likely to have to go during the test.

, Before you begin the GMAT on your exam day, you'll need to choose which schools will receive your results. You are allowed to choose up to five schools to receive your GMAT scores for free. If you want to request that your scores be sent to additional schools, you will need to make that request after the exam, and can do so online, over the phone, by fax, or through the mail.The first five schools you submit your scores to are free, but must be chosen at the test site before you begin the GMAT.
Any additional schools (beyond the first five) you wish to send your scores to, or any schools that you want to add on after the exam, will cost you an additional score report fee of $28 per school., This may sound like a given, but it's important to complete the entire GMAT. There are substantial penalties imposed for any portion of the exam that you do not finish.


Because the exam is administered on a computer, you cannot jump around from one question to another.
You must answer one question in order to proceed to the next question.
Don't take more than two minutes on any given question. If you can spend less than two minutes you will be in better shape for the rest of the exam.
The ideal time range for each question is to spend around one minute and thirty seconds for each question.All answers are final, so you will not be able to revisit a question and change your answer.
If you only have one or two questions unanswered in the verbal or qualitative sections, it won't make much of a difference if you guess the answers or leave them blank.
When answering the quantitative section, it is imperative that you answer all of the questions in their entirety. There are fewer questions in this section, so an unanswered question will cost you more points than the verbal or qualitative sections., Time management is crucial in any examination, so it's important to know how many sections of the test there are and how much time you have for each section. During the GMAT, you will be timed on each section, and it's worth remembering that you may not proceed to the next question or the next section without answering the question at hand. Because you cannot jump around through the test, it's imperative that you answer each question to the best of your ability and within the allotted timeframe.


You will have 30 minutes to complete the analytical writing assessment, which is the first part of the exam. There is only one essay question, and it analyzes your persuasive/argumentative abilities.
You have 30 minutes to complete the integrated reasoning section of the exam. There are 12 questions that test your reasoning, table/graph analysis, and data interpretation.
You'll be given the option of taking an eight minute break before the quantitative section, and another optional eight minute break before the verbal section.
The quantitative section consists of 37 questions over 75 minutes. It tests your ability to analyze data and solve problems.
The verbal section consists of 41 questions over 75 minutes. You will be tested on reading comprehension, sentence formulation, and critical reasoning., Immediately after you complete the exam, you will receive your unofficial scores for the verbal, quantitative, integrated reasoning, and total scores for everything but the analytical writing section. You'll receive your official scores (including the analytical writing score) by email within 20 days of completing the GMAT. The email you receive will provide you with a link to access your scores and detailed instructions on how to view, download, or print your scores.When you view the unofficial scores immediately after the exam, you will have two minutes to decide whether you want to keep those scores or cancel them. If you do not make a selection in the two minutes allotted to you, the system will automatically cancel your score.
You will not be able to view canceled scores, and the programs you have your scores sent to will not be able to view those scores.If you canceled your score but later change your mind, you may reinstate your scores for a $100 reinstatement fee, payable through your regional customer service phone line.You may only reinstate your canceled scores within 60 days of the exam date. After 60 days, your scores will be permanently unavailable if you do not reinstate them."

, Most standardized tests call for a scientific calculator, or better yet, a graphing calculator. You don't need a pencil or a ruler; those are provided for you. Also, think about the personal items you may need. Ask if you are allowed to bring a small snack, like a granola bar or an apple. If so, take advantage of this and bring something small to eat to keep you awake.

, Gum can stimulate your senses and keep you awake and focused. Just make sure you don't chew with your mouth open. Don't do this is if your district is against chewing gum.

, Most standardized tests are taken during spring, and it might get a little hot in your testing room. The last thing you want is to be uncomfortable. For example, if you wear a heavy sweater, chances are that you are going to be extremely tired because of the heat. You can also consider wearing bright colors, which will keep you looking positive and feeling energetic. This may sound silly, but if you wear brighter colors, people will react to you more positively, and you'll be able to feed off of their positive energy.

, Don't get discouraged if you can't figure out a problem; just skip it and come back to it later. Complete open-ended questions to the best of your ability, and read and reread the directions. Go back and check your answers when you get to the end of the test because you probably aren't completely finished. Don't over think things; the directions are probably simpler than you think! Most importantly of all, take your time. Utilize extra time if it is available. Even though you hear this a lot, it is very important! Relax! Standardized tests are not a big deal; just do your best and your efforts will show when you get your grades back.

, The fact is, you should already know everything you need to know by the day before the test. If you have to cram the night before, then you won't do as well you could have if you had studied more in the weeks leading up to the exam. Studying too much the night before can actually make you do worse, because you'll start stressing out if you forget a problem or you may even start panicking if you feel like you've realized there's a concept you don't know at the last minute. To keep your mind tough and relaxed at the same time, make sure you're adequately prepared during the days leading up to the exam and take it easy the night before.

, Along with not studying the night before, you should avoid cramming in the morning before you head to the exam. You won't learn anything new in that short amount of time, and all you'll be doing is weakening your mind by doubting yourself.

, Smile at your friends before the exam. Give a close friend or a parent a hug. Even shake out your arms and legs to loosen yourself up. Just acting positive can go a long way in making you feel more mentally alert and ready to tackle any challenges that you may find on the test.

, If you see a problem you've never seen before, don't let yourself implode and start freaking out. Instead, skip the problem, work on some problems you know until you feel more confident, and return to the tough problem later if you have time. If you spend all your time on this one problem you're not sure you know how to do, you're bound to get frustrated and will keep yourself from earning the points you can earn.

, Sure, you may feel like it's the end of the world when you're facing a standardized test and feel like you don't really know what you're doing, but it's never as bad as you think it is. For one thing, it's likely that you're just second guessing yourself and that you're doing much better than you think. For another, no one test is ever going to have that big of an impact on your life, especially not in middle school. So when you feel yourself losing mental strength, just remember to take it easy. Though this may sound easier said than done, you can definitely do it if you put your mind to it.

Check your IT Quotient.,
Keep yourself updated every day.,
Start reading tech.,
Observe and take a note of the taglines of IT companies.,
Google the famous headquarters of the tech biggies.,
Convince yourself that you cannot cover the entire tech world.",How to Prepare for TCS IT Wiz," Every participant may have his/her own way to check if they are ready for the quiz. One such way is to take the official web-based mini quiz which has 10 easy questions to check your IT quotient.

Another way you may like to try is to approach your geek friend or a relative who keeps good knowledge in this field and ask them to question you. This way you can get an idea of how much you'll need to prepare.
If you think that you are not yet ready, this shouldn't be a reason to stop you. Follow the steps, put in more efforts and soon you'll be on the right track.;
, TCS doesn't declare a 'syllabus' for the quiz. The question asked in the quiz are only answerable if you stay up to date with all the happenings in the tech world. Make good use of the internet, websites like TechCrunch, Engadget and PC Gamer are some good websites you'll like to visit., Stay aware of small things in big companies and big things in small companies. Keep track of CEOs and history of tech giants as well as their acquisitions.

Have a look at the evolution of the logos of big companies, you'll be amazed to find that the logos which you see today aren't the ones which accompanied the companies since the very beginning.
Read about the history of programming languages (who founded them, how were they built and interesting stories related to them).

, For example, the tagline of wikiHow is How to do anything. This is one of the most common types of questions asked in the preliminary round., Most of the times, the quiz master flashes the image of a headquarter of an IT company and flashes a fun fact related to it. Search for 'company name' headquarters and remember to take a note of their names. For example, Zynga's HQ is called The Dog Houseand wikiHow's HQ is known as the wikiHaus!, Nobody can! The tech world is quite bigger than our expectation, thousands of advancement are achieved every day. So, stay focused and be confident about what you have observed and learnt and your hard work will pay off for sure!"

The exam consists of three sections: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Each section contains 30 questions. All sections are weighed equally.For each question answered correctly, four points are awarded. For each incorrect answer, one point is deducted. No points are awarded or deducted for unanswered questions.;
, The JEE Advanced is structured differently than the main exam. The advanced exam covers the same three topics: Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. However, unlike the main exam, the advanced exam is divided into two three-hour long papers, each divided into three sections (one for each topic). The papers are organized as follows: Paper One: Each section contains 10 multiple choice questions with one correct answer, five multiple choice questions with one or more correct answers, and five questions that require the test taker to provide a single-digit answer.
Paper Two: Each section contains eight multiple choice questions with one correct answer, eight questions that require responding to a reading passage, and several ""matching list""-type questions.

, Though both the JEE Main and JEE Advanced cover the same three subjects (physics, chemistry, and mathematics), the precise topics covered and the difficulty of the individual questions will vary between the two tests.To gain a sense for the topics you may be expected to know for each test, consult the official test syllabi for the Main and Advanced exams, both of which are available in free PDF form from official test resources online.Below are just a few examples of the topics you may encounter on the test — these lists are by no means complete or definitive:


Physics: Kinematics, laws of motion, gravity, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, electronic devices.
Chemistry: States of matter, atomic structure, redox reactions, chemical kinetics, environmental chemistry, periodic groups, basic organic chemistry principles.
Mathematics: Quadratic equations, mathematical induction, sequences and series, matrices, integral calculus, differential equations, coordinate geometry.

, The simplest, most effective way to prepare for the JEE is simply to do the test itself. Mock tests are available for free from the official JEE website. These tests mirror the actual JEE in terms of structure, format, and content and can be accessed entirely through your computer — no physical testing materials are required. Completing mock tests gives you the valuable experience of working through the JEE (and, in the process, finding your strengths and weaknesses) in advance of the actual exam.


Note that while mock tests mimic computer-based versions of the JEE almost perfectly, paper-based versions of the JEE will require you to record your answers by hand on an official answer sheet — for obvious reasons, online mock tests can't replicate this part of the testing experience.

, Another important resource for applicants looking to pass the JEE are the question papers from past tests (freely available on the official JEE website). Unlike the mock tests, which have questions specifically made for them, JEE question papers contain the exact questions included on past exams, making them a very valuable resource.


Because the JEE is relatively new (the exam replaced the old IIT-JEE in 2013), only question papers from 2014 are available. However, since the test is offered multiple times per year, as of late 2014, eight papers have been published, offering plenty of practice material. In addition, question papers for the old IIT-JEE (also available online) will cover most of the same topics.

, This article covers most of what of what a JEE aspirant will need to prepare for the exam, but it's not intended to be a substitute for official JEE test resources. If you're ever unsure about some aspect of the JEE (like, for instance, how to apply, what the eligibility requirements are for public students, and so on), try consulting the JEE FAQ. The FAQ can provide you with the answers to frequently asked questions about the JEE, thus ensuring that you don't have to waste any valuable study time finding the answers elsewhere.

, Over time, the JEE can (and has) changed. Tests may be rescheduled, results may be re-interpreted, and the topics covered may change. To ensure that you have the absolute best chance of doing well on the JEE, stay up to speed with official JEE bulletins, which are published as they are released on the official JEE website.


As an example of the sort of valuable information that may be released in a JEE bulletin, one recent bulletin contained important information on test takers' eligibility for admission to various Indian engineering and architectural programs.

, The official JEE site is generally the most reputable source for test prep materials, but it is far from the only place to find sample questions, practice tests, and other valuable resources. A variety of third-party organizations and agencies also provide JEE test prep materials (some are for free; others cost money). However, since these third parties may not always be reputable or certified, it's important to use discretion and only rely on sources that appear legitimate when studying for the JEE.


One great source for JEE test questions is Khan Academy. This relatively well-known academic site offers free educational material on a huge variety of topics and even has a page dedicated specifically to JEE test prep., In addition to online resources, JEE test prep materials are also available in physical form. Test prep books, brochures, pamphlets, and more are available at academic bookstores. The price (and legitimacy) of these materials can vary — try to choose materials that are officially certified by JEE-administering agencies and contain practice tests, questions from old tests, and so on.


It's also a wise idea to pick books that contain full solutions with explanations (and not just answers) for every question — this way, if you don't understand a question, you'll get the luxury of being walked through the question step-by-step, rather than having to piece the solution together based off the final answer.

, If you've been a diligent student, you may have access to great test-prep resources and not even realize it! Dig up your notes from physics, chemistry, and mathematics classes you've attended and review them, taking time to highlight important topics for further review. If you have access to old problems, consider going through some of these as well for extra practice.


Some students may find it useful to read old textbooks directly — if this is the case for you, feel free to. However, for many, the ""dense"" way material is presented in many textbooks can make it almost impenetrable, so this may not be a great use of your test prep time.

, When it comes to preparing for the JEE, the earlier you start, the better. Studying for the JEE is a serious undertaking, especially if you plan on taking the JEE Advanced. It's also one that can have a significant impact on your professional future — a great score on the JEE can make it much easier to get into the engineering program of your choosing. For these reasons, some people choose to start studying years before they'll need to actually take the JEE. Though this probably isn't necessary if you've been attentive to your studies, for the best score, you will probably want to begin as early as practical — at least a few months before your test date.

, As you study for the JEE, you'll want to devote some time to every topic, even if you're already confident that you know some of them very well. However, to get the best score possible, you'll want to devote the majority of your time to the topics that you're not confident in. Doing this ensures you get the biggest improvement possible from your studying effort.


If you're not sure how to allocate your time, try reviewing your grades from school — spend your most time studying the subjects that you get the poorest marks in.

, In the months before the JEE, you want to make the most of your time — you don't want to waste an hour (or more) fooling around for every hour you spend studying. To avoid distractions like TV, video games, and other forms of digital entertainment, remove them from your life temporarily. For instance, if you're having a hard time giving up your video games, you may want to try leaving your game system at a friend's house until the test is over.


Try to use the internet only for study purposes. Don't waste your study time on games or social networking until the exams are over. If you can't seem to overcome these online distractions, try downloading and installing a productivity app (most browsers will have these available for free in the browser store).

, When you practice individual problems in preparation for the JEE, a good rule of thumb is to take as long as you need to fully understand the problem and answer it correctly. However, when you take entire JEE practice tests, it's a smart idea to give yourself the same 180-minute time limit you would normally have to finish the test. Doing prepares you to account for the time limit when it will actually matter.


You don't necessarily need to be able to complete the entire test within the time limit the first time you try to do so, but you should work to increase your speed so that you're able to finish the whole test in 180 minutes (with as few questions skipped as possible) by the date of the test.

, Past a certain point, additional studying prior to the JEE can actually be harmful. If you have to give up eating or sleeping properly in the days prior to the JEE to squeeze in last-minute studying, you're probably hurting your chances of getting the best grade that you can. Neglecting these basic physical functions can leave you drowsy and distracted on the day of the exam, making it tricky or even impossible to do your best. Take the time to relax, eat normally, and get plenty of sleep in the days before your test — if you've been studying all along, it's almost certainly the smartest thing to do.


This advice isn't unique to the JEE. Neglecting your physical needs (especially sleep) before any test has been demonstrated to lower your score on average."

Studying for finals at the end of the semester is a lot easier if you've been keeping up with the work all along.


Attend class. It is very easy to fall behind in your work if you haven't been in class. Listening to a lecture in person will give more background to the content and enable you to ask questions than simply reading a friend's notes.
Staying organized and keeping all of your notes and study materials in the same spot will help you stay on top of your work.;
, A good rule of thumb is to devote 60-90 minutes a day, 5-6 days a week during the semester for each subject you have a final in.Staying consistent throughout the semester will help guarantee that you are covering all the material evenly. Remember that with studying, like anything else, practice makes perfect. Figure out what time of day you are most efficient, how long you can maintain focus without distraction, and in what environment you best study, and craft a schedule based on these factors.

, Decide how confident you are about the content going into it, and find a tutor or a study partner at the beginning of the semester. Oftentimes you won't realize you need help before finals are almost upon you, so lining a person up early will put someone in your corner even before you encounter the challenging portions of the material. Your college or department might provide tutors free of charge, or you could ask your professor for suggestions. You don't have to hire a professional tutor; just find someone who has taken the course before or has a major or minor in the area.


Word to the wise: while study partners are helpful when you want to bounce around ideas and ask questions while you are studying, stay away from good friends when you are really struggling with the material. The best study partner is often someone you don't know very well, and wouldn't necessarily choose to hang out with outside of class. Studying with a friend can easily turn into a gab-session and keep you distracted from the work.

, Don’t wait until the end of the semester to study past sections; review old material on a regular basis throughout the semester. Keep a running list of important terms as you come across them in your reading, or keep all of your flash cards together in one place, periodically shuffling them to ensure you are covering all the material evenly.


Keeping all of your study material (notes, flash cards, etc) together will help you review past content while you are studying current material, though it is easy to get it mixed up. Try color-coding your work to differentiate it between past and present material. Use colored highlighters or colored tabs to distinguish each section of material. You could also differentiate based on category (for example, “already mastered”, “for review”, and “needs clarification”). Keep all of the questions you have on the content together in one place. This way when you study you can go back and answer them and see how much you've learned!

, Keeping track of your score on exams and comments on your papers will help you recognize the section of material you need to spend more time on later. Plus, you will know your grade in the class prior to going into the final so that you will know how much time you need to put into studying later on.

, Check your syllabus or look online to see when your finals are scheduled. Look closely at your exam schedule, and plan when you study around when your finals are offered. If two or more exams are scheduled close together, prioritize a subject based on how

, Don't feel like you need to give equal study time to each of your courses; your studying will be much more efficient if you prioritize your time. Look back at your progress throughout the semester; if your grade is already where you want it, then putting in the same amount of effort you've put in all semester will be fine. But if your grade is borderline (between a 'C' and a 'B' for example) or you're hoping that the final will raise your grade, you'll want to put in a bit more effort. Consider these factors when deciding which subjects to prioritize:


How confident you already feel about the material.
The amount of time you’ve already spent studying.
Your grade going into the exam.
How much the final is worth compared to the rest of the semester's work (you'll want to give more time to a final that is worth 50% of your grade compared to 20%, for example)
The make-up of the final; if the final is primarily essay-based and you don't do very well with essay questions, you'll want to spend a bit more time studying just to raise your confidence going into it.

, Now is the time to make sure you have all of your notes and handouts from class; go through and organize them by day to make sure you aren't missing any. If you've missed any class periods, make sure you get the notes to copy from a friend, or ask your classmates or professor for anything you might have missed.

, Take a look now at your final exam schedule, all of your assignments before the end of the semester, and all of your extracurricular and outside activities between now and finals, and form a study schedule based on this. If you have a light week this week but know next week will be rough, take advantage of the time and start studying now.


If you don’t have a study group already, be proactive about forming one for finals. Talk to your classmates now about studying together, and if necessary assign review material to each person.

, You need a studying location that is quiet and free of distractions. If the library, study area, or outdoors does not work for you, keep looking. Sometimes colleges open up conference rooms or other spaces to allow additional room for studying during exam week.


For best results, alternate study spots. Scientists have found that alternating a space in which a person studies can actually increase retention. Why? Your brain makes subtle associations between what it is studying and the environment in which you are in. , Be intentional about the time you devote to studying. carve a bit of time away each day for the courses you prioritize. Cramming has actually been shown to produce anxiety, so starting earlier in the week will help alleviate the pressure later on.It might help to write it into your planner just like another activity and stick to this time. If your intentions are clear going into study, it is less likely that you will be distracted during your study session.

, These are essential for knowing exactly what topics to focus on during study. Some professors will provide a list of what topics to study, complete with a practice test. This helpful information is sometimes only provided at the review sessions, and not during regular class periods.Classmates that seem to grasp the concepts well can be an easily accessible resource if you are confused about something. Don't be afraid to ask them for help in studying for finals.
Make use of office hours. Make an appointment if you have any remaining questions or need clarification on any material. If your schedule conflicts with office hours, e-mail your professor to set up an alternate time. Professors are there to help you understand the content, and by asking questions you show them that you care about the material- and your grade.
Teaching assistants are often more accessible than a professor, and might not be bothered as much by questions that seem basic. Approach them before or after class or make a special appointment with them to review material.

, Keeping your body active and healthy is as important as knowing the content; there is nothing worse than sitting through a final while sick. Finals can be a stressful time, so make sure you are taking care of your physical self.


Exercise. Exercise is an effective tool in helping your body combat stress. Staying active helps relieve tension and anxiety, and can help depression over the long-term . But don't overdo it this week; you don't want to have to deal with a muscle injury over finals.
Eat superfoods that are high in antioxidants. High-carb, high-fiber, slow-digesting foods (like oatmeal, almonds, fruit, and yogurt) can actually increase attention and thinking speed. Eating a breakfast of oatmeal, fruit, and yogurt is ideal the morning of the exam.
Take breaks. Make it a point to relax with friends regularly and participate in non-academic activities to avoid burn-out.

, Don't simply review the material by re-reading it and summarizing; these techniques don't necessarily boost performance. Instead, testing yourself through the use of flash cards or taking a practice exam is more effective .

, While it is tempting to cram a bit more studying into the hours you have left before an exam, trust what you have already done to prepare. All-nighters can actually impair reasoning and memory for as long as four days.While it's very easy to get caught up in the pressure and hype of finals, approach the exam with confidence. Trust yourself and all that you've done to prepare: you can do this.


Go to bed on time and get a good night's sleep. This way you'll be able to pull the information out fresh the next day.
Don't try any last-ditch heroics to boost your energy-level or try and retain more; keep to your routine so that your body is regulated the day of the exam. While it's important to stay healthy, eat right, and go to bed on time, don't do anything that will throw your body off-whack.

Relax and speak as confidently as you can.Candidates who are not able to participate fully in the conversation *may not achieve their potential band score.,
Learn how the Speaking component is assessed: The aim of the test is to assess your ability to communicate effectively.The interviewer considers this ability in four different ways:


Fluency and Coherence:This measures your ability to speak without too many pauses and hesitations.,
Be prepared to answer the questions in part 1 of the interview.,
Sample questions: The interviewer will ask for general information about topics such as the following:


Your country of origin
Your hometown
How long you have lived there
What you do: work or study
Your interests and future plans

,
It is not possible to predict what topics may be discussed at this point in the interview; however, some familiar topics related to you or your country could include:


Family and family relationships
Modern and traditional lifestyles
Traditional or modern buildings
Tourism and tourist sites
Celebrations and cultural activities
Schooling and the education system
City and country living

,
Know what to expect.,
Typical questions for this stage of the test might be:


What’s your name?,
Carefully consider what you know about each of the topics above.,
Be ready for Part 2 of the interview.,
sample:Describe a person from your youth who had a great influence on you:


You should say:
where you met them
what relationship this person was to you
what was special about them
and explain how they influenced you so much.

,
Before the test, you need to practice talking about topics for one or two minutes, making notes appropriate to the topic beforehand, to help you.,
When you are giving your talk, take each point you have written and expand it into full sentences, but also add more new information.For example:


g/mother (or grandmother)could become:“The person who had most influence on me was actually my father’s mother, my grandmother; she grew up in the country and moved to the city in 1965 to get a better education.”and * intro.,
Use examples from your own life.,
Prepare for the extended conversation in Part 3.,
Know what is being tested...your ability to:


give in-depth answers to questions about the topic
use the language of description, comparison and speculation
explain and justify your opinions, assumptions, predictions, reasons etc

,
Practice with sample questions: It is not possible to predict what questions will come up at this point in the test except that you can be sure that the topic will be related to your long turn topic.,
Thus, the interviewer may start the discussion on the first related topic (Music in society) by asking you to describe how music is important to everyday life in your country.,
Expose yourself to everyday topics as often discussed in newspapers or on radio and TV programs.,
Be ready to use a good range of tenses and a variety of grammar, for instance, to speculate on what may be possible in the future.,
Be prepared to speculate about the future:


I hope that …
It’s possible that…
I can see that …
If possible, I’d like to see …
We should plan to …
It might be that …
We can assume that …
Probably, …
I expect that …

",How to Prepare for IELTS Speaking Test," This may be because they haven't been able to demonstrate the level of language they are capable of producing.;
, It is also to do with how easily and clearly your ideas can be understood.
Lexical Resource:This refers to your use of words and the range and accuracy of the vocabulary you choose to use. Not only how you select words but also how well you use them will be considered.
Grammatical Range and Accuracy:The variety of grammar you use and how correctly you use it are both judged by the interviewer. So, the range of tenses as well as the appropriate use of them is important in all parts of the Speaking test.
Pronunciation: Here it is not only individual words but the whole sentences which are considered. The interviewer will be considering how easily they can understand what you are saying.

, It starts with an introduction in which the interviewer asks you basic questions about yourself and asks to see your identification. The interviewer will then go on to ask you further questions about yourself, your family/hometown, your job or studies and a range of similar topics areas that are familiar to you.This section of the test lasts 4-5 minutes and in it you may need to give longer answers to questions to ensure you display your best ability.What is being tested is your ability to:


provide full answers to all questions
give longer responses to some questions
give information by describing and explaining

,,, The introductory section of the test will go something like this:


The interviewer greets the candidate and introduces himself or herself.
The interviewer asks the candidate to state his or her name clearly for the cassette and confirms the candidate’s country of origin.
The interviewer then asks to see the candidate’s identification.The remainder of Part 1 of the test will follow this format:
The interviewer will ask the candidate set questions about your hometown or your occupation.
The interviewer will then ask set questions about a familiar topic of general interest.
They could ask three to five questions which will extend or develop this topic.
The interviewer may ask the candidate about more than one topic.

,
What country do you come from?
Describe your hometown to me.
Where do you live?
Tell me about your family members
What are you studying?
What do you dislike most about your studies?
Do you like eating in restaurants? Why?
What type of transport do you use most? Why?
Where would you like to go on holiday? Why?
Tell me who you would most like to go on vacation with.

, Try to think of all the questions that someone who was trying to get to know you might ask, and make sure that you have all the vocabulary you need to discuss the topics in depth. Check and practice the pronunciation of any new vocabulary. Practice extending your answers to questions. You will perform better in the IELTS interview if your speech is fluent. You are likely to be more fluent if you have already thought about the topic and have some ideas to express. Before the test, prepare the language you will need in order to discuss topics like these. This doesn’t mean memorizing or rehearsing a speech because you can never be sure You should also be prepared to use the past, present and present perfect tenses to describe your current situation. For example, ‘I have been studying English for two years since I moved to the city’.

, Part 2 is the long turn. The examiner will give you a card with prompts relating to a particular topic. These prompts are to help you prepare a short talk of 1 to 2 minutes. You will be given a minute to organize your thoughts and you can make some notes. The examiner will ask one or two follow up questions to finish this part of the test. Part 2 will take three to four minutes, including the one-minute preparation for your talk. What is being tested is your ability to:


talk at length on a topic
develop your ideas into a talk
use grammar correctly and speak clearly

,, Record yourself and then play back the recording listening to how clearly you are pronouncing and how well you select vocabulary. You also need to practice making your notes in point-form, with abbreviations and symbols. There are many ways to do this.


For example: If you are preparing the talk shown in the example above: ‘Describe a person from your youth who had a great influence on you’ and you are thinking about your grandmother who was a musician and who looked after you when you were a child, taught you to play the piano, talked to you often about music and musicians and encouraged you to express your feelings through many forms of music, then your notes may look like this:
g/mother
musician
taught me piano
intro. me -> many music forms
encouraged feelings through music
major influence

, me -> many forms of music could become:“She opened up my life to music in its many different forms.We would make music by clapping our hands, using bottles,jars, pots and pans, anything we could use, as well as the piano. My life was full of music.”

, These you can speak about more easily than stories you have made up or read somewhere else.Try to relax and enjoy the experience of telling the interviewer as much interesting information about yourself as you can.

, After asking one or two follow-up questions the interviewer will lead you into in an extended conversation discussing issues related to the Part 2 topic you spoke on. The interviewer will enlarge on things which were discussed in the second part of the test, possibly starting by asking you to describe something, then asking you to attempt something a little more difficult like comparing, evaluating or speculating; the questions will become a little more difficult as Part 3 proceeds. Finally, the interviewer will conclude the Speaking test by simply saying something like:


“Thank you, that is the end of the Speaking test.”

,, Some questions will arise naturally from the discussion and the information you are giving as this section progresses.For example, consider the following sample topic:


Describe a piece of music that has had a big effect on you.Possible related topics may be:
Music in society
Cultural aspects of music
Commercialization of music

, After you have talked about this, the interviewer may ask you to compare the importance of music now with how it was when your grandparents were young; and then may even go on to ask what you think will be the effects of music on future societies.

, Make it your habit to read newspaper and magazine articles, particularly those that discuss issues and contain arguments and opinions. Also, listen to radio discussions like talk-back and watch interviews on current affairs programs on the television.Not only does this give you some excellent listening practice, but it will build your background knowledge for the issues that may come up in both the Speaking and the Writing tests.Choose an issue. Record all the vocabulary you will need to discuss that issue – note words raised in the news article or program (TV, radio, newspapers). Try to do one of these every day. When you consider an issue, decide what would be your position on the issue, especially the steps you will need to take to reach your desired position and how you would overcome any possible problems in discussing it. Be prepared to use descriptive and comparative language, for example, in respect to the Music in society example given earlier:“In my country, traditional music plays a more important role in society than it seems to here, in Australia. It is played at important events like festivals and official ceremonies, as well as at special occasions such as weddings and funerals.”Practice using conditional sentences to discuss, for instance, hypothetical issues from a broad or world view; for example:“If the world economy becomes more global, all nations will lose their cultural independence.”or “If the leaders of the world were to spend more money on the poor,many of the problems of global conflict would be resolved.”

, For example:Interviewer: What future role do you see for music in society?Candidate: Well, I’d (or I’ve) always hoped that all the peoples of the world could benefit by sharing their common experience of music. In the past, there have been many examples of musicians joining forces to raise awareness of global issues that result from famine or human rights abuses.or Candidate: If different cultures could see the common features of music in other countries, they may be less fearful of each other and understand one another’s cultures better.

Bring whatever you need.",How to Prepare for English Exams," Before you begin studying, you should confirm which information from your English course will be on the exam. Your syllabus should outline whether it is a unit-specific exam, for example, or a comprehensive exam covering an entire course worth of material.Check your syllabus, and read through your notes to see if your instructor announced any changes in class.
Email your instructor or meet with her after class to confirm that you are studying the right material.
Try to find out what format the literature exam will be in. If it is short answer or fill-in-the-blank format, you'll have to know the material a little more thoroughly than if it's a multiple choice format.
Make sure that you attend class in the days leading up to the exam. Instructors will often do a review session in one of the class periods before an exam.;
, Your notes from class should help you get a general idea of what information your instructor thinks is most relevant or important from the reading assignments. If you've been taking notes while you read the course material or otherwise notating important passages, review those notes and passages as well.If your instructor talked about it in class, it's fair game for the exam.
Anything from the relevant readings is also fair game for exam material.
Review any supplemental material from class, such as handouts, worksheets, etc.
Bring your book to class each week. Reading along while your teacher quotes or references passages can help give you a visual memory of the passages you're likely to be tested on.
Take notes on any passages you discuss in class, and reread those passages extensively. You may also wish to highlight or underline any particularly important passages for ease of reference.

, As you go back through the book or books your exam will cover, take notes that will outline what you've read. You can make your own comprehensive study guide by reviewing important passages and jotting down the main people, places, and events in the book(s).Make a list of characters and their noteworthy characteristics. Try to get an overall sense of each character's personality, as well as each character's role in the book.
Write down the dates or time period (if relevant) and the setting of each major section in the book. Try to get a sense of how the period may have affected the setting, and how both setting and period may affect characters.
Jot down any details you learned about the author's life. Try to make connections between what the author experienced (both personally and generally, in his place and time) and what takes place in the book.
Try to pin down what the book means, beyond just rehashing the plot. Was it a social commentary? A criticism of some person/place/movement? Is the novel thick with simile and metaphor?

, Once you've written your own study guide and compiled all your course notes and handout materials, you should review this information until you can recall any portion of the material. Test your knowledge of the material by doing a quiz-and-recall review. Read a line from your notes with the answer covered or blanked-out, and see if you can tell (without cheating) what the notes said.You can also quiz yourself on plot and character questions by reciting the main characters, and main sequence of events to yourself. Do this as often as possible to test your memory - you can even quiz yourself by reciting these summaries while walking or doing chores.

, After extensive study sessions, you should be ready to take the exam. Beyond just knowing the information, however, it can be useful to know how to take an exam efficiently. If you're taking a multiple choice exam, it's fairly easy to answer the exam questions systematically in a way that maximizes your potential for success.Pay attention to how many points each question is worth and spend more time on the questions that are worth more. For example, you would want to spend more time on a question that is worth 10 points than a question that is worth 2 points.
Skip difficult questions and come back to them later. Hammer out the answers you know first, then spend more time working on what you're struggling with.
Cover the answers while you read the question. Underline key words, and look for absolute qualifiers like ""always,"" ""never,"" or ""none."" In a true or false situation, these terms often indicate that the answer is false.Predict the answer before you look at the answer bank. Then find the best response that most closely matches your answer.
Cross out any answers that you know are wrong. Make an educated guess if you are absolutely stumped - if you eliminated two wrong answers, you've probably got a 50/50 chance of guessing correctly.

, If you have sufficient time, it may be helpful to reread the book or books you will be tested on. If you don't have time to review the entire book(s), you should at least reread the most difficult passages.Identify the major themes in the book, and try to get a sense of the most important events.
Write out the basic plot of the book. Include details like which character carries out a given action, as well as the overall sequence of events.

, You may not know what exactly will be asked of you on an essay exam, but you should have a fairly decent idea based on your completion of the reading and any previous exams you've taken. By predicting what will be asked of you on the exam, you can study more efficiently and outline your essay well before it's time to take the test.Review the questions and format of the last exam essays you completed for this course.
Focus on the structure of previous exam essays. Were you asked to write about the reading within the context of historical events? The author's life?
Did previous exam essays ask you to summarize the plot? Or did it go deeper, like compare/contrast questions, or questions that ask you to prove/disprove an argument?

, Once you have a sense for the types of essay questions that might be asked, review your notes and study materials with that knowledge in mind. Try to pull out potential questions based on what you know about your instructor's essay questions in the past, and come up with your own thoughtful, articulate responses to those hypothetical questions.Put yourself in your instructor's shoes. What types of questions does he like to ask, and how might he pull those questions out of the course material at hand?
You can also predict possible essay questions by looking for any boldface text/headings in your course textbook (if you have one), and turning those phrases into questions.
As you look for possible essay topics, practice phrasing those questions using key essay terms like ""describe,"" ""explain,"" ""define,"" and ""contextualize""., Once you've generated a few potential essay questions, try outlining your answers to these questions. This should help you to memorize some of the information that you will need to know and determine how best to organize your essay.You can make your essay outline as detailed as you want. For example, you could create a skeletal outline that briefly states the topics you will cover in each paragraph or you could create a more detailed outline with topic sentences for each paragraph followed by bullets for other details.
Make sure that the points you include in your outline will provide a satisfactory answer to the question and that you know how to elaborate on each of these points.
Only include relevant information in your outline. When you take the essay exam, you will need to be as concise and direct as possible and avoid padding your answers. Identifying and memorizing lots of relevant details will help you to write the best essay answers possible.

, After you've reviewed the material for the exam, covered possible essay topics, and written practice essays, you should be ready to take the exam. Try to pace yourself if you're working within a time limit, and make sure you read every question (and its instructions) carefully before answering.


Write down a condensed summary of all the information you've studied on your scrap paper or in the margins. This is called a ""memory dump,"" and it's incredibly helpful for freeing up your mind to review the questions at hand.Review the instructions for each section to ensure that you're answering in the correct format.
Analyze each question. Take a moment to reread what's being asked of you before you formulate a response, and look for action verbs that indicate what/how you should be writing.Form a thesis that will address the question.
Organize and sketch out your supporting information on scrap paper or in the margins.
Write a clear, concise thesis statement in response to the question, and write the body of your essay using your supporting information as the main points of each body paragraph.
Review your answers. Confirm that your essays answer the questions completely, and look for any glaring factual errors, grammatical errors, or structural mistakes.

, Rewriting your notes can help you process the information from lectures/readings and commit that information to memory. When you rewrite your notes, though, be sure that you rephrase and summarize what your original notes said, instead of simply copying them word for word.Read over your original notes and give yourself a few minutes to process what you wrote.
Think about the key concepts, characters, and literary devices discussed in each note passage.
Paraphrase your notes into your own words. Try also drawing comparisons or connections between relevant topics and ideas discussed in class.

, Flash cards are easy to make and can be a valuable tool for studying. You can use these cards to study and memorize key terms, concepts, names, dates, and places.You'll need a stack of blank index cards.
Write a term, concept, or name on one side of the card and its definition or explanation on the back.
Quiz yourself by only viewing one side (either the term or its explanation) and reciting what appears on the other side. When you've mastered giving the explanation for the term, switch it up by giving the term for the explanation.
Set aside cards you struggle with and review those cards with extra effort.
Repeat the whole process until you've committed the cards to memory in any order.

, It may be tempting to cram right before an exam, but you will not retain much information by staging long, exhausting study sessions. Instead, you should study more efficiently by breaking your study sessions up into smaller, more manageable blocks of time.Don't study for longer than 50 consecutive minutes at a time. This can overload your memory and prevent you from retaining all the information.
Take breaks between study sessions. Aim for at least a 5 to 10 minute break, and try stretching or going for a walk to refresh your mind and body before the next session begins.Pace your sessions out over the course of several days or weeks.
Refuel by having a nutritious snack when you take a break from studying. Opt for fresh fruit and vegetables for a refreshing, reinvigorating study snack.

, Some night owls find that they are more productive in the evening. Morning people, on the other hand, might prefer to wake up early after a good night's sleep and do their studying over coffee. However you study, it's important to try different study times and locations to figure out what works best for you.Schedule your study sessions during the time of day that you're most alert and attentive.
Don't study when you're too tired. Study sessions while you struggle to stay awake will not be very productive, and you probably won't retain much information.
Figure out where you study best. If you like working in a comfortable environment, you might study well at home. If you prefer a quiet, distraction-free setting, try the library.

, It's important to get a restful night of sleep before the exam. You should show up to class alert and awake, ready to begin as soon as possible.


Adolescent students in high school or younger typically need 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.College students typically need between 6 and 10 hours of sleep, with seven to eight hours being the average.Make sure you're wakeful for the exam. Drink a caffeinated beverage or chew gum to ensure you're mentally alert., Follow your usual morning routine to feel your best the day of the exam. If you usually shower in the morning, make time to do so. Just make sure you leave early enough to get to class at least 15 minutes before the exam to ensure you're in the right classroom.Eat a small, nutritious breakfast. Oatmeal and fruit is usually a good bet.
Avoid eating anything that might upset your stomach.
Make sure you use the bathroom before you get to the exam.
Wear comfortable clothes.

, When you leave your home the day of the exam, make sure you've got everything you'll need for the test. The last thing you want to do is show up unprepared in some way.Bring extra writing utensils, in case your pen dies or your pencil breaks.
You may want to bring a water bottle or coffee to stay hydrated and focused.
If it's an open-book or open-notebook exam, bring your textbook(s) and your notebook to the exam.

Backward plan to figure out when you need to go to bed or get up.,
Eat brain foods and complex carbs.,
Start an exercise routine.",How to Prepare for Competitive Exams2," Ensure that you get a full 8 hours of sleep before your exam. Getting a bad night's sleep can have a marked negative impact on your test score. Regularly not getting good sleep can create stress and cause you to get sick more often.

, One technique that can help you get to bed on time is backward planning. Start from the time you want to be at your test site or studying the next day, and mentally go through all the things you need to do leading up to that time. Plan backward to figure out when you need to realistically be in bed by to get enough sleep.


Consider how long it takes you to fall asleep, typically, and make sure you account for that time.
Add some cushion time in your backward planning for your test day in case something unexpected happens, like you get lost trying to get to a test site.

, Eat complex carbs for brain power. If you are distracted by your hunger during your test or while you study, you won’t be able to focus as well. To combat this, on the day of the test and before you study, eat food high in protein, like eggs, and/or whole grains that will stick with you for several hours, like oatmeal. If you have a break during your test, pack a light snack, like an apple, that will keep you alert.


On the day of the test, eat complex carbohydrates like oatmeal rather than candy made up of simple carbohydrates and sugar.
Eat a serving of omega 3’s three times a week. To help you study better and prepare for your test, consider incorporating omega 3’s into your diet. These nutrients have been found to boost your ability to concentrate and stay alert. You can get these nutrients from salmon, herring, mackerel, trout and sardines. Eat dark veggies and fruits for antioxidants that help your cognitive abilities. Oxidants will damage your cell membranes and fruit like blueberries are a great example of a fruit high in antioxidants that protect your brain cells., To help with your mental well being as well as your physical health, try to incorporate about 2 ½ hours of moderately intense (power walking, cycling) exercise into your schedule per week. This will help you relax and concentrate on your test and studies. If you are interested in sports, often times there are intramural teams that meet at parks that you can play on for free or little cost. Inquire at your school or local parks department.Consider renting a workout DVD from the library or doing a video workout online with friends or family every day or every other day.


If you feel like you don’t have the time, take 15 minute walks around your campus when you need a break. This will help you focus better once you get back to studying.
Go on jogs first thing in the morning to give you energy.
Look for ways to get exercise without going out of your way. For example, if you are in school, walk to class rather than taking a bus, or take the stairs instead of the elevator."

Clear your plate of obligations.,
Keep track of your progress by taking practice tests.,
Study the areas you are weak in.,
Stay focused on your outline.",How to Prepare for Competitive Exams3," Most competitive exams are composed of different parts. For example, the GRE is comprised of math, verbal, and essay components. In order to do targeted studying and practice you need to best prepare for the test, you will need to take a practice test to determine which areas of the test you need to focus on the most.

If not, do your best to determine what kind of problems you are missing, and look for patterns in the mistakes you are making so that you know what to focus on in your studying.When testing, don’t consider each question unique. There are different types of questions that recur in tests. For example, on the English portion of the ACT, test questions come from these categories: grammar & usage, punctuation, sentence structure, strategy, organization, and style., Take more time studying the concepts that you are having trouble with. For example, if you are having difficulty correctly answering the questions about sentence structure in the ACT, use your practice book to study lessons on sentence structure. Consider getting help from someone who is strong in the area you are struggling in, like a teacher or a friend.

, The stress that comes from studying for competitive tests can be overwhelming at times because of the amount that you have to study. Make sure to combat that stress by concentrating on studying one lesson at a time. Remind yourself that you have to go through this test prep one step at a time, and don’t let yourself worry about mastering the whole test in a short period of time.Do not try to learn everything at once, cramming will not help you deeply understand the content you are learning.

Remove distractions while you study.,
Study in different spaces.,
Reframe your mindset when you feel bored.,
Psych yourself down.",How to Prepare for Competitive Exams4," One way to make the practice of studying more manageable is if you set up a routine of removing all distractions from your study space. Looking at your phone or computer will break your focus and ability to study well. Make sure that you put all of your electronics away and that you are working in a space that will help you focus. For example, there should be no televisions or distractions in the background. , New research is showing that people retain more information if they study in different locations.You will be able to focus better when you change your scenery because it keeps your alert. For example, you can move from one room in your house to another when you find yourself losing momentum.


Try to go to spaces that have a different feel. For example, you might want to switch between rooms painted different colors and/or with different lighting.

, Consider the things you could learn from studying this material, and focus on the positive rather than dwelling on your feelings of boredom. Think about the potential ways you could apply this information to your life or find it useful. , When we get ready for a test either by studying or taking the test, oftentimes we tense up by instinct. Oftentimes tensing up is a habit we have had for years, and it makes studying or taking a test more difficult than it needs to be. This is because we become overly aroused by our nervousness, and it makes it harder to concentrate on what we need to do. To combat this negative instinct, try these simple techniques to help you to relax:Tense up your muscles briefly and then release. Tense all of your muscles, for example, close your eyes tight, raise your toes up, clench your fists, tense your legs, clench your buttocks, etc. Breathe in a deep breath, and hold it in for a few seconds while your body remains tense. After about 5 seconds, let go all at once, and enjoy the sensation of releasing your built up tension.
Close your eyes and concentrate on the tip of your nose with your eyes. Pay attention to your breathing. Notice how the breath that you breathe in is cooler and the breathe you breath out warmer. Continue breathing in and out and maintaining your focus on your nose until you calm down.

Do your best on the test.,
Reward yourself.",How to Prepare for a Test," In order to ensure that you are familiar with the test material, make plans to study on a regular basis. Organize your time so that you will have studied all your notes by the test date. Giving your brain enough time to process the information will allow you to recall more information when taking the test. It may help to write down your plans in a calendar or planner so that you are aware of the deadline. Avoid procrastination, as your brain will retain very little from cramming sessions.;
, By listing your objectives and setting them in stone, you will be able to plan your schedule as needed. Once you see what you need to accomplish, you can organize your priorities in order to ensure that your missions are completed. However, be sure that you realize your limits and do not go overboard; otherwise, you may quickly become overwhelmed.

, Maybe you could display what you have learned in a spider diagram or map out when, what, how and why you learned these certain things.

, Keep the important points in mind, and ignore unnecessary information. As long as you remain focused on the main topics and state the facts, you will be able to do well on the test.

, When the need arises, it is best to receive direct help from the professional. Ask your teacher to summarize the topic with all the important points. You could also ask him/her for a set of questions and answers that could help you memorize the information. If your notes are unreliable, find another student and ask to copy his/her notes.

, Fit reviewing into everyday life by sticking up notes with sentences you need to remember for the test written upon them. You will notice it everyday and it won't seem too boring or dull. You could possibly put one on the bathroom mirror, one at the table and another by the TV. This is optional but highly recommended.

, Once you have studied all the information, quiz yourself using flash cards or a set of questions to make sure that you understand the material. You could also ask a family member or a friend for help.


Gathering your friends into a study group is another option, although you should make sure that they don't distract you.

, Find out how much you remember certain things and what's missing.


Decide what you did well in and what you did not so well in. This may boost your chances at getting more marks in the assessment and may also help you remember for next time. For instance, if you are struggling on maths problems based on geometry, then put this down as something that you need to review that tiny bit more than the subjects you are good at.







, Do not push yourself and try reviewing everything in one day. Practice takes time and if you rush, you won't remember anything.

, During your study sessions, it is important to clear all pressure and stress from your body. You should calm yourself down in order to retain as much information as possible. Find an appropriate study location that has a relaxing atmosphere, such as the outdoors. Add soft music for a pleasant environment. If you find that you are having trouble focusing, stop for a short time and participate in a relaxing activity.

, In between study sessions, lie down on a hard surface for at least ten minutes to allow your brain to rest. You can participate in relaxing activities to relieve your body of stress or pressure. You can refill your energy levels by grabbing healthy snacks, such as fruits and nuts. If necessary, set a timer to remind yourself when your break is over.


Give yourself a blissful break in between. After reviewing, do something which will take your mind off things. Maybe go bowling or have a warm shower to release stress and to relax.







, Although you may be nervous about taking it, understand that your life does not depend upon it. As long as you finish your assignments and do well on your other tests, one test will not drastically affect your grade, as there are other projects to support it. Understand that as long as you employ effective study methods, you will do well.

, Someone may be reviewing more than you or not reviewing at all, but don't worry about this. You should review until you understand the subject fully. Everyone practices to different extents. Some will learn slower than others and some will learn quicker. This does not affect your intelligence.

, Be sure that you receive at least eight hours of sleep per night, as this is essential to keeping your brain healthy and focused. A lack of sleep will cause your energy level to deplete, resulting in an inability to pay close attention to important tasks. You should consider going to bed early in order to ensure that you are well rested.


It is important that you sleep on the night before the test. Avoid staying up to cram, as your brain will not be able to retain the information. You will have no energy for the next day.
Set yourself a bedtime about half-an-hour earlier than your usual bedtime so that you get more time sleeping. Also, while you are trying to get to sleep, don't let those worries eat away at your mind. Another day will come and that is another bunch of opportunities awaiting. Just forget about stressing over the tests and think positive thoughts inside your mind. Now is your time to relax and you don't want to let your worries take over.







, On the day of the test, eat a healthy breakfast to ensure that you have enough energy to get through the day. Give yourself a quick review on the test material, but avoid cramming as that will do you little good. Tell yourself that you have done your best to study, and that's all that matters.

, Whatever the results of your test, give yourself a prize for studying so hard. As long as you do your best, you deserve a treat for working so hard. However, once you receive your test results, check to see which areas you could improve in and whether your study methods could use work. Adjust accordingly and aim to do even better next time.

Choose your GRE word list material.,
Choose a reading domain.,
Start reading alphabetically.,
Learn the basic structure of a word.,
Start making your own notes on words.,
Unlike associating roots, this method is useful just for the one word, but is a very effective way of memorizing.,
Shortlist the words after a while.,
Make different groups of words.,
Group similar words together.,
Review words with audio recordings.,
Make up verbal questions when reviewing words.,
There is no short cut to revision.The word list works on a simple principle: ""Out of sight, out of mind"".",How to Prepare a Word List for the GRE General Test," A good GRE word list is believed to be made up of 3000 to 6000 words. Before you start reading from the material you have chosen, verify its authenticity by surveying its reviews from internet sources or interviewing GRE test takers who scored high. The more words you learn, the greater the probability your exam success will increase.;
, Reading the word list is the most convenient method to start with and you can adjust your speed according to your ability.


If you prefer reading from hard copy, then it is a good idea to create print outs, making sure that your material has a lot of space around each word. You may also want to make notes on many of the words.
It is easy to remember words when you can attach screen clippings as pictures and recordable audio files to each word, so consider software like Microsoft One Note for making your reading domain. In that case, create an editable soft copy of your material.

, Alphabetical grouping is one among many ways of grouping the words. It is a good method to start with as it gives you a clear distinction to different but similar sounding words or words under same prefix/suffix. Initially, you may find the list difficult and lengthy, but it gets better with more revision and you will get better at it.

,


A word can be made up with a prefix/suffix, one or more roots, or a combination of those.
Learn about common prefixes and suffixes; they can help you recognize if the word is a noun/verb/adjective/adverb.
Try to recognize the root part of the word. The basic meaning of a word comes from the root.
For example, incumbent (adjective)means 'lying upon something /obligatory'.
Break up the word into smaller parts: 'in+ cumb+ ent'.
'In' means 'upon/on' as a prefix, 'cumb' comes from Latin root 'cumbere', which means to recline; 'ent' is a suffix, which makes the word likely to be an adjective or a noun.

,


The goal is to memorize a word with its meaning. Here are some ways you can master a word:


'Find the root of a word.'


Many English words are based upon Greek or Latin roots. Remembering a word by its root will not only make that word easy to memorize, but will also make other words with the same root understandable.
For example, in the word ""incumbent"", the root “cumbere” means ""to recline"". If you remember the root ""cumbere,"" you may guess the meaning of words like ""recumbent"" (which means ""lying down or reclining"").
The best way to find out the root of a word is to search for it on any good online dictionary. It is a good idea to make a note of the root word with its meaning next to your word in the reading domain.
You may find some sites and materials from the internet with ready-made lists of the same root words.


'""Try associating audio visuals with words.""

, You can take a great advantage of this method if your reading domain is a software which lets you insert screen clippings and audios next to a word, but even if you are reading in conventional ways, you can sketch out a small rough diagram next to a word or try to ""write"" a sound effect. The point of this method is to associate a sound or a picture with a word in your mind. It does not have to be perfect in your reading domain.

For example, ""perpetual"", (meaning 'everlasting') can be associated with a screen clipping of a perpetual motion machine or a rough diagram of it next to the word.
Many picture flashcard materials are available online, but those cards may not be customized as per your need, so if you plan to use them, make sure you don't spend a lot of time on the words you already know.



Make mnemonics.


This works fantastically for some words. “Mnemonics” means an aid for remembering. It can be silly, irrelevant or very personalized, but it should serve the purpose of memorizing.
For example, ""nascent"" (which means 'emerging') can be remembered as 'New soul sent! abscond' (which means 'to depart secretly and hide') can be remembered as 'absent in a second'!
You can use mnemonic websites to find ready-made mnemonics. If English is not your first language, try finding out sites which have mnemonics that you will find easiest to understand; this may broaden your mnemonic scope.

, After repeating the list for a couple of times, you will face difficulties memorizing only a certain number of words. It is a good idea to highlight them or distinguish them in some way, so next time when you revise the list, you can emphasize only those words, which will save you time.

,


After going through the word list alphabetically for a couple of times, you will be able to group words by their meaning, relevance to an object or similarly rhyming ends or beginnings, etc. For example, groups can be made of synonyms, for example, words related to literature/poetry/church/money, etc.
Learning words by groups is a good way to memorize words the other way around - by associating each word with its meaning rather than associating each meaning with a word.
One way to form such groups is to keep a symbol (for example, '$' for words related to money) in your mind and whenever a word related to it appears, insert or write the symbol in its margin. By doing so, you can easily combine all the related words at the end.
You can find such ready-made groups from the internet.

,


The most confusing words are those which have similar spellings or pronunciations. It is a good idea, therefore, to group them together and be clear about their different meanings.
For example: 'abate – abet; imminent – eminent- immanent; spire - aspire - conspire - inspire – perspire – respire – suspire – transpire'.
Some online dictionaries and some dictionary software allow you to find words starting with or ending with a particular word phrase or words that sound the same.

,


It is worth searching online for audio recordings of your word list. There is a great chance that someone has already recorded it. If you get them ready-made, you can download them in your mobile phone. If not, you can use your mobile phone for recording the words that you find difficult and hear them over and over again.
This is a great way to revise your word list while physically doing other mandatory activities such as traveling/walking/exercising/cooking/eating, etc. At the same time, you can save the time you were supposed to spend upon vocabulary.

,


The GRE exam does not test you on words and their meanings. Instead, they are presented in relationships linked by sentences or in some references. By practicing those kinds of questions (the kind that are asked in the GRE exam), you can strengthen your word power along with getting adapted to tricks for solving those questions. This technique is more beneficial if the word list has been revised at least a couple of times.

, It is very less probable that anyone will memorize the whole world list without missing a single word, but the goal is to minimize the percentage of forgotten words as much as possible. Your main weapon to fight an unknown question in verbal section is your word power. It is advisable to allot a considerable time to GRE preparation to the word list, but smart work can save you a big chunk of time. Regular repetitions and reflection for a little time after, can strengthen your memory power for the word list.

Find out the exact dates of your exams.,
Prioritise your subjects.,
Decide on a revision plan which will work for you.,
Fill in your revision timetable in with your subjects, and use your priority list to give the most important ones more revision time.

,
Stick to this timetable!,
Begin by revising all the material which you don't know as well.,
Actually attempt to remember the material.,
Read the facts a few times so you are familiar with what they mean.,
After you are more familiar with them, make your own notes so that it's shorter, but ensure that they make sense so you won't need to refer back to the test book when revising.

,
Don't do too much at once.",How to Plan Your Revision Well," You will know how much time you have left before each exam. It might help to draw up a table which includes all your subjects and all the weeks you have until the last exam, and then fill in the exam dates.;
, If you think you have most to do in science or that is your weakest subject then this will be top priority. Put all your subjects in an order from most to least important.

, How many hours do you need to do of a night? Do you have other commitments you can't get out of? Leave some time for breaks,meals and free time but ensure you have a good time slot each night for revision.

,, speaking from experience, if you decide to focus solely on one or two subjects because you think you know the others, you will get a nasty shock. Don't ignore any of the subjects, but ensure you have a balance where your priority subjects have the lead.

, There is no point in beginning to revise the digestive system in science if you are pretty confident in it. You may find that also prioritising each individual subjects modules or topics helps you. Therefore if you run out of time you will know that you have definitely revised the hardest stuff!

, It sounds stupid but most of the time people are tempted to spend all their revision time just reading or writing and assume that they know it all. Never assume; 'it makes an ASS out of U and ME' and its true. If you assume you know it without actually testing yourself on it then you might get a shock in the exam...

, If there's anything you don't understand do everything you can to find out. Ask the teacher, research other books and on the Internet. You will be learning as you do it!

,, Take a page and test yourself by covering it up and writing down everything you remember. Then, check it and do it again and again until you have everything! This way you are testing and revising as you re-read it over again!

Some people find exams no big deal, but most people find them at least a little stressful. Your body may react the way it would if it perceived a physical danger, often called the ""fight or flight"" reaction. Your body--unaware that this test is an academic assessment and not a man-eating tiger-- prepares you by getting you ready for an all-out freak-out. This can cause you to feel:


A tightening of the stomach.
Headaches
General nervousness or jumpiness.
Sweaty palms.;
, Often people stay up all night to study, but this is ineffective since you retain very little information when you are tired. It is better that you get a good night's sleep, so that you can concentrate and get all the brain power you need for the next day.

, Sitting all day can be bad for your health. Getting some active time is very important while studying. Break up your study sessions so you can clear your mind and get some fresh air. Try going for a quick jog or perform jumping jacks to get the blood flowing.

, With little time to spare, people often resort to unhealthy foods which are quick and easy to prepare. These foods can make it harder to concentrate and are bad for your health. Keep your diet nutritious and drink lots of water.

, Having the energy to stay awake all night won't be any use to you; it will be harder to concentrate, you will make more mistakes and learn information incorrectly. Instead, try limiting yourself to one coffee a day and organize your time so you don't have to stay up all night.

, Remember to take some time to relax and regenerate. Avoid mental exhaustion by doing something you enjoy so that you can have a clear and happy mind. Try meditation or yoga for a deeper relaxation.

, Write up a timetable to managing study and leisure. Make your study periods reasonable and manageable. Factor in break days and time off, being stressed out is just as bad as not studying.

, Be realistic about how well you will perform and don't get your parents' hopes too high. On the other hand, if you are expected to get a good result tell them to back down. While it can be beneficial to want to do well and put pressure on yourself, remember that grades aren't everything and in the long term it won't matter if you have to do the test again.

, Laugh and keep time to be with your friends. Don't be embarrassed to be studying; you could even encourage them to study with you and make it fun.

, Try to stop alcohol, smoking, dope, cocaine, heroin or any other thing you might take. Even if they help you concentrate and retain information, it is short term. In the longer outlook, it will make you feel worse and badly affect your health.

, If things are getting difficult, don't be afraid to ask your teachers or other people who work at your institute. If you are going crazy and getting anxious, see the counselor.

Review the exam.",How to Pass Your Mid Terms," Most teachers and professors will have a midterm study guide with course content that should be reviewed before taking the exam. Ask your professor or teacher to provide you with a print or electronic study guide with specific subjects or areas to review. Study guides should have comprehensive information reviewing the overall content of the course up until the midterm. They often have specific content, chapters, sections, or areas that need review and can occasionally have sample questions.Look for key terms, test format, and example questions on the study guide. If they are not on the study guide reach out to your professor!
If your teacher does not have a study guide, ask to meet with your teacher or professor outside of class to review materials for the midterm.;
, Study groups can be effective ways of setting deadlines and sharing knowledge to better review and understand the content that could be on your midterm. Create a schedule with your study group detailing what content will be covered during what times. Study groups can be organized in a variety of ways, from assigning specific material to individuals to all collectively sharing each section. Some teachers or professors may even require you to meet in groups to ensure that you all study for the exam.Have a discussion with your group to discuss people’s strengths and weaknesses to better understand how you should organize the study schedule. For example, if one of you feels confident and proficient in one area then that person could lead the group in reviewing that area. If you all feel less than proficient then divide the section into parts.
Start a group if one does not already exist. Be proactive about your midterm preparation and ask fellow students if they would like to meet regularly to study together.

, Set your studying schedule weeks in advance so that you can review specific sections as well as the overall format of the exam with enough time to fully retain the information. Try to study for the exam right after the class ends to help deepen the connections between materials. Making the schedule as detailed as possible will help you stick to a strict routine and improve your ability to recall the information come the exam.


Try following your study guide if you have one. Write the dates and hours you plan on spending next to specific areas, subjects, or sections.
Try to spend at least one hour studying for each exam per day up to 3 weeks before the exam date. Increasing your studying by 1-2 hours the week of the exam will help solidify your retention.
Take a 30 minute snack or exercise break for every 2-3 hours of studying., Cramming large amounts of information in a short period of time will make it difficult to easily recall all of the information you’ll need to pass an exam. Cramming also will impact your sleep schedule and cause anxiety as cramming sessions frequently extend into early hours of the morning.Stick to a study schedule before your exam to avoid cramming. Remember to take breaks frequently to avoid burning out.

, Getting plenty of sleep will help you be focused for study sessions and test taking. All-nighters can impact memory and retention for up to four days, so it’s best to get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Make sure to set an alarm if you plan on studying late into the night so that you have a set time to stop studying and get some sleep.Try studying the most difficult material before bed as it can be easier to recall in the morning., It’s easy to binge on junk food and drink caffeinated beverages while studying. However, it’s best to stick to simple, healthy foods and water to fuel you through long study sessions and promote retention. Try to prepare food ahead of time, whether meals or snacks, so that you don’t wait until the last minute and make unhealthy choices.Your body consumes large amounts of glucose while studying.
Make sure to eat lots of whole grains, high-quality protein, and plenty of vegetables.

, Cardiovascular exercise has been shown to improve your energy and memory. Schedule your studying around regular exercise to provide yourself with breaks and to improve your results.Try going on brisk walks or short jogs for 15 minute intervals between study sessions.
If your teacher has recorded their lectures, put one on a mp3 player and listen to it while you jog or walk to get a little extra studying in.

, Bringing extra pencils and pens to your exam will help you avoid any emergencies caused by running out of ink or lead. Some instructors forbid talking or getting out of your seat while the exam is in session, so be sure to sharpen all of your pencils before the exam and have them out on your desk so that you don’t have to dig for them in your bag.If you forget extras the day of your exam, ask a friend if you can borrow one or more pencils or pens for the duration of the exam.

, Read the entire exam and look for instructions before beginning to answer questions. Look for general exam instructions at the beginning and read for specific instructions as each section changes. Reviewing the entire exam will help you gauge the format of the exam as well as spot questions that you might need to allot more time to.Reading over the exam can also provide useful information for other sections. For example, there may be a later section in the exam that answers a few questions in an earlier section.
Read instructions carefully. Your instructor might ask you to only answer 8 out of 10 short answer questions or have other qualifiers for multiple choice, true/false, and long answers.

, If you arrive at a question that you do not have an answer to, mark it, move on, and return to it later. Stressing over questions that you might not have an answer to right away can take up time, cause anxiety, and inhibit recalling information that you might need for other questions.Have a system for marking questions you don’t know, like drawing a circle or check mark in pencil next to the question number.

, Some questions, like long written answers or essays, are often worth more in points or percentage. Spending more time on these questions will help you have a better chance of raising the overall grade of your test. If you anticipate not being able to finish, or working until the last second of the allotted time, start with questions that are worth more and return to other questions after.Return to questions, like multiple choice, matching, or true/false, after you’ve answered more difficult and complex questions.

, Even if you finished your exam with plenty of time left over, staying until the end of the allotted time will allow you to review your answers and make changes where necessary. Try to read through your entire exam from start to finish to check all your answers and make sure you haven’t left any blank.Review questions that you answered hastily, or spend time going over high point or high percentage areas of the exam to ensure the best grade possible.

Only those who wish to enter a Specialized High School (or, one of 9 public high schools for especially talented students) are required to take this test.In order to qualify for the exam, you must:


Be a resident of New York City
Be in the 8th grade
Register for the SHSAT during the Fall of your 8th grade year
Be interested in attending a Specialized High School--most public schools do not require the exam
Eighth-graders can apply for the SHSAT no matter what school they attend--public, private, parochial, or home-schooled--as long as they are a resident of New York City.Some 9th graders can also take the exam for admission to grades 10-12.;
, There are over 400 public high schools in New York City. However, there are only 9 Specialized High Schools out of which just 8 require an exam.For these schools, a student's score on the SHSAT is the sole basis of admission--not essays, academic records, or letters of recommendation. These schools are:Bronx High School of Science
Brooklyn Latin
Brooklyn Technical High School
High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College
High School for American Studies at Lehman College
Queens High School for Sciences at York College
Staten Island Technical High School
Stuyvesant High School
The ninth Specialized High School is Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where admission depends on a student's audition and academic records, not the SHSAT., The SHSAT is formatted as a multiple-choice standardized test. It tests students on both their math and their verbal skills, and take 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete.There are 95 questions total on the exam (5 of them are scrambled paragraphs counting for 2 points each, so you can earn a raw score of 100 points).You can allot your time between the verbal and the math sections as you see fit.The verbal section asks students to read and interpret passages and answer logic questions. The scrambled paragraphs section of the test has been removed due to lack of teaching this in most schools. There are 45 verbal questions on the exam.The mathematics section requires students to answer questions that involve simple arithmetic, algebra, geometry, logic, probability, and statistics. Ninth-graders who take the test will also have to answer trigonometry questions.There are 50 mathematics questions on the exam.Scores are usually released in the February or March following the exam., While the specific dates of the exam change from year to year, students will take the SHSAT around mid-October. It is a good idea to take at least three months to study for the exam, which means you should start studying in July at the latest, though June is even better.This should give you a lot of time to take practice tests, find tutors if necessary, and figure out which kinds of problems you struggle with.


Don't leave all your studying to the Fall: you will be busy with school and other activities. Give yourself a chance to study during the summer break when you have more free time.
Some students even spend several years preparing for the SHSAT. If you are in 6th or 7th grade, you can certainly start studying early! However, don't panic if you haven't started studying yet: 3 or 4 months should give you lots of time to build up your test-taking skills., As soon as you think you might want to enter a Specialized High School program, you should talk it over with your guidance counselor. It is your guidance counselor's job to help students enter the high schools that are the best fit for them, and your guidance counselor will have a lot of knowledge and experience with test-taking preparation. Make an appointment to speak with your counselor, and consider bringing your parents along as well. Come up with a plan to increase your likelihood of admission to a Specialized High School.Your guidance counselor might be able to recommend specific books, classes, and tutors to help you as well.

, The Specialized High School Handbook is revised each year, and it provides middle-school students and their parents with important information about the admissions process. The 2016 version of the handbook can be accessed here: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/441F37BC-FF75-403D-B265-60F3B1F4C84D/0/2016SHSAT_English.pdf. The handbook includes study tips and practice tests as well as a list of exam dates. Read this handbook carefully, as soon as it is published online.Taking the practice exams in the handbook under test-like conditions is a great way to get a diagnostic for your general performance. Use your score on the practice tests as a baseline to help you determine your future test-taking strategies., The DREAM course is designed to help low-income students perform well on the SHSAT. The program begins in 6th grade and lasts for 22 months.It is an intensive, rigorous program, and students only qualify if they have excellent 5th-grade attendance, have qualifying scores on 5th-grade standardized tests, and are considered low-income.If this applies to you or someone you know, sign up for the course right away for 22 months of excellent, free study prep.

, There are several testing companies that provide excellent practice questions and study tips in their published guides. Reputable companies include Kaplan, the Princeton Review, Barron's, and McGraw-Hill.Most large bookstores and online book providers will have study guides you can purchase, for between $15-30. Additionally, online SHSAT options have become available in the last few years at a similar price range under $50 annually.


Online courses may require a good internet connection and computing device, but typically they cover more content and features than study guides.
If you purchase a study guide in a used book store, make sure that the practice tests have not been filled in. The most useful parts of these books are the practice tests, and you don't want to take a practice test where the answers have already been filled in!
Make sure you are purchasing the most updated study guide you can. The test's format has changed some over the years, and you should not practice with an outdated guide.
Additional SHSAT guidance is available from non-profit organizations and various online test preparation courses.

, You can pay a test prep company to receive specialized training leading up the the SHSAT. There are numerous SHSAT courses offered, through companies like Kweller Test Prep, Kaplan, and the Princeton Review, as well as other private tutoring companies. This can be an expensive option, costing anywhere from $800-1500 for 8-15 lessons.However, students who require some extra attention and guidance than what is found in a study guide might find a special course useful.


Most courses can be taken the summer before the exam, though there are some last-minute courses that are offered in the early fall as well.
As a middle ground option, for under $50, an alternative is to enroll in an online course. Many of these include extensive practice materials and the ability to interact with tutors and track your progress

, If you require one-on-one attention in order to perform well on the kinds of questions asked on the SHSAT, you can hire a private tutor. Private tutors can be found through tutoring agencies, Craigslist, online searches, or through personal recommendations. Tutors vary widely in price, though $100 per session is a common figure.

, New York City offers a wide variety of enrichment programs that are free or very low-cost to qualifying students.These programs can help with homework, math skills, study skills, reading and writing, science, and the arts.Even though they are not necessarily tailored to the SHSAT, the kinds of skills they help middle-schoolers build can help them perform well on the test. This is a great option for students who cannot afford a specialized course., One of the best ways for any student to do well on the SHSAT is to keep up with schoolwork. Do your homework, pay attention in class, and study for your school exams. These will help build many of the SHSAT skills naturally and gradually. It is also help for you to read widely in order to build your vocabulary., If you like, you can search on Facebook or Twitter for students that currently attend the school of your choice. Ask them for any suggestions or tips on taking the test.


Many schools also offer open houses, fairs, or other events to introduce students to potential high schools. Network with other students and potential students at these events to get their advice about the exam (and to determine whether you wish to attend the school!)., Do so under your testing conditions: silent, without a calculator, using a number 2 pencil. Follow the exact time limits of the exam and answer the proper amount of questions. These practice tests will not only help you figure out what you need to study most, but they are also essential to getting you comfortable and relaxed enough to perform well the day of the test., Be aware of the items that you must bring to the exam. It is best if you have these ready to go the day before the test, so that you don't have to worry the day of the exam. Do not bring any electronic devices with you such as a calculator or ipad: you are not allowed to use these items on the test.What you should bring are:Several well-sharpened number 2 pencils
A watch to keep time (make sure the watch does not have a calculator or computer function, however: those are not permitted)
Your Test Ticket with your signature and the signature of your parent/guardian as well as your ranking of the specialized high schools you wish to apply to
Comfortable clothes and shoes

, Listen to your proctor, and read the written instructions carefully. Breaking any of the rules might lead to your test being invalidated.Do not attempt to go over time, exchange answers, or use an electronic device during the test.

, You can use your test booklet for scratch paper. However, your official answers have to be entered into the formal answer sheet. This is a multiple-choice test scored by machine, so you have to be careful to fill in the correct bubble on your answer sheet. Be sure that you do not accidentally fill in two bubbles for the same question, since that will automatically count as a wrong answer. Make sure that the number on your answer sheet matches the number in your test booklet: it can be easy to accidentally skip over a number, leading you to inadvertently answer questions incorrectly., Unlike other exams, the SHSAT does not penalize for wrong answers. This means that you should put an answer down for every question, even if you are not confident in your answer. By random chance, you might get it right. You will certainly get it wrong if you put nothing down., Unlike other exams, the SHSAT does not allocate your time for you. You have 2.5 hours to do the entire test: how you divide that time between math and verbal is up to you. Many people like to spend 75 minutes on each part of the exam. However, depending on your strengths, you might wish to spend more time on one portion or the other.Use your watch to make sure that you are staying on track in order to complete all 95 questions within the 150 minutes you have.


If you have a tutor or guidance counselor, she might be able to help you come up with an optimal plan for how you will spend your time during the test.

, It can be tempting to rush through an exam. However, jumping to conclusions can be harmful to your score. Take your time and make sure that you understand what the question asks of you. Resist the temptation to skim questions and make assumptions without a firm basis., Many of the verbal questions depend on your understanding of various reading passages. Do not skim these passages: read them slowly and carefully, underlining key words and phrases. The questions will quiz you on your understanding of the detail and nuance of the passages: a quick skim of the passage will not give you the information you need to do well., The jumbled paragraph questions will provide you with a list of sentences that you have to place in the correct order. It is worth taking some extra time to focus on these paragraphs because they are worth 2 points, whereas the other questions on the exam are worth just 1 point. Do not rush through these since they double-count toward your score."

,
Study these topics for mathematics: Complex numbers, Circle, Parabola, Hyperbola in Co-ordinate Geometry, Probability, Limits, Vectors, Matrices in Algebra, Functions, Differentiability, Definite Integral in Calculus and Application of Derivatives.

,
Prepare yourselves mentally for IIT-JEE.,
Do continuous effort.,
Have proper guidance.",How to Pass the IIT JEE Exams," In physics, chemistry and mathematics, all the topics should be covered and selective study should be avoided since the questions are of an objective type, as well as being large in number.;
,,,,, ""The success is to be achieved"", keeping this in mind the aspirants must accept themselves as deserving candidates for JEE success because during preparation confidence plays an important role.

, IIT-JEE preparation requires continuous effort. Each subject must be given proper and regular time. Instead of preparing one subject for some days then other subjects, all the three subjects (Physics, Chemistry and (Mathematics) must be given time each day. It also helps in breaking monotony.

, In today's competitive era, proper guidance is needed for success. The pattern of JEE has become concept based completely. So you need clear and doubtless concepts in each and every topic, to achieve a good rank in JEE.

Get a good night's sleep.,
Do something fun.,
Pack your bag the night before.,
Eat a healthy breakfast.",How to Pass the STAAR Test1," You will do better on your test if you are well rested. If you are sleepy, you will have difficulty thinking and will be more forgetful. If you are a teenager, you need between 8-10 hours of sleep a night.If you are between the ages of 6 and 13, you need 9-11 hours of sleep each night.Cramming for the test the night before won't help you. It is better to relax and get a good night's sleep instead.
Adjust your schedule the week of the test so you can get enough rest.;
, Don't spend the night before your test worrying about it. Do an activity that you enjoy and that will take your mind off of things. Spend time with your friends or family, watch a movie, play video games, or read a magazine that is not school related.


You will do better on the test if you are relaxed and in a good mood.

, You do not want to be in a rush the morning of your test. This can cause you to feel even more nervous and anxious. Pack your school bag the night before with everything you will need for the day.


Make sure you have all necessary materials for the test, including pencils and erasers.

, Wake up early enough to eat a nutritious breakfast. Food is necessary to fuel your brain. If you take your test without eating, you will be more distracted and have problems concentrating. Do not experiment or try any new foods the day of your test either.Good breakfast choices include fruit, whole grain-cereal, and protein rich foods (e.g. eggs, nuts, and yogurt).
Stay away from processed and sugary foods such as cookies, cakes, etc. Also avoid eating a carbohydrate (e.g. bread, pancakes, etc.) heavy breakfast because it will cause you to feel sluggish and sleepy.
If you do not feel like eating in the morning, try having a smoothie or a breakfast shake.

"
"
Read each question carefully.,
Monitor your time.,
Stick with your first answer.",How to Pass the STAAR Test2," Before you answer a question, read the entire question before you choose an answer. It is important to do this even if you already feel like you know the answer. Underline any words that are important or that stand out to you. If the question is difficult to understand, try to rewrite/rephrase the question so it makes sense to you.Be sure to follow any written or verbal instructions you receive about the test.
If you are unsure about an answer, eliminate the answers you know are wrong and choose between the other possible choices. This will increase your chances of getting the question right.

, The STAAR test is a timed test. Wear a watch or make sure you can see the clock during your test. Your teacher will probably give you warnings about the time, but you should keep track of it as well.


If you have extra time, go back and double check your answers.
Be sure to leave some time at the end to answer the questions that you skipped. It is better to guess than to leave a question unanswered. For example, if you have 45 minutes to complete a section, try to finish in 40 minutes so you have time to go back.

, When you take a test, the first answer that you choose is usually the best answer. You get into trouble when you begin to second guess yourself. Do not got back and change your answer unless you are absolutely sure.If you go completely blank on a question, skip it and come back to it later.You do not want to waste time thinking about one question when you could be answering the questions that you already know.
Make some type of mark by the questions that you skipped. You do not want to forget to go back and answer them.

"
"
Take a deep breath.,
Pause if you experience fear.,
Focus on one question at a time.",How to Pass the STAAR Test3," If you find yourself getting anxious during the test, stop and take a deep breath.Close your eyes and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Take a couple of breaths and then get back to your test.


Practice deep breathing before you take your test so you can get in the habit of doing it.
As you take a deep breath, tell yourself, ""I am in control. Everything is going to be fine.""
If you get a headache, start sweating, feel like you might pass out, get butterflies in your stomach, start sweating, or start shaking, you may be feeling anxious. These are signs that you should take a deep breath., Test taking can be scary. If you experience fear or become overwhelmed during the test, stop and acknowledge it. When you pause, remind yourself about the task at hand. The task is to answer the question in front of you.If your mind goes blank or you feel like you have no idea what you are doing all of a sudden, you may also be experiencing fear. Fear is completely normal. You will not be able to eliminate fear completely, but you can manage it so it does not affect your test.
Place your hand on your belly and take 3 deep breaths. As you inhale and exhale, notice how your belly gets bigger then smaller. You can also write the word ""breathe"" at the top of your test booklet to remind you take deep breaths when you begin to feel stressed out.Tell yourself, ""I can do this,"" or ""Just keep going.""

, It is easy to get worked up about a test. You may be thinking about what will happen if you do not pass or how many more questions you have to answer. You may still be thinking about the last question you answered. Stay in the present and answer one question at a time.If your mind begins to wander, bring it back and tell yourself, ""I will only focus on one question at a time.
If you tend to have problems focusing or get nervous every time you take a test, talk to a teacher, parent, or school counselor about it. They can help you with other techniques to stay calm during the test.
Tell yourself, ""I am smart. I can do this."""
"
Understand the test components.,
Do practice questions.,
Talk to your teacher about developing a study schedule.,
Pay attention in class.,
Work with a standardized-test taking tutor.",How to Pass the STAAR Test4," Become familiar with the test subjects and format of the test before your exam date. You do not want to be surprised by anything when you take the test. The test structure will vary depending on what grade you are in.If you are in 3rd grade, your test will include reading and mathematics.
If you are in 4th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, and writing.
If you are in 5th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, writing, and science.
If you are in 6th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, writing, and science.
If you are in 7th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, and writing.
If you are in 8th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, science, and social studies.
If you are in high school, you will have end-of-course (EOC) assessments for English I, English II, Algebra I, biology and U.S history.

, Your teacher will give you practice questions at school, but you should also do some practice questions on your own. Visit the Texas Education Agency website and click on the ""Student Testing and Accountability"" section. Once you are in that section go to ""Testing,"" ""State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR),"" and then click on ""STAAR Released Test Questions."" Find the questions that correspond to your grade level.You can see the practice questions and the answers. Try to answer the questions without looking at the answers.
Commit to studying for a designated amount of time.For example, you may spend an hour on Tuesdays and Saturdays doing STAAR practice questions.

, Having a regular study schedule is more effective than cramming for your test. You need to spend enough time studying for your STAAR without neglecting your other school work.You may study only once a week or every other week in the beginning of the school year and then increase your study time as the test approaches. You may be studying 3 or 4 times a week as your test date gets closer.


An appropriate study schedule varies by each student. If you took the STAAR test last year, pay attention to the areas that you struggled in and devote more study time to those.
If you did not take the STAAR test last year, spend more time in the general subject areas that you struggle in. For example, you may spend more time studying mathematics than reading.

, Your teacher will prepare you for your STAAR test during the school year. Your curriculum will include the things that you need to know. It is important that you pay attention in class, take notes, and do your homework. Your teacher may do more intense STAAR prep in the weeks leading up to your test. This is a time that you really need to focus.


If you do not understand a concept or have a question, get help from your teacher as soon as you can. If you wait until it is time for your test, it may be too late.
Try to be a good student throughout the school year, not just a few weeks before the test. This will increase your chances of passing the STAAR.

, A tutor that is experienced with standardized test taking can help you prepare for the test. A tutor can help assess your skills and teach you standardized test taking techniques. Your tutor can also develop a study plan based on your skills and how soon you need to take your exam.


Some private tutoring organizations such as 'Mathnasium' (math learning center) and Sylvan Learning offer STAAR specific training.You can also ask your teacher or school counselor about any prep programs in your area.

48 questions that require you to read written passages to find the answer. These passages can be about lots of different things. Art, history, and science are three common topics. You don't need to know about these topics before the test.
19 questions that require you to complete sentences with the appropriate word/concept.
Some questions will test your vocabulary. Others will require you to comment on a reading selection (e.g., ""Which of these words best describes the author's tone?"");
, The math section is just what it sounds like — a chance for you to show how well you do math problems. You can (and should) use a calculator for the math section. All scientific calculators and most graphing calculators are eligible.You can expect:Two 25-minute sections and a 20-minute one (70 minutes total)
44 multiple-choice questions
10 questions that require you to write out your answer.
Problems are taken from four main focus areas:



Numbers and operations
Algebra and Functions
Geometry and measurement
Statistics and probability




For this section, you're provided with a selection of important geometrical formulas. Click here to see this sheet., Though it's called the ""Writing"" section, there's only one place where you'll actually have to write. Most of the section is actually made up of multiple-choice questions that test your ability to think and judge pieces of writing like a good writer. You can expect:One 25-minute written essay, one 25-minute multiple choice segment, and one 10-minute multiple choice segment (60 minutes total)
The essay requires you to read and respond to a short prompt. Generally, the prompt presents a philosophical or moral question without a ""right"" answer. It's your job to choose a stance and give a strong argument.
The multiple choice questions require you to communicate ideas clearly and intelligently. You will need to pick fixes for pieces of writing that contain errors.

, Don't waste time and energy stressing over subjects that won't even appear on the test. Breathe easy — you don't need to worry about any of the following:


Specific facts, names, dates, and places. You'll probably be required to read passages from history, science, and the humanities, but all the information you'll need will be in the passage itself.
Scientific concepts. You don't need to worry about anything you covered in Chemistry, Biology, or Physics. You'll probably encounter passages about one or more of these topics, but you'll be judged on your ability to interpret and analyze the passages — not your ability to write chemical equations, diagram a cell, etc.
Logic and abstract reasoning. You won't be asked to piece your way through complex logic problems or create new philosophical proofs out of thin air. The SAT is designed to test your ability in skills you'd use at school.

, The best way to get a feel for the types of questions you'll find in this section is to do them. Luckily, it's easy to find practice questions online. A few helpful links are below.


The official SAT site has practice questions here.Majortests.com has practice questions here.Khanacademy has practice questions here., The passages in the Reading Comprehension section can cover a huge range of subjects. It's impossible to learn everything you might conceivably read during the test beforehand. Don't waste your practice time trying to become an expert in art, history, and so on. Instead, practice reading things that you aren't already familiar with. Here are just a few ideas:


Read short snippets or articles from science and art magazines, then have a friend ask you questions about them. Try to get a good mix of specific and abstract questions, like ""What was the article about?"" and ""How would you describe the author's tone?"" You can usually read these kinds of publications for free at your local library.
Pick a page from a book you haven't read, then try to write in your own words what seems to be happening. If there are characters on this page, try to describe their moods.

, Unfortunately, some of the questions in the Reading Comprehension section hinge on whether or not you know what certain words mean. Try to spend some of your time familiarizing yourself with ""fancy,"" academic words — adjectives are an especially smart choice.


For good sources of vocabulary SAT prep, use Word Dynamo on Dictionary.com, Knewton SAT prep, or College Board Vocabulary Prep. You can even make your own flashcards with SAT vocabulary lists, quizzing yourself when you have free time.
A good idea is to get familiar with the Greek and Latin roots that form the basis for many complicated words. Once you know these, it's easier to guess what words mean even if you've never heard them before. A good list is available here., Reading the passages in the section is vital for answering the questions. However, since the time you spend reading is time you can't use to answer questions, you'll want to get through the passages reasonably fast. If you're not the quickest reader, try to keep your pace up by focusing on the main concepts in each paragraph. It's better to get through the passage quickly and understand the general ideas in it than to get through it slowly and have only a slightly better understanding.


A good rule to get the general point of a passage is to read the whole beginning paragraph, then read the first sentence of each of the body paragraphs, and finish by reading the whole concluding paragraph.Some questions will reference a certain line in the passage. If you can find the answer by reading only this line, go with it. However, don't be afraid to read a sentence or two on either side of the line to get a better understanding.
If you don't understand a question, try going back and reading the paragraph(s) where the ideas in the question are discussed.

, Practicing the sorts of questions that will show up in the math section is a must. This will help sharpen your math skills and re-acquaint you with math topics that you may not have seen for a while. A few helpful links are below:


Official SAT math practice problems are available here.Practice problems from Majortests.com are available here.Khanacademy math practice problems are available here., When it comes to math problems, a single missed word can lead you to an incorrect answer. Be sure you understand what each question is asking you to do before you answer. You don't want to lose points on math problems you know how to solve because you overlooked something in the problem itself.


One smart rule is to look for key words and phrases that change your answer. These include things like ""other,"" ""besides,"" ""more,"" ""less,"" ""extra,"" ""in addition to,"" and so on.
For example, let's say you get this problem: A circle is divided by two lines that intersect in its center. One of the angles formed measures 33 degrees. How many other angles measure 33 degrees?



In this problem, there is just one other angle with this measurement, so don't pick two (the total number of 33 degree angles).





, Use what you know about math to remove answers as soon as you realize that they can't possibly be correct. This saves you time and makes it more likely that you'll get the right answer if you have to guess.


For example, let's say that you're asked to find the absolute value of x2 -3x + 4. You can instantly rule out any answer that's negative — absolute values always give positive results.

, In the SAT, you are allowed to write in your test booklet. It gets thrown away when you're done.Feel free to write, sketch or scribble anything you need to help you solve the problem. You don't get more points if you return your test booklet with no writing in it. You also get a small reference sheet with important geometrical formulas on it that you'll need to answer some of the questions.


You can consult this sheet as much as you want, but it's up to you to know which formulas to use when the time comes, so it's a good idea to practice questions that use these formulas anyway.

, You don't want to waste valuable time fiddling with a calculator you've never used before. Try to have at least a basic familiarity with your calculator before you take the test. If you can bring the calculator you practiced with, all the better.


You don't need to know how to use every single function on your calculator, but you should at least know how to do all the basic operations, how to enter exponents, and how to use scientific notation features. Being able to use an answer recall/memory feature can also be helpful.

, Just like for math and reading, practice makes perfect for the SAT writing section. A few helpful resources are below:


The essay prompts from the most recent SAT are available here.Official ""Improving Sentences"" multiple-choice practice problems are available here., Nothing's worse than churning your way 90% of the way through an essay only to find out at the end that you don't really know what your main point is. Avoid this by using a small amount of your essay-writing time (just a minute or two) to sketch out a broad, general outline. You can always make changes as you're writing. Having a plan will help you stay on-track and divide your limited time carefully.


Start by picking a stance on the problem the essay prompt gives you. This doesn't have to be something you passionately agree with — just something you can argue well. Next, write a few claims, facts, and ideas that support your argument. These will form the basis for your body paragraphs. Your conclusion can be a re-statement of your main idea.

, The essay isn't an opportunity to show off flashy writing tricks and creative twists of phrase. The main thing you are being judged on is your ability to clearly and effectively argue a specific point. Making the grader laugh or cry with your beautiful prose unfortunately won't have an effect on your score. Just use your time to make your argument and support it with logic and facts.


Short, descriptive sentences are fine here. Try not to worry about how ""pretty"" or ""complex"" each sentence is. Instead, worry about how strong your argument is. Plain, clear sentences that make logical points are better than gorgeous sentences that go nowhere.

, A good SAT essay doesn't just make claims. It backs up its claims with examples that illustrate how those claims are correct. Be sure to incorporate specific examples into your writing. These form a major portion of the essay's score.The examples can be from your schoolwork, personal reading you've done, people you've met, and even your own life experiences. The source isn't important, but the example's ability to support your argument is.

, Don't forget that the writing section isn't just about the essay. Many of the multiple-choice questions in the writing section test your ability to improve sentences and paragraphs that have errors in them. Getting a little experience editing flawed writing can be a big benefit — this helps you get in the critical editor's mindset.


Editing your own essays for school projects is one great way to do this, but if you need more practice, ask to edit your friends' or siblings' work. You'll be doing them a favor and helping yourself prepare for the test.

, As noted above, the best way to get better at taking the SAT is to take it. While individual practice problems can help you gain the skills and knowledge you need to do well, taking the whole test — all at once — is a valuable experience. Taking a practice test doesn't just help you learn what you need to know. It gets you used to having to sit still and focus on your work for over three hours. It also teaches you how to get through the questions as quickly as possible and how to pace yourself.


The official SAT Practice test is available here for free.It's easy to find others online and in test prep booklets.

, Almost everyone who takes the SAT will make at least some mistakes. The first few times you take practice tests, note which sections you do the worst on. Focus on practicing these sorts of questions most of all. You won't want to ignore the other sections, but you will want to use your study time as effectively as possible.

, You should always be aware of the clock as you're taking your test. Taking practice tests will help you get used to this. There are also other things you can do to manage your time effectively. See below:


Keep the total number of questions in the section in mind. This info is written at the start of each section. If you know you have five minutes left and you're on question 20 of 25, you're in good shape.
Do the easy questions first, then the hard ones. If you get to a hard problem, skip it and come back. If you do the hard ones first, you might not even get to easy problems that you could have answered quickly. In general, the questions in each section get harder as they go on. The ""easiest"" questions are generally:
Reading Comprehension: Sentence completion (not passage-based questions)
Math: Basic arithmetic/algebra word problems
Writing: Identifying sentence errors

, Don't psyche yourself out — with a little practice and hard work, you can do your absolute best on the SAT. Even if this isn't as good as you'd like, it's not the end of the world. Here are just a few things to keep in mind:


The SAT is just one thing that colleges look at when considering your application. Your grades, extracurricular activities, recommendations, and projects outside of school also play a factor. A bad SAT score won't keep you out of college on its own.
The SAT isn't a test of how smart you are. It can't tell you whether you're a good artist, whether you can think critically, or how high your emotional intelligence is. It can only tell you how good you are at a few school skills.

Geography (15%)
Civics and government (25%)
Economics (20%)

, The Science section of the GED is 80 minutes long and contains 50 multiple choice questions. The section tests the student's knowledge of life science, physical science, and earth and space science. The questions in the section are distributed between these areas as follows:Life science (biology, medicine, etc., 45%)
Physical science (physics and chemistry, 35%)
Earth and space science (astronomy, etc., 20%)

, The Reading section of the GED is 65 minutes long and contains 40 multiple choice questions. The section tests the student's ability to comprehend and analyze written passages. The section draws questions from two categories, fiction and nonfiction. The questions are distributed between these areas as follows:Fiction (passages taken from at least one of the following: poetry, drama, prose fiction before 1920, prose fiction between 1920 and 1960, and prose fiction after 1960, 75%)

, The second part of the writing section is 45 minutes long and requires you to plan, organize, and write an essay on a provided topic. The topic of the essay is not disclosed beforehand. The essay doesn't have a goal in terms of word count - rather, the essay is graded based on its content. Two readers grade the essay based on the following criteria:Focused main points
Clear organization
Specific development of ideas
Sentence structure control, punctuation, grammar, word choice, and spelling

, Even if you're confident that you'll be able to pass the GED, it's still wise to study, especially if you haven't been to school for a while. When you schedule a test, be sure that you choose a date that will allow you adequately prepare, taking into account any family or work responsibilities that may compete for your time.


Tests can be scheduled electronically from the official GED website., Use your study time wisely! Since you know (roughly) which subjects you'll be tested on, try to devote the most time and effort to reviewing ones that you know have unsteady foundations. For instance, if you're decent at math, but you have almost no knowledge of world history, you would do well to spend most of your time brushing up on basic historical concepts while only lightly reviewing your math skills.

, A moderate, consistent study routine is almost always better than a spotty, hectic one. Rather than ""cramming"" at the last minute or ""binge-studying"" once or twice for hours on end in the days leading up to the test, instead, spread your burden out over the months or weeks leading up to your test. Studying consistently over a long period of time has been shown to aid in information retention much better than spending the equivalent amount of study time in a last-minute sprint to prepare.One additional consideration is that cramming can interfere with your sleep schedule the night before the test. Showing up fatigued to your GED can markedly decrease your performance.

, While there are no hard and fast rules about which study practices are and aren't appropriate, most people can benefit substantially by seeking out and reviewing questions that resemble those found on the actual GED test. A few select sample questions are listed on the official GED website, as is a free practice test.Additionally, if you're willing to spend money, a wide variety of paid GED test resources are available both online and in commercial and academic bookstores.

, On test day, you want to eliminate as many distractions as possible so that you're able to devote your entire concentration to the GED test. Two big distractions that are often forgotten by students are hunger and fatigue. The effect that biological factors like these can have on a test taker's score are real, tangible, and pronounced.Be sure to get a full night's rest the night before your test and to eat a healthy breakfast the following morning to ensure you're not kept from reaching your full potential by hunger pangs or heavy eyelids.

, As noted above, each section of the GED has a specified time limit. Unless you're able to secure an official disability accommodation (for which you can apply at the GED website), these time limits are inflexible. Generally, each section allows between 1 and 2 minutes per problem - this information can help you budget your time wisely. However, the essay section has a single 45-minute time limit during which you must synthesize an entire essay. Be aware of the time limit as you work - you can't correctly answer any questions you don't get to.


To ""get used"" to the feeling of working under a time limit, you may want to try incorporating timed practice into your study routine. Use a stopwatch or timer to keep track of the time you're taking as you complete practice problems.

, Because of the aforementioned time limit, it's important to budget the time you spend on each question wisely. One tried and true test-taking strategy is to skip question that you don't immediately know how to answer. In other words, only answer the questions you know how to answer right away - don't spend time trying to figure out difficult questions. Then, when you reach the end of the section, go back and attempt to answer the difficult questions. This strategy ensures you use your time as efficiently as possible, answering as many easy, ""sure thing"" questions as you can.

When you skip questions, be sure to skip the corresponding lines in your multiple choice answer sheet to avoid a disastrous mis-match of the rest of your answers in the section.

, Above all, try to make your essay as clear, straightforward, and coherent as possible. This applies primarily to the quality of your argument, but also to the actual presentation of your essay with regards to handwriting, proper paragraph structure, spelling, and so on. The essay is the only part of the GED graded by actual humans - as such, it's the only part of the essay where it's important to remember that your work should communicate an idea to another person as clearly and strongly as possible.

, With all likelihood, you may finish one or more sections of the GED with time to spare. Make the most of this extra time - spend it going over your work, especially any that posed challenges to you. Any extra points you can gain from revising incorrect answers can add up to a big overall score boost.


This advice is extra-important for the essay section. Extra time spent on the essay can allow you to enhance your argument, add extra examples, make your thesis more clear, and much more.

Learn the format of the exam.,
Read the questions before you read the passage.,
Eliminate obviously wrong questions.,
Practice writing essays.,
Identify your weaknesses.",How to Prepare for the ACT Exam1," It is important to understand how the exam is structured so that you can master all of its sections. The ACT has four sections with an optional writing section as well.


The English section covers punctuation, grammar, proper word usage, sentence structure, and style. Vocabulary is not a big component of the ACT English section.There are 75 questions over 45 minutes.
The math section tests algebra, geometry questions, statistics, and word problems.There are 60 questions over 60 minutes.
The reading section will have about four reading passages with a few questions following each one. The subjects can range from science, literature, history, and politics. There are 40 questions over 35 minutes.
The science section has a series of passages with questions on each one. A few questions may need outside knowledge, but most can be answered by the passage.There are 40 questions over 35 minutes.
For the writing section, you will write an essay on a given prompt. The writing section is graded based on four areas: ideas and analysis, development and support, organization, and language use and conventions. It is one essay prompt written in 40 minutes.;
, Before you read the passages for the science and reading sections, you should read the questions so that you understand what you are looking for.As you read the questions, underline or mark passages in the text that the questions ask about. This will make them easier to find.

, ACT questions may seem to be ambiguously worded. It may be difficult to decide which answer is the right one since all of the answers seem to be partially correct. Instead, try to look for the answers that have something that is wrong about them. This may be a single word or detail that is not correct. The right answer is the one that is completely correct., If you have decided to take the writing exam, you will need to hone your writing skills as well. Get sample prompts from the ACT website or a prep book, and time yourself for forty minutes to write the exam. Ask a teacher or parent to grade the essay based on the ACT essay rubric.


The prompt will ask you to take a perspective on an issue and argue against a different perspective.While you should aim for neat handwriting and generally good grammar, do not focus on making the essay perfect. You will not have points deducted for an occasional spelling error or grammatical mistake.

, After you have done some practice, you may want to look back on the type of questions you consistently get wrong. Is there a pattern? Are you doing better on some sections than others? Devote extra time to these issues to help you improve.For example, if you do poorly on geometry questions, you may want to spend extra time studying geometry.
Once you have identified what your weaknesses are, try to think about why you might have them. For example, are you doing poorly on the reading section because you are unable to read the passages quickly enough? Do the words in the science section confuse you?

Start preparing before your junior year.,
Buy a prep book.,
Take a prep course.,
Create a study schedule.,
Reduce distractions.,
Find a comfortable workspace.,
Time yourself taking a practice exam.",How to Prepare for the ACT Exam2," You should not take the ACT before your junior year of high school. This is because the material on the exam includes many subjects that are not taught until 11th grade. Furthermore, if you take the exam in your junior year, you will be able to retake the test again for a higher score.


The test is offered six times a year. You can take it in September, October, December, February, April, or June.
The earliest you should take the exam is in June before your junior year, and only if you have already taken courses that cover the material tested on the ACT.
Most juniors take the exam for the first time in the spring of their junior year., Prep books contain tips on taking the exam as well as practice exams based on ACTs from previous years. When choosing a prep book, get one from a reputable brand, such as Kaplan or McGraw-Hill, or buy the ACT’s official study guide.


Some prep books offer activation codes or CDs with additional resources.
You not necessarily need to buy study materials. Some websites, including the ACT website, have free practice exams and questions.

, There are many courses offered both online and in person that can help you learn how to master the ACT. These courses teach study skills, test taking tips, and the material found on the exam. These courses may last over the course of several weeks, or you may just have to go for a few days.


Many high schools offer ACT courses. These may be available for free or for a small fee. Ask your teachers or administration if your school or another local high school offers these courses.
Some tutoring centers also offer test prep courses. You may even be able to find an online course.

, Set aside time each day to study. Determine in advance how long you will study for, and do not stop until you have reached the time limit.You may want to study a different section on different days of the week. When you get closer to the date of the exam, schedule in enough time to do a full practice exam once a week.


You may want to schedule a certain time of day when you practice for the exam. For example, you may want to run through your flash cards after you wake up or do ten questions before you go to sleep.
You may be able to sign up for a question of the day service. There are both apps and email subscriptions that will send you a practice question every day.

, While you are studying, you should make sure that you have as few distractions as possible. Try to reduce noise. Find some time to yourself, and do not stop until you have studied for a certain amount of time.


If other people in your household may interrupt while you study, try hanging a sign on the door that says “Do Not Disturb! Studying for the ACT exam.”
Turn your cell phone off, and do not take calls or texts during your study time.
If you study better with complete quiet, turn off the TV and radio. If you find you study better with music, put some on light instrumental music, such as classical music.

, Look for a quiet, private room where you can study in peace. Try sitting at a desk with only the essential things you need, such as the ACT book, a notebook, pencil, a computer and any test software you have. Do not lay on the bed or be in a position where you could easily fall asleep.


If studying at home is too distracting, try going to a school or public library.

, During the exam, you will have a limited amount of time for each section. You should make sure that you can answer all or most of the questions within that time period. To do this, time yourself taking practice exams. Limit yourself to the same amount of time per section as you have on the exam.The ACT offers free practice exams on their website.
If you having trouble finishing a particular section, practice more of those type of questions. For example, if you cannot do the math problems in time, try doing math equations within a minute each.
You have about 30 seconds per question in the English section; one minute per question in the math section; and just under a minute per question in the reading and science sections.

Check the deadlines at colleges.,
Register before the ACT deadline.,
Sign up for the ACT with writing if needed.,
Request accommodations if needed.,
Consider signing up for the SAT as well.,
Bring your registration ticket on the day of the exam.",How to Prepare for the ACT Exam3," Colleges will typically have a deadline for when you need to submit your scores to them. You should take the ACT before this date to make sure that the scores reach the college in time.


It generally takes two weeks for ACT scores to reach the university. If you took the exam outside of the US or Canada, it can take an extra week or two.
Writing exam results can take up to four weeks to be scored and sent to universities., Generally, registration for the ACT ends a month before the testing day, but you should register early to make sure that you have a spot. Check the ACT website for a schedule of test dates and registration deadlines.


It may be helpful to sign up as early as three months in advance. This will help you create a studying schedule and give you plenty of time to succeed.To register for the exam, go to the ACT website. You will need a credit card to pay for the exam as well as a headshot of yourself.
You may not need to register for the ACT if your school automatically registers you for a ACT state or district testing. Check with your school first.

, Some colleges will want to see a writing score as well as your normal ACT scores. Check with the colleges that you are planning to attend to see if they require this or not. If they do, make sure you register for this additional portion.


The ACT maintains a database that can inform you if the writing portion is required or not for the colleges you want to attend.

, If you have documented learning differences, you may be able to get accommodations to help you take the test. To do this, indicate on the ACT registration form that you need accommodations.

Score reports, including the Student Report, High School Report, and College Report, are available 3-8 weeks after testing. If you took the writing test, your score reports will be released within 5-8 weeks after the test date.ACT customer service cannot provide your scores by phone, email, or fax.
Multiple-choice scores will be available online before writing scores because the scoring process for the writing test takes longer.Score reports will be sent to different destinations.The student report is delivered to you via online access from your ACT web account, and reports ACT scores, college and career planning information. The high school report is delivered to your high school and reports the same information as the student report. The college report is delivered to each college or scholarship agency you listed (up to 6), and includes everything on the student report plus the grades you reported in up to 30 high school courses.;
, The ACT test is scored between 1 (low) and 36 (high) points. You will find a separate score for each of the four core sections (English, mathematics, reading, and science), as well as a composite score (an average of the four core sections). Depending whether or not you took the optional writing section, you may have a score for that, too. You will find additional information on your score report, including ranks and benchmarks.


Find your composite score. It will be written in bold in the upper left of your score report. It will be a whole number score.
Find your multiple choice test scores. There will be one each for English, mathematics, reading, and science, and each will be listed in bold. English, mathematics, and reading will also include sub-scores for various parts of the academic component. Sub-scores range from 1-18.
If applicable, find your writing score. This will be scored from 1-36, with writing domain scores that range from 2-12. It is divided into sub-scores as well, but note that these do not necessarily add up to your score on the writing test., Your ranks will tell you the percentage of recent high school graduates who took the ACT and received scores that are the same or lower than yours.


Note your “US Rank”. This rank tells you about your performance in comparison to other test takers in the United States.
If you took the ACT before September 2015, find your “State Rank.” This tells you about your performance in comparison to others in your state.
Use the rank to get a sense of your relative strengths and weaknesses in the four general subject areas.A high score in rank indicates that you are in the top percent of students.

, This feature is included in score reports. If your scores are at or above the benchmark scores, you will likely be ready for first-year college courses., The ELA (English Language Arts) is an average of your English, reading, and writing scores. It ranges from 1-36. Your STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) score is an average of your math and science scores. It ranges from 1-36.ELA and STEM scores will be included on tests taken during and after fall 2015.

, This measures your level of proficiency on a subset of items in the reading test. It is specifically aimed at assessing your ability to identify the central meaning and purpose in complex texts.,, Remember that you will receive a score from 1-36 for each multiple choice section (English, mathematics, reading, and science), and that your composite score will be an average of these four subject test scores. Knowing how the test is scored will help you interpret what your scores mean.You will receive one point for each of the questions on each test that you answered correctly. This will be your raw score, a record of how many questions you got right and wrong.No points are deducted for incorrect answers.
Your scores are scaled. This means that the raw scores are converted to scale scores, which have the same meaning for all the different forms of the ACT (regardless of which date a test was taken or what set of questions you took). Scaling translates each raw score into a score between 1 and 36, which is then reported to you in your score report.
Sub-scores measure your performance on a specific group of questions within each section., The average ACT score falls between 20 and 21.An above-average ACT score can improve your chances at getting in to a more selective school.


Determine whether you scored near, far above, or far below the average.
Use the average scores and reported percentiles only as a reference. Remember that your score target is unique to you and can be considered “good” or “needing improvement” based on the schools in which you are interested and your personal academic goals.

, This information can be found on the school’s website and can help you interpret if your scores are sufficient for admittance to your school of choice. Part of interpreting your ACT score is understanding where it will put you in the college admissions process.

Always be aware of the time.",How to Get a Perfect Score on the SAT," Do you struggle with quadratic equations? Do you get stuck on grammar questions? Think about what you need to improve and set aside more time for it in your study plan. Not only will this help you on that particular subject, it will also help you feel less stressed overall.;
, This may seem counter-intuitive, but while it's good to give attention to weak points, you don't want to lose sight of what you can do well. Devoting all your energy to that elusive perfect score in the writing section can make you forget some of those basic math skills you had under your belt. It's also important to remind yourself that you are an intelligent person with many strengths and beating yourself up over the hard stuff is only going to make you feel stressed-out and incompetent when it comes time to take the test.

, Some people learn better when they read the problem, others do better when they listen to it. Some people need to visualize it in their heads. Think about how you learn information and apply it to your study program. If you learn best while listening, then listen to some lessons on CD while you drive. If you learn best by looking at the words, then go ahead and make packs of flashcards.

, The time for deep, focused studying is in the month (or months) before the exam, not on the night before. Studies show that studying for longer periods of time increase knowledge more than short cramming sessions.

, When we try to accomplish anything long-term, be it studying or exercising or writing a novel, it can be very easy to say, ""Oh, this is too much, I'll do it tomorrow."" The problem with putting things off is that finding the motivation to start them again becomes twice as hard. Give yourself a short, accessible goal for each session. For example, ""I will get a 75% on this practice quiz,"" or ""I will finish writing one short essay tonight.""

, When you meet your goals, go ahead and treat yourself. Go get an ice cream cone. Play an hour of your favorite game. Go window shopping at a nearby store. This will keep your motivation high.

, The College Board, the official makers of the SAT have released The Official SAT Study Guide, which is a good starting point for your SAT resources. But there is also a plethora of study books out there for students to choose from. Your local and school libraries are likely to have a good selection so flip through them and see which appeal to you.

, The College Board website (http://www.collegeboard.org) includes study tips, practice tests, a new SAT question of the day, and test day simulators. They also provide a feature to help you plan your own personal study guide, tailored to your needs.

, Private tutors can be a great resource, especially for students that don't know how to practice good study habits. There are many companies that offer private SAT tutoring, including The Princeton Review, Kaplan, and TestMasters. You can also ask your school guidance counselor which local tutoring service they recommend.

, There's a reason that books and websites keep offering practice tests. It's because there's no better way to find out what's going to be on your test. When you take a practice test, pretend it's the real test. Sit in a quiet space where there are no distractions and time yourself. Do not look ahead to the answers at the back of the book. At the end of the test, assess what you did right and wrong.

, Practice reading long, comprehensive passages on a topic that will test your understanding. Try to stretch yourself by reading up on topics that you don't find interesting or don't know much about. Then have somebody test on you what you learned or write down a short analysis. This will force you to increase your attention span, analyze a topic, and practice close reading skills.

, Studying doesn't always have to feel like a chore. Cool down at the end of a long session by playing a math or vocabulary game on your computer. This will not only help your skills but will also help you relax.

, Take a night off. There is such thing as burnout. If you burn yourself out too much, you may get depressed, and begin to see major drops in your scores. Read a book, watch a movie. Go for a stroll around the block.

, Getting a good eight or nine hours of sleep is essential for feeling awake and healthy the next day.

, Oatmeal, yogurt, granola, and eggs are all good choices. Peanut butter is a good source of protein. Fresh fruit is a nice supplement and gives lot of natural sugar. Avoid processed sugars and refined carbohydrates like those found in doughnuts, muffins, and other pastries; those are likely to give you a brief energy surge and a deep ""crash"" later in the day.

, The last thing you need is to be worrying about whether or not you'll be late for the exam. Have your destination planned out ahead of time so you can focus on staying calm and remembering your facts.

, Unwanted bathroom breaks will take time away from your test so just drink enough to keep yourself hydrated.

, Get the questions you know out of the way first so that you'll have more time to focus on the challenging ones.

, Sometimes you run into a particularly difficult question and before you know it, you've just spent fifteen minutes scratching out answers to that one problem. If a question is just beyond your ability to guess, then go ahead and skip it.

, Even while you're working on the test, be aware of the clock. Know how much time you have left and how many questions you have to do. This will help you avoid giving too much time to a particular section or problem.

, Working with a private tutor can develop your homeschool student’s testing knowledge and skills. This is especially true for advanced math and science. Have the tutor work through test-specific questions or focus on developing more general skills that the SAT and ACT cover., Once you have a sense of the student’s abilities, adjust their learning goals to areas that need work. This meets not only their curriculum goals, but also further develops their skills for the tests. Spend more time on subjects with weaker practice scores until the student takes the test or show signs of improvement., Both the ACT and SAT test a student’s math skills. Your student will benefit from lessons that develop these, which may also help them in science. Helping them get a handle on Algebra 1 and 2 and geometry can provide a better base knowledge.Assess math skills by giving the student sample questions that you can get for free online.Tailor math lessons to area of weakness.

, Like math, both tests assess a student’s English language skills. On the SAT, this is a part of the verbal section.Both have similar content and will test other knowledge based on reading 4-5 passages.Prepare your student for the English sections with the following:Reading higher level texts
Building vocabulary
Reviewing word etymology
Refreshing grammar
Taking practice tests to identify weak areas

, The SAT and ACT test reading comprehension, rhetorical skills, and language mechanics. Give your student challenging reading material, which develops reading and comprehension skills. Ask specific questions about grammar, to strengthen rhetorical and language mechanics skills.Readings that can prepare your student include:


Magazines such as The Economist, The New Yorker, or Foreign Affairs
Newspapers such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal
Classic literature including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, War of the Worlds, and The Tales of Edgar Allan Poe

, The ACT and SAT have optional essay sections. These test comprehension, evaluation, and analytical skills. If your homeschool student plans to take this section, have them write essays about any reading they have done. Ask questions to guide the essays, which the ACT or SAT websites provide.Identify areas that need work by evaluating the following:


Clarity
Analysis
Development of ideas

, The ACT has one section on science. This section contains reading passages and 40 related questions. A student must answer these in 35 minutes.These questions cover biology, physics, chemistry and Earth/ space sciences such as geology and meteorology.Figure out where the student needs work by looking at a practice exam.Have the student review data, make predictions and synthesize information. This helps them with the question format on the exam., Both the SAT and ACT have sample questions from each testing area online.Other study prep organizations also have questions online that your homeschool student can answer.Have your student track their progress by routinely answering the same or similar questions online.

, Purchase, borrow or rent test prep books. These can help your homeschool student anticipate the types of questions on each exam. If you can, get books published by the official designers of each test. Have your student study with prep books for a set time after school each day. This concentrated study can develop skills and provide valuable tips and information for the exams. Download prep books and study guides for free online when possible., There may be other homeschool students in your local area who also preparing for the SAT and ACT. Finding or setting up a local study group of homeschool students taking these exams may help your student further develop their skills. It may also boost their test scores and give them a chance to meet possible future friends.Use known networks of other homeschool students or organizations to help you find support groups. You can also advertise a prep group you’d like to start.

, Give your student a prep test. Not only can these help your student learn, but they can also identify areas for improvement. It can also improve test timing and pacing skills as well as their confidence.The College Board and ACT offer free, full SAT and ACT practice tests.Time practice exams for the same allotted time as the actual test."

, High school juniors and seniors only have one or (in the case of juniors) two shots at it. You're in 7th grade, so you have 6 shots, so the test shouldn't be a huge deal for you.

, Don't spend ten minutes on a question, because there will probably be some that you don't know, especially on the math section.


If you answer a question incorrectly on the SAT, you lose points. The SAT is designed so that theoretically, guessing blindly will not increase and in certain test schemes might decrease your score. If you can eliminate at least two of the answers, you may wish to guess.
If you're taking the ACT, guess on every question you don't know. Don't leave any blank.

, As you can see, the averages of 7th graders on these two tests are not that high.

Be familiar with the structure of SATs.,
The Math Section.,
Look into SAT preparation programs for your calculator.,
Pay attention to the root words of the vocabulary.,
Practice the passages part in reading.,
Relax.,
Train your working memory for a few weeks ahead of time.,
Remember the essay part of the reading.",How to Do Better on the SAT," The SATs consist of 25 minutes for the essay, two 25 minute sections of math, two 25 minute sections of English/reading comp., a 20 minute section of English/reading comp, a 20 minute section of math, a 10 minute section of writing questions, and a 25 minute section of writing questions. So, there is 70 minutes for math, 70 minutes for reading, and 60 minutes for writing. Combined with breaks, the amount needed to take the SAT is 3 hours 45 minutes. Kind of painful just to think about, isn't it? But don't worry-with proper time management, that time will be well spent.;
, The section focuses on Algebra I, Algebra II, geometry, and some basic comprehension problems. In the math section, there are usually two very wrong answers. Weed these out and focus on the other answers. Points are not subtracted if you leave a question blank or for wrong answers. Be sure to check your work, as silly mistakes can bring down your score.

, They are little known resources that can provide a quick score boost. Some programs can be used during the math section of the test and others can be used in place of verbal flashcards.

, Instead of studying 5000 vocabulary words, one easier way is to study common roots of words. If you know about roots, prefixes, and suffixes, you will be better off than memorizing long lists.

, The passage portion consists of a couple of questions for passage one, a couple of questions of passage 2, and compare/contrast questions for two passages. Before reading be prepared to come up with an argument that takes just one side of the issue in the prompt. An outline is key to structuring your essay. The five paragraph structure works well for this essay and length counts. Studies have found a correlation between long essays and higher scores, as ninety percent of essays over 400 words got the highest possible score of 12 out of 12.

, Remember, it's just a test. Your score doesn't define you as a person and it won't screw up the rest of your life if you don't get a perfect score. All you can do is prepare as much as you can and take the test. After that, it's out of your hands.

, This will increase your fluid intelligence which will improve your score.

the passages, read the questions to see what you are supposed to be looking for. The questions always give the number of the line they are talking about, which is helpful. Remember, while it is admirable to painstakingly read each passage and think long and hard about each answer, you are being timed here. That being said, don't skim so quickly that you lose important details and the meaning of the passage. Also, do not attempt to answer the questions without first reading both passages.

, The essay is always to be written in persuasive essay format, so"

Don't panic.,
Get to know the test.,
Practice, and practice with the real thing.,
Prepare over time.,
Practice reading short non-fiction articles to prepare for the reading section.,
Learn from your mistakes.,
Focus on your weak areas.,
Identify problems you might have during the test.,
Familiarize yourself with the calculator as soon as possible.,
Keep your morale high.,
Get a good night's sleep and eat a good breakfast.,
Try not to be nervous on the test day.,
Bring water to be hydrated if it is allowed during the test.,
Read the question before you write the answers.,
Don't think too hard into the question.,
Eliminate any answers that you can.,
Remember that each question is worth the same amount of points, and that the questions get progressively harder.,
When you're doing a math problem, remember to ask yourself ""What is the question asking.""",How to Do Well on the SATs," There are two things that will help you get a good score, and the most important of these is keeping your cool. (The other is being prepared). Reading, understanding, and answering the questions is more difficult if you feel panic or anxiety. Keep a cool head. Slow down a bit. You will finish as long as you don't spend too much time on any particular question!;
, The SAT is a standardized test, meaning every test taker takes the same test under the same conditions allowing their scores to be compared fairly. If you can identify these types of questions you are one step closer to the score you want (or need).

, When you're dealing with the SAT, there's nothing like the real thing when it comes to practice test. The first time you take a SAT will be the hardest, as it is the only time you will not know what to expect. Try to take practice tests in an environment that closely resembles where you will take the real test (a library is a good bet) This will get you ready for the other side of the test—concentrating for 3+ hours in an uncomfortable setting while other people cough, sneeze and tap pencils around you.

, Spending about half an hour every other day over a 4-5 month period is reasonable. Organize your study time between maths, vocab, and grammar. Study for each section thoroughly using SAT testing aids. There are many different testing aids available; books and practice tests can be found at the SAT Preparation Center. There was also a New York Times article on a lesser known way to increase your SAT score using SAT calculator programs that can be used while you take the maths portion of the test, or serve as verbal flashcards on your calculator for handy review., The Economist magazine is an excellent source of articles that are just the right length. There are several online sources as well. Try to read a few every day.

, After taking a practice test, you should spend about the same amount of time you spent taking the test on going through your answers. Try to remember why you picked a certain answer. See if you notice a pattern. There almost always is one.

, The SAT is a multi-subject text, which means that excelling in certain areas but doing poorly in others can give you a mediocre overall score. Make the most of your study time by devoting as much time as you can to the things you're not good at, rather than the things you are good at. If you're not sure how to begin addressing your weak spots, try talking to your teachers in these subjects for advice.

, Do you have trouble with the difficult algebraic questions? Are you in the dark about some of the more obscure grammatical rules? Study more for these areas than you would others. It is recommended that you study at least twice as long in difficult areas as you would easier ones. Understand the concepts first, then practice those concepts with problems and questions. While memorizing can be helpful, particularly with vocabulary, it isn't the whole thing. Understanding goes a lot further than memorization.

, You can't afford to spend a few minutes getting to know the calculator on the day of your test.

, As important as it is to prepare mentally, learning the material from front to back, it's almost as important to ensure you're emotionally prepared. A positive, focused, high-energy attitude can make the difference between whether you do good or great on the SAT. For the best chance of excelling, do everything you can to keep your spirits high as you study and especially as you take the test itself.


Perhaps the single biggest thing you can do to guarantee you're in a good mood on test day is to make sure the rest of your life is in good order. If you're distracted, for instance, by an argument you had earlier in the week with your significant other, you won't be able to focus 100% on the questions in front of you.

, Don't sabotage yourself so you have an excuse when you do badly. You don't want to have regrets. If you set yourself up for success, it's much more likely you will.

, It may be difficult, but just think to yourself: ""It's just a test, and I prepared all that I could. I will succeed."" If you have confidence in yourself, quite simply, you will do better.

, Being hydrated can make the difference between failing and passing., Reading the question and then deciding what you think the answer should be BEFORE looking will almost always help you pick the right answer. Do not look at the answer choices until you have an idea of what the answer should be. Four of the answers are designed to lead you astray.

, In the verbal sections, you should be positively certain of the answer—don't try to read too far into how the answer might fit. If you have an idea of what you're looking for before you start looking, chances are you will find it. Only one answer will fit like a glove.

, If one of the answers glares out at you as ""completely wrong"", then cross it out. By ignoring the answer that you are certain to be wrong, you can increase your chances of selecting a correct answer. This is particularly useful if you intend to guess one question.

, If you are not a strong math student, concentrate on doing the first 15-20 questions well instead on wasting time on the really difficult ones, since you would be less likely to do well regardless.

, Many math questions try to trick you with word games. Make sure you understand exactly what the question is asking.

Get advice.",How to Choose Between the SAT or ACT Test1," Do you excel at problem solving and reasoning? Are you better at sticking with the facts and prefer straightforward questions? The SAT is requires more critical thinking and reasoning. The ACT is more knowledge based and straightforward.For example, the English section of the SAT focuses more on reading comprehension and vocabulary. The English section of the ACT focuses more on grammar and syntax.
In the math section of the SAT, you may have to apply the rules of geometry in a word problem. However, the math section of the ACT would focus on the basic concepts of geometry instead of using the concepts to problem solve.;
, The ACT has a science section, but the SAT does not. If you have a strong foundation in biology, earth science, and physics, the ACT may be a better choice for you. If you take the ACT, you will have to interpret charts, graphs, and understand scientific hypotheses.If you struggle in science or are not confident about your abilities, the SAT is probably a better choice for you.

, Both of the tests cover basic math, algebra, and geometry. However, the ACT also includes trigonometry.The SAT also gives you the formulas, but you will have to memorize them and know when to apply them if you take the ACT.If you have strong math skills, go with the ACT.
If math is not one of your better subjects, the SAT is a better choice.
You can use a calculator on all of the ACT math questions, but you can only use your calculator on one math section of the SAT., All of the reading passages of the ACT are written at a 9th grade level, but the passages on the SAT can range from 9th grade level to early college level. The SAT also includes graphs and tables in the reading section.If you are a fast reader and pay attention to detail, the ACT may be best. You get 50 seconds per question on the ACT.
If you are a slower reader and are good at comprehending historical documents, the SAT is best. You get 1 minute and 10 seconds per question on the SAT.

, It can be difficult to evaluate your own abilities and which test is best for you. Speak with a parent, teacher, or guidance counselor to help you. They can look at your academic history and previous test scores. They also may see things about your personality and test taking habits that you are not aware of.


Be open minded about the feedback that you get regarding your abilities.

, You receive a point for each question you answer correctly on the ACT, which is called your raw score. There is no penalty or point deduction for incorrect answers. Your raw score is converted into a scale score on the online and official reports. The scale score accounts for any differences in level of difficulty between tests.Your scale score will be a number between 1 and 36, with 36 being the highest.

, You’ll also receive an overall score on your ACT, which is called the composite. This is the average of your scores on each test—the math, reading, English, and science. You can also get this number by adding up your scores for each test and dividing the total by 4., If you took the essay test, two people will evaluate what you wrote. They will score the essay in four different areas. From this, the ACT will translate this onto the 1-36 scoring scale.

You can also take an optional writing test, in which you will be required to write an essay.The English test consists of 75 questions designed to measure standard written and rhetorical skills. You have 45 minutes to complete it.
The mathematics test consists of 60 questions designed to measure mathematical skills typically learned before the start of grade 12. You have 60 minutes to complete it.
The reading test consists of 40 questions designed to measure reading comprehension skills. You have 35 minutes to complete it.
The science test consists of 40 questions designed to measure a student's ability to interpret, analyze, evaluate, reason, and problem-solve with the natural sciences. You have 35 minutes to complete it.
The writing test consists of one prompt, which you will have 30 minutes to write about.;
, The whole purpose behind the ACT is to determine how ready you are for college, so any goal you create should be for the purpose of getting you into the college of your choice.


Know how high your score needs to be in order to get accepted to your first choice school.
Know whether or not the college you want to attend wants you to take the optional writing portion of the test. Since this part is optional, many colleges and universities do not need to see it, so you can skip taking it if that is the case. Many colleges and universities do want to see that score, however, so you should find out beforehand before opting out of it.

, There is a direct relationship between how much you practice and how well you do on the test, so if you want to ace the ACT, you need to study consistently for several months. An actual study plan will help you stay more committed to your practice.


Focus on the areas you struggle with most. While you need to practice all areas of the ACT in order to be truly ready, if you struggle with one subject more than the others, set aside a bit more time for that area than the others.

, You can find practice tests through the ACT website, third party test prep sites, and in books. Choose practice tests specifically set up in the ACT format so that you can study while also becoming comfortable with the way the test is set up.


If at all possible, take your practice tests at roughly the same time of day you can expect to take the actual ACT at. Since the test is usually held fairly early, taking practice tests in the morning will help your brain develop the early morning thinking habits it needs.
For the first week, test yourself on one timed ACT section each day. If you cannot complete the section within the expected time limit, complete it untimed to determine how much time you need and to give yourself a better idea of where you can shave off more time.

, The ACT covers a wide range of material, and the amount of material you need to study for is vastly greater than the amount of information you need for a standard high school test. There is no way to effectively cram for the ACT.


Moreover, cramming can actually hurt your chances since you might cause yourself more stress or confusion by trying to shove all the information into your mind at once.

, Essentially, you should brush up on the standard rules of English, especially as they apply to grammar. Vocabulary flashcards will not do you much good.


Noun-pronoun agreement can be difficult for many students because people often break these rules in common, everyday speech. For example, the sentence, ""A student needs to have their materials ready,"" would be incorrect since ""student"" is a singular noun and ""their"" is a plural pronoun. The pronoun ""his"" or ""her"" needs to be used, instead.Make sure that you have a thorough understanding of how to use commas, colons, semi-colons, and dashes.

, You will not be given the formulas you need for answering the questions, so as you study for the mathematics portion, make sure that you memorize the most essential trigonometry, algebra, geometry, formulas and understand how to apply them.


Memorize both simple and complex formulas. Use flashcards to help you memorize them, if necessary.
Note that calculus is not tested on the ACT. Trigonometry questions may appear, but there will only be a limited number of these.
Algebraic variable manipulation and plane geometry are the most important subjects to study for the mathematics portion of the test.

, The science section will contain a wide range of charts, and you will need to understand how to read and interpret these charts in order to excel in this section.


Practice by making your own charts and graphs. Doing this can help you understand each chart type more effectively than merely reading different charts can.
When practicing for this section, try answering data representation sections first before answering more complex questions in the practice test.
Even though the science section does cover some science knowledge, the majority of the section tests your science reading comprehension.

, Complete a draft essay once a week using writing prompts suggested by study materials or teachers. Brainstorm, make an outline, and write a five-paragraph essay in response to the prompt.


A five-paragraph essay needs an introduction, three body paragraphs with supporting points, and a conclusion. Ideally, one of your body paragraphs will be a contradictory point with your rebuttal.
Ask teachers or strong writers to assess your work and review their critiques to improve your writing.

, Go for a short run, ride your bicycle, or work on a puzzle. The idea is to stimulate yourself without exhausting yourself.Physical activity gets the blood pumping, which can improve blood flow to the brain and make it easier to stay alert and focused during the text.
Similarly, mental stimulation can get the metaphorical gears turning in your head, preparing your brain for the problem solving it will need to perform on the test.

, A good night's sleep is very important since it allows you to wake up refreshed and recharged. Aim for a full 8 hours the night before the test.

, The breakfast you eat should be healthy but fairly normal in size. If all you usually eat in the morning is a bowl of cereal, opt for a healthier cereal option and hydrate yourself with orange juice.


Do not eat a large meal if you are not used to it, since eating a lot of food can cause you to slow down and become tired.
Do not drink a bunch of caffeine in the morning, either. You can have a cup of coffee or tea if that is part of your morning routine, but drinking a lot of caffeine in the morning to give yourself an energy buzz is risky since you will likely find your blood sugar and energy crashing halfway through the ACT.
If you have stomach pains or nausea associated with nervousness on the day of the test, do not force yourself to eat a lot. You should make sure that you are hydrated, and you should also try to put something light and tolerable in your stomach, but you do not need to make yourself sick over it.

, In short, you will need to have an appropriate ID, approved calculator, number two pencils, and your test ticket.


You should also lay out a route from your home to the testing center. If you have never been to the testing center, take a drive there before the day of the test to familiarize yourself with the roads.
You are permitted to use four-function, scientific, and graphic calculators. You cannot use calculators with built-in algebra systems, though (Texas Instruments TI-89, TI-92, TI-Nspire CAS; Hewlett-Packard HP 48GII or any model number beginning with HP 40G, HP 49G, or HP 50G; Casio Algebra fx 2.0, ClassPad 300, ClassPad 330, or any model beginning with CFX-9970G). You cannot use calculators built into a computer, writing pad, cell phone, or other similar technological device., Panic will only hurt you in the end, and if you think you will fail, you risk setting your sights on failure instead of success. Go to the testing center with as much confidence as possible.

, At minimum, you need to bring the essential supplies you prepared earlier: a student ID or other acceptable form of ID, an approved calculator, multiple number two pencils, and your test ticket.


It is also a good idea to bring a bottle of water and a small snack you can munch on in between sections. These could help keep you energized and focused during the test.
You should also bring your own watch so that you can keep track of the time on your own. Moderators are supposed to announce when your time is almost up for each section, but in case yours forgets to do so, you should use your own watch.

, Moderators tend to be pretty strict, and if you show up late, you might be disqualified.You can take the test at a later date even if you are disqualified for this one, but you might end up losing the money you spent to take the test on your originally scheduled date.

, You need to read each answer to each question in each section completely, even if you think you already know the answer from the start.


Some questions have several answers that could work, the the directions say that you need to choose the best one. If you rush and pick the first one that could work, you might end up missing a better answer listed after it.

, You need to pace yourself throughout the test in order to ensure that you have enough time to answer all the questions. If one question has you stumped or confused, make a mental note to come back to it later and move onto the next question.


Simply put, if you need to spend seven minutes on a question you might get right, you might not have time to answer two or three questions later in the test that you would actually know the answer to for certain. Answer the questions you know first before returning to the ones you have to mull over.

, There is no penalty for wrong answers on the ACT, so it is in your best interest to guess the correct answer rather than leaving a question blank.


Note, however, that there is a penalty for guessing wrong on the SAT.

, While your studying efforts should have prepared you for each section prior to the day of the test itself, there are a few key points you should try to remember that apply to specific sections.


Use the diagrams in the math section. All the figures are drawn to scale for each math problem, so if you get stumped on a problem with a figure attached to it, you can use that figure to help you solve the question.

Skim through the reading section and the questions before going into greater detail. The reading section usually includes a passage of prose fiction, followed by a social science passage, a humanities passage, and a natural science passage. After each passage, you will need to answer questions to test your comprehension of what you read. Skim through the section as a whole to identify your strongest topics and start on those first. Maximize your time by reading the question first and keeping them in mind as you read the passage.
Review the science section quickly. For many students, the science section proves to be the hardest, simply because you have a short amount of time to answer fairly complex comprehension questions. Read through the text quickly and circle main points or ideas rather than reading the passage closely. Doing so can save you the time you need.

, Stay focused on the writing prompt and stick to the issue as you write. You can discuss the issue in a broader context, but make sure that you use specific examples and answer the prompt question thoroughly.Do not skip lines or write in the margins.
Consider the prompt and make sure that you understand it.
Determine your perspective on the issue and jot down ideas. Also consider what others might say against your argument and figure out what you might say in response.
Think about the best way to organize your essay before beginning it.

Find out the school's preference.,
Determine if the school requires an essay.,
Determine if you need to take an SAT Subject Test.,
Contact the admissions office.",How to Choose Between the SAT or ACT Test2," Most colleges will accept the ACT or the SAT. Always check the college’s requirements to see if they have a preference. If they have a preference, go with that test. If the school does not have a preference, choose the test that you will do the best on.Some Ivy League schools like for students to take both the ACT and SAT. However, if you cannot afford to take both or need to focus on one, only choose one.

, The essay is optional on both the ACT and SAT. Some schools require students to take the essay portion. Other schools may say the essay is recommended or optional.Some schools may require an essay for one test, but do not require an essay for the other test. Always check before you sign up to take the test.
For example, a school may require an ACT essay, but does not require an SAT essay. If you struggle with essays, you may consider only taking the SAT so you can avoid having to write an essay.

, Some schools will require or recommend that you take an SAT subject test. These tests take one hour to complete and focus on specific subjects such as languages, history, English, mathematics, and science. These tests are a supplement to your regular SAT score.


Even if SAT subject tests are not required, you may want to take a few. They can set you apart from another applicant. If you and another applicant are equal in all areas, but you have taken and done well on a subject test; you may increase your chances of getting in.Take tests in the subjects that you are good at. This will let your college know more about your skills and areas that you may excel in.
Even if you take the ACT, a school may require that you have SAT subject tests., Each college has an admissions office that can walk you through the application process. They can answer any questions you have about the tests you should take, how they select students, and all of the deadlines and requirements.Visit the school's website to find the contact information for the admissions office. You can call or email the office to speak with someone.
If you are able to go to the school in person, you can set up an appointment to meet with an admissions officer.

Consider the fees.",How to Choose Between the SAT or ACT Test3," A practice test allows you to see the types of questions that are asked and the structure of the test. If you score much higher on one of the tests or prefer one test over the other, focus on that test. It is better to prep for one test instead of trying to prep for both of them.Make sure you take an official practice test. You can find them at the ACT and SAT websites.
Take the practice tests early in your college admissions process. This will allow you more time to prepare.

, The SAT is offered in October, November, December, January, March, May and June. The ACT is offered in September, October, December, February, April, and June.You get one more opportunity to improve your test scores with the SAT.


Beginning in 2017, the SAT can be taken in August. After January 2017, you can no longer take the SAT in January.

, The ACT without the essay is $39.50, and $56.50 with the essay. The SAT without an essay is $43.00, and $54.40 with an essay. If you have to change your test date, you will be charged an additional fee ($24.00 for ACT, $28.00 for SAT).If you register late for a test, you will also have to pay an additional fee ($25.00 for ACT, $28.00 for SAT).
If you cannot afford to take the test, go see your high school counselor to see if you are eligible for a fee waiver."

Find out what each school's required SAT score for entry is. This will give you a goal score.There are several ways to get this information.


Schools often publish this information on official websites, usually under the ""Admissions"" section. If you can't find what you need on the school websites, try doing an internet search of the school's name and ""SAT score requirement."" This way you can avoid searching around the school websites.
Call or email the school's admissions office and ask for their SAT score requirements. There are advisers there whose job it is to answer any questions prospective students may have, so you shouldn't be shy about asking them for information.
Some schools don't have a minimum score for entry. If this is the case, use these methods to find the average SAT scores for their incoming freshman class. This will give you an idea of what you should aim for.
If there is a lot of variation in the scores each school requires, make the highest one your goal. That way, you'll cover all your bases.;
, There are a number of quality SAT review books available at most book stores and local libraries.Some top test books include:College Board Official SAT Study Guide. Also known as the Blue Book, this prep book is published by the company that makes the SAT. It contains 10 full-length tests. It is known to be particularly useful for math sections, because it contains detailed descriptions of every problem. It also comes with a DVD that has further advice and tips.
Kaplan SAT Premier. This has eight full tests with explanations to answers. It also comes with a companion DVD, offering videos with further explanation.
Gruber's Complete SAT Guide. This book focuses on test taking techniques that will improve your scores and help you find the right answers quickly. In addition, it has five full tests.
Baron's SAT. Baron's publishes quality books for almost all standardized tests. The SAT book explains all answers, but is known for having a high-quality reading section. The 2015 edition had five full tests, plus another two on the companion CD.
It is best to use a combination of these books and others. That way, you'll maximize your chances of seeing the most questions possible.
Make sure these books were published in or after 2005. The SAT was reformatted in 2005 and older books, while still helpful, won't prepare you for this new version as well as a current book.

, While it may seem strange to do this before any prep, doing this will give you a good idea of what your strengths and weaknesses are. It will also give you the baseline score you need to improve.Make sure you're in a quiet area where you won't be disturbed at all. and you have several hours to devote to this. Time yourself and stick to the time requirements.
The full SAT is 3 hours and 45 minutes.
There is a 70 minute math section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part.
There is a 70 minute critical reading section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part.
There is a 60 minute writing section. This breaks down to two 25 minute parts and one 10 minute part.
There is a 25 minute experimental section. This is ungraded, but you should still complete it so you can build up your endurance.
You are allowed three 5 minute breaks, one after each section. During this time you're allowed to stretch, go to the bathroom, and have a drink and snack. Only eat or drink during breaks to accurately recreate the testing experience.
Stick carefully to these time limits. One of your problems could be that you have trouble finishing in the allotted time, so you'll need to know if this is something you have to improve on.

, This is more than a matter of finding out what your score is. You need to go through the test and find out exactly where you made mistakes. As you move on and work to improve your grade, you'll need to know where your trouble spots are and where you need to focus your efforts., Many students decide to self-prep, which is essentially just utilizing study guides to prepare for the SAT. However, many people fall short of their goals, and in some cases a quality prep course would have significantly improved a students chances of scoring higher on their SAT. A student must assess whether or not they need that extra push to study effectively. Prep courses do a great job at holding students accountable and keeping them engaged.


If you are the student that has a history of not following through with studying or has trouble staying focused, then a prep course might be your best bet. If you do decide to use a prep course, it's extremely important to consider many factors when assessing what prep course might be the best for you.
One of the most important factors to pay attention to is whether or not you're getting quality content with your prep course purchase. There are many companies trying to get in the prep course game, but they all don't have the same level of content quality. Make sure to do your research on the company before you make a prep course purchase, and seriously consider trying to get access to a free trial before making your prep course purchase.

, There are many words that repeat themselves from year to year. If you read enough practice tests, chances are good that when you take the test you've seen a majority of the words before.You don't need to purchase these practice books- you can just flip through these sections at the bookstore or library.
College Board, the company that designs the SAT, offers free sample test questions and sections on its website., Keep a notebook and write down words you don't know as you come across them. Take a dictionary and define them afterwards. Also include whether the word is a noun, verb, etc.Set up your book in columns. Draw a line down the middle of the page to divide the columns. Put the words on the left, and the definitions on the right. This way, you can either put a piece of paper or your hand over the definitions while you study.
Make sure your notebook is small enough to conveniently carry around with you. That way, any down time you have can be used for study.
You could also try a few websites dedicated to improving vocabulary. That way you can access them on your smartphone anywhere., Set time aside to work on your vocabulary. Go through your notebook, cover the definitions, and define as many words as you can without looking.


For words you don't know, say the definitions aloud a few times to help you remember them for next time.
Use the words in a sentence. This will not only help you understand their meanings, but prepare you to use them in your essay and in the reading comprehension sections.
Use the words in everyday life. When you get comfortable with a word's definition, put it to use. When these words become normal parts of your vocabulary, they'll be much easier to figure out on the SAT.

, Many companies that publish review books also make vocabulary flashcards. They can usually fit easily in your pocket or bag, so they may be more convenient to carry around than your notebook.

, With apps, you'll always have a study resource at your fingertips. For example, SAT and ACT Vocabulary Builder by AccelaStudy uses a dynamic approach to flashcards by specifically focusing on words you've had trouble with., Sentence completion questions have one or two blank spaces. You have to pick the word or words that best complete the sentence. Improving your vocabulary will help here, but it's unlikely you'll know all the words. That's why it's important to know some strategies to help you break down sentences and pick the right answer.

, You don't need to know the definitions of the words most of the time, you just need the context the sentence provides., A clause is a part of a sentence that contains a noun and a verb, and conveys a complete idea. The sentence completion questions almost always present you with compound sentences, meaning they contain two or more clauses. The clauses are usually linked by a conjunction, which are words like ""but,"" ""and,"" ""so,"" and ""because.""For example: ""I went to the store, but it was closed."" This sentence contains two clauses, linked by the conjunction ""but.""

, The type of conjunction tells you how the clauses are related.One-way switch. These conjunctions tell you that the sentence flows in one direction. That means the clauses both support the main idea of the sentence. Some one-way switches are: and, because, since, so, and therefore.
Here's a one-way switch: ""I got in my car and drove to work."" The ""and"" tells us that the two clauses support each other.
Two-way switch. This type of conjunction tells us that there will be a break in the sentence's flow. That means the second clause will negate something in the first. Some of these are: but, although, despite, however, and while.
Here's a two-way switch: ""I got in my car but it wouldn't start."" The ""but"" tells us that the second clause will be inconsistent with the first. Presumably, this person got in their car to go somewhere, but they now can't go anywhere because the car won't start.
Sentences without a switch are all one-way, unless they're about change over time. Sentences that describe change over time are two-way.

, Now that you know how to break down a sentence, you can start working out how to solve a sentence completion question. Using the rules about one-and two-way switches, figure out the flow of the sentence.


""Johnny didn't even know how to ride a bike, but he _____ the race anyway."" The ""but"" tells us that we have a two-way switch here. Already, without even seeing any choices, you know that the right choice will contrast with Johnny not knowing how to ride a bike.

, That way, you can pick the choice most like the word you had in mind.

, When you've broken the sentence down, figured out its flow, and picked a word to complete it, then look at the choices. All the previous steps will make it much easier to spot the correct choice.


If you're completely stuck on vocabulary, start eliminating choices. Even if you have to guess, every choice you eliminate makes your chances better.

, These are usually the typical length and difficulty of SAT reading sections. Read an article and understand its point.Ask yourself what the main idea of the article is.
After deciding on the main idea, make the article's scope more specific. If you read about volcanoes in Hawaii, saying that the article was about Earth science is too broad. In a short sentence, say the article's topic and scope.
If you're unsure that you understood an article properly, ask a teacher or tutor to read it. Then tell them the short summary sentence you came up with. They can tell you if you've properly understood the article or if you made a mistake somewhere.
Make notes next to the article to help yourself comprehend it better.

, You don't get to pick the topics for the reading comprehension sections, so chances are good you'll find at least one of the sections very boring. Unfortunately, we tend to skim and not pay attention to topics we have no interest in, which could lead you to get questions wrong. Get yourself used to paying attention to boring topics by purposely reading things you don't find interesting., There are a few types of questions the SAT usually asks. Understanding these can help you figure out the answer.Main Idea. These ask about the point of the article as a whole.
Inference. This will ask you about something that isn't directly stated in the article, but rather implied.
Detail. These will ask you about a specific section of the article.
Vocabulary. These will ask you to define a word based on how it is used in the passage.
Function. These ask you about the purpose of a specific part of the passage.

, We all think differently, and there really isn't one golden rule on how to tackle reading comprehension sections. All strategies have positives and negatives. Try these on your practice tests and see which one works best for you.Read through passages fully, then move onto the questions.
Read the questions first, then read the passages.
Skim the passage, then read the questions and refer back to the passage when you have to.
If one strategy isn't working for you, try another.

, Because the SAT has strict time constraints, you shouldn't read every word of every passage. Use the following techniques to get all the necessary information in the shortest amount of time.Read the introduction paragraph. This should layout the main idea and topic of the passage.
Only read the first and last sentences of paragraphs after this. Effectively constructed paragraphs will give an introduction that summarizes the paragraph, and a conclusion that wraps it up.
Circle or underline important words or terms. Key terms will vary from passage to passage and will be based on the passage's main idea. For example, if you're reading a passage about climate change, terms like ""rising sea levels,"" ""greenhouse gas,"" and ""pollution"" will likely be important.

, Longer passages usually have several paragraphs. Each paragraph has a particular topic in relation to the main idea of the reading. Take only a few seconds to come up with a very fast, one-sentence summary of each paragraph. That way, if questions ask about a particular section of the passage, you know exactly where to go., Since you've read the passage, you'll probably have an idea of what the right answer is. Find the answer that best matches your prediction. This will prevent you from wasting time by referring back to the passage looking for answers., Many students have trouble sticking to the time constraints in reading comprehension sections. If it takes you more than a minute to answer a question, skip it, or you risk running out of time. If you can eliminate even one choice, then it is best to take a guess., Just like with vocabulary words, there are a limited number of math questions the SAT can ask, so over the years there will be similar or identical questions.


SAT Math breaks down into four areas: Numbers and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, and Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability.There are 44 multiple choice questions and 10 fill-ins.
Multiple choice questions give you a few opportunities to solve them. If you know how, you can solve them mathematically and pick the right answer. If you're stuck and don't know how to solve a problem, you can try substitution. This means you plug answers into the equation from the question and see what you get. Remember that SAT answers always go from lowest to highest, so this can give you an idea of which answer to start with. With multiple choice questions, you can also always guess.
Fill-ins. These have no answer choices, so this eliminates the possibility of substitution or guessing easily. You'll have to actually solve them. The best thing you can do here is study and practice your mathematical concepts., You may find that you have issues with one particular type of problem. If all the questions you get wrong are geometry, you know what you need to focus on.

, It's true that the SAT booklet includes all relevant formulas.However, you still need to know when and how to use them. Just like with your vocabulary words, make note of formulas you need to know and write down what situations you would use them for.

, Although you aren't graded for showing your work, this will prevent you from making careless mistakes. If you work everything out in your head, you could lose track of your work and make a preventable mistake., These can be tricky, and many students get them wrong because they are confused by the wording.


Before doing any work, ask yourself: ""What is this question asking me?""That way, you can make sure you understand what exactly you're supposed to solve in this question.Write out all important parts of the question. Word problems often confuse us with unimportant sections. For instance, if a question starts with, ""John's mom put three apples in his lunchbox for school today,"" write ""3 apples."" That way, by the end you should have a simple math problem without all the confusing wording.

, This is helpful in many ways. For example, if you're in a rush and a problem asks you to calculate a certain angle, you may not have time to do a lengthy equation. However, three of the choices are acute angles and the fourth is obtuse. You see that the angle is clearly greater than a right angle. Since the figure is drawn to scale, you can correctly choose the obtuse angle., Don't rely on your imagination to visualize shapes- draw them. Like showing your work, this will help you catch mistakes before you make a careless error.,


iTooch SAT Math is an app currently for iPhones and iPads, and is under construction for Windows and Androids. It has a large database of questions and includes math games to help you practice in a more entertaining way.SAT Math Testbank. This app is compatible with Apple products. It isn't flashy and includes a large question database., The writing section asks you to take a side on a broad issue, then defend it with examples. So while grammar and spelling are important as well, what graders are looking for is how well you can support an argument., The top bun is the introduction, the middle is the body and supporting examples, the bottom bun is the conclusion.Introduction. Here you should state what your position on the debate is. It helps to rephrase the original question in some way. Then, tell the reader what your position is and why.
Body. Here is where your examples will go. Use one paragraph per example. This is enough room to elaborate on the example and why it proves your point, but not so long that you'll take too long and won't finish.
Conclusion. Remind the reader what your position was. Explain why the examples you used demonstrate this point.

, It is much better to have two well-thought out and coherent points than five jumbled and poorly considered points. It is helpful to pre-plan a few examples that are applicable in many different situations.Historical examples. In your history classes, you've probably encountered a number of people and events that would be great supporting evidence in an essay. For example, if the essay prompt is ""Can we learn from failure?"" you could say that Abraham Lincoln was a great leader because he was always willing to learn from his past mistakes.
Literary examples. Authors almost always include moral or social lessons in their work. You've probably read plenty of these in English class. Novels like 1984 and To Kill a Mockingbird are standards in most high schools, and contain great examples you can use in a number of different essays.
Current events examples. The news is full of examples you can use in almost any argument. Good topics include censorship, military actions, political developments, and social justice.

, Essays don't have to be long to be good. It will be obvious to the grader if you're just adding words and sections to make your essay longer. It's much better to have a shorter essay with strong examples than a long essay full of fluff., Although the point is to defend your position, it shows that you are a powerful writer if you can at least acknowledge the other point of view. This doesn't have to be long- even a sentence will show that you've considered other side of the issue.For example, if the question is asking whether it is right for the government to monitor its citizens, you could say, ""While many would argue that monitoring citizens is essential for national security, it is a violation of our constitutional rights.""

, Although the main point is to defend your argument, it shows a level of maturity in your writing if you can go beyond words like ""good"" and ""bad.""Make absolutely sure, however, that you're using complicated words correctly. It could be a mark against you if you keep misusing words.

, It will hurt your chances of a good score if your essay is full of grammar and spelling mistakes. Also be sure to write legibly- the grader can't give you a good score if he can't read your essay.

, If writing is your weak spot, the best way to improve your score is to do write out the essay questions from SAT books and websites. Do these as if you were actually taking the test. Do not look at the question before you start. Stick to the 25 minute time limit and see if you can write an entire essay with an introduction, conclusion, and examples. Then on test day, you'll be in good shape to write an essay with little trouble., There are typically five choices for SAT answers. That means you have a 1 in 5 chance of guessing correctly. However, for every answer you eliminate, it's more likely you'll guess correctly. If you don't know an answer but are absolutely sure 4 choices are wrong, you've just found the correct answer., It's very important to understand exactly what questions are asking you. If you only breeze through or skip the instructions, you'll almost certainly make mistakes.

, If you get stuck on a question and can't eliminate any choices, skip it. You'll waste time trying to figure it out when you could be answering questions you know. When you finish that section, you can come back to questions you skipped if there's time left. However, remember with every choice you eliminate your chances of guessing right improve. If you can eliminate even one answer, it is better to guess.If you skip questions, be certain you fill in the correct bubbles on your scantron as you move on. If you don't pay attention, you could end up filling in the wrong bubbles for all the questions after the one you skipped, meaning the whole section will be wrong.

, The SAT is an exhausting test, so reading in general will help you. This is effective not just for reading sections, but for the whole test. It will help you keep your concentration for long periods of time.,


Bring a watch. While proctors are supposed to keep track for you, you should be sure you know exactly how much time you have left.Figure out how much time you have per question. In a 20 minute section with 25 questions, you have 48 seconds per question. Keep this in mind to see if you're falling behind and have to pick up the pace.
If you start running out of time, just answer easy questions. That way you'll complete the section as much as possible. You'll also probably have time to go back and work on harder ones with this method.
Be prepared. After practicing all this time, you know the deal. You know the test's layout and what's required in each section. You've done timed practice tests. This will all help make it easier for you to finish in enough time., How long you'll spend prepping really depends on your goals. It also depends on how much free time you have for study. As a general rule, less than two weeks is not enough time for adequate prep. But you don't want to take too long either- if you start a year in advance, you'll probably forget a lot.Overall, 1 to 3 months is a good goal. This allows you enough time to let all the information sink in without risking forgetting anything., With flashcards and apps, you can study pretty much anywhere. If you're on the bus on the way to school, try doing a few math problems or flipping through some vocabulary flashcards. Little things like this can make huge differences.

, If you have any questions or are having trouble in a particular area, ask your teacher in that subject for help. Teachers will be happy to give you extra help.

, Working through test books by yourself may not be enough, and you might require some explanation to help you.


Many schools offer after school classes for SAT prep. Find out if your school has one of these, or if you could get one started.
Check the internet and see if there are prep classes in your area. Remember that these are sometimes expensive.

Reap the rewards.",How to Pass the IGCSE Exam," Forget about the classic 'listen to your teacher, do your work, work consistently' strategy. Instead, think long term. Relax, enjoy and have fun throughout the year. There is really no need to work your butt off for the internal examinations or try to impress your teachers because, in the IGCSEs, ""only the boards matter!"".;
, When you do homework, you can test what you know on each subject, and you can look back at it for revision.

,, Every weekend, just read through the text. One chapter of each subject; whichever one you prefer, but, try not to repeat the same ones every time.

, A steady, ongoing state of learning will have you more than ready by exam time, rather than trying to cram at the last minute. Those breaks during the year provide a more relaxing, yet still work-focused, time to keep preparing consistently. If you use these times to keep learning, you won't stress anywhere near as much as those leaving it all until the last minute.

, This deeper learning and revision must begin well before the boards, so plan out a timetable and give up on about 90% of the fun you have been having at this point. It's serious study time! It may seem a long term but it short in the bigger scheme of things and yet has such long-term impact, so dedicate yourself to the long-term outcome for the best.

, These will help you to retain the information and is useful to draw on in case you forget what something means.

, After the mid-year examinations, work on improving your grades. For example, if you get a C in physics (or biology or chemistry), work on getting at least a B; if you get a B in maths, try to work harder for getting an A and so on.


Note: English is a language that you can't study. The only thing you can do to improve your skills is to read stories, books, magazines, newspapers etc. See ""reading voraciously"" as a strategy in Section One.

, Try to focus, even if you find that this is easier said than done.

, This is very helpful and could help you overcome any problems that arise.

, Look at the notes you took during the past couple of years. You need to remember it all.

, For the next three months, read and learn all your textbooks (remember only the prescribed ones, there is no need to buy those guide books). Learn each and every definition. They will be in the test.

, For the last three months do and re-do the past papers from the last 20 years. Do them as many times as you can and check your answers from the marking scheme.


Review all the tests and exams done in class and learn from your mistakes.
Try to print out old IGCSE/GCSE papers, this way when it comes to the real exam you'll know how everything is organised. (Mostly from ""Circle the answers"" to definitions).
You can mostly find past papers on your exam board's website, and there are many other sites which offer them too.

, Not eating could cause you to forget things, and you need to have energy to work hard; some exams are about 2 hours long!

, Try not to leave any questions blank.


If you can't answer a question, don't waste time by hopelessly trying to figure it out. Move on, then come back to it later.

, Some of these include:


Run through the exam quickly before doing any questions, that way you know what questions are to come and you don't get a big shock.
Use the number of marks available for each question as an indicator of how much you need to write. Don't write an entire paragraph for a one mark question, and don't write one short sentence for a six-mark question.
Use information given in the question. Use tables and graphs if given to back up your answer.
Answer the question. If there are two parts to a question ensure you answer both.
Don't write more points than required: is it's a 3 mark question, write 3 points only; the examiner will not pick out the best points out of many.

On the exam day.",How to Pass the New 2011 to 2014 Edexcel GCSE Science Specifications1," You will most likely start with Core Science and start with Biology B1 or Physics P1. Once you find out, make sure you have the correct revision guide (which will either be provided by your school or you might have to buy yourself from W H Smith or any book store).;
, This is the most effective way of memorizing all the information, after you learn one topic in one lesson, once you're home from school then run through it again in your revision book and rehearsing the notes you made in class.

, Past paper questions are miracles! Find past papers online from the Edexcel website under GCSE from 2011 and then print out the questions you can find for the relevant topic.

It's to refresh your memory, the more you rehearse something, the better get.

, Ask your teacher to give you full past papers or mock papers, it's time to put all that knowledge to test and practise for the real things. Ask someone to mark it using the mark scheme and then see where you failed, and which 6 markers you struggled on. Go back and then try to revise the topics you struggled on further.

",How to Pass a GCSE Biology Exam," The way certain exam boards structure their papers can vary, and you may need to study extra material if this is the case. This article serves as a guideline for all major exam boards.;
, You cannot revise if you are talking to a friend or watching an episode of Friends.

, Also have a blank exercise book and a calculator at hand.

, However your school will not give it to you for free but may supply so you can buy from them revision guides which are also specific for your exam board. This are a great way to prompt yourself a week or so before the exam.


Look through the textbook. Don't be intimidated by the big text and confusing words. Try to read the book and take in information. If you are still confused then ask your Biology teacher to help you.

, These short bullet point type notes will be easy to remember.

, This is usually for BMI (body mass index). In the exam they may give you the equation but remember it just in case.

, They help you understand what type of questions are in the exam and also help you know the areas you struggle with.

,, For example ""30 people take part in an experiment which was about how much exercise they do in a week, the line graph shows the amount of exercise they did and their heart rate. Suggest the link between the amount of exercise and their heart rate."" Normally these types of questions will be broken down into 2 or 3 separate parts. For the question in quotation marks you need to tell the examiner the link between heart rate and the amount of exercise they do. Another part of the question is: ""Is the test reliable?"" In which the answer should ""If the test was reliable it means if repeated the test will get the same results."" Remember: Reliable = repeatable!

Prepare all your supplies.,
Find a quiet place free from any distractions.,
Start off by getting a book about the subject you first want to study.,
Start on the more difficult subjects - this way you have more time to tackle them.,
Take short breaks in between revising.,
If you find yourself stumped, write down exactly what you find difficult and ask someone reliable, such as a teacher, for help.,
You don't have to revise around the clock.",How to Revise for Your GCSEs," The basic supplies you require may be notebooks for writing notes or a legal pad, highlighter pens and writing pens. You may also need items that are specific to particular subjects. For example, you need a protractor, a pair of compasses and a calculator for mathematics or if you are studying a language it is best to have a translator with you(though not at the test) . Also make sure you have suitable food and drink as staying full and hydrated will allow you to concentrate and work better.;
, The library or a study hall would make a good location. Make sure you have sufficient space for revising as you may need to spread your work out. Ask people around you to keep noise to a minimum. Do not revise with a TV or music playing in the background as you will be doing the exam in silence. If you have younger siblings try to get your parents to get them to bed earlier so you can have a quiet nighttime revision. Having noise in the background does not help your context dependent memory; this means that if you do your revision in a similar environment to when you are doing the test it will be easier for you to recall information. Think wisely about where you want to be - it can be any place that's right for you.


Create a clean space that works for you. Don't get sucked into what your friends want you to do—if you don't feel you're getting work done in their environment, go somewhere else.Remember study how you feel you want to study.

, Also, get out your workbook from school and some paper.

, There are many ways you can revise; everyone has a different techniques. Some of them are: reading through notes you have made in classes, then re-writing them until they are memorised; using revision books; making mind maps and charts; using cue cards to write short condensed notes to make it easier to remember; making a voice recording of the information and playing it back over and over again. You have to find a method that works BEST for you.


Write down any important sentences you noticed and want to learn. Highlight keywords on your piece of paper.
Make some flash cards. Stick them up around the room-great if you are learning a language!
Read your notes that you couldn't remember and learn them in any way possible. This could be by reading them aloud over and over again, writing them out over and over again, putting them into a song, or anything else that works for you.

, You shouldn't work for more than an hour without a break, but keep breaks to a maximum of 20 minutes. Use the break to refresh yourself with a wash or a drink, and do something completely different, though sometimes it is best to revise until you feel tired of revising then take a break

, If you're strapped for time, you may want to search on the internet, but it may help to limit yourself as you can easily get distracted by other things on the internet such as social networking websites.

, Make sure you revise without distraction for at least a few hours a day without forgetting to socialise and relax. Study different subjects on different days and don't stick to one area! Remember, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!

, These will help you get used to the layout of exam papers and you'll understand what the questions are like in the exam.

, You'll perform much better after a good night's sleep.

,, Most exam boards require you to have a black ballpoint pen, HB pencil, rubber, ruler, protractor and compass. You'll also need a calculator if you're doing a calculator paper, and tracing paper may be necessary for questions about rotations.

, Don't forget to write down your name, candidate number and centre number before you start!

, Once you've been through the entire paper, look through everything again and try to work on questions you couldn't answer during the first run.

Before you start anything, you will need to be able to identify what the question is asking you to do.",How to Start and Conclude a GCSE English Essay Effectively1," There will be ""trigger"" words embedded in the question that should be able to point you in the right direction. They may more apparent such as describe, explain, analyse to name a few. You should also know what each of these trigger words mean. However, it will be a lot more common for questions such as ""The Barn and another creates a powerful sense of place and feeling"" to appear. I know that the question is asking me to compare this poem to another poem that is similar in terms of tone and style. In doing this, I will make comments on and analyse the language of one and compare it to the other. You will need to practice this so that you'll be able to do it quickly.

The examiner is most likely to just skim and scan the essays that they mark but they may choose to read through it thoroughly if you write an effective and captivating introduction.",How to Start and Conclude a GCSE English Essay Effectively2," To make your introduction as effective as possible you'll need to show the examiner that you understood the text. Make a simple and blunt comment on the style, genre, purpose or tone of the piece of writing. For example, ""The biographical article about Nelson Mandela is written in a factual formal manner and mainly in an objective style."" (this is a segment of a real A/A* essay by an anonymous student) You will also need to identify what the text is about and refer to the exam question: "" the prose is continuous and focuses on Mandela's personal journey through life, exploring his physical hardships and mental hardships"". This is a brief introduction that is effective because it uses sophisticated vocabulary and showcases the student's knowledge of the piece of writing. You may also want to use some punctuation marks such as ellipses (...), semi-colons (;), colons (:) or even a dash (-). The use of these throughout can boost your grade, just make sure that you use them correctly and that you're not going over the top.;

Refer to the question after you've finished a point and when you are ready to move on to the next paragraph.",How to Start and Conclude a GCSE English Essay Effectively3," Using a range of words is effective because it can help to express your understanding and if you use the same words over and over again it can sound like you're repeating yourself. You may find yourself using a comma or a full stop that could be replaced with a semi-colon (;).

, Make comments and by doing this you can identify techniques (e.g. metaphors, similes, hyperbole, imagery) that the writer uses and discuss the effect that it has: 'the sound bite at the start that begins 'perhaps the most generally ....' breaks the smooth, flowing of the prose. This emphasizes the negativity of the comment and startles readers because it is unexpected. Despite this, it is a good technique to keep readers engaged.' This is good because it shows that the student understand how the language and techniques are effective.

, is something that I personally used in my English essays. This means to makes a point; back up the point with evidence (a quote); explain what this means and then make some further comments on the language/techniques within that quote e.g. 'The use of the hyperbole '' is actually quite interesting; it helps to emphasize the portrayal of the protagonist's experience as '

, Although it may be good to remember it as a whole, you may only really need to hold on to the thought of the genre, audience, language, style and tone. When it comes to the audience you may want to focus on how certain techniques may appeal to the audience. When it comes to tone, you may want to look at the techniques and language used that helps to determine the way that the author feels towards a certain subject.

, It is important to refer back to the original question throughout where ever it may be possible.

For some, the conclusion can be their weakest part of the essay.",How to Start and Conclude a GCSE English Essay Effectively4," However, don't feel too bad about it. All you really need to do is summarize all the ideas that you had from 'the body' of the essay. This really isn't about quantity, it's about quality. You just need to once again show your understanding of the text and refer back to the original question.

Know the exam material inside and out.,
Make friends with your teachers.,
Figure out what revision books you'll need.,
Find out how each of your final exams will be graded.,
Get motivated.,
Read the Excel as a student in England article.",How to Pass All Your GCSEs1," To succeed in your goal, you need to know exactly what content is in all of your GCSEs.


Ask your teachers or find out on the website of each of your GCSEs Exam boards. Common ones are: AQA, Edexcel, OCR and WJEC.
By knowing your exam boards you can find out many important pieces of information:;
, If there was ever a right time to bury the grudges with your teachers, now is it: you need them more than ever. This will involve you pestering your teachers to mark your work, etc.

, Revision books can be extremely helpful for your study, as they provide only the essential information you need for your exams.


Before you spend about £50 on revision books, ask your teachers whether the school is going to provide any revision books.
Ask your teacher if the revision books are available in the school library.
Also buy revision books that are specific to your exam board, not the general books with vague information.

, If you are in or entering Year 11 you might be interested in how much time you are going to have to spend doing a paper and how important it is in regards to your overall GCSE marks. It is also recommended to skim-read each specification (each one is extremely long.)

, Think why you want the best GCSEs and keep reminding yourself when you feel unmotivated.


Write down your goal grades for each subject and always aim for the top mark range, where possible. It's always better to aim high!
Be positive, calm and confident about your exams. If you put in the work, there's no need to panic about doing badly. Preparation is the key to success.

Make a revision timetable.,
Revise.,
Do lots of past exam papers.,
Study with a friend.,
Study even when you're not studying.,
Take breaks - but not too many.,
Get lots of sleep.,
Stick to a strict routine.",How to Pass All Your GCSEs2," Try not to be too accurate and plan every minute of your day. This can be stifling and you may grow bored quickly. Instead, make a list of subjects you need to revise that day, and how long you need and make sure you have time for it.

, Revise so hard that your head hurts (in a good way). You might think that your GCSEs are a long time off, but they are not. If you only get one thing from this article, it has to be to start revising now.


Write out notes from your revision book rather than just reading it, or else the information won't stay in your brain. Try to write neatly so it's easy to review.
Prioritize your subjects and their various topics to know which ones need the most work.
Try making index cards with questions on one side and answers on the other to help you learn the facts. Online flashcards that you can study on a mobile app are especially good for consistent revision.

, You really need to familiarize yourself with what the structure of your exam will be, and what sort of questions you will get. There is only a limited number of questions appear on a test about any given subject, so very similar questions are likely to appear again. You can find past papers and mark schemes online, or from your teacher or Exam Board.

, Get a friend to test you after you finish studying a topic to see if you remembered what you were meant to be learning.


Offer to do the same for them -- then the arrangement will be useful for both of you.
Having a study buddy can make studying fun and effective -- provided you stay focused on the material.
You can also get help from people who have already passed their GCSEs -- like parents or older siblings and friends.

, Look at your notes during the day even if you aren't actively ""studying"".


Five minutes with flashcards every day over a long period will be better than six hours cramming of science without breaks or rewards.
This is something you can easily do on the bus or while waiting for your friends at the coffee shop.

, It's important to give your brain a break during long periods of study -- so try to take one fifteen minute break for every hour of revision. This will keep you fresh and help you to absorb information better.


If you're younger and using this guide for other exams you'll probably want shorter breaks more often - ten minute breaks for every half hour.
Try not to get distracted by others or the internet during your study breaks -- go for a walk outside instead, the fresh air will be way more beneficial than browsing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other social media.

, Getting enough sleep is really important for effective study and good performance in exams.


Without enough sleep, your mind becomes foggy and you'll find it difficult to remember information.
Set yourself a strict bedtime and make sure you get at least eight hours sleep a night.

, Keep a set routine every day -- it will get your body into a good routine for revising and stop you from getting tired.


An example routine could be: get up at 7:30, breakfast 7:45, lunch at 1:00, dinner at 6:00, bed at 9:00.
This is easier if you have school, but some schools choose to give you study leave instead. If this is the case, you'll just have to be more disciplined!
If you do have school, you should think about going to lunchtime revision classes.

Study maths.,
Study the sciences.,
Study religion, geography, and other information specific subjects.,
Study history.,
Study music.,
Study creative subjects like art and DT.",How to Pass All Your GCSEs3," English is difficult to revise, as many of the skills needed cannot be learned, only developed. There are no right answers as long as you back all your statements up - practice by doing past papers and have your teachers mark them, and tell you how you can improve. This can include spelling, grammar, providing more evidence, etc. A lot of these skills will be homed in class or coursework anyway.


For the reading papers there is a simple way to revise - read. Not just the TV guide but everything. Read newspapers often; broadsheets, not tabloids like the Sun or The Mail. Read with an active, analytical mind, considering the intended audience and purpose, separating opinion from fact, and any techniques the author uses to persuade/inform/explain. This does not, however, benefit everyone so as an alternative try reading good quality literature on any topic that interests you.
Make lists of the types of questions you might be asked (e.g. writing to persuade) and practice. Get past papers and questions from your teachers, then have them marked by your teachers who should enjoy the extra work load and the sudden interest in learning. Homework is not revision - it's just homework.


, Past papers and practice. Maths is one subject where it is easy to pass if you know how to do it - and you can learn how to do it with ease with practice. Past papers, while they do not repeat questions, will almost certainly feature specific topics.

, Past papers are also useful to find out where you have problems. Revise these areas carefully and do the past papers again until you understand everything you need to know for the exam.

, These are the exams that require knowing specific answers.


It is important to get the revision books to find out all the necessary information and memorize them.
To help with this, it's a good idea to make thorough notes on all of the required notes early in the year and revise these notes continually -- it’s easier to remember something when you have known it for a long time.
Flashcards and mnemonics are also helpful for remembering large quantities of information..

, It is not enough to simply know all the facts for history - you must become adept at finding information from sources and relating this back to your knowledge already about your topic. Revise everything you can for your subject area and tackle past papers.

, You should already be adept at practicing your instrument so keep up with that - you may wish to use it as a 'reward' for good work in another subject, if playing said instrument is a hobby for you.


Listening papers require a lot of pre-knowledge of your Areas of Study, so learn all the facts in a way that suits you.
Also make sure to listen to lots of different kinds of music with an active mind.

, These take more than theory work or memorizing facts. Take care to do some work in your sketchbooks/etc every day, and remember to explain whether what you did worked well or not.

Go through each subject you are doing for GCSE and discover what you don't understand.,
Buy revision guides for all of your subjects.,
Try to find somewhere where you won't be disturbed.,
Discover what type of learner you are.,
The three types of learner:

Auditory learners may have a knack for ascertaining the true meaning of someone's words by listening to audible signals like changes in tone.,
Take breaks every 45 minutes when you revise.,
If you don't understand something, ask your teachers, parents, older brothers and sisters for help.

,
Get past exams from teachers or off the Internet.,
If you don't understand something, write it out again, and again, and again until you fully understand it!

,
Drink plenty, rest plenty, and play often (but less as the exams approach - there'll be time for social lives afterwards!),
Once you know the date of your exam, aim to start revising at least a month before.",How to Effectively Revise for Your GCSE," You can never revise enough might be true, but don't sit for hours on end working at the same subject—your revision will be most effective in the first hour.;

, CGP and Collins are all good brands, but try to get the revision guides from your exam board like AQA, OCR, CCEA, WJEC and Edexcel.

, If you can work with music on, this can help you relax. It can also drown out noises around you. Make sure you have an empty desk to work at, with everything you need at hand for the session ahead. Have plenty of scrap paper handy. If you're using the Internet to revise, make sure you know what you want to improve on before you start.

, There are three basic types of learning styles. The three most common are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. To learn, we depend on our senses to process the information around us. Most people tend to use one of their senses more than the others. Try different methods of revision to find out what your learner type is.

, When memorizing a phone number, an auditory learner will say it out loud and then remember how it sounded to recall it. Does any of this sound like you?






Visual learners are those who learn things best through seeing them. Visual learning students like to keep an eye on the teacher by sitting in the front of the class and watching the lecture closely. Often, visual learners will find that information ""clicks"" when it is explained with the aid of a chart or picture.






Tactile or kinesthetic learners are those who learn through experiencing/doing things. For this reason, tactile learners may become bored more quickly than other students while listening to a class lecture. Tactile learners like to experience the world and act out events. To remember a phone number, tactile learners may remember the pattern of their fingers as they press the numbers.







, There's no point revising for 3 hours non stop without taking any breaks. You brain will simply become overloaded with information and will not take anything in.

,, Past exams are one of the most popular ways to revise.

Do NOT hesitate from nervousness.",How to Ace A Levels," Write notes after each class, not during it. Pay the maximum amount of attention in class and maybe write down just a few headlines, then at home write detailed notes neatly on a separate notebook. Include diagrams and tables. If your school allows you to bring a cell phone to class, then record your teacher's lecture and write notes from it at home. This will allow you to pay more attention in class.;
, If you have already attended some classes, rewrite all the notes you have in a more organized way, adding in more information that you have learned since then. Remember, the more you know about a subject the better.

, Study all your subjects every day in small portions. This will help you to reconnect ideas you have previously learned, and helps with memorizing and understanding. After each weekly schedule has been completed, plan and write a new one for the following week. Only have 1 day a week as free time. Be strict and finish all your planned work!

, This will give you essential time to revise, practice past papers and answer additional questions.

,, If you don't find it interesting, try to create interest by studying biographies about famous scientists.

, Change it when this happens.

Assess where you are in the semester and what you have left to do.Do you need to improve your grades in only one class, or many?,
Assess your current studying techniques thoroughly.Sit down and think about how you’ve been studying up until this point.,
Talk to your teacher.,
Talk to your parents.,
Create a study schedule and get yourself organized.,
Buckle down … and stay buckled down till it’s over.,
Make plans for the next school semester or year.,
Go to summer school.",How to Raise Your Grades Quickly1," Do you have assignments left to be submitted, or only the final exam? Make a list of all the classes you currently have, what needs to be done for each class, and the due dates for all assignments and exams.


In order to get the “big picture,” use a calendar to mark out all your assignment due dates and exam dates.;
, Analyze what has worked and what hasn’t - then ask yourself why. Make a list of things you want to avoid doing in the future (e.g., procrastination) - and don’t do them. Figure out what your motivations for studying are and take advantage of them.


This is a good opportunity to learn how to do a S.W.O.T. (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats) analysis.The SWOT analysis method was designed for businesses, but can easily be adapted to your personal academic situation.

, Ask your teacher(s) for advice on how you can improve, and where you might have gone wrong.Keep in mind that this conversation could go one of several ways. If you’ve been a lazy student up until this point, and you’re now asking for help, some teachers are not going to be impressed. Make sure you approach them sincerely and then actually follow through on their advice. If you ask for their help and then don’t follow it, they’re probably not going to be too thrilled to help you again in the future.


Ask your teacher if there are any assignments you can do for extra credit.
Ask your teacher if you can hand-in any outstanding assignments, even those past the deadline. Or if you can re-do any assignments you did badly on.
Ask for help as soon as you know you're having trouble. Do not wait until the last minute to ask for help, or to ask for things such as extra credit. In most cases it will be too late for you.

, Your parents don’t want you to get bad grades, and if you admit you’re having problems, they will likely want to help.Even if all you need them to do is constantly follow-up with you to make sure you’re doing your work, asking for help is a good idea.


Keep in mind that showing this initiative to your parents may help them provide additional support to you in the future. For example, if they see you’re having a lot of trouble with math, they may be able to hire a math tutor to work with you the next semester or during the summer.

, Look through your calendar of things you still have to do and make a detailed schedule. Assign specific study goals to yourself everyday, and the times each day that you’ll spend on studying.Try not to schedule large amounts of time for one topic unless absolutely necessary. Try to study more than one topic per day if possible.Remember that smaller chunks of daily study time are more effective than a huge cram session or two.
If you're in college, you should plan to study 2-3 hours per week for each credit hour you're enrolled. So, if you're in a 3-hour history class, you should plan on studying an additional 6-9 hours per week for that class. If that sounds like a lot, that's because it is -- and it's what it usually takes to get good grades.Don’t forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals. These rewards just need to be small things to keep you motivated to move forward day-by-day - such as allowing yourself an hour to watch your favourite TV show, or an hour to play a video game. Save the big rewards for when the semester is done!

, While not the best advice, if you are down to the wire, cram. Stuff in as much as you can, in whatever time you have left. Drink lots of caffeinated beverages. Forego (some) sleep. Consider this your “hail mary” play and do the best you can.Avoid getting distracted during cram sessions. Turn off your phone and the TV. Don't listen to music with lyrics. You have very limited time, so use it wisely.

, This is, of course, assuming this wasn’t the last semester of school you’re ever going to take! If school is not over, take this opportunity to get yourself ready for the next year or semester.


Buy yourself an academic calendar or organizer.
Review your course syllabi before classes begin.
Make sure you have all the materials you need for each course before the start of the semester, if possible.
Organize your study space.
Research the various ways of getting academic support on your campus (i.e. success centres, writing centres, tutors, etc.).

, No one likes going to class in the summer, but if you’re looking to improve your grades this is definitely an option. You may want to consider re-taking a class over the summer (to increase your grade) or taking a supplemental class to help you prepare for a hard class you have coming up.At the post-secondary level there are additional benefits to taking one or more classes in the summer term: you can reduce your workload in the fall and winter terms, or reduce the total amount of time you spend in college; some summer programs are offered in other countries or at other colleges, giving you a chance to travel; if you’re aiming to take a specific course with a prerequisite, you can get the pre-req out of the way early."
"
Complete a post-semester assessment.,
Get yourself organized.,
Talk to your teacher(s) in advance.If you’re serious about improving your grades, your teachers will help.,
Join or start a study group.,
Take care of yourself physically.Make sure you always get a good night’s rest.,
Get a tutor.",How to Raise Your Grades Quickly2," Ask yourself a series of questions about how you performed over the semester in order to analyze what went well and what didn’t go so well.What did you end up doing differently after deciding to raise your grades? Did any of it work? How much did your grades improved, if at all? What did you find worked really well for you, and what did you find worked really badly for you? Is there anything you’d like to do differently next time?
Think about the study methods you took on that really helped and make sure you build them into your permanent repertoire.
Think about what didn’t work and why it didn’t work. Maybe you tried to study at home and found it was more distracting than you’d like, etc. Make sure to avoid these items in the future.

, Buy yourself an academic calendar and/or a large wall-mounted white-board calendar. Clean up the space you intend to use for studying, remove anything you don’t need (books, magazines, comics, etc.) and organize the things you do need (pens, pencils, highlighters, sticky notes, etc.) Make your study space a distraction-free zone. Organize your study materials in a way that makes sense to you and allows you to find things quickly.


Have a separate notebook or binder for each class you're taking and label them appropriately.
Have pens and highlighters of different colours to signify different things in your notes and textbooks. For example, blue might mean examples, whereas yellow means definitions.
Turn your cell phone or tablet off while studying. And if you're not using it, turn the wi-fi off on your computer while studying. Don't give into the temptation to check your email or text messages!

, Ask them their advice on what to focus on in their class and what methods of studying work best for their material. Ask them if you can review assignments with them before you hand them in.


Keep track of your teachers’ contact information and office hours in a centralized location. Each week review where you are in each course and determine if you need to take advantage of your teacher’s office hours, and if you do, schedule it in.
When asking for advice, try to avoid saying things like ""What's important in your class?"" or ""What do I need to do to get an A?"" These suggest that you aren't actually invested in the class. Instead, ask questions such as ""What types of questions do your exams usually focus on? I'd like to know how to improve my note-taking"" or ""What advice would you give a student who really wants to do well?""

, Work with friends or classmates, as a group, to learn the material and work on the assignments. Quiz each other. Do sample tests together. Take turns “teaching” each other the material.It is advantageous, but not necessary, to have some structure to your study group, such as: a pre-determined meeting time and place, specific study session goals, and an informal leader or moderator.
Study group members do not need to be your friends. In fact, it might be better if they weren’t. Getting together with your friends to study might turn into socialization time, which isn’t helpful.

, Eat properly every day. And exercise as often as you can. Taking care of yourself physically will help make sure you can take care of yourself mentally.


Taking care of yourself also means taking breaks when studying, like getting up and walking around every hour, and rewarding yourself for meeting your study goals.

, Tutors can be folks you’ve hired to spend time working with you on a specific subject, but it can also include your school’s success centres. Most post-secondary institutions have tutoring centres (manned by graduate students), writing centres (that offer both seminars and feedback on actual papers), and success centres (where professionals can provide you guidance and feedback). Some of this extra help is free, while some has a cost associated with it.


If you’re interested in hiring a tutor, ask your teacher for recommendations. They’ll know which former students did well in their class and who might be able to help you.

Read assigned material before and after each class.,
Attend all your classes.As crazy as it sounds, this actually works!,
Take excellent notes in every class.Take notes for every class using a method that works best for you.,
Participate in every class.This is especially important if your teacher provides grades for participation.,
Do your homework assignments as soon as possible.Don’t wait until the night before they’re due to start working on an assignment.,
Hand in any outstanding assignments.,
Ask your teacher for extra credit.It never hurts to ask, and the worst that can happen is your teacher says no.,
Learn and understand the material, don’t just memorize.,
Read all exam instructions completely before starting the exam and then follow them.For some strange reason, one way students lose points on tests is because they don’t actually read the instructions and do what they say!",How to Raise Your Grades Quickly3," Prepare yourself for what your teacher is going to talk about in class. Write a list of questions you have about the material and make sure they’re all answered in class. Review the material again immediately after class and make sure you understood all the concepts discussed; if not, follow-up with the teacher right away.Try reading the material out loud to help it stay in your memory.Your cat might find molecular biology quite fascinating!

, Some classes even provide credit for attendance, so skipping a class like that is just throwing points away. Pay attention in class.


Attending class shows your teachers you’re actually interested in learning. If you need help in the future, they’re usually more willing to help someone who has already shown initiative.
If you really want to show initiative, sit in the front of the class. Not only will this make you more visible to your teacher, but the rest of the class will be out-of-sight behind you, hopefully removing any distractions they may cause.

, Review your notes immediately after class and rewrite them to help the concepts stay in your memory. Make sure to highlight any tips or hints your teacher gave about an assignment or test.


Focus on key items in your notes, such as: dates or timelines, names of people and why they’re important, theories, equations, definitions, pros and cons about a topic debated in class, images/charts/diagrams, example problems.Use a system of shorthand for your note taking if possible. This includes using symbols instead of words (e.g., “&” instead of “and”), and abbreviating words (e.g., “approx.” instead of “approximately”).Make up your own abbreviations if that helps.
Don’t worry about your spelling and grammar when taking notes (unless it’s an actual language class teaching spelling and grammar!) - you can correct that later if you need to.
Gear your note-taking to the course. Some courses can benefit from highly structured methods such as the Cornell method, while others -- such as those that are very discussion-heavy --will benefit from more free-form notes.

, If there are participation grades, teachers aren’t looking for quantity as much as they’re looking for quality. Participation also demonstrates your understanding of the subject matter to the teacher. They may determine, through class participation, that they’ve explained something badly and re-explain.


Class participation can often turn into a class debate - a teacher’s dream come true! If you disagree with what a classmate has said, you can say so, but be respectful. Don’t turn the debate into an argument.

, Begin homework assignments the same day they were assigned (if not known about in advance) or build the work required for the assignment into your study schedule (if known about in advance). Plan to get your homework done in advance so you can review and revise without pressure.


Finishing writing assignments early is especially important as students often lose points on simple things like spelling, grammar, layout, etc. Plus, if you finish a writing assignment early enough, you may be able to get your teacher, tutor or someone else to review it and provide feedback., Every assignment in every class is worth something. Some teachers have a system for how they grade late assignments. Depending on the teacher, you may be able to get at least some points for an assignment even if it's late.And when you’re desperate for marks, every single one counts!


Check with your teacher or class syllabus before doing outstanding assignments. If the teacher will not accept them, and you’re short on time, it may not be useful to complete them.
If the teacher won’t accept late assignments, but you do have the time, use the assignments as practice tests and complete them. Most teachers will provide an answer key you can use to determine how well you did.

, If you do ask for extra credit, and your teacher provides you with an extra assignment or two, make sure you actually do the work.


Don't wait until two days before your term ends to ask for extra credit! This suggests that you were lazy all semester and want an easy grade fix. If you're struggling, ask sooner rather than later.
There is a never-ending debate in the academic community regarding “extra credit.” One side thinks it’s great, the other side thinks it’s bad.Each of your teachers is probably on one of these two sides, and has a good reason for being there (such as their own past experience). While there’s no harm in asking for extra credit, it is not worth arguing about if your teacher says no.

, Actually being able to understand what you’re learning is far better than simply memorizing everything in your textbook.Make sure you’ve perfected one topic before moving onto the next topic, especially if they’re linked.Most textbooks and classes are set up in such a way that each consecutive chapter/lecture builds on the stuff learned in the previous chapter/lecture. If you haven’t learned the previous material, it’ll be much harder to learn the current material.
Use personal or familiar situations to help you understand the material.Textbooks (and some teachers) tend to use boring examples when explaining concepts and ideas, but that doesn’t mean you have to. For example, if you’re learning about Newton’s First Law of Motion where it states that “an object in motion continues in motion … unless acted upon by an unbalanced force” try to think of examples where this makes sense for you.Maybe ‘’The Fast and the Furious’’ … the cars will keep travelling until something stops them. (Not the greatest example, but you get the idea!)

,


For example, have you ever had that situation where a section of a test asks you to choose 4 of the following 6 topics to write an essay about, but you end up writing an essay for ALL 6 topics? This is a clear situation of not reading the instructions, and then losing valuable time doing work you didn’t need to do, possibly at the expense of completing other parts of the test.
There is also no reason why you have to do the test in the order it’s written - unless each question builds on the previous one. Look through the entire test first, then start with the easiest questions and work your way to the hardest questions. This will help build your confidence as you write the test.
Tests aren’t the only place where you need to follow the instructions precisely. If you’re writing an essay and the teacher asks for double-spaced lines with 12pt Times New Roman font and 1” margins - then DO that. Don’t use single-spaced lines with 10pt Arial font and 1.5” margins!

Find out what exam board your qualification is in.,
Once you have the exam board, be wary and make sure you have the right qualification.",How to Get GCSE/A Level Past Papers Online1," If you aren't sure, the best and most reliable way to find out is to ask your teacher. It might also be stated in any textbooks you have been given or any specifications or past papers you have already. Check at the bottom of the page, or at the front of a past paper for a logo. In all likelihood, all of your qualifications will not be from the same exam board, so be prepared to search around a little to find past papers for all of your exams.

, Take a look at some of the documents and check whether it seems like the things you are being taught. You may be taking something like an IGCSE (International GCSE), which will have a different specification to a normal GCSE. Some exam boards, notably OCR, will have different types of a similar qualification, e.g. Mathematics A, Mathematics B and so on.

Make a “master” to-do list.,
Complete the tasks you delineated in your to-do list.,
Organize your daily activities by creating a timetable to clearly delineate your day/week.,
Purchase a planner or use a free service like Google Calendar.Using a pre-designed calendar for your timetable is especially helpful if you do not have time to create a calendar of your own.,
Complete the most urgent items in your timetable earlier in the day.This way you can also ensure that you get all of your most time-sensitive work done.

",How to Balance Your Homework With Extra Curricular Activities or Friends1," This is a list of all your academic, extracurricular, and social goals, desires, and obligations. Do this both for short- and long-term goals you’d like to meet. This will allow you to clearly see what your goals and interests are at the moment and will give you an idea of how you should be dividing up your time.Include anything that you want or need to devote time to in your list. If you have a project due next week, write it in. If you have in mind to complete a college application by next month, put that on the list as well. And yes, playing that awesome new video game for an hour the day it comes out should also be factored into your list.
Create a realistic timeline you will use to meet your goals. Set a due date next to each item, and organize your list by due date. This way, you can hold yourself accountable for meeting your goals by the dates you have established.;
, Stick strictly to your due dates. If you follow your timeline, it will be easier to keep track of what you still need to do. It will also relieve you of the stress that often comes with not having strictly set deadlines. Cross off each task as you complete it. This will help you keep track of the work you have done and what you have left to do. You will also feel a great sense of validation when you look back and see all that you’ve accomplished!
Reward yourself occasionally. You’re meeting your goals! Keep up the great work.

, A timetable will propel your productivity by allowing you to clearly see what you need to do and when you need to do it. Angle it more towards daily tasks rather than long-term goals, and make it as detailed as possible (e.g. do homework from 5:00-6:00, eat dinner from 6:00-6:30, and so forth).Leave a bit of a cushion for unexpected events and for transitions between different activities in your timetable. You never know what could arise, and you want to be prepared and flexible enough so that unforeseen circumstances don’t throw your schedule and your productivity out of sync.Schedule breaks into your timetable. Breaks are conducive to mental acuity - don’t underestimate their power!Go for a nice walk or watch a funny animal video - just get your brain out of “work” mode for a few minutes.

Consider the type of planner you will use very carefully. Planners come in all shapes and sizes - from daily to weekly to monthly- and you should pick the format that works best for you so that you get the most out of its usage.

Set aside a Saturday or Sunday every weekend just for social activities.,
Consider participating in extracurricular activities with friends.,
Reach out to your friends for advice and guidance.",How to Balance Your Homework With Extra Curricular Activities or Friends3," For example, knowing that Saturday is your “off” day will allow you to put boundaries around how much time you are able to devote to schoolwork versus to socializing. If you don’t waver from the pattern you establish, this division will also keep you on track - if Saturday is for play, then Sunday is for work., When you do this, you reduce the urgency to socialize with friends in other time-consuming ways.That way, you can devote more time to homework if you need to or even for independent downtime.

, Recall that as much as you can distinguish between school and extracurricular activities or hanging out with friends, studying can also be an activity that you do with or alongside others. Even if you aren’t working on the same projects, you and your friends are on the same (or a similar) boat. Observing or directly asking your friends how they balance their work and social lives can be helpful!

Plan for how you're going to handle the workload.,
Stick to your revision schedule as much as possible.,
Study frequently but take breaks.,
Get help if you need it.,
Watch out for signs of stress.,
Stay healthy and active.,
Try to stay away from anything that might cause extra stress.,
Relax as much as possible.,
Get all your equipment ready for the exam.,
Go into your exams, having done lots of revision and relaxed.,
Have fun whilst waiting for your results.",How to Avoid GCSE Stress," Create a precise timetable detailing times set for revising, relaxation, sleeping and exercising. Start this process well ahead of time, so that you can allot enough time to study each day, without being overwhelmed.


Ideally your study schedule will be divided by subject, with a little extra time spent on the subjects you need more work on. If you need help deciding when and how to study for which part, ask your teacher or tutors for input.;
, This will help you feel in control and avoid your being overwhelmed by stress. Leave lots of time for relaxation and breaks; don't overwork as you will become tired and more stressed.

, You want to revise hard, but you also want to build in breaks, and break your studying up into sections so that you don't overwhelm yourself. Don't get so absorbed in what you're doing that you forget to get up, stretch, and have a drink or a snack every now and then. You'll come back to the books more refreshed and focused if you allow yourself little breaks.

, If you don't understand a concept or need a little extra help in a particular subject, don't wear yourself out going over and over the material again by yourself. Reach out to teachers, tutors, or your parents for clarification and help. This will not only reduce your stress levels but also help you master the material.

, Are you becoming nervous? Do you do repeated unusual actions? Do you feel unwell, with signs of headaches? These are all signs of stress; try to reduce it as much as possible by talking to friends or family.

, Try to eat and drink regularly and remember to sleep as much as possible.


Exercise is also a good way of keeping stress levels to a minimum; it will help keep your mind off the forthcoming exams.

, A tough time with friends or a bad relationship are prime examples. Try to stabilise your surrounding life so your full attention can be on your GCSEs. It's not a good time to take on new challenging hobbies or relationships, or start a new part-time job.

, Treat yourself often and take time to just do what you want to do. While you need to find time to revise, you can balance this with relaxation time. A calm relaxing bath for example can be therapeutic.

, Full preparation is key; knowing that you are prepared for the exam as much as possible will hopefully reduce your stress. Make sure you have all your supplies for test day ready ahead of time.

, Remember that you can do it! You have done lots of revision and will be ready. Try to remain calm; bad nerves could hinder your academic performance.

, You have finished your exams they are in the past. You have done the best you could have so relax. Enjoy your time with friends and family and try not to focus on your exam performance. Going on holiday or meeting up with friends is a great way to distract yourself whilst waiting.

Try pronouncing each letter out loud several times. Take your time, and do this slowly.

Now for the rest of the letters.",How to Pronounce Difficult Arabic Letters3," You have to practice them correctly or they will stick with the wrong sound in your head. One problem is, Arabic letters can be written in Romaji the same way but they each have their own pronunciation. Try to make your tongue light, your control of air pressure in your mouth precise and your throat and teeth more obedient in order to say them correctly.

, Take your time! It's okay to taste the letters before saying them. Seeing your mouth's movements in the mirror helps. The difficult letters will be split into two parts


ح - haa' is the sound you make when you clear your throat, only keep your mouth open when you do. Usually when we clear our throats, we start by holding air then letting it out forcefully. With ح , you end the letter with suddenly cutting the air.
خ - like forcing phlegm out. I know it's gross, but khaa' requires less effort than you can imagine. End it like ح, with a sudden cut of air. Remember not to put too much pressure on it, just a slight blocking of air will do.
ص - this one is a bit tricky. Start by saying S normally then pull the middle of your tongue to the base of your mouth, leaving the tip close to your teeth. Now try to make this sound and follow it with a, ending with D. Something like SSaad should be the result. ص is like a magnified version of س
ض -  also like ص, this is a magnified version of د, made by saying D, only pulling the middle of your tongue down. While د is gentle and easy to make, ض or Daad is more of a heavy and deep sound. After pronouncing the sound, open your mouth to add an 'aa' sound and end with normal D.

, Try to whisper or say the ones above out loud for some time. Don't cram everything at once. You can practice those while doing anything, like working around the house, studying or gardening.

,


ط - is forceful sound. Put the tip of your tongue between your teeth, and pull the middle section down. Apply air pressure against your teeth and let it out forcefully. To help, try imagining ط like a pressuring T.
ظ - unlike ذ, this one requires also pulling the mid-section of your tongue down. End it with an 'aah'.
ع - this one comes from the throat. It's the sound you make when you gag. Follow it with an 'eain'
غ - made with literally gargling on air. You probably do this everyday when brushing your teeth and kids do it when they drink to make bubbles in their mouths. End it with 'ain'.
ق - while ك is made with pushing your tongue to the roof of your mouth while blocking the air in your throat, this one is made with pulling your tongue down while blocking air. Let the air out from the upper behind of your throat. This sound is made in cartoons when a character gulps down a drink.

Don't just say the letters on their own.,
Listening to the pronunciation of those letters helps a lot.,
Be gentle on your throat!,
Lastly, read!",How to Pronounce Difficult Arabic Letters4," Try to find words with those letter in them. See how they turn out in different positions in the words, beginning, middle or end.

, But remember not to trust your inner ear for the accuracy of these sounds. It's better to record your voice while saying these words and comparing them later to actual pronunciation.

, Repeating those letter alone all the time might leave you with a sore throat since you're not used to it. Take your time and proceed slowly.

, Learning how to speak by reading gets you used to these letters faster and gives you much less stress than when saying them alone.

Ask questions.",How to Pay Attention When You Are Confused1," If you feel quizzical, no doubt others will feel puzzled as well; so when you turn your confusion into questions not only will it be useful to you, but also you may help others. You can start by considering asking any of the 5 Ws: Ask what, when, where, why/how, and/or who?.

Keep your eyes on the ball or the road; on the speaker at work, the subject at school or wherever--in the game--on the sales floor; don't stare.,
Nod positively.,
Develop the jigsaw of bits that you understand into the big picture like a puzzle.,
Decide to puzzle-it-out; make your way through the maze...,
Get in a habit of devoting time and mind-power: meet your own expectations that you will think, listen actively and read actively with total concentration like an extreme-athlete concentrates on the dangerous moves.,
Be interested: Avoid getting bored: so don't study the cracks in the floor tiles, or the grain patterns of the door or woodwork, or analyze the speaker's accent; that's called ""spacing out"" a form of dissociation...Some people appear to use milder forms of spacing out (but not when you need to listen and be aware of other people) as a strategy to get by under stress to avoid being overwhelmed.,
Purposely pay close attention to whomever has the floor.,
Smile and do a thumbs-up like when you understand a step in reading or listening, like getting an answer to a question.,
Say affirmations like ""Okay, yeah!",How to Pay Attention When You Are Confused2," Get in the zone, like an athlete who can't miss, in an altered state of consciousness. A synonymous phrase is ""altered states of awareness"" or ""altered state of mind""... It can be associated with your creativity: artistic efforts or the reveries of the inspired engineer.So be in a state of creative effort in your area of study or work. Be on the edge of your seat; lean slightly toward the speaker; be ready to learn and to make your inputs.


Get each and every piece of the puzzle and every phrase; understand each clause and sentence, and eventually fit it all together. The goal is to get the picture; see the panoramic picture by finding and getting the bits of the picture all together in your life and in studies and your short term and long term goals.;
, Shake your head ""Yes!"" in class during lecture and class discussion or when hearing, reading and understanding a small point; it's all the small matters that form the whole subject; so work to understand each detail. Of course the wide view is equally important for seeing how it fits and to understanding--not to learn by rote (not by memorizing). The goal is to understand, not just to memorize nonsense (as it might seem without a better understanding).

, Concepts are to understand... But, memorizing rules, axioms, postulates, identities, concepts, history and definitions must be mastered, and then applied and manipulated in math and science, even details of history, foreign language, spelling or grammar, etc. must be mastered by memorizing and then applying them.

, Many things like 1000 piece puzzles are not like a snap of your fingers--a subject to learn is like a big, new puzzle--but it is based on what you've done before and what you already know and built up. That is of course why there are fundamentals to never forget and review as you advance... You will begin to put the ideas together. Develop the small bits understood into the big picture like a jigsaw puzzle.

, Every move of a snow boarder or skier is a risk and a challenge. A great athlete is on the edge; s/he knows what the other people are doing. So it is in your career, your art, your studying, your teaching, and your business: be there--on top of it. At the top of your game.

, If you did not have this ability get in the zone to some degree, you might otherwise go nuts from emotional or sensory overload., Keep your eye on the ""ball"" in sports or in keeping up with what people are doing in any competitive activity or business. Well in class, that means listen to the teacher and to the students who are participating.

, Build on the things that make sense, be glad when you understand.

, Being positive, involved, if only smiling, nodding ""yes"", saying ""Right; I agree!"" which makes you alert and engaged!

, Don't fight it! Try reciting main ideas in your mind when there is a lull or pause in presentation, material, or lecture in other training; don't break the reverie. People can feel as if they're living in a bubble, which they don't necessarily wish to come out of... Concentrating and feeling protected by some sort of separation from the rest of the world. It helps feeling generally relaxed and hyper-focused on the here and now.Committing complexities to memory and understanding it in context is necessary. Make it part of you... not just the facts; the drama, the scheme of it all; what is it, and how does each concept fit into the whole panorama of your subject.

, Maybe you have a friend in the same class who will work on studying for a big sales presentation or a test or hard homework or other assignments with you. Make a friend! Do your part.

Watch the four video guides to become eligible to take the exam.,
Try a suitable single session.,
Study the Videos carefully: These videos consist of a narrator or instructor that walks you through many of the different tools that Bloomberg has to offer.,
Don’t stress out.,
Take the Test.

,
After the Test: If you passed, Congratulations.",How to Pass the Bloomberg Essentials Certification Exam," These videos serve as the guide you must study and comprehend before you take the exam. These videos are around 15 to 30 minutes long and packed with information you should know. It is important to note at this point, you are only able to take the exam once (or twice depending on your terminal) so it is essential that you concentrate on learning all of the material that is presented. Many people who have taken this exam believe, the most essential video in this whole process is the last and longest one. It explains the Bloomberg API system. This is a system that allows users to bring in data from The Bloomberg into Microsoft Excel. Many of the questions in the exam, may potentially involve topics covered in this final video. Pay attention to this one.;
, After researching on the Internet, you will discover that many of the official classes are done in a single session. If you can concentrate that long, it is highly recommended doing it that way. When you break it up, the information is not as fresh in your head. What ever you do, don’t let it go more than a week or two before you take your test or you will forget it. After you complete the 4 videos, there is a 30 question exam that can take anywhere from 30-90 minutes to complete depending on the person. Before you start, put your cellphone away, log off of your Facebook, Twitter, and any other social networking platforms, and remove anything that may distract you. If you miss something, you will have to rewind the video and if you do that, you are wasting time.

, When he or she is doing something on the video, you too should execute these commands on your other workstation window. This will help you retain the information better. If you fall behind for any reason, rewind the video to a place where you understood it. If you are a curious person, and you enjoy learning things after, each of the videos, explore further. Use the commands that they taught you and looked at personal stock picks and used new tools that were not covered during the videos. This is recommended to everyone; once you finish a video, go explore more. Learn how to execute the commands that you were taught with speed and accuracy. In the real world your speed and accuracy will help your firm make money and prevent it losing money. Information is power. If you have the information (even by a few seconds) before a competing firm, that creates opportunity.

, If you did the videos and practiced, you will pass the exam. Don’t cheat. It is easy enough to pass this test, don’t cut corners with something that you will carry with you for the rest of your life; eventually you will have to prove yourself to your boss, and if you say you are certified, you should know exactly what you would see if you type “AAPL <EQUITY> BOLL GO” into the Bloomberg.

,, If you didn’t… Don’t worry, you should be able to take it again. If not, contact the Bloomberg rep and have them reset your account. Review your questions and find out what you did wrong. The terminal will show you all of your answers along with what the correct answer is. Next, do all of the videos again and don’t be discouraged and take the test again. Learn the material and get certified.

Treat a pass/fail class as a normal class.,
Review the syllabus.,
Come to class prepared.,
Establish an effective note-taking strategy.,
Participate in class.,
Ask questions.,
Complete assignments thoroughly and on time.,
Study.,
Keep track of your performance.",How to Pass or Fail a Class1," One of the biggest pitfalls of students who take a class as pass/fail is to exert minimal effort, since it’s not being taken as a traditional class for a letter grade. In most schools, a failing grade in a pass/fail class will show up on your transcript and tank your GPA. Take the class just as seriously as you would any other. While an “A” and a “C” carry the same weight in a pass/fail class, an “F” is always an “F.”;
, The syllabus has all the information you’ll need to know before starting the class. Read through it and highlight important dates, rules, etc. A typical class syllabus will include some combination of the following:


Course description
Professor’s contact information and office hours
Units or topics of study
Materials needed
Homework assignments
Dates of tests, quizzes, projects, etc.
Grading policy
General classroom policies and expectations
Suggestions for success

, Preparation includes any physical items needed for class (i.e. notebook, laptop, textbook, writing utensil, etc.), as well as having your homework or assigned reading completed. Come to class on time and with all the necessary preparations to ensure you will be as successful as possible.

, Taking notes engages you during class and helps to document the information covered so that you can study it later. There are lots of different note-taking strategies that work well for different people. Try out different styles of note-taking and see which one works best to help you learn and summarize the material from class.No matter the strategy used, all effective class notes should have the following in common:


Be well organized
Distinguish main points from details
Include examples
Allow for self-testing
Use abbreviations to help write quickly

, Class participation shows your professor that you’re interested and willing to put in the effort to understanding the material on a deeper level. It also helps you to pay attention in the class and not let your mind wander off. In many classes, class participation is factored into your final grade. , If you’re confused or need clarification, ask your professor for help- that’s what he or she is there for! Take advantage of your professor’s office hours, which will allow you one-one-one time to ask questions, review material, and catch up if you're feeling behind.

, Every assignment, from a simple homework, to a written paper, to a complex project, is designed to deepen your understanding of the material. Put effort into every assignment, whether it counts toward your grade or not. Handing in an assignment late frequently results in a loss of points, or at the very least will put you behind in the class. Ask for an extension on an assignment only in an absolute emergency.

, Find a study routine that works for you and stick with it. Study habits are very personal and one person's approach may not work for you. Try out different methods of studying; use the strategies that help you and forget the ones that don’t.Some popular study tips include:


Establish a set time each week to study for your class.
Find a quiet place to study with few distractions.
Use notecards to help learn important terms, dates, formulas, ideas, etc.
Review general concepts first, then focus on the details.
Quiz yourself on the information, or have a partner quiz you to see in which areas you are strongest and which need improvement.
Study with a classmate or study group that is serious about learning the material.
Don’t cram. It’s better to study a little information more frequently than to try to review a lot of information all at once.

, Closely monitor your grades on all submitted assignments to make sure you’re staying within the passing range. Don't aim to achieve the minimum grade for passing the class. One poor test performance can send your “C-” grade to an “F,” ruining your chances at passing."

Consider the pros of taking a class as pass/fail.,
Examine the cons of taking a class as pass/fail.,
Research your school’s policy on taking a class as pass/fail.,
Register for your class as pass/fail.",How to Pass or Fail a Class2," Taking a class as pass/fail can be a great option, depending on your personal academic situation and learning goals. Think about the following advantages:


It can alleviate the stress that comes with taking a class for a traditional letter grade.
You can concentrate more on the classes within your major.
You can explore subjects outside of your major without worrying as much about how you'll perform in the class., While taking a class as pass/fail does have certain benefits, there are also disadvantages to take into consideration. Weigh the pros against these cons:


You still need to do the work required of the class. Working really hard for a grade of “Pass” instead of an “A” can be unsatisfying.
You usually can't switch back once you've decided to take a class as pass/fail. That means if you're earning the equivalent of an ""A"" grade in the class, you can't change your grading option to a traditional letter grade.
If you change your major, and a class you took as pass/fail becomes a required class for your new major, you may need to re-take it., While all pass/fail courses generally follow a similar format, the rules and expectations of pass/fail classes can vary greatly among schools. Research your school’s policies on pass/fail classes and talk to a school advisor to verify information or ask questions.Some questions to consider are:


How many pass/fail classes can you take per semester? Per academic year? Per college career?
What kinds of restrictions are there in taking classes as pass/fail? For example, many schools don’t allow you to take any classes within your major area of study as pass/fail.
What is the minimum grade you need to pass a pass/fail class?
What is the effect of a pass/fail class on your overall GPA?
Will taking a class as pass/fail impact graduation with Latin honors?
What happens if you fail a pass/fail class? Does it go on your permanent transcript? Will you have the opportunity to retake it as a pass/fail class?
What are the general expectations of students taking classes as pass/fail?

, If you decide to take a class as pass/fail, follow the directions in your school’s student handbook or on the website for enrolling in the class. Usually there is a different registration process for taking a class with the pass/fail option- sometimes it's as simple as clicking a button while registering, other times it requires submitting a form. Talk to an advisor if you’re unsure.

Talk to the teacher.,
Ask for a chance to revise.,
Try to make up missed work.,
Find out about extra credit opportunities.",How to Pass a Class1," If you are struggling with a class, your first step should be to talk to the teacher and let him or her know you are struggling.Your instructor should be able to offer you some insights on how to pass the class, and whether that is still even a possibility.


Many instructors will be able to give you helpful study tips or insights on how to perform better on assignments. In some cases, you might even be given an extension on assignments you are struggling to complete on time.
Try not to until the last minute to communicate with your teacher. If he or she doesn't hear from you until the end of a course, there may not be much that can be done at that stage even if the instructor would like to help. Further, if you don't communicate with the teacher early, she or he may assume you just don't care about your performance in the course.;
, If you are at risk of failing a class because of work you did poorly, contact the instructor and ask if you might be allowed to revise and resubmit your assignment.


While you probably still won't be able to get full credit for a revised assignment, many instructors will be open to this possibility, because it shows you want to learn from your mistakes and improve your performance. For this reason, many instructors will be more open to this than offering extra credit opportunities.In making this request, explain that you would appreciate another opportunity to show you have mastered the material. Try to make it about demonstrating learning, not just about a grade.

, If you are at risk of failing a class because you missed an exam or assignment(s), ask about an opportunity to make up some or all of the missed work. Even if you only get partial credit for it, this is better than no credit at all.


If you have a course syllabus, look at what the instructor's policy is for late work. This will give you some sense of how likely it is your request will be granted.If you missed work for medical reasons, be prepared to show documentation of your illness if possible. Many instructors require this.
If you miss an assignment or exam due to illness, a crisis, or some other unavoidable situation, let your instructor know as soon as possible. You will be more likely to be given a chance to make up the work if you do so.

, Some teachers offer extra credit opportunities that allow students to add points to their final score in the class. These opportunities are often designed to supplement the primary assignments or give students a second chance to master skills.Find out if your teacher offers any opportunities.


If you don't see any listed in the syllabus, it doesn't hurt to ask if there will be any opportunities of this sort. While many teachers are unlikely to create an extra credit assignment just for you, if enough people ask, he or she may offer an opportunity like this to all the students.
Do not beg for extra credit. Instead, think in advance about some reasons you can offer for why you should be granted an opportunity to earn extra points. Be prepared to make a strong case for your position. Arguments such as ""I really need to pass this class"" are unlikely to take you far.

Discuss the importance of an education.,
Explain how grades are important for college.,
Talk about how their peers might view them.,
Talk about how grades are just one way of measuring their abilities.,
Stay informed about your teenager's grades.,
Find a tutor.,
Reward them for success.,
Work with all relevant parties.,
Help the teen manage their responsibilities.,
Make sure that they get enough sleep.,
Diagnose any learning disabilities.,
Identify if the teen is suffering any emotional or psychological issues.,
Think about whether the teen is using controlled substances.,
Find help for the teen.",How to Motivate Teens Toward Better Grades," Your first step should be explaining why education is important. In doing this, you should focus on both the abstract and concrete.


Education is important for starting a good career and making a person into a good citizen. Tell them that through education, they’ll be able to understand complex problems that we, as citizens, must grapple with. Say something like: ""Education will make you a better neighbor, it will make you a better voter, and it will probably make you a better friend.""
Education is important in helping us understand the world. Without education, we won’t have the knowledge to understand the world around us. For example, explain how their science classes will help them understand how the natural world works. Use the example of plant leaves and photosynthesis, and explain how science helps us understand how plants function and grow.;
, If the teen has any interest in attending college, they should be concerned about their grades. Because of this, you should spend a little time explaining how colleges evaluate potential students based on their grades.


If the child is in middle school, explain to them that excelling there will prepare them to excel and get good grades in high school. Say something like: ""While you don't think it matters now, your education is preparing you for challenges you'll meet later!""
Tell them that “Colleges look very carefully at your grades when they are considering admitting you!” You might remind them that grades start counting towards college in 9th grade.
If the teenager says they don't care about college, you might remind them that a good college education can give them a better career and standard of living later in life.
Explain how it is never too late to improve their grades in high school. If the teen in question is in eleventh or twelfth grade, let them know that some schools may weigh the last years of high school more heavily than earlier years.

, While some teens think that it is uncool or nerdy to perform well academically, kids that perform poorly in school are actually looked down upon by their peers. Thus, you need to explain that while they may want to seem cool, they might gain a poor reputation if they consistently fail.


Discuss how they can balance their desire for social acceptance or “coolness” with positive academic performance.
Remind them that they shouldn't care what other students think about their grades. You may want to encourage them to avoid telling other students what their grades are.
Explain to them that regardless of what they think, people have linked popularity to academic success.
Say something like “You can be smart and cool, too!”, After you’ve explained why grades are important for their future, you need to briefly discuss that they’re not everything. Ultimately, you want the teen to understand that they need to be a well-rounded person who earns good grades, but also excels in other aspects of their lives.


Explain how they might not be able to earn top marks in every class. Let them know that not everyone can be good at everything. Say something like “It is okay to not be the best in every subject.”
Let them know that it is okay to balance academics with other things they excel at, like sports or other extracurricular activities. However, also let them know that it is not ok to sacrifice academics for the sake of sports.
Tell them that poor grades don’t mean they’re not intelligent. Ultimately, if a teen thinks that they can’t succeed, it will be very hard to motivate them toward success.Keep in mind that there are other ways than just college for a teenager to succeed after high school. They could go to vocational school or community college.

, By the time you realize the teenager is failing, it may be late in the semester. Make an effort to learn about their successes and struggles throughout the school year so that you can help them as soon as possible.

Talk to them frequently about school. How are they doing day to day? Is there anything they enjoy about school? What do they dislike about it?
Review grades on assignments, tests, papers, and other submitted work. If the child doesn't do well, instead of punishing them, have a chat about why they struggled. Is there anything they can do next time to improve?

, Get a tutor to help the teen in subjects they are struggling in. A tutor might provide the teen with the type of intellectual and academic support to help them go the extra step toward success.


If you’re a parent, ask your teachers if they know of any school resources or any private resources available to help your child.
If you’re a teacher, see if your institution has any tutoring resources for the teen in question.
Spend time working with the student individually., Depending on your position, you may be able to provide different types of rewards for academic performance. You might find that a reward – even if it is simple – will go a long way in motivating the teen.


Offer rewards for grades. This could be in the form of meals, presents, trips, or anything you deem appropriate. While this might seem like bribery, it could just work.
Verbally communicate your pride or happiness when the teen succeeds academically. Say things like “I am so proud of you” or “I knew you could do it.”, You also need to make a concerted effort to communicate with all people relevant to the teen’s success. After a little work, you may find success by recruiting a team to motivate the teen.


Ask your teenager who they want to be involved in this process. They may have a mentor, friend, spiritual leader, or family member who they feel comfortable in approaching about these issues.
If you’re a parent, make sure you maintain a dialogue with the teen’s teachers. Encourage the teacher to motivate the student and say things like “I know you can succeed.”
If you’re a teacher, make sure you’re engaged with the other teachers and the student’s parents. Let them know that you’re working to motivate their child and any support they could offer at home would be helpful.
Make sure everyone is providing positive motivation and is encouraging the teen on a daily or weekly basis., Sit down with the teen and talk about creating a schedule to balance their obligations. By doing this, you’ll give the teen tools to help them deal with their responsibilities. At first you may have to monitor them frequently, but as they get better, you can give them more and more freedom. In the end, they’ll likely be better organized and more motivated.


Suggest they create a to-do list.
Suggest they get a day planner so they know when projects are due and tests are scheduled.
Help them design a study or homework schedule., Sleep is a major factor in educational success for teenagers, but many teens don't get enough sleep. Encourage your teenager to sleep at least 8-9 hours a night. This means that they may have to go to bed a little earlier so that they can wake up for school. More sleep will help them pay attention in school and give them more energy to complete assignments.Avoid letting them have any caffeine in the evening so that they can sleep well at night.
If your teenager has problems sleeping, take them to a doctor.

, One thing that might be holding the teen back is undiagnosed learning disabilities. Not only can learning disabilities inhibit the student’s capacity to learn, but having an undiagnosed disability may lead some teens to feel inferior or like failures. Once you’ve diagnosed any problems, you can take steps to provide learning support and motivation to the teen.


Schedule a visit with a professional who can evaluate the teen’s intellectual and academic capabilities.
Have the teen take an IQ test or aptitude test.
Talk to the student about why they think they are failing to excel.
Remember that teens who struggle with learning disabilities may feel as if they can’t succeed. If they think they can’t succeed, they won’t be motivated to do so., Emotional or psychological problems could be hampering the teens motivating and undermining their ability to succeed academically. By identifying any underlying emotional or psychological problems, you’ll be able to help the teen get treatment and motivate them toward academic success.


If you’re a teacher, recommend that the student sees your school counselor or mental health expert.
If you’re a parent, locate a mental health professional that specializes in children.
Common problems may include depression, anxiety disorder, attention deficit disorder, and more.
If you’re an educator, you should consider whether the teen is being psychologically or physically abused at home. To do so, schedule a meeting with the teen and ask them if they’d like to talk about anything. Don’t compel them to talk, but ask them if they’d like to volunteer information. If you think they are being abused, contact a school counselor or law enforcement., Certain drugs may undermine a teen's motivation and impede their ability to maintain high grades. Because of this, you should watch for warning signs associated with drug abuse.


Marijuana and other drugs may impede the teen’s academic performance. Watch for signs such as blood shot eyes, extreme moodiness, disinterestedness in socializing, or in the case of uppers – extra energy.
Watch for the abuse of prescription medicines such as Xanax, Valium, OxyContin, and Adderall.
if you suspect a teen is abusing drugs, contact their parents, your school guidance counselor, and other authorities (if necessary).
Consider if the teen is going through normal teenage problems, such as relationship issues. The teen might be melancholy or disinterested in academics because they’re depressed about a relationship or just simply distracted by other stuff going on in their lives., Ultimately, whatever the non-academic problem the teen is facing, you need to get them help. By getting them help, you'll clear up the larger problem that is sapping their motivation.


Contact a learning disability specialist to help if your teen has a learning disability.
Get a psychologist, psychiatrist, or counselor for teens with emotional or psychological problems.
Enroll the teen in a drug rehabilitation program if they need."

For example, if 60 percent of your grade comes from exams, you should spend the majority of your work time studying for exams. On the other hand, if 60 percent of your grade comes from papers or other assignments, you should focus a large portion of your energy there.
In most college courses, this information should be spelled out in the syllabus.If your teacher hasn't provided this information for you in printed form or on a course website, don't hesitate to ask.

, Keep track of how well you are doing in each aspect of the class. This will give you a sense of whether or not you are passing, and again, where to focus your energies. Further, research shows that students who track their progress in class score better than those who do not.For example, if you do very well on all written assignments, but are struggling with exams, you want to consider spending less time on the homework and more time preparing for tests.

, Taking into account both the aspects of the class carry the most weight and how you are doing in different areas, focus your attention where it is most needed to ensure you will pass.


In an ideal world, every student would have time to come to every class, regularly review their notes, and do every assignment. For a variety of reasons, many students cannot. It may feel wrong to neglect certain aspects of a class in favor of others, but sometimes it's better to skip (or not dedicate much time to) one assignment in favor of another. Likewise, sometimes studying for a major exam is more important than doing a less important homework assignment.For example, imagine written assignments make 30 percent of your final grade, and you currently have an 90 percent average on your written assignments. Imagine exams make up 40 percent of your grade, and you only have a 52 percent in this area. If there's both a major exam and a written assignment due next Friday, it probably makes sense to spend the bulk of your time studying for the exam, even if that might mean skipping the written assignment entirely.

Go to office hours.,
Join a study group.,
See a tutor.",How to Pass a Class3," If your teacher offers office hours outside of class (i.e. for a college course), attend them regularly. This is a good chance to get some extra help and one-on-one attention from your teacher.When you go to office hours, come with specific questions or topics you want to discuss or review. This will help you get focused attention where you most need it. Furthermore, most teachers don't appreciate it when students come to office hours with no idea what they want to cover.
Do not just bring your homework or study guide to office hours and ask the instructor to fill it out for you. Teachers find this very frustrating.

, Find out if other students in your class are studying together. If so, ask if you can join one of these groups.


Study groups allow students to pool their knowledge and understanding of the course, sharing information with each other and creating a regular study schedule.Ask people you know in the course if they are studying with other people. If you can't find a study group, you might try to start one yourself by asking other students if they'd be interested in participating in one.

, If you are really struggling, you may need to seek additional help with a course in the form of tutoring. A tutor can help you by clarifying concepts and reviewing information with you in a structured way.


Many schools offer free tutoring services to students in the form of writing or tutoring centers. There is usually no additional cost for using these services.Find out if your school has such a program, and when it's open. You may need to make an appointment, so find out about that, too.
If you have the money, you can also hire a private tutor to work with you. You can either hire an individual tutor or enlist the services of a tutoring business. Look online and on bulletin boards around your school to find out what services may be offered near you. Your school's website may even have listings for tutors available to help in different subject areas."

Attend class regularly.,
Be on time.,
Pay attention and participate.,
Take notes.,
Do your homework.,
Study effectively.",How to Pass a Class4," Of course, the best option is to not get in a position where you are failing in the first place. It may seem obvious, but one of the most important things you can do to pass a class is show up.This is the best way to get a sense of what content is most important and what the teacher wants you to do.


Even if material from class sessions is duplicated in course readings, attending class will give you a sense of where you should focus your studies.
Attending class gives you a chance to ask about material you are confused by or having trouble with.
Some teachers include an attendance score in calculating final grades. Even those that don't are less likely be accommodating with extra help for students who don't come to class, as they appear to not be making an effort.

, In addition to coming to class, it's important that you arrive on time. Important announcements about exams and major projects often occur at the beginning of class. Missing these announcements can mean missing important information.As with poor attendance, teachers often don't look favorably upon students who don't show up on time. Being late is disrespectful and disruptive.If you need help from your teacher in the form of extensions or extra credit, being on time regularly may make the teacher more likely to be lenient.

, Of course, just being physically present in class isn't enough. You need to be mentally present as well, paying close attention and participating in class discussions and activities.Many classes have a participation component in the final grade, sometimes a large one.Not participating can mean losing valuable points.
Being attentive in class will help you better understand the material.
Asking questions in class can help you grasp challenging concepts, and also signals to the instructor that you are engaged and trying your best.

, Always take notes in class, even for material that is simple, and even if you are recording the teacher's presentation.


Notes can be the basis for a study guide when it comes time to study for exams.
Taking notes helps reinforce the material in your brain and will help you remember it later.Taking notes by hand, rather than with a computer, is thought to be especially helpful in making material easier to remember and understand.This can be more challenging, but for many people helps significantly with recalling information.

, Try to do every assignment the teacher gives. In most cases, these assignments make up a significant portion of your final grade in the class.


Even getting an ""F"" on a homework assignment you struggle with is much better than getting no points at all.
Many assignments will be designed to teach and reinforce information or ideas that will be important later in the course, e.g. on exams.Doing assigned readings is important, too. Most teachers will not assign a reading just to give you something to do. Course readings typically contain important information which may not be covered in lectures or other class sessions., Regularly review your notes on what happens in class, as well as the readings. This will help you remember the information more easily come test time.


When you read for class, underline, highlight, or take notes indicate ideas or information that seems most important. This will make review go more quickly and easily.Create a study guide before exams that lists or visually maps the most important concepts and ideas.Go over it several times to make sure you are comfortable with all of the main course concepts.
Start studying early. Don't try to just cram on the night before the exam. Studying throughout the course, or at least for several days leading up to an exam, will give you more chances to rehearse the information and commit it to memory.

Avoid tricks that are easy to catch.,
Talk with the reviewer after the test.,
Wait for your official results and any further instructions.",How to Pass a Polygraph Test," A polygraph cannot detect a lie, per se, but it does track physiological changes in your body, like your blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and perspiration, thereby detecting physiological conditions that occur when you lie.


Once you arrive for the appointment, the equipment and process will be reviewed. It does not hurt to familiarize yourself with the basics on your own, but avoid polygraph horror stories posted on the Internet, since these will only make you more nervous than you need to be.;
, If you spend too much time worrying about the polygraph test before you take it, you run the risk of skewing the test against your favor by finding things to condemn yourself on needlessly.To avoid worrying yourself unnecessarily, do not ask anyone who has taken a polygraph what it was like, do not spend time soul-searching before the test, and do not try to anticipate which questions will be asked.
Try to avoid spending too much time reviewing anti-polygraph websites, since these websites often mix fact with hyped-up conspiracies and may cause undue panic.

, You need to be comfortable during the polygraph in order to provide accurate physiological responses. In order to be comfortable, you need to make sure that you are well-rested and feeling as physically cozy as possible.


Follow your usual routine as accurately as possible. Even if your routine includes activities that affect your heart rate, like drinking caffeinated coffee or going for a morning run, you should follow your routine since your body has trained itself to run on those physiological conditions.
Try to get seven or eight hours of sleep the night before the test.
Make sure that you are not hungry and that you have loose, comfortable clothes on.

, Depending on the reason for the polygraph, you might have security clearance forms to fill out or forms requiring your authorization. Take your time on these forms. Read through them carefully and sign your name only when ready.

, If you are currently ill, the examiner may want you to reschedule the test. Certain drugs, like blood pressure medication, can also affect the results, so you should let the examiner know about those, as well.


Illness can make you feel uncomfortable, thereby skewing the results.
If you take prescription medications, you should continue taking them as prescribed by your doctor before the test.
Contrary to popular belief, most anti-depressant medications cannot alter a polygraph and allow you to ""beat"" it. You should still tell your examiner about these medications, if applicable, since they can produce abnormal results.

, The polygraph examiner is required to tell you the questions ahead of time. Take all the time you need reviewing them, and feel free to ask the examiner for clarification about uncertain or confusing questions.


You must ask for clarification about questions before the test. In most cases, you will not be permitted to do so during the test. In fact, your answers will be limited to “yes” and “no” during the polygraph exam itself, so any discussion you need to have about the test questions must take place before the test itself.

, The standard polygraph test is the CQT, or ""Control Question Test."" In some instances, however, you may be given a ""Directed Lie Test"" (DLT) or ""Guilty Knowledge Test"" (GKT) instead.With a CQT polygraph, control questions will be mixed in among the relevant questions. A control question is one that nearly everyone will need to reply ""yes"" to, even though many people will be tempted to reply ""no."" Such questions include ones like, ""Have you ever told a lie to your parents?"" or ""Have you ever stolen or borrowed something without permission?""
With a DLT, you will be asked several questions by the examiner and directly asked to lie about those questions. In doing so, the examiner can gauge your physiological responses to lying by reviewing the questions he or she knew you lied on.
For a GKT, you will be asked multiple choice questions about various facts that only you and the examiner would know. Many of these questions will be about the case. Your verbal responses will be compared to your physiological responses.

, Nowadays, no one is expected to remain perfectly calm during a polygraph test, even if the person in question is perfectly innocent and has nothing to hide. By allowing yourself to be nervous, you can provide the polygraph examiner with an accurate representation of your physiological statistics when you are being truthful and when you are lying.


The lines on the polygraph screen will never be flat and smooth, even if you are telling the truth.
Oddly enough, only the person who is nervous about every answer will appear the most truthful on a polygraph test., If you have nothing to hide or be ashamed of, then tell the truth to each question you are asked. This includes control questions, for which many people are expected to lie. The more often you tell the truth, the more accurate the results will be. This is a good thing, as long as you are innocent.


While people often believe that there will be ""trick"" questions designed to trap them into a guilty answer, the current state of ethics surrounding the administration of polygraph exams demands that the questions remain straightforward. No surprise questions will be asked, either.
Listen to the entire question thoroughly and answer it precisely. Do not listen to only half the question or answer the question according to what you think it asked rather than what it actually asked.

, You can ask the examiner to repeat a question two to six times, depending on who is examining you. Make sure that you find out how often you can ask for a question to be repeated before the test begins. Do not rush through the questions, since this sense of haste can skew the results against you.


Questioning usually takes five to ten minutes, but it may take longer depending on how often you ask to have the questions repeated, how long you take to answer the questions, and the nature or reasoning behind the test.

, If you feel the need to cheat or manipulate the test, one thing that most people recommend is to cause yourself mental or physical stress when you are expected to give the answer to a control question. This will give you a higher baseline, so when you tell lies relevant to the case or situation, any spikes in your responses might be smaller than the spike you just created during the control.


Think of a frightening or exciting thought when you recognize an obvious control question.
You can also make your heart rate and perspiration increase by trying to solve a somewhat difficult math problem in your head. Try dividing 563 by 42, or some other similar problem., When asked a question relevant to the case or situation, put yourself in a calm state of mind when you answer. By staying as calm as possible, you can prevent many major spikes in your physiological responses.


Essentially, a “lie” only counts if that lie generates a greater physiological response than that which you had while you were telling “white lies” with the control questions. As long as your physiological response to a question and answer produces a less noticeable reaction than any reaction you displayed while answering the control questions, it will probably not count against you.
Maintain your breathing pattern and keep in mind that the polygraph is not infallible, and that you are in control of your own physiological response.
Daydream about something soothing,like cuddling under a warm blanket with a cup of hot chocolate on a cool night, or taking a relaxing shower or bath.

, If the examiner catches you trying to cheat the test, you might be asked to schedule another test or the examiner may take countermeasures against further acts of manipulation. Moreover, attempts to manipulate the test might cause the examiner or reviewer to judge your results more harshly once you finish.


For instance, do not stick a thumbtack in your shoe and attempt to press down on it to spike your vitals during control questions. Oftentimes, an examiner will have you remove your shoes during the test to avoid such tricks.
In fact, while physical pain will cause your vitals to spike, it is usually easier to catch than psychological stress. Biting your tongue, clenching a muscle, or other similar tactics can be caught easily if you are working with a trained polygraph professional.

, After you take the polygraph test, a reviewer will go over your results and determine if you need to be questioned further or if any points need to be clarified.


The reviewer will likely ask you about your responses only if the results are inconclusive or if he or she suspects you of lying.
In reviewing your results, the reviewer and examiner will also consider your emotional state, medical and physical condition, and the factual details of the case or circumstances calling for the test.

, Your results will need to be professionally and officially analyzed before any judgment can be made on them. If you are suspected of lying or if your results were inconclusive, you might be called and asked to take another polygraph test.


The American Polygraph Association Standards and Ethics Committee requires the examiner to release the official results to the examinee upon request, so even if the results are not automatically given to you within a week or two, you can call or contact your examiner to request those results."

Set up a study space.,
Establish a regular study routine.,
Go to class regularly.,
Keep your papers and assignments organized.,
Develop good time management.,
Form a study group.,
Take good notes.,
Hit the books.,
Complete your assignments.,
Reward yourself.,
Don’t be afraid to seek help.,
Live a balanced life outside of school.,
Set goals.,
Learn to cope with failure productively.",How to Make All A's in High School," First things first, you’ll need a quiet sanctuary for studying if you want to get good grades. Think of it as your “fortress of solitude.” A good study space will put you in a the mental mood to hit the books.It could be your room, a nook at the library, a table at your favorite cafe, or a home office. It doesn’t really matter so long as you feel at ease there and are able to focus.
Make sure that your space is distraction-free. If you get sidetracked by the internet, be sure that your computer isn’t connected. If you are bothered by noise, find a study space that is out of the way and quiet.
Try to make the space as comfortable as possible. If at home, use an ergonomic chair. Plants can make a study space more calming, as well.;
, Successful students usually set aside regular times during the week to study. You don’t need to spend hours every day on task. You might schedule study sessions three times or four times per week; it all depends on what works best for you.It is better to spread out studying over time. This will give you more time to digest, and then review, material. The important thing is that you study regularly enough to avoid last minute cramming, which studies show to be ineffective.Another important point is that you keep to your routine. Establishing a schedule is not just about learning, but about making studying part of your life. When the time comes, you’ll be able to transition into the right, focused frame of mind.
Make sure that your study sessions have a clear goal, as well. For example, you might make a plan for reviewing last week’s material each Sunday night. On Tuesdays you work on the week’s new math chapter and do reading for English. On Thursdays you go through your new material in biology and history. Set specific goals for each session to help you focus.

, This is maybe the most important part of getting good grades. Every class that you miss puts you behind in terms of notes, explanations, assignments, and reading. You can’t afford to miss these things – you cannot fully catch up with what you’ve missed.Class should be your first priority as a student. Make a concerted effort to get out of bed and to school every day. And, of course, don’t cut classes.
There are clear benefits to being in class. What you learn in class is usually a supplement to what’s in your textbook. The teacher might present things in a different light, use different examples, or give new perspectives that improve your grasp of the material.
Consider that your studying will be easier if you pay attention in class. Having reviewed the material once before, you will already be familiar with it and can often cut down on your total study time at home.If you must miss a class or two, make sure to ask the teacher what you missed. You can also have a friend bring you up to speed or, if possible, ask to see her notes from the class.
Remember, however, that taking your own notes is better than borrowing a friend’s. In fact, one study shows that students who use borrowed notes score much lower than students who regularly attend and take their own notes., Disorganization is a big pitfall in school. Some people can keep track of assignments, papers, due dates, and classes in their head. Most of us cannot, though. Try to create a system or organization that keeps you on top of things, be it through a day-planner, folders, binders, or filing system.Notebooks are useful for note taking. For example, you might buy one binder for each of your classes to keep your notes separate and easy to access. Buying different colors will also make it easier to tell the subjects apart.
Binders are the next level in organization. For example, you might divide a binder into sections for classwork, completed homework, and tests. Some have pockets in which you can store your notebook, as well. Again, it’s good to have different binders for each subject, each in a different color.
A day planner will keep you on top of all of your classes, assignments, tests, and deadlines. Planners come in several varieties. Some have a few lines each day for reminders. If you need lots of structure, however, consider getting one that lets you plan each day hour-by-hour.

, Having good time management is important to studying hard and effectively. Part of using your time well is organization, while another is knowing and training yourself. Developing these can help you to get those higher marks.Set priorities. You will need to prioritize school and study in order to get good grades. You might make a “to-do list,” for instance, for each day or even each week or month. Start with the most urgent tasks and then list them in order of priority.
Schedule your time. Using an aid like a day planner, block off time when you will work on given tasks. You might try scheduling the most urgent tasks first and at times when you’ll have fewer interruptions. Or, try scheduling challenging tasks for times when you’ll have lots of energy.
Push out distractions. Avoid things you know will distract you, be it noise, email, your phone or computer, or otherwise. If it helps to maintain your focus, break tasks into smaller units – then reward yourself for completing each unit.
Avoid multi-tasking. You might think that you’re good at doing many things at the same time. In fact, science suggest that you aren’t.Multi-taskers actually make more mistakes, forget more, and take longer to complete items. This is because you lose time and focus in switching from one task to another.
Get started early on big projects. Long-term time management is important, too. A lot of students fall into the trap of putting off projects until the last minute, and then struggle to finish them. This can lead to poor marks.

, Study groups can work great – after all, don’t people say “two heads are better than one”? For one thing, a study group can help if you don’t understand a concept. By teaching each other, you and your partners will also internalize material more quickly.Study groups are great if all the members are committed. However, they are less helpful when members are not committed and the group is not structured.
Try to hold your study group regularly. Make sure that your friends and peers are all in – members should be actively contributing and not just along for easy answers. Study partners can also hold each other accountable.

, Reviewing and studying often starts with your notes – the notes that you took in class. We tend to forget things very fast. Studies show that, without review, we forget 47% of material within twenty minutes. We forget 62% in a day.Having good notes can determine how well you do on tests, quizzes, and mid-terms. Taking them will also help you to stay attentive and listen to the material actively.


Good notes don’t include everything that the teacher says or explains. They condense it into the most important points. Learn to recognize important information. Listen for keywords and phrases. Anything that the teacher writes on the board or repeats is usually important.Your notes should consist of points or short sentences rather than entire explanations. Focus on the “fat” rather than the “trimmings,” and keep in mind that you should be able to return and fill anything you’ve missed.
Try to record facts, details, or explanations on the main points. Include important definitions, if they are given, word for word. Again, anything that is put on the board, on slides, or is repeated is probably important and should go into your notes.
Go back and review and edit your notes within 24 hours. Highlight anything that you can’t read or that you don’t understand, writing your questions in the margins. Try to fill the gaps by comparing your notes to readings. If you still have unanswered questions, ask your instructor to repeat the information the next class.Consider taking notes by hand rather than on a computer. Using a pen and paper forces you to listen, summarize, and pick out the most important information. It means that you are actively thinking about what the teacher says. Research also shows that people who write down notes recall information better than those who use a computer., Studying, and studying often and regularly, is probably the most important part of getting good grades outside of attending class. Here is where your notes come into play. Review them, rewrite them, synthesize them, and make an outline. Find methods that help you to internalize the material.


Try outlining and rewriting your notes. Re-reading what you’ve written is helpful. However, using a more active strategy will force you to think about the concepts and explanations. It puts the words and terms into your own language. Talking aloud while you write helps, too, and engages another part of your brain.Use mnemonic devices. These are things like word play or rhyme that help you to recall information. For example, you might remember the names of all of the Great Lakes with the word “HOMES” – Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior. You could do the same by inventing a song.

, Make sure to tackle any and all assignments and homework. Remember that your grade might be based mostly on assignments. Even if you have a lot of homework for a class, missing one assignment could cost you 3, 4, or 5% of your final grade. It could mean the different between a B+ and an A.


Rely on your organization to remember your assignments. Make sure to write down all of your homework and deadlines in your day planner.
Give priority to upcoming assignments. Plan accordingly. For example, if math homework usually takes you a while, block off enough time so that you can complete it and complete it well.

, Studying is hard. To make it less of a chore, try to motivate yourself by taking breaks and giving yourself small rewards. These will make the task easier, give you something to work towards, and reinforce your study habits.For example, break your studying into sections. Promise yourself a 15 minute break for every hour that you study. Use the time to daydream, check your email, or take a breather outside.
You can promise other rewards as well. Like cookies? Say that you’ll treat yourself to a cookie after dinner if you can finish your math problems. Or, give yourself 30 minutes of computer gaming for each biology chapter that you are able to review.

, Be proactive inside and outside of the classroom. Your instructors are usually happy to help if you ask for it, and oftentimes have time set aside specifically for answering student questions about ideas, assignments, or projects.


Bring your questions to the instructor before or after class, for instance, when they are around and not busy with other students.
You might also find out if your teachers have special “office hours.” Write the hours down in your planner for later reference. If you later have questions or would like extra help with a concept, pay a visit.

, Keep in mind that study is not the only part of being a successful student. Balance is important. When life is out of balance, everything from focusing to studying becomes much harder. Remember that you’re not just a study machine but a person with other emotional and physical needs.Make sure to eat well and exercise. A good diet and physical activity will not only keep you healthy but prime your brain for learning.
Sleep is another important element of balance. We need sleep in order to function at our highest level. Aim for at least 8 hours a day, if possible. Avoid activities, food, or drinks that keep you up late and try to stick to a regular sleep schedule.
Too much work can lead to stress, anxiety, and sometimes depression. Get out, see friends, and socialize; spend time with your family and loved ones. Find ways to reduce levels of stress.
Take up an extra-curricular activity. While it isn’t good to overload your schedule, playing a sport, doing drama or debate, or joining a club is a great way to socialize and to meet new people.

, Studying and good grades are only the beginning. Where do you want to go and what do you want to do with those grades? Think some about the future and set goals. Be specific. Be ambitious. Having a clear sense of purpose will reinforce your study habits and keep you on track.Your goals don’t all have to be lofty. They could be as simple as passing an upcoming test. Still, that gives you something to work towards in the short term. Other short term goals could include making the Honor Roll, getting into Advanced Placement courses, or getting Student of the Year in Latin.
Longer term goals might have to do with what college you want to attend, what you want to study in the future, or even what career you want to pursue.

, There is a big difference between being a high-achiever and a perfectionist. Perfectionists set unrealistically high goals and judge themselves harshly, often because they want other people’s approval. In fact, perfectionists are often more anxious, depressed, and prone to emotional problems than others.Know your limits, and learn how to grow from setbacks.


Nearly everyone has to deal with setbacks at some point. Don’t let it get you down. Do not think that making a mistake means that you have failed personally.
Try to use your setback as an opportunity to grow and learn. If you got a bad grade on a math test, go back, review the concepts, and talk to your teacher about your difficulties. If your essay got a lower mark than you expected, talk to the teacher about how you can improve in the next one.
Set standards that are high but achievable. No one can be absolutely perfect. Most of all, remember that your success in school is measured by grades but that, ultimately, the most important thing is learning.

Find and use online learning resources.",How to Pass Social Studies Class," Chances are your teacher supplied you with a printed or digital document at the beginning of the school year containing essential information about the class. This syllabus likely includes information about the course structure, your teacher's expectations of you, and possibly even a list of projects or assignments and their projected due dates. Look over the syllabus carefully to figure out what you need to do to succeed in the class and plan ahead for deadlines.


If your teacher did not supply some kind of syllabus for the class, you will have to speak to her directly. Before doing this, make sure your questions have not already been answered in your first-day class notes or in previous email correspondence from your teacher.
If you were given a paper syllabus, consider scanning it and saving an electronic copy on your computer. This way you can easily print another copy if you lose or damage the original without having to ask your teacher.;
, If you are unclear on what is required of you in the class after reading the course syllabus (or if you don't have one), then you should speak to your teacher about her expectations. Tell your teacher that you want to make sure you are aware of all course requirements so you can plan accordingly. Your teacher will likely appreciate your initiative and be happy to help you.


The earlier you do this, the better. Asking your teacher a week before the cumulative semester exam what you need to do to pass her class is not going to be received well. Being proactive about your grade shows that you care.
If you find the subject matter especially challenging, don't be afraid to tell your teacher this. You might not be the first student to say so, and there is always a chance your teacher might make adjustments to the class to accommodate your concerns.
When speaking to your teacher, avoid finger-pointing. Your teacher puts a lot of work into designing her course, creating lessons, and grading student work. She will not appreciate being told that your issues with the class are her fault (even if there is some truth to this!).

, If you were given a schedule for the course stating when all major assignments and projects are due and the dates of the exams, use this to create a calendar for yourself.You can do this digitally (using a phone app or computer program) or the old fashioned way (on a printed calendar) -- just choose something that you are likely to regularly check and maintain.


Having a calendar like this will make you less likely to forget important dates. You can also modify it later on if any new assignments are given or dates are changed.
It is a good idea to set reminders in your calendar several days or even a week or two before important due dates. Doing this may help prompt you to get an early start on your coursework so you can be as thorough as possible and get it done on time.

, Are your homework assignments always due on Thursdays? Do you have an exam every six weeks? Are you only assigned reading on Mondays and Wednesdays? Asking questions like these can help you figure out whether the class works on a predictable schedule. This will help you pace yourself and strategize your efforts.


Establish your own schedule for studying and doing homework using what you've figured out about the rhythm of your class. For example, if you only have reading assignments on certain days, you might want to plan to work on projects or other assignments on days that don't overlap with your reading.
Be aware of your own study habits and abilities. If, for example, you are able to quickly complete readings but take longer to do written homework assignments, you should plan for this and adjust your schedule accordingly.

, You will learn and retain the material much better if you are paying attention to your teacher in class.You should strive each day to make the best possible use of your class time and face-to-face interaction with your teacher. In order to do this, you will need to make sure you are free from distractions.


Show up to class on time and prepared to learn. You will have a hard time succeeding in class if you always show up 3 minutes late and forget to bring a pencil. A little planning goes a long way, both in terms of your learning potential and how your teacher perceives your work ethic.
Leave your phone and any other potential sources of distraction in your backpack or book bag during class and don't take it out until class is over. This will keep you from being tempted to take your attention away from class.
Sit toward the front of the room or close to your teacher's desk if you have the option. This will help keep you from talking to your friends during class or doodling in your notebook while your teacher is talking. If you are assigned to a seat in the back but find yourself getting too easily distracted, ask your teacher to move you.

, Your greatest resource for doing well in class is your teacher. Not only is she a trained and licensed educator, but she is the one grading you. If you encounter a topic or assignment during class that confuses you, speak up! Find an appropriate time to raise your hand or speak to your teacher one-on-one so you don't leave class without having your question resolved.


Asking questions during class shows your teacher you care about learning the material and are making an effort to do well in her class. This is guaranteed to be appreciated by your teacher, so long as your questions are relevant to the subject and not inappropriate.
If you don't have an opportunity to ask your question as soon as it comes to you, write it down so you can ask your teacher later. Depending on your teacher's preferences, you can even send her an email about it so she can respond to you directly or during your next class meeting.
Remember that if you have a question about something, you probably aren't the only one. In this sense, asking questions in class is almost like doing your classmates a favor that helps you out, too!

, One of the most common reasons students receive poor marks in school is that they don't complete the required coursework. Fortunately, this is also one of the easiest problems to fix. It is very unlikely that you won't pass your class if you do every assignment and turn it in on time.


Effort counts. If you turn in work you clearly didn't make an effort on, this could count against you because it will show your teacher that you don't care enough about the class to put in the work.
Go the extra mile once in a while. This means doing more than the bare minimum on assignments or projects. For example, if you are assigned a report that requires a minimum of two sources, try to find at least three. This might earn you a better score, and at the very least will demonstrate to your teacher that you are willing to work for your grade.

, Teachers often design lessons with the assumption that their students have already been introduced to the material through assigned readings. You will get the most out of class if you read about the topics prior to attending class.This will also allow you to come to class with any clarifying questions you may have.


Devote enough time to reading that you are able to at least absorb the main points. If you wait until you are already tired on the night before class to begin reading, you will struggle to get through it and probably won't remember it very well.Take notes on the main points of the reading and review them before class. This will prepare you to grasp the lecture material more easily and will reinforce the important points of the topic(s) you read about the night before.
While you are reading, think of questions you can ask your teacher in class about the material in the textbook. This can help you link important concepts together and will help you absorb what you've read. This also shows your teacher that you are doing the assigned reading before class and taking an active role in your learning.

, Never try to take an exam without studying. Social studies courses often present lots of concepts, dates, places, and names, which can be difficult to remember. You will perform much better on tests if you devote significant time and effort to studying the material several weeks in advance of the exam date.Ask your teacher for a study guide. If she gives you one, use it to help you prepare for your upcoming exam. You can go through the topics on the guide, one by one, and make sure you understand each one. Ask your teacher for help with particularly difficult topics.
Form a study group. If you have friends in your class, ask them to help you study the course material. This can be a useful way to combine your knowledge with that of others in the class. As they say, two heads are better than one!
Quiz yourself often. You might not understand the material as well as you think you do simply from doing the assigned reading. By quizzing yourself on a range of topics in the days following their introduction in class, you can identify topics you need to work on -- and you'll learn the material better.Match your study style to the exam format. Ask your teacher about the structure and format of the exams so you know what to expect. Make sure you're not limiting your studying to memorizing definitions if your exam will be all essay format, for example.

, If you are struggling, one of the best things you can do to improve your grade is to ask your teacher about her expectations. Maybe you are losing points for simple mistakes you can easily fix -- if so, your teacher will tell you what you've been doing wrong. You should not assume to know what your teacher wants without being told!


Go to your teacher in person. You can do this before class, after class, or during study hall. Teachers are very busy, so meeting with her in person will help show her you are sincere and is more likely to make your particular situation stick in her mind.
Be genuine when discussing class issues with your teacher. If you can show her you actually care about learning, she will be much more willing to help you out or even cut you some slack.
Don't make excuses for why you are struggling. Keep the conversation focused on the specific issues you're having with the material. Accept responsibility and don't pass the blame; this way, your teacher will be less likely to think you are just trying to get out of doing the work.
If you have already turned in all the work you've been assigned, ask for extra assignments to boost your grade. Just be careful not to ask for this if your teacher has a ""no extra credit"" policy. If your teacher agrees to this request, make it a priority to complete the work and turn it in on time!

, If you have trouble studying on your own and/or if the material doesn't sink in during class, then consider finding a professional tutor. Be aware that a tutor is not there to do your work for you, but rather to help you understand things better; it is still on you to do the work required for improvement. Use the internet, services at your school, or the recommendation of a teacher or peer to find a tutor to suit your needs.


Social studies classes often involve lots of writing in the form of essays, reports, and research projects. If you have trouble with writing in general, you may want to seek help from a writing tutor.
Make sure your sessions are one-on-one. Some tutors try to meet with several clients all at once, which means less individual assistance for you. You will reap the biggest benefits of your investment by only booking sessions for one-on-one help.
When using tutoring companies, request that you be paired with a tutor who has special experience or expertise in the particular social studies subjects you are struggling with. If your class is focused on American political science, for example, you wouldn't want to get paired up with a tutor who only knows about European history.

, If there are people in your class who seem to understand things better than you do, ask them to pair up with you for study sessions. After all, they are probably putting in study time already and probably won't mind assisting you with the material. This kind of deal can be helpful to everyone involved, because your friend will retain information better if he helps explain it to you and you will have a patient, knowledgeable peer to study with.When forming student work groups for collaborative projects, choose group-mates who are strong, committed students. It will be very difficult to get anything done if the other members in your group are also struggling, are always off task, or don't care about the class. If you find yourself in a group that won't mesh well with your goals for the class, politely request that your teacher place you in a different group (and be sure to tell her why you want this).
Don't expect your classmates to teach you the material. Even if they seem to get the material, they are also just learning it! Your classmates' advice or instruction should always be supplemental to more reliable sources; always consult your teacher or course textbook when in doubt. You can be more certain that the information you're getting is reliable if it comes from multiple sources.

, Let's be honest: not all teachers and textbooks are good at explaining complex topics. If you are in this kind of situation, it may be time to seek out additional resources online. There is lots of great (but also totally unreliable) information available on the internet. You have a good chance at finding something online that you can understand more easily than your textbook, and it may be easier to find than you'd think.


Check to your assigned textbook for supplemental resources. These tools often come in the form of online, interactive activities that offer alternative methods for teaching the course material -- and it is also often easier to make sense of them. Look for information on these inside the cover of your textbook; visit the publisher's website or ask your teacher if you can't find any information in the book itself.
Search online for information about your study topics. Chances are good that there are discussion forums, online wikis, and/or even professional academic journals available for the subject(s) with which you need help. Just don't use opinion-based information unless you are researching a debated topic. Some red flags for unreliable websites include: no citations, lots of advertisements/pop-ups, and a sketchy feel to the information. If any of these apply to a website from which you are getting information, don't trust it!

Create a calendar.,
Get organized.,
Plan ahead.",How to Maintain Good Grades While Playing a Sport1," Using a planner to keep track of important sports matches and school assignments can keep you on schedule. Opt for a calendar that allows space to create notes, so you can jot down critical dates and events.


When selecting a calendar, pick one that extends months out so you can take a long view of upcoming athletic practices and assignments. Keep a pen handy too, so you can write things down as they come up.A digital planner on your phone or tablet is an easy solution too, if you’re not the pen-and-paper type. Something you can throw in your gym bag is ideal.;
, Planning ahead the night before can help you accomplish your goals at school and at practice the next day. Look at your calendar, and gather all the books, sports gear and homework you will need. Laying out all these items ahead of time ensures you won’t forget anything important and will be poised to do your best work. This will ward off any stress from forgetting what you need.


Try putting the items in a place you can’t help but remember them, such as by the front door.

, Adjust your mindset to focus not only on the day ahead, but also towards the week or month ahead with a broader focus. If you have sports-related travel or games coming up, be sure to carve out additional time to take care of schoolwork.


If looking at all your to-dos is overwhelming, try setting smaller, more manageable goals. You’ll feel yourself making forward progress when you can check these smaller component parts off your list."

Use the buddy system.,
Join a study group.,
Embrace a tutor.",How to Maintain Good Grades While Playing a Sport2," If you find you’re having trouble managing your workload in light of your sports commitments, seek out a study partner.


Look at your competitive season and plan out multiple study dates ahead of time, so you’ll know you can make them.
When you make a date to study with someone else, you’re more likely to keep it. This will help you stay on track.
It may be beneficial to find another athlete who has a similar schedule to you. You may even make a new friend.

, Sometimes solving problems or learning new material can be easier in a group setting. You stand to benefit from the differing ideas and approaches of many people. Plus, you’re already a team player., When you’re struggling with material or have fallen behind, there’s no shame in calling in the professionals. A tutor can help you overcome challenging subject matter and get you back on your game quickly.Many schools have additional tutoring support in place for student-athletes. If your school has a specific student-athlete liaison, they would be a good place to start.
Your school can help connect you with a tutor who would be a good match for your needs. Many teachers and older students actually tutor in their spare time.

"
"
Sideline social media.,
Table athletic concerns to study.,
Create scheduled breaks.",How to Maintain Good Grades While Playing a Sport3," Your time is already at a premium due to your sports schedule. Make separate time to talk with your teammates about the latest scrimmage, so you’re not tempted to eat up your study time.If you need to use your computer to complete a project, close chatting applications or make yourself unavailable to talk. This will keep you from getting sidetracked by a conversation that’s not apt to help you complete your work. Don’t try to juggle your fantasy team and your term paper research on different tabs. The fantasy team will always win out!
Place your phone on Do Not Disturb, or if you’re really struggling with the temptation, turn it off entirely. Placing it in another room can keep you from getting sucked into a team text chain.

, It can be hard not to focus on your latest loss (or even amazing win!) when it’s time to do your homework. Practice clearing your mind before a study session so you can best devote yourself to the task at hand.


Try meditation to calm your thoughts so you can focus. Yoga can also help center the mind and is great for your body, too., Schedule a break to do some stretches every 30 or 45 minutes while working. By creating a scheduled opportunity to take a mental break, you’re more likely to work through difficult tasks. Plus, it will keep your post-practice muscles loose through long periods of sitting.

Eat a good breakfast.,
Attend your classes.,
Keep on top of your daily workload.",How to Maintain Good Grades While Playing a Sport4," A nutritionally-dense breakfast has been proven to maximize both academic and athletic performance.Fuel your brain and body properly by opting for whole foods, such as turkey bacon and eggs or a piece of whole grain toast with peanut butter.


Breakfast choices high in fiber and lower in sugar will keep you feeling satisfied longer., To succeed in school and get good grades, it is absolutely critical that you attend your classes.Interfacing with your teacher every day and keeping up with daily reading will keep you from falling behind. You can also discuss your sports schedule with your teacher to get a head start on upcoming assignments.


If you have to miss class for a game, get a trusted friend to give you a copy of his or her notes. By reviewing what was covered, you can stay on track to succeed.

, It is extremely difficult to find the time to clear a backlog of work or assignments when you fall behind. Ten pages of reading today may be hard, but finding the time to read twenty tomorrow is even more difficult.


If you find you’re running short on time to get things done, try to multitask. Review some flashcards in the dugout or while you brush your teeth. By tackling multiple things at once, you’ll make the most out of your time."

You have to want it.,
Always show up for class.,
Remember that studying is similar to working out--it's done best in shorter periods regularly.,
Make college your priority.,
Get organized-make sure that you know when tests are and exactly what you have to study.

,
Having a full-time job may keep you on track and make sure NO time is wasted.,
Take a full course load but level it out.,
And lastly remember why you are in college.",How to Maintain a High GPA in College," This is the most important step. If a 4.0 is your number one priority, you will get it. This means you will be ready to sacrifice things such as going out with friends, keeping up with your favorite television shows, and sometimes sleeping.;
, If attendance is part of the grade, always show up. You should attend class regularly regardless if attendance is required.

, This means study consistently (it may be daily) and don't crash study. Learning to study for long periods of time is an important skill as well. It may be hard or impossible at first, but it can be mastered.

, Only go out when you don't have work to do.

,, However, if you are at a point where you are not sleeping regularly, a job may be a good thing to cut out. I recommend finding a job where you can study like university library or secretary position.

, Take a hard class or two with two easy classes. Don't take chemistry, calculus, zoology and trig all in the same semester. Be careful of the tricky 1 or 2 credit courses. They can be very time consuming, even more so than a 3 or 4 credit class. Sometimes, you will have to take a full course (generally after higher level major classes have started and gen eds have ended), and a study schedule becomes critical.

, You are there to learn so don't moan about going to class -- see it as an opportunity to improve yourself. Take pride in your commitment to your studies. However, do not neglect the fact that you will become depressed and will have no friends if all you ever do is study. Staying sane is half the battle, and having friends should remain a priority.

Find a fun stress-reliever.,
Plan ahead.,
Focus while studying or doing homework.,
Don't procrastinate.,
Study with friends.,
Keep yourself motivated.",How to Make Good Grades Without Stressing," What better way to eliminate stress than have a good time? Working too hard on good grades can lead to stress and anxiety. Don't spend all your weekends fluttering about your room gathering books and writing down facts. These are a time to relax and take a break. Invite friends over, play outside, play a video game, light some candles, take a spa day - whatever makes you happy. This will help you focus better for longer during the school week, so that you can achieve those grades when it counts.;
, Invest in a small calendar you can take with you anywhere. Look for a cheap one at a dollar store, or check out a local bookstore for nicer calendars. Write down all your upcoming assignments and when they're do, and add study sessions or homework time so that you set aside enough time to finish your assignments. Writing down each assignment as you get it helps you stay on top of all your work, and scheduling time to complete them well in advance of the due date ensures that you have enough time to finish them and do them well. This also eliminates stress because you get to know you are in control and are organized.

, Don't turn on your favorite song, tap your foot, watch TV, daydream, or get up to get food when your really not hungry, as all of these activities are distracting and will keep you from working efficiently and effectively, which will help you achieve better grades. Focusing on only one thing (your work) will also help you not stress over other things.

, Every time you put off doing an assignment, you stress about it a little bit more. Pretty soon, all that stress builds up to make it much harder to actually complete the assignment. Rather than procrastinating, start early on assignments - you'll save yourself from the stress, and your work will get done faster and better.  Use your calendar to show you when you got your work done and when the due date is. It will make you feel proud when you know you finished before the due date. You then will exude confidence and your grades will rise.

, Working with friends makes your work more fun and less stressful. It can also increase the quality of your work. Asking friends any questions you have or helping teach them material they don't get will cement your knowledge of the material and help you turn in more well-thought-out, better-quality assignments. The helpful academic tips and facts of others will help the score on your next test go through the roof!

, Know that you have to work the hardest for the things that matter most. Never let down and always know that in the long run your grades will affect your future. Never stress and always remember hard work always pays off. Stay confident and believe in yourself. You can have a stress-free year and excel!

Make time for your family.,
Schedule a weekly social activity.,
Make time for yourself.",How to Balance School and Work as an Adult1," Some parts of your schedule are going to be inflexible, such as class times and work days. Fit homework and studying in when you're not in class or at the office. Build a routine that you can stick to, but are able to adjust if other important things come up. As a working student, you have to be ready to adapt to new assignments, unexpected errands, and sudden work crises that need to be addressed immediately. Make enough studying time in your schedule so that if something comes up, you can shift it into another slot during the week.


Get a calendar. Write out what you need to accomplish each and every day. When you accomplish a task, check it off with a pen. This way you'll be able to still see how much you've accomplished, while keeping your future tasks organized.
If you have other members in your household, keep your calendar posted where everyone can see it. That way, they can avoid making plans that involve you during times when you aren't available.;
, A planner is especially useful if you have a lot of appointments and your days are so varied that you have trouble keeping track of your schedule. Fill in all of your fixed appointments - class times, work times, due dates, and familial obligations. This way you'll know exactly when your free time is, so you can schedule studying sessions or leisure time.

, Most smartphones have calendar and to-do list functions on them. Apple and Google products have the capability to sync with your laptops and desktop computers so that you can share your schedule between devices. If you add something to your calendar in your smartphone - a new assignment's due date for class, perhaps - it will appear on your home device as well., Talk about your schedule with your friends and family. Give them a glimpse into what the life of a working student looks like and they might just empathize - perhaps, they'll even try to make your life easier. At the very least, they'll know when to expect you and when to leave you alone to conquer your other goals.


Sign up for an online calendar and send the URL to the people who depend on knowing where you are and when. You can use a special calendar site, or just share a Google Calendar with them.

, Figure out what steps you need to make it to where you want to go and set goals for yourself. Do you need 5 courses to finish a program? Find out when they're offered and create a multi-year schedule. Every school is different. Go see an advisor and get them to help you map out your entire program, so you know what to expect.

, As you fill out your schedule also include time for your family and family obligations. Create a separate column for things you need to do to keep your house in order, your spouse happy, and your children well. Schedule things like laundry and family meal times alongside studying and other work related activities.If you have children, make sure their needs are met. You'll have to take them to daycare/school. Some jobs and schools even provide daycare for their students.They'll need to be fed and you'll need to spend as much time as possible with them. Make sure that you don't neglect your children while going to school.

, You want to maintain your friendships. At the beginning of every week, schedule something fun to do with your friends for the upcoming weekend. It will show that you are still making an effort to be friends and it will give you something to look forward to during the week., With all of your responsibilities, you probably have a hard time finding time to get everything done, let alone give yourself any down time. However, in order to avoid burnout and stress, it's important to schedule some ""me time"" every week. Even if it's just an hour where you sit in a coffee shop and read a book for fun with no kids around, make yourself a promise that you will make time to keep yourself happy and healthy."

Review regularly, don’t cram.,
Talk to your professors.,
Visit your school’s tutoring center.",How to Balance School and Work as an Adult2," Keep your school materials organized and in one place so that it will be easy to find them. Mark upcoming deadlines on your calendar and start school projects early to allow sufficient time to complete them in case other things come up in the meantime. If you're taking several courses at once, don't spend all of your time on one course while other deadlines begin to loom on the horizon.

, Focus on the main ideas covered in each class rather than all the superfluous information. Focus on noting steps in larger processes, summary statements (therefore, consequently), information that your professor repeats frequently, and everything written out on the board or in handouts. This is the information your professor will draw from for your tests. Focus on it.If you have to miss class for some reason, ask a classmate if she'll take notes for you.

, Find a place where you can study comfortably and without interruption. Make sure that you have a comfortable chair, a table, adequate lighting, and all the study materials you need for that study session., Turn off your cell phone and television. Leave your email alone. Keep away from social media. The key to efficient studying is to focus all of your efforts on the task at hand.If you are easily distracted by social networking sites such as YouTube, Facebook, or others, download one of several applications designed to regulate your access to them and to increase your focus. When you are done with your work, you can unblock access to all the sites as before.Make sure that your family understands that your study time is important. They should know not to interrupt you while you're studying. Don't feel bad about telling people that you cannot help them while you're studying.

, Start studying the first day of class and review your materials on a regular basis. Don’t put it off to the last minute and then try to cram a month or more’s worth of work into a single study session. Your brain won’t be able to process and retain all that information in one fell swoop. Your brain is a muscle and like other muscles, constant repetition builds strength. You can’t just go to the gym, lift one really heavy weight, and expect to be better for it. You need to go to the gym (to study) frequently and in short bursts, gradually building up to more difficult levels., If you don’t understand a topic, visit the source. Professors hold regular office hours and/or answer emails relating to specific content questions. Create an open dialogue with your professor. It will help you jump hurdles in the class more quickly., Many schools have free or cheap tutoring services staffed by fellow students or graduates. Rather than spend hours mulling over the same material at home, only to still not understand it, visit someone who does like a tutor."

Harness the power of teamwork.,
Consider talking to your boss.",How to Balance School and Work as an Adult3," Compile a list of both easy and difficult tasks. Note emails that you need to return, forms to be submitted, meetings to attend, and any other things you need to complete by the end of the day., Place the most important tasks at the beginning of your list and the least important at the end. If you find any tasks that seem inconsequential or unnecessary, get rid of them. Don't waste your time with ""fluff"" work. It will only hurt your productivity. , Getting organized is the first step to a really productive day. The main steps are decluttering, strategically organizing forms and information, and maintaining that organization.


First, get rid of anything you don't need while you're at work. Knick knacks and family photos are ok, but anything else should be put in another room. You need to create a clean space free of distractions.
Second, determine what forms or information (e.g., business cards, standard forms, email lists, payroll logs, or data reports) you need to have readily available. Purchase folders and place each kind of information in the same place. This way you'll know where to find it in the future.
Third, at the end of every day, do some basic maintenance to your organization system. Make sure all forms are put away properly. This way when you arrive in the morning, you won't be confronted with a mess., Delegate tasks. Break up complex assignments into manageable parts and then assign those parts to individual members of your team. Don't waste days to complete a task that a small group can accomplish in a couple of hours.Remember that it's okay to say ""no"" to additional responsibilities. If someone asks you to help on a project that you just don't have time for this week, explain that you'd usually be happy to help but you have a deadline for school that you can't miss.

, If you choose to, emphasize how your proposed plans will help you gain valuable skills or qualify you for a promotion. Sell her on your education plans. If your boss gets onboard, it will be easier to navigate between school and work. She might even be able to help you adjust your work hours when necessary to accommodate school work.You'll need to weigh the pros and cons of talking to your boss. Some bosses won't find your education advantageous to them or their operation.

Keep work and school separate.,
Take those much-needed breaks.,
Be active.,
Get enough sleep.,
Eat healthy.",How to Balance School and Work as an Adult4," Don't worry about work while you're at school, and vice versa. Focus on one thing at a time. Don’t bring your books or notes to work and don’t bring work stuff to school. The time you are at each place is dedicated to that endeavor. If you work hard at work, you shouldn’t feel guilty for focusing on school when you are at school.

, Give yourself time to collect yourself when you need it the most, so you can return to work/school with a clear head. Go for a walk. Read a newspaper. Make some tea. Try to take breaks every couple of hours, but limit them to 5 to 10 minutes. You don't want to turn them into time wasters.


Avoid indulging in guilty pleasures too often during your breaks. Everybody has them, whether it's MTV, getting lost in idle chit-chat with your neighbor, or scanning Facebook for hours on end. If there's an activity that you tend to get caught up with, but that negatively affects your work-school-life balance, avoid it like the plague. And certainly don't turn to them during your brief breaks., Stretch. Swim. Run. Lift. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle helps relieve stress and you'll find that the more you get out and exercise, the easier work and school will seem. Exercising is commonly known to reduce stress. Scientists have shown that regular participation in aerobic exercise leads to decreased stress, elevated and stabilized moods, improved sleeping habits, and increased self-esteem., Make time in your schedule to sleep. Studies have shown that sleep increases your memory capabilities, improves your overall mood, and helps you stay attentive. All three of these will positively affect your stress levels. Staying up all night studying may be necessary on occasion, but don’t make it a regular thing. If you become sleep-deprived, take a short nap (15 to 30 minutes) just to give your brain a little boost.

, Eat high-fiber, carbohydrate rich foods. Scientists believe that carbohydrates cause the brain to produce elevated levels of serotonin, a hormone with relaxes us. Eat lots of fiber to regulate your system. Eat fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidants to boost your immune system. Citrus fruits provide plenty of vitamin C. Acorn squash and carrots are great sources of the antioxidant beta-carotene. A balanced diet will lead to a healthier school-work-life balance.Avoid fatty foods, excessive caffeine usage, and sugary treats. Meats or cheeses contain light levels of fat, which thickens your blood and leaves you feeling lethargic. Caffeine probably seems like a necessity, but consume it responsibly and don’t let it affect your sleep schedule. Lastly, sugar is simple carbohydrate that will give you a momentary high, only to leave you with a “crash”. Choose complex carbohydrates instead like pasta, beans, and lentils."

Be realistic.,
Remember why you're doing it.,
Allow others to help you.,
Keep your momentum.,
Try keeping a diary of your work daily.,
Celebrate little and big successes.,
Know that it can be done!",How to Balance School and Work as an Adult5," There may not be enough time for everything, so get your priorities straight and don't beat yourself up if you don't accomplish every single task you've set out to do on a given day. Stay positive and be thankful that you have the opportunity to make a living and get an education — two things many people in the world go without.


Going to school and working at the same time is not for everyone. Be realistic and prioritize. Don't let going to school jeopardize your income and your family's well-being., By taking on work and studies at the same time, you're accepting a challenge that many wouldn't dare attempt. But, you wouldn't be doing it if you weren't motivated. Maybe you want to pay your way through school and remain debt-free or you want to get ahead in your career. No matter what, be sure to keep your goals in mind whenever it starts to feel like too much., If you try to accomplish all of this by yourself, it will be infinitely more difficult. If you find yourself increasingly irritable, withdrawing from social interaction, distracted or forgetful, anxious, or emotionally strained, talk to someone. Talk to your significant other, your parents, your friends, or even a professional counsellor. Many colleges have full-time counselors, advisors, and therapists that can help you work through your issues. One of the first steps to success is knowing how to depend on others., Don’t start and stop. Taking a semester off may seem like a fine idea, but only do so for extraordinary circumstances, such as illness, serious injury, or a death in the family. If you find you are tiring of school, reduce your course load for the next semester and take at least one class that you’ll enjoy. Otherwise, you risk losing the momentum and never returning.

, What you aspire to do each day and what you actually managed to do. This will help in attaining your goal on a daily basis.

, Create some sort of progress measurement. Cross completed classes off of a list or use a countdown clock to measure time to completion. This will help keep your eyes on the prize. When you make it over small and large obstacles, commemorate your achievements with friends and family.It doesn't matter if it is a good grade on a paper, passing a class, or graduating. It is necessary to celebrate to keep yourself motivated., It may seem overwhelming at times, but remember that other people have gone through the same thing you are and they have succeeded.

Most people learn through multiple methods but favor one or two. Use your preferences to your advantage.;
, Try many different things so that you don't box yourself into believing you're only good at a few things. It's probable that you're good at many things, but you won't know until you've tried.

Be wary of past memories that tell you to stay away from certain things. This can soon inhibit you from trying a lot of new things if taken to an extreme. As you grow you develop more experience, coordination, responsiveness, and confidence that one experience can't teach, but you can apply to re-learning an old experience. For example, if you had a bad experience riding a horse when younger, not getting back on a horse when you're older and calmer might mean you miss out on a trek of a lifetime. Or, you might have hated certain sports, tastes or activities when younger because of your lack of experience, strength or maturity. All these things change as you mature, develop, and adjust to new environments. Be careful not to let past experiences like these cut off opportunities for you now.

, Don't just force yourself to learn things because they're important or necessary. Instead, learn things that you need to learn alongside things you love to learn. Follow your heart, as well as your sense of duty. Do you remember the 8th grade history that you hated so much, with all those names and dates that seemed to mean nothing? The point was to bring you to learn details now that will knit chunks of information together later. It was a chore then, but it makes sense, now.

Even when you're learning the things you have to, such as on-the-job knowledge, seek to go beyond what you're being asked to learn. Look at the history, case studies, different applications, etc., to make your learning experience much more well-rounded.

, It can be a grind at times, but you'll be able to remember, connect and figure out all kinds of complicated things through relatively few, simple building blocks if you learn some math and natural-science concepts.You can look up precise formulas and trivia again later, but the concepts will do the most good and save a lot of time in repeated look-ups if mostly learned by heart.Try some free OpenCourseWare, TED Talks or iTunes University for comprehensive presentations from famous professors and experts in their fields.


Mix learning the basics with more fun learning, like intellectual hobbies and games. Don't space them out so far that you forget what came before in a sequence; a half-class or class every day or two might be a good pace. Check into DIY U for a list of colleges and institutions that offer low cost or free courses.
If you find complex math very unintuitive in isolation, you can look it up as you learn things that use it. Without seeing the applications, it's hard to distinguish the concepts you need from the computational tricks most people don't.
Read books by people who experienced difficulties with the basics of math, science or other subjects but have still managed to find workarounds without giving up. Their ways of learning might help you to improve your own.

, Make friends with your local library and new and used book sellers. Reading is a portal into other worlds and into the minds of your fellow human beings. Through reading you will never stop learning and being amazed by the incredible creativity, intelligence and yes, even banality, of the human species. Wise people read lots of books, all the time; it's as simple as that. And reading will help you to learn the discoveries and mistakes of others who have gone before you; reading is, in effect, a shortcut so that you don't have to learn things the hard way.

Read all sorts of books. Just because you're usually a mystery fan doesn't mean you shouldn't try nonfiction now and then. Don't limit yourself.
Recognize the educational value in whatever you read. Nonfiction, of course, teaches about its subject. Fiction, freed from that constraint, can teach more about good writing, storytelling, vocabulary, and human nature generally. Indeed, fiction will tell you a great deal about the mores, morals, thinking and habits of the time during which it was written, and it is also said that fiction readers are more empathetic than those who avoid it because it teaches us about interacting in the social world.Newspapers, magazines, manuals, and comic books are all worth reading. As are websites, blogs, reviews and other online sources of information.

, Take a look at the Theory of Multiple Intelligences if you don't know it yet. Consider how you might fit in, and where you can improve.

Refine your existing skills. Are you already good at fly fishing? Computers? Teaching? Playing saxophone? Hone these skills and take them to the next level.
Try new things, both inside and outside your preferred skill areas.

, As an adult, your experience may be your best teacher. Whether you work for pay or volunteer your time, focus on a project or tinker with whatever grabs your attention, try lots of things and notice the results. Apply the results to other things in your life, to expand the value of what you've learned. You never know when an opportune discovery might arise as a result of your observations and innovative approaches.

, Not all learning comes from outside you. In fact, some of the most powerful learning happens when you are creating or formulating something for yourself. Creation, like intelligence, can be artistic or scientific; physical or intellectual; social or solitary. Try different media and methods and refine the ones you like the most., Look more closely at your world, and examine both the usual and the unusual. Also, look at the world from different levels. Chances are you already respond differently to the news of a friend than to the news of a country, for example.

Respond to what you observe, and notice and examine your own response.
Be mindful; if you find that it's difficult to observe things for long enough, consider meditating. This will help you to learn to see things you haven't noticed since you were a young child.

, No matter how dedicated an autodidact you are, some subjects are best learned with the aid of a teacher. Remember that a teacher may be found in a classroom, but also in an office, a neighbor's garage, a store, a restaurant, or a taxicab. The teacher may also be a mentor or a guide of some sort in your life, such as a life coach or counselor.

Several of the world's best universities provide videos and materials for their courses free over the Internet as the ""Open CourseWare"" project. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an exceptional contributor, with hundreds of courses.You can also use iTunes University, which can be viewed via your computer or your portable electronic devices.

, Asking the right questions can be more important than having the answers. It can also turn just about anybody into a teacher. Be sure to listen closely and understand the response.


Sometimes a response is difficult to understand. Feel free to take notes, ask more questions and to break down the response into smaller components to try to make sense of it. Return to your preferred learning style––if something is easier drawn in pictures, then draw it out to help make better sense of it.
Keep a journal or notebook to record what you learn and what questions you still have. Questions can teach as much as, or more than, answers. A journal or notebook can also record your progress.

, Does it make sense? Is it true? Who said so? How was it determined? Can it be verified? Is an argument or piece of advice logical, valuable, applicable?


Read How to develop critical thinking skills and How to improve critical thinking skills for more ideas on ways to evaluate what you're learning.

, This is the best way to test it and it will help you learn it more completely and retain it longer. It will also help you to discover flaws and strengths in your learning, which is how we progress the sum of human knowledge. Who knows what you may be about to discover, uncover or link together?

, Plenty of learning comes from the process of experimenting, tinkering, and just being silly. Take time to mess around and try new things without pressure.

, Teaching is a wonderful way to learn a subject better and improve your own understanding of it. If you're not a teacher or tutor, you can write about your knowledge in a wiki, where you and other contributors will know you can return to see something even better, or forum, or simply volunteer an answer when somebody asks.

Joseph Joubert once said that ""To teach is to learn twice."" In teaching others how to learn things, you will find that you learn even more than the students. Not only will you need to have a good grasp of your materials, you will need to respond to the querying minds of your students and extend your understanding beyond what you have considered it to be up to the point of each question asked of you.

Never give up.",How to Be a Good College Student," It’s totally normal to feel overwhelmed, especially if you’re a freshman at a huge college or university. Don’t let that feeling keep you from making new friends. College is a place where you can meet a variety of diverse, unique people. Embrace the newness. Remember: you probably aren’t the only person who’s a little nervous about making new friends.Attend mixers and socials, especially the ones specifically for freshmen. These are great places to meet people who haven’t yet found their “set.” You’ll feel at ease and meet a bunch of people in the same boat as you are.
Introduce yourself to people in your dorm. Keep your door cracked when you’re in your room to encourage people to drop by and say “hi.”
Even if you know just one person, ask him or her to introduce you to friends s/he thinks you might get along with. You’ll build your networks really quickly.
Join a club or society. Pledging a fraternity or sorority is a common way to build a friend network fast, but it isn’t the only way. College is full of opportunities to get involved in something you enjoy. Religious organization, clubs, interest societies, sports teams, and academic groups all offer opportunities to get to know like-minded people.;
, Volunteering is sometimes required as part of your curriculum in college, but even if it isn’t, you’ll meet plenty of new people this way. As an added bonus, volunteering looks great on a resume and can teach you valuable skills you can use for your job hunt after you graduate.


Many colleges have volunteer coordinators or offices of “service learning” who can connect you with volunteer opportunities that match your interests and skill sets.
Volunteering can also open your eyes to new possibilities for careers and passions. For example, you might discover by volunteering at your local animal shelter that you have a passion for caring for animals and want to become a vet. You won’t know until you try., College is a great place to try out new things. Explore the many opportunities you have right at your fingertips! Have you always wanted to act? Audition for a play or join an improv group. Do you secretly want to learn flamenco dancing? Take a class. Maybe you’ve always thought it would be cool to be a writer. Join a literary magazine or school newspaper.Remember that you won’t be an expert in everything you try out, and that’s okay! College is a wonderful place to embrace vulnerability and try new stuff, even if you aren’t great at it.

, You may not have any idea what you want to do for a career, and as a freshman, that’s okay. However, the sooner you can decide on a path, the sooner you’ll be able to gear your college experience toward it. This doesn’t mean everything in college has to be about your future plans, but you should keep them in the back of your mind when making choices.Choose classes, even electives, that will give you knowledge and experience you can use in your career path.
Don’t be afraid to be open to new experiences. Sure, a poetry class may not seem like it will help you with your advertising major, but studying poetry encourages creativity and expression -- things that you’ll need to succeed in advertising.
Save projects or papers that you’re really proud of. You can use these as proof of skills that you’re marketing, like clear communication skills or the ability to tackle complex problems.

, It’s so much harder to do well at something that you don’t care about. Choosing a major shouldn’t be all about the money or your parents’ expectations. You’re an adult now, and part of that means making important decisions for yourself.Talk with an academic advisor or counselor. Visit the career center. Get enough information for you to know what your major entails and what kinds of opportunities you can expect once you graduate.
It’s unfortunately common for people to deride humanities or arts majors (English, philosophy, theatre, etc.) by saying “You’ll never get a job with that.” They’re wrong. Part of college is learning to become a fully developed, well-rounded human. Humanities and arts majors encourage important skills like critical thinking, creative problem-solving, analysis, innovation, and reflection. You’d be surprised at the jobs you can land with skills like these. (Check out Inside Jobs’ list of “100 Careers for English Majors” if you’re still in doubt.) Choose what you love, whether it’s Accounting or Zoology., Some students go through college expecting that they’re entitled to good grades or certain treatment. They’ll get upset if they do badly on an exam and blame the professor for their failure instead of examining what they need to do. Don’t be one of these students. You are not entitled to an “A” in a class or your first pick of classes or a schedule that only goes from noon to 3 PM Tuesdays and Thursdays.Take responsibility for your own actions. Own up to your mistakes. Work on improving and doing better next time. Don’t blame others -- classmates, friends, your roommate, or your teacher -- for your own actions.
Remember that your instructors don’t owe you special treatment. Even if you’re a great student in general, your professors are not obligated to “cut you some slack” for missing class or doing poorly on an assignment. Don’t beg them to change your grade or make special exceptions to their policies for you.
Don’t take refusal personally. An instructor or anyone else who refuses your request isn’t doing it because s/he has a vendetta against you. You will sometimes ask for things you can’t get. This is part of being an adult (admittedly, a not-so-fun part). Don’t take it personally, and don’t push once you’ve been told “no.”

, Part of becoming a successful college student is accepting that things won’t always work out the way you want them to. You won’t be good at everything you try. You’ll make some mistakes, even some big ones. You will have experiences that totally bomb. Don’t see these as evidence that you’re “a failure.” View them as opportunities for growth.Ditch any perfectionistic tendencies you have. While you may believe they’re a sign of ambition or a strong work ethic, perfectionism can actually hold you back from success and happiness.Perfectionism can stem from the fear of appearing weak or vulnerable. It holds you to unrealistic standards and asks you to interpret anything other than perfection as “failure.” It can even lead to procrastination because you’re so terrified of not doing a perfect job. Nobody is perfect. Not Lady Gaga, George Takei, or Neil DeGrasse Tyson. And you aren’t either, and that’s okay.
Reframe challenges and setbacks as learning experiences. If you try out for a sports team and don’t get picked, don’t assume it’s because you’re a failure. Ask the coach if s/he can offer some feedback for you so you know where to develop your skills. You can learn from any experience, no matter how unpleasant., For some students, maxing out on credit hours each semester is a point of pride. It’s also a terrible idea. Have you heard of the saying, “Jack of all trades, master of none”? If you spread yourself thin between a bunch of classes, you will not have the energy or time to excel in any of them.Take 4-5 classes each semester. If you really want to take more, consult with your advisor. S/he will often know what the workloads for courses are like and whether you can really handle another course.

, Not only will getting to know your instructors help you in your course, it will also help if you need to ask them for recommendations later. An instructor can write a much better rec letter if s/he has gotten to know you a little bit.Look for at least one instructor or faculty member who can serve as a mentor. (In some colleges, you may be assigned a mentor or advisor.)
You’ll find it easy to ask questions and talk to your instructors if you’ve introduced yourself.

, This is especially important if you’re in the sciences. It’s never too early to get started, especially if you plan on attending graduate or medical school. Talk to your instructors about any opportunities for undergraduates who want to get involved in research.You may even find a paid position as a lab or research assistant.

, It’s crucial to have a place that’s dedicated to studying. Trying to do all your work in public spaces or your bed just won’t give you the focus you need to be really productive. Having a dedicated study space also means you’re more likely to study when you’re there, so you can have fun and let loose elsewhere.If you have nowhere to study but a shared space, at least block out distractions. Wear noise-canceling headphones or listen to “white noise” or relaxing, lyric-free music.You may find it helpful to have several places to study. If you find yourself getting distracted or bored in one, move to the next. Good choices include quiet coffee shops and the library.

, This cannot be stressed enough. If you’re in college full time, you’ll have 4-5 classes, each with its own assignments and due dates. You may also have other responsibilities, like work, volunteering, social obligations, and athletics. Staying on top of everything takes a little work upfront, but it pays off.Get a planner! Whether it’s a little notebook or the calendar on your phone, commit to putting everything in your planner as soon as you learn about it. With electronic calendars (like Google Calendars) you can even set reminders about important events. You can color coordinate by category (athletics, homework, social event, etc.) if it helps. Keeping everything written down will also help you know if you have potential conflicts that you need to address (for example, your baseball team is playing an out-of-town game on the day of a test).
Organize your material by class. Have a place on your bookshelf or desk where you put the most important to-do stuff. Know where your books, papers, etc. are. Keep a nice, neat binder or folder for each class. Put assignments into their appropriate folder/binder so you don’t lose them.
If you’re taking a class with online components, make sure to check in with the online platform regularly. Instructors often post notices or announcements online that you’ll miss if you don’t check.

, The syllabus is the holy grail of information for every class. It will tell you what assignments you’ll have, when they’re due, and what they’re worth for your grade. Read every syllabus carefully the first week of class, and transfer important dates into your planner or calendar.If you aren’t sure about something in the syllabus, ask immediately. It’s way better to clear up confusion before you spend a bunch of time doing something wrong.

, This one seems like a no-brainer, but it can be tempting -- especially in big lecture classes where attendance isn’t always taken -- to skip out on classes. Don’t do it. You will miss valuable information and announcements if you skip.Plus, you’re going to college to get an education: what’s the point if you aren’t bothering to learn anything?If you’re in a smaller class, your instructor will notice your absences, even if s/he doesn’t count them against you. If it seems like you aren’t engaged with the course, your instructor may not want to help you.
If you need some motivation, consider calculating how much an hour of class-time costs. Let’s say you’re at Harvard, where tuition and fees are $45,278 a year. If you’re taking 5 classes each semester (a full-time load), that’s $4,527.80 per class. For a standard 16-week semester, that’s $282.98 per week, $94.32 per class hour for a 3x weekly class. Is that afternoon nap really worth nearly a hundred bucks? Didn’t think so.

, Homework can seem like an epic waste of time, especially if it isn’t worth much to your overall grade scheme. However, teachers don’t assign homework just for laughs. Those homework assignments usually teach you important concepts or skills that you need for bigger assignments, like exams or essays. Do them., Your ability to take helpful notes will directly impact your ability to study for exams and succeed in courses. Taking notes requires you to be an active participant in class, listening to what’s said and deciding what’s important and what isn’t.You may be tempted to take notes on your shiny new laptop, but studies show that you’re more likely to remember stuff if you use good ol’ pen and paper.Write down anything your instructor writes on the board; it’s likely to show up later. Pay attention to anything your instructor emphasizes or spends a lot of time on.
See if slides are available online. If they are, print them out beforehand and supplement them with your own notes, rather than trying to copy out all the slide information.
Don’t bother with complete sentences. Use keywords and phrases to get the big idea. Just make sure you don’t use so many abbreviations or shortcuts that you can’t interpret your notes later.Most colleges and universities have some sort of academic support or counseling center. These centers often offer handouts and classes on developing better note-taking and study skills. Use these resources!

, You may have been able to skate through high school without studying too much, but college is a different world. If you don’t develop wise study habits, you could find yourself overwhelmed by your workload and failing your classes.


Use your spare time wisely! If you have an hour or two in between classes, head to the library and study for a bit.Breaking up your studying will make it easier than trying to cram all at once, and you’re more likely to remember the material.
Figure out your study style. You may be a visual learner, in which case making flowcharts or graphs, or even drawing pictures, could be helpful when you study. Or you might respond better to listening, in which case listening to lectures or talking to yourself about topics could be more useful for you. Learn what works for you and use those techniques.
You can find learning style inventories for free online. Your college’s academic resources center may also have some that you can take.Plan to study 2 hours per week for every hour you spend in class. If you’re in class 12 hours a week (standard if you’re taking 4 classes), you’ll need to spend around 24 hours a week studying. Yep, it’s work.Remember that you’re actually there to learn information and skills. Your ability to get a job may depend on you knowing what the classes on your transcript say you know. The only way to develop those skills is to study.

, Instructors aren’t required to offer extra credit, but if yours does, take advantage of it! Extra credit can be a great way to boost your grades if you aren’t really confident in your performance.


Get started early. Don’t wait until the last possible chance to try for extra credit. You don’t know what could come up to make you miss out.
If you’re really worried about your performance, talk with your instructor about the possibility of doing extra credit to bring your grade up. S/he may not agree (and s/he doesn’t have to), but it doesn’t hurt to ask politely.

, College students have a wealth of resources available to help ensure their success. Check to see what support services and resources you can make use of. Don’t feel “weak” or embarrassed if you need to ask for help! It takes strength and courage to admit you’re having trouble.Most schools have a tutoring and/or writing center. If you’re having trouble with a subject or need help with any type of writing, use these resources! They’re usually free, and the tutors specialize in helping people who are having trouble, so they won’t judge or look down on you.
Schools usually also have a career services center. These centers can help you buff up a resume, practice your interview skills, find employment or volunteering opportunities, and plan for your future career.
Don’t forget the library! Librarians do more than just shelve books all day. They’re trained at identifying helpful, credible research sources and using them for your projects. Contact your library to schedule a consultation with a librarian. You will be amazed at the resources s/he can provide.
Check out your school’s academic support center. (It may have a different name at your school.) This center usually offers classes, mentoring, advising, tutoring, etc. that can help you with things like study skills, note-taking, time-management, balancing your workload, and many other aspects of student life.

, Some predatory lenders will loan you more than you need. While it may seem like “free money” now, remember that you have to pay back every penny that you borrow in college. Don’t saddle yourself with huge debt that you’ll be paying off until you retire.You don’t have to accept the entire amount of a loan that’s offered, either. You can adjust the number to cover your legitimate expenses without borrowing more than is necessary.
If you have to take out private loans, shop around for the best interest rates. You may find that you get a more competitive interest rate if you can have your parents or a responsible adult co-sign the loan, but be careful; a co-signer is responsible for the debt if you end up unable to pay it.

, Not only will having a job help you cover expenses without racking up student loan debt, it will also help boost your resume for after you graduate. Ask your school’s financial aid office whether you qualify for work study, which helps pay your tuition in exchange for your work.


If you can, try to find a job that has some transferable skills. For example, working as a receptionist at your school isn’t super exciting, but you can use some of those skills, such as organization and software familiarity, in “grown-up” jobs.

, With all the pressures of college, it can be really easy to let your emotional, physical, or mental health slip. Don’t let your overall well-being suffer through neglect. Keeping a healthy exercise regimen, eating well, sleeping enough, and seeking counseling when you need it will help you stay on top of your game.Making time to exercise will help keep you feeling healthy and positive. It will also help ward off the dreaded “Freshman 15.” Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day. Remember small changes add up: choose the stairs instead of the elevator and walk around campus instead of grabbing the bus or driving.Eat healthy. With unlimited dining plans and 24/7 cafeterias, it can be tempting to eat nothing but chicken fingers and milkshakes when you’re in college. Choose a balanced diet to get the nutrition you need to perform at your best. Limit sugar and highly processed foods, and make sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Watch your snacking habits, too - those calories are often empty and they add up quick.Develop healthy sleep habits. Avoid all-nighters by planning in advance. Try to go to sleep and get up at the same times each day (yup, even on weekends!). Avoid alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine within 4 hours of bedtime. And get enough sleep: teenagers need up to 10 hours a night.Get counseling when you need it. Your freshman year can be a stressful, even scary experience. Don’t be afraid to check out your college counseling center. A counselor can teach you time-management and stress-coping skills, help you with relationship drama, and listen to you when you need to vent. Don’t wait until you feel overwhelmed! Just like your teeth, good mental health requires preventive care to keep you in tip-top shape., If your school has an active Greek community, you may really want to be a part of it. However, the mountain of obligations and time commitments can sink a first-semester freshman faster than that iceberg did for the Titanic. National research studies have shown that your GPA can drop 5-8 percentage points just by pledging a sorority or fraternity.Wait until your second semester or even sophomore year, when you have a better handle on your work/life balance.If you do choose to pledge a sorority or fraternity your first semester, consider an academic one. These are typically more focused on studying and may even be specific to an academic subject, which can be helpful networking for your future career.

, As a college student, you’ll have lots of competing obligations, all of which can seem super important. Learning to prioritize your commitments and responsibilities will help you achieve a good work/life balance.Consider what you need and what will offer the most helpful benefit to you.Sometimes, you’ll have to prioritize studying for a big exam over going out with your friends, because you need that extra time studying. However, sometimes, you may need a mental health break and spending an hour or two with a video game or at a coffee shop with your pals is just what you need to refresh yourself. Learn to tell what you really need.


, It’s great advice for college. Don’t let setbacks or mistakes hold you down. Get back up and keep pursuing your goals. The only surefire way to fail is to stop trying.


This applies to individual classes as well as life in general. If you aren’t doing too well in a class, your temptation might be to just stop trying. Don’t! Sure, you may not be able to pull your grade up to an A if you’ve got a C at the midterm, but if you stop trying you’ll only continue to do poorly. Put in a little work and effort, though, and you at least know you won’t flunk.

""Am I unsure of how to proceed?""
""Am I worried about how things will turn out?""
"" Will bad things happen if I don't solve this problem?"";
, Once you've convinced yourself you need help, you need to pinpoint the exact problem. This will both make it easier to ask another person for help and easier for you to communicate to this person what the problem is. Sometimes this process is remarkably simple - if you can't remember your lines for the school play, it's easy to articulate this to the director. However, complex emotional issues can be tricky to pin down. If, for instance, you're unhappy but you're not sure why, you may feel hopeless. Narrow your problems down as best as you can. Ask yourself questions like the following:


""At what point in the process do I first experience difficulty?""
""When do I seem to get most frustrated?""
""Is there some part of this process that I fear?""

, Though you may be surprised by the willingness of strangers and casual acquaintances to help you, you should probably pick someone who's well-qualified to give the help you're looking for. Sometimes, this may be a friend, other times, a professional. Sometimes it can even be both. For instance, if you've decided that you need help getting in shape, asking one of your friends to be your workout buddy and seeking out a trainer at your local gym are both valid, sensible options.


Don't ask a jerk for help unless s/he is your only option. You don't want to bother with someone who will make you feel stupid for asking.
If you need help with an emotional issue, it can be handy to talk to a very close friend, significant other, or family member, even if they don't have any special qualifications.
If the problem you need help with is serious or you feel like you can't ask someone close to you for help, confide in a counselor or psychologist. These professionals exist to help normal, sane people like you - you're not crazy just for talking to someone about your problems.

, Asking for help is not a reason to feel weak, inadequate, or stupid. Remember, seeking help when you need it is a sign of strength, not of weakness. It's easy to deny you have a problem. It's hard to put aside your pride in an effort to fix it. As you seek help, you might feel bashful or embarrassed. Don't be, even if you're not seeking help for the first time. Think of it this way: asking for help isn't as embarrassing as failing at whatever's giving you difficulty.


If the problem you're seeking help for is some aspect of a team project (whether at work, school, or elsewhere), you're letting your team down by not seeking help. Remember that you're not the only one affected if you refuse to seek help. You're being an admirable team member by seeking help.

, Pride is the cardinal sin when seeking help. When you ask for help, you have to admit (explicitly or implicitly) that you can't do something on your own. It's an acknowledgement that you have your own personal faults and struggles. Remember that it's not a big deal! No one's perfect - everyone needs help at some point or another. Going through life without ever admitting you're wrong is no way to live - people who are too proud to ask for help have to rationalize their stubbornness through increasingly complicated internal justifications. Don't be like them - suck it up and ask..

, This is it! The most likely outcome is that you'll be surprised at how willing this person is to help you. If you don't know this person well, introduce yourself briefly and make it clear that you need help. If it's urgent, introductions can wait until later. Explain politely, quickly, and clearly that you need help. Then, if they're willing to give it, explain what you need help with.


If this person is a friend, family member, or significant other, you have nothing to worry about! Asking for help is a normal, everyday interaction between people who care for each other. Your willingness to ask for help (and give it back, when it's asked of you) is a sign of your closeness and intimacy. Asking for help can even be an affectionate gesture.

, If your problem is a physical, practical one (for instance, if you can't figure out how to repair your refrigerator), rather than an emotional one, it's often more useful to watch your helper fix the problem than to try to remember their verbal advice. If you can, take your helper to the problem situation and allow them to show, rather than tell you how to fix it.


Even if your problem isn't a physical or practical one, a change of scenery can be necessary. Personal emotional problems, for instance, aren't best discussed in cramped train cars or in your cubicle where someone can overhear. To avoid extreme awkwardness, discuss any serious problems you need help with in a private place.

, Whether your problem is a practical one or a personal one, pay attention to your helper as they guide you through how to solve it. Don't be afraid to take notes as they explain or demonstrate how to fix your problem - if, for example, they're helping you jump start your car, you should make note of the order you should attach the alligator cables to each car's terminals. Remember, the better you're able to remember how to solve your problem, the less likely you are to need to ask for help again.


If you don't understand part of your helper's instructions, don't be shy about asking them to elaborate or re-explain. It's better that you take the extra time to fully understand their instructions rather than rushing ahead and encountering more problems, which will, in turn, cost you more time.

, The person who helped you deserves your thanks. Everyone's time is precious - the fact that they gave you some of theirs shows that they're compassionate and care about you. At the very least, give your helper a hearty ""thank you."" If they helped you with something major, consider buying them drinks, dinner, or even a gift. It's usually not necessary to be too extravagant - it's much more important to show that you're sincerely grateful. They'll appreciate it immensely and they'll be more likely to help you out in the future.


One of the best ways to show you appreciate someone's advice is to help them in return. If they need help with something, offer your help immediately. If not, just be open to helping them in the future.

, Now that your helper has taught you how to work through your problem, take steps to ensure you remember what they taught you. Make a mnemonic to remember their advice if it can be divided into a few steps.


One great trick is to try writing you helper's advice out in your own words. By reinterpreting their instructions in a way that's logical and sensible to you, you'll make it easier for you to understand while simultaneously reinforcing the information.

, It's time to put your new knowledge to the test. As soon as you get the chance, try to work through your problem yourself. If possible, try doing it with your helper present to correct any mistakes you make, but if not, don't fret - doing it by yourself is better than not doing it at all. Make note of any aspects of the process that still give you trouble - you can ask for clarification on these steps later.

, If asking for help the first time isn't a sign of weakness, it definitely is the second time, right? Wrong. If you're learning an entirely new process, there's a good chance you'll forget something along the way when you try to reproduce your helper's advice. If you listened carefully and did your best to replicate you helper's instructions, this might not even be your fault - your helper might just be a bad teacher. S/he might have offered you incomplete or confusing advice. S/he might have incorrectly assumed you possessed certain knowledge necessary to solve your problem. Whatever the case, there's no shame in asking for clarification on tricky particulars.


Sometimes, second opinions are necessary. If you can't seem to find success by following your first helper's advice, ask someone else who has a different perspective on your problem. You might be surprised at the varied, even contradictory advice you receive from different helpers!

Check homeschool regulations.,
Create a difficult curriculum.,
Give your teenager independence.,
Lead her to a wider range of subjects.,
Hold your teenager to deadlines.,
Look into colleges.,
Set aside time for a social life.,
Stay friends.",How to Homeschool Your Teenager," Look up your state's or country's homeschooling laws. Even if you've been homeschooling your child her whole life, prepare to meet the requirements for high school (secondary school) graduation and college applications. If you have any questions about this, contact your State Board of Education (or a similar government education office if you're outside of the United States).;
, Your child's studies rapidly become more difficult as he becomes a teenager. Most parents do not remember the material well enough to teach it, and do not have the time to learn it all before their kid. The student will need to learn how to teach himself, but there are ways to encourage this:


Online courses or private tutors give the student access to expert help.
Cooperative classes with other homeschoolers let each parent teach to their strengths.
A good textbook can work for a motivated student, but it cannot fully replace a teacher.

, Some parents have a hard time watching their son or daughter struggle with an assignment or fail to meet a deadline. However tempting it is to do some of their work or manage their schedule for them, this is a big mistake. Teenagers need space to grow into independent adults. Let them study by themselves, and even grade their own tests. They need to understand that success is their own responsibility, and that acting foolishly will have consequences.


You do not need to limit teenagers' time by subject. Let them spend as much time as it takes to understand each assignment.

, Include time in the education to explore topics outside of the required classes. This can be anything from woodworking to marine biology. Including subjects that match your teen's interests will make her much more motivated to get through the last few years of school


Expose them to music, sports, art, and other extracurricular activities as well. But remember: it's her turn to decide what she'll become. She gets to decide which activities to pursue.
Extra points if you can satisfy class credit with activities. Join a theater camp for English credit, or learn cake decorating for art.

, Many homeschoolers have a problem meeting solid deadlines. Stay in communication about your teen's learning schedule, how much work he's doing, and whether it's going well. Encourage him to stay on top of his work, and even get ahead of schedule whenever possible.


If your teen is procrastinating, you may need to adopt a stricter schedule, requiring homework time before social activities. You can also help them stay on track with engaging assignments, and a reward system for completing work.

, If your teen might be headed to college, both of you should be thinking about it early. Look into the application requirements for various colleges well in advance, so you know you're covering all the required coursework.


If you're in the US or thinking about a US college, plan on taking the SAT or ACT tests in the equivalent of 11th grade. Start studying early with online resources, from Khan academy to the official ACT and College Board websites.

, Isolation has a terrible effect on mental health and happiness. Even introverted teens need some time with friends, and away from their parents. Don't let the heavier workload drive away a healthy social life.


Your teen's friends in regular school may suddenly have very busy schedules, and may not be as available as they were before. It can help to find one or two homeschooled peers with more flexible time commitments.

, Raising a teenager isn't easy, especially when you're his teacher as well. Show unconditional love, and don't let conflicts over schoolwork drive a rift between you.


You may discover that certain tasks or subjects lead to arguments, even if this wasn't a problem in the past. Pass on these duties to the other parent or someone outside the family.

Learn how your teacher works.,
Get extra help if you need it.,
Study for your tests the minute you find out about them.,
Studying can be easy.,
Projects are like tests.,
Exams review the year which seems like a lot but its really not.,
Catch up from your sick days.",How to Stay on Top of Classes in High School," Find out often and thoroughly your teacher checks homework, you should always get it done but it doesn't hurt to have a deadline. One of my teachers has no deadlines so homework just flew out the window and started to pile up. When marking time came I had do them all in a few nights assuming that he was still accepting them. Always do your homework, not half, not a quarter, all of it. when you have that test coming up you'll find that doing that work was half the battle.;
, When you don't understand a question or a whole concept ask a teacher, tutor, parent, sibling, classmate, anyone really as long as they can and will help you. If your school has a program such as peer-tutors, extra help, or programs for a specific subject take advantage of it. Don't worry about looking foolish who really cares that you need extra help?

, So many times have I left it to the last minute and did poorly. Tests may not always count for a lot of marks but they're a good indicator as to how well you understand all that you've learnt. If you don't do well on a test or one part of it review it until you do, when exams come round and you didn't brush up on that unit you set yourself up for failure. Always ask your teachers what is going to be on the test if they haven't given you a review sheet making studying simple.

, As previously mentioned ask your teachers about the content of the test so you know what to study. When your astronomy test comes and you studied when Galileo was born instead of difference between Geocentric and Heliocentric systems it'll be no help to you. Summarize the text into jot notes single-spaced on a lined sheet of paper. The single space will prevent the text from all blurring together and discouraging work. Redo those worksheets or questions for extra practice and feel free to reread that textbook or those notes.

, Start immediately, when your french teacher tells you you have a month and you think no sweat guess what? It's suddenly a week to due date and you haven't opened the package yet. I find that when this happens stress is at its best and relentless, it's hard to work on a project when your telling yourself that you cannot finish it. Start early and again ask your teacher what they're looking for (look through your old assignments to see what they liked.)

, When every unit or section is done gather all the work and note which pages from the textbook you used and put it in a folder so at the end of the year you know what to study. Again ask your teacher what to study or for a review package and don't overdue it. The only thing worse than a understudying is over studying. Don't become the mess crying in a corner the day before the exam cramming useless information into your brain at three Am. You can't take it in tired, sleep.

, Sure your buddy said ""yeah, we did nothing"" so you just watched each other grow? Ask the teacher but also ask friends the night of so if there's any work you can do-do it not point doing double the next day. If you missed a lesson get extra help but above all don't miss school unless necessary. Good luck!

Grading in homeschooling is done by the teacher-in-charge.,
When grading a child undergoing homeschooling, it is more important to assess whether the child has understood the subject that is being taught.,
This will work in your child's favor in 2 ways.,
When assessing your child's abilities, do not allow emotions to overcrowd your rationale.,
When the child is still young and unable to understand the importance of his lessons, it is your responsibility to see to it that the child develops the skill set necessary for future growth.

,
If you live in a state that requires yearly tests, this will help you to judge your child's ability compared to his or her peers.

,
Even if it is not mandatory, you may want to test your child every year.,
In case your state requires a homeschool report card, keep a record of the yearly development and scores of your child.,
You may also need to keep a record of the number of working days and attendance schedules.

,
While grading your child, make sure that you use as many external tests as possible.,
This is an excellent and cost-effective method to assess your child.",How to Grade in Homeschooling," In most of the cases, this means mom! In this situation, grading can get a bit tricky because it can be a little difficult to grade your own child. There is no benchmark against which you can evaluate your child's performance. In most cases, you also have no awareness of how well other children are doing. So, obviously the traditional method of grading is perhaps not the best method to follow.;
, Inherent in this is the fact that if the child has not understood something, you will go over it again.

, Firstly, the child knows that if he or she fails to catch on, the topic will be repeated till it is mastered. Secondly, the child also knows that once the topic has been mastered, he or she will get full credit for his hard work. Getting full reward for the hard work put in is a great motivational factor, especially for kids.

, Do not yield to the cries and tears of your child if he or she resists certain topics or subjects. If mastering these skills is necessary, then you as the teacher (and not as the parent alone) have to go over the topic over and over till it sinks in. When dealing with tougher concepts, the child may get restless and may even show frustration or belligerence.

,,, These tests will reveal the variations in the child's learning pattern. It may show up unexpected areas of strength and hitherto unknown areas of weakness. This enables you to structure your teaching to cover the areas that are weak, and build upon the areas that are strong.

, Include pertinent areas like punctuality, discipline etc in the report.

,, There are several websites that deal with the various age groups, and allow free downloading of question papers.

, Homeschooling, if done in the proper manner, will boost the child's confidence because he will be studying to satisfy his natural curiosity. The scores therefore will reflect his true intelligence.

Websites like Home School Legal Defense Association and A to Z Home’s Cool offer state by state legal guides.
Talk to local home school support groups about their experience registering.
If you are moving during your child's school year, follow the requirements of whatever state you are in at the time.
Some states' homeschool laws vary by school district.
Get started with research as soon as possible. You may be required to withdraw your child from school by a certain deadline and register by another.
States require varying levels of documentation. You may need to maintain an ""attendance record,"" and you may need to keep portfolios of your child's work.;
, You will need to establish a curriculum that teachers your child the material required by the state, that prepares your child for the next step (whether that be high school, home high school, or the GED), and that engages your child's curiosity and desire to learn. Check your state's requirements to see if you need to teach certain subjects, and if you need to train your child for standardized tests.Even if you don't follow it strictly, you may want to buy a standard middle school curriculum to use as a basis for your own.

, If there are subjects you do not feel qualified to teach, or if you are simply interested in providing specialized instruction for your child, hire tutors. Your tutors may need to fill certain requirements: in some states, they may need to be certified teachers., Get your child some classmates and playmates, and get yourself some colleagues. Not only do you need support as a teacher, but your child needs to be in touch with peers. Middle school age students are peer-oriented learners, and the presence of other children their age is essential to their cognitive development and personal happiness.


Find homeschool organizations at the HSLDA website, or at your state's education website.You may find groups of parents who keep in contact, debate competitions, extracurricular societies, and meet-up groups for students, and even pools of parents who share teaching responsibility.
Some states allow you to register your child with church-affiliated ""umbrella"" schools., Make sure your child has space dedicated to work. If you have a spare room, let that be the classroom. If you are short on space, make a corner of the living room your child's classroom. Have material that indicates workspace: bookcases and a large whiteboard to section off the space, a desk for your child, art, lab, and writing supplies, and perhaps a computer dedicated to schoolwork.


Make sure your child's work place is quiet, well-lit, and full of the resources your child will need.

, If you have decided to homeschool, you may already have a curriculum in mind. If not, you can find curricula for purchase at websites like Homeschool.com.Compare carefully, and make sure an curriculum you adopt reflects the curricular requirements for your state.


Get in touch with other homeschool families to find out what they have based their studies on.

, Limit the amount of new information you present in each lesson. A student in middle school can typically retain 5 to 7 pieces of information at one time.Break new information into sections organized around this model.


For instance, if your child is studying the Civil War, you might focus each lesson on one battle or one facet of the war, such as medical care or period weapons technology.
Reinforce each bit of information, and connect it to other parts of the day's lesson.

, Young adolescent brains will not retain information unless they can review it and connect it to new previous learning. After learning new information, give your student a chance to discuss it or write about it. In subsequent lessons, review the information and connect it to what you are currently studying.

, Early adolescent learners need to be involved in the lesson, and their assignments need to be hands-on. Approach each subject from many angles, and give your student a leading role in each activity. Each lesson should involve projects, art-making, pictures, music, video, or discussion.


As soon as information is given, it should be applied. If you teach your student a math concept, you then ask him or her to solve problems.
If your student is reading about slavery in the United States, teach art that depicts slaves and field hands, teach the music slaves would sing, and have your student write essays, debate ethics, and make art reflecting the information he or she is learning.

, Develop your students' deductive reasoning, problem solving, and generalizing skills. Early adolescent minds are just beginning to move from concrete thinking to abstract thinking. You will watch your child begin thinking about and regulating his or her own thought processes.This is a great age for writing that reasons through dilemmas, small research assignments to answer questions of your student's choosing, and scientific problem-solving.
Letting your child develop and maintain long-term projects, such as designing a website or writing and staging a play, will encourage your child to practice problem-solving.

, Students of middle school age tend to develop passionate interests that come and go. Harness your student's focus, and let him or her choose topics of study. Orient lessons around subjects of interest to your student. Encourage your student to develop and complete projects.For instance, if your student is obsessed with fairies and magic, study folklore and its historical context. Locate myths and legends geographically, and study their religious and political backgrounds, as well as the music and literature that proceed from them.
If your child is obsessed with Japanese culture, let him or her learn everything about Japan.
Integrate the topics and approaches that compel your child into other subjects. For instance, if your child only cares about science, math, and engineering, assign science fiction and nonfiction in his or her English classes.

, This is the age when your student will become ready to learn organization and self-regulation. Encourage your child to think systematically about the organization of time and work. Help your child establish and maintain consistent study routines. Patiently remind your child to stay on task, as children of this age struggle to remember and follow rules.At the beginning of long-term projects, make a chart with your child with steps to track progress. Revisit the steps at the beginning and end of each lesson or study session, and mark those that have been completed.
Give your child binders and a filing system, and teach him or her to color-code and organize school materials.

, Bookmark websites you can use for educational media, lesson plans, and worksheets. Make an account with PBS to access the material on their teaching website.Look for science and history teaching material from the Smithsonian.For humanities materials,s visit EDSITEment..


You can get good math material for 6th graders at Math Worksheets for Kids, and lessons, activities, and games for 6th and above at Illuminations., For math, Khan Academy has an extensive curriculum of math lessons, infinite practice material, and video tutorials,while Calculation Nation has entertaining math games.#*To vary your student's reading, have them visit Book Adventure, a virtual library. After your student reads a book, he or she can take a reading comprehension quiz to earn prizes.Get spelling and vocabulary games at Spelling City.You may subscribe to newspapers and magazines, but consider having your child read and compare coverage of different news events across different online newspapers.

, If you haven't already, get library cards for yourself and your child at the public library. Ask about interlibrary loan—some libraries will order books they don't have from other libraries. Take advantage of other public institutions, such as local museums or historical sites. Sign up for museum membership if you can afford it, and ask about classes and resources for students.


Get to know your neighborhood. If there is a community garden, see if your kid can garden there. If there are neighborhood sports teams, community theater, or after-school organizations that homeschoolers can use, sign your child up.
Ask other homeschooling parents what resources they rely on.
Middle school is a great time to start your child volunteering. See if your kid would be interested in helping out in an elementary school or nursery home, or tutoring younger homeschoolers.

, In teaching good study habits, put your child in charge of setting and achieving realistic learning goals. Your child should also be involved in tracking and evaluating his or her own progress. Share these responsibilities with your child. Review your child's structure and suggest amendments.


Leaving your child absolutely unsupervised might cause a depressed or anxious child to lie about progress.
The emotional volatility of a middle schooler often combines poorly with a highly disciplined environment. Your child is

, Middle school is the age in which your child becomes strongly peer-oriented. Home school can be a productively social time if you prioritize social interaction as part of your child's school time and playtime. Sign your kids up for classes outside of the home, participate in a home school cooperative, and let your child participate in your community and in communities outside of your own.


For instance, your child may always go to church with you, but he or she may also play Magic cards or intra-mural sports with kids at the public library.
Middle school students who make motivated, learning-oriented friends do better at their work.Your child should have at least one engagement with peers each day.

, School is often the place that a child is seen to exhibit signs of cognitive difference. Behaviors indicative of ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and even mental illness are sometimes inscrutable to parents and guardians. Cross-check your suspicions against other sources: visit a doctor, therapist, or learning disability specialist, talk to other parents about your child, and investigate your child's upbringing and any traits, such as dyslexia, that run in the family.


Notice if your child is slow to build vocabulary, has difficulty rhyming, or reads much slower than other children his or her age. These could be signs of dyslexia.Middle school age children tend to develop longer attention spans. If your child skips from subject to subject, can't remember where he or she left off on a project, does not finish a project that had been exciting, or cannot follow instructions or break tasks into smaller steps, she or he may have ADHD.If your child has experienced traumatic events, such as violence, sexual abuse, verbal abuse, neglect, accidents, or illness, she or he may be more prone to dissociation, depression, anxiety, and anger.
She or he may have cognitive issues, struggling with language development and abstract reasoning., Your child's emotions will become unwieldy around middle school age. She or he may go through stages of depression, anger, and irritability.This is a great age to teach emotional self-regulation, because it is the age when your child will begin to develop metacognition, awareness of his or her own thinking. Talk to your child about how he or she feels.


Connect each lesson with the memories, feelings, and personal associations your child has. If you are teaching history, ask your child to empathize with the situations of the historical figures, connect the events with events in the contemporary world, and imagine how they might handle a situation. If reading a novel, have your student write about personal crises similar to those in the novel, and what he or she would do differently now.Allow for flexibility in your child's daily schedule: if your kid wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, he or she may do better with solo activities rather than one-on-one instruction.
Don't cancel your planned lessons when your child is rebellious or upset. Rather, reschedule them. Work should not go away if it is difficult, but should be approached calmly.
Provide ample outlets for creative expression of feeling. Have your child keep a journal that is entirely private. Provide your child with art supplies.
Expose your child to art. Take him or her to museums, plays, opera, concerts, dance performances and poetry readings.
Be calm during a blow-up. Take deep breaths, and give your child space.
If you are worried for your child's happiness or mental health, seek help from a doctor or therapist.

, Around age 11, kids often opt out of the subjects that are difficult for them. If your kid asks to give up on a subject because they ""aren't good"" at it, refocus their studies so that they learn specific skills. For instance, around age 10 many children become frustrated with the lack of realism in their drawing, and give up art. Head this off by teaching new skills at this age, such as perspective, shading, and proportion.An outside class may help head off your child's desire to ""give up"" a subject. If your kid does not excel at sports, encourage other approaches to physical activity. Sign your kid up for a martial arts class, or a dance class, of their choosing."

Make up a name for your 'school' such as Rainbow Academy.,Occasionally make a reference to other friends from your ""school"" without going over the top.,Talk about teachers/different teaching methods, where you won't have to lie or make things up since you can talk about your tutor or whoever tutored you at home without giving away you were home-schooled.,
Sidestep the uniform issue by either making one up using something you've seen a sibling or parent wear when they went to school, or - if you think you can get away with it - say there was no strict uniform code.,
Show pictures sparingly.",How to Hide the Fact That You Were Homeschooled," Home-schools are private schools so giving it a name makes it sound more 'professional'.
,,, Many school uniforms consist of a school shirt with a specific color of skirt or pants., Pictures can be good evidence. If you've had a tutor, a picture with her/him where you happen to be wearing something similar to what you described as your uniform might work to show around casually."

Use a pre-packaged curriculum.,
Look through subject-specific textbooks with your child.,
Make use of online teaching resources.,
Teach classes outside of core requirements.,
Tailor the courses for your child’s post-high-school plans.,
Help your child assemble a 4-year (or 5-year) plan for graduation.,
Enroll your child in courses at a local high school.,
Look for homeschool enrichment programs.,

Help with ACT or SAT prep and college applications.,
Create transcripts of your child’s homeschool courses.",How to Homeschool a High Schooler," Many homeschooling companies have developed full high-school level curriculums that can be purchased and taught for a full school year. These curriculums will include textbooks covering typical high-school subjects, such as English and American literature, biology, chemistry, physics, and history. If you prefer to use this model of high school education, you can purchase and use four separate curriculums, one for each year of high school.While many of these curriculums tend to be explicitly Christian—including well-known curriculums such as Calvert and A Beka—there are plenty of secular options as well.;
, If you prefer not to use a pre-packaged curriculum—or would like to supplement the curriculum with textbooks of your choosing—you can teach your child directly out of subject textbooks. Even if you are not an expert in the academic subject in question, the textbook will include enough explanatory material—often including CDs or online teacher’s guides and lesson plans—to resolve any questions you or your child has.Homeschool textbooks can be purchased from book vendors online. Alternately, if you’d like to access a wide selection in person, most states hold annual homeschooling conventions, at which you can flip through dozens of textbooks.

, Your child can take complete courses online, and interact with other homeschooled high-school students. These online courses are often designed and sold by the same companies who make pre-packaged homeschool curriculums.Online courses can also include pre-filmed lectures or educational videos.

For example, visit the website for HomeSchool.com; this site directs you to a number of online resources and curriculums.These include: The Home Learning Institute, which provides K–12 online education for $49 per course; Middlebury Interactive, which provides K–12 foreign language courses; and the Conceptual Academy, which provides science courses to high-school students online.
The Homeschool Legal Defense also provides a variety of full high-school curriculums online and provides concise explanations of legal homeschool concerns.If you do not have a consistently reliable internet connection, there are also DVD-based curriculums that have recorded lectures, in addition to workbooks and textbooks.

, It’s not difficult to find textbooks or online course material for core classes like English, math, and science (chemistry, biology, physics, etc.).To teach classes beyond these you can find textbooks and curriculums online for courses such as web design, computer sciences, and courses on health and fitness and art. Students should take one or two electives each semester.If you’d like, you can consult the yearly course requirements of your local public high school for an idea of which non-core classes are typically offered.
Keep in mind that public schools will have scientific and athletic facilities and so offer courses that you may not be able to offer, such as courses in wrestling, weight lifting, or swimming.

, Talk with your child and inquire about their plans for after high school, then work with them to tailor their coursework towards these goals. (This will likely be more useful for older high school students , but do take into account whatever post-high-school plans younger students may have too.) If your child has an idea of a future college major or a future career path, find or develop high-school courses they can take that will help them achieve this future goal.

For example, if your child plans to go into a political position or wants to run for office, you can tailor history courses towards political history, and teach elective courses in economics or political theory.
If your child is thinking of becoming a dentist or a doctor, focus on biology and anatomy courses in their later years of high school; perhaps the child could take an advanced biology course instead of physics.

, This is a common practice at public schools, where students work closely with guidance counselors to make sure they are progressing through classes at a rate that will allow them to graduate on time. As a homeschooler, you can do the same: make sure that your child completes an English course each year of high school, and completes three courses each in math, sciences, and social studies.Since many colleges and universities expect students to have a foreign language on their transcript, encourage your child to study a language for at least two years.
Also encourage your homeschool students to keep their grades up; failing classes can easily derail a well-planned 4-year plan.

, If the administration will allow this, it can be beneficial to let your child take one or two courses each semester at the local public high school. Not only will this expose your son or daughter to other individuals their age, but to will allow them to pursue academic topics that may be difficult to fully teach in the home.

For example, if your child is interested in creating artwork, the high school will likely have facilities such as a photography darkroom, a painting studio, a ceramic kiln, and a sculpting wheel.
Also consider enrolling your child in courses that cannot be taught at home due to the large number of student required: for example, playing an instrument in a band or orchestra, or singing in the choir.

, An enrichment program is formed when multiple homeschool families bring their age children for weekly courses, taught by the homeschooling parents. This will allow your child to participate in an educational program out of the home, and also allow them to take classes from experienced homeschooling parents, often who teach classes in specialized fields.

For example, if a homeschooling parent has taught literature courses at the high-school or college level, they could offer to teach a similar course to the high school students. A parent fluent in a foreign language like Spanish or French could teach a language-acquisition course.
Enrichment programs don’t have to be only for high schoolers; homeschooled children of all ages can join and take classes focused on their educational level.

, For high-level juniors and seniors who are planning to attend college after they graduate, a community college can be a beneficial intermediate step between the homeschool classroom and a large university. The college-level coursework will challenge the high schooler, and they can start building up college credits before graduating high school.Community colleges often appreciate the enrollment of homeschooled students, as these students tend to be focused and engaged, even if they are younger than some of their classmates.

, Accreditation means you’re your homeschool has been approved by a state accrediting body; the diploma you give your child will signify that the homeschool curriculum has been approved and carries the same weight as would a diploma from a public school. For many homeschool parents, this legitimates the homeschooling process. To receive an accredited diploma, you’ll need to contact an accrediting organization within your state and send them copies of your child’s transcript.Accredited diplomas are more highly regarded by colleges and universities, and will increase your child’s chances of acceptance.
Accreditation is not mandatory; many homeschool parents choose not to accredit their transcript. In fact, plenty of public high schools do not offer accredited diplomas. If your child does not plan to attend college, there is no need to accredit your homeschool program.

, If your child plans to attend college, you’ll need to help them prepare through coursework. In fact, you can use university admission guidelines as a template for your child’s high-school curriculum. For example, most universities will require three years of science, social studies, and math courses, and four years of English. Colleges generally have no problem accepting homeschooled students from accredited programs., During your child’s Junior year, you’ll need to help them register and study for the ACT or SAT exam. It’s important for homeschool students to take one or both of these tests, as they lend legitimacy to the student’s homeschool credentials. Just as with any public-school students, your child will appear especially valuable to the college if they’ve scored well on the ACT or SAT exam.Then, near the end of the Fall semester of your child’s senior year, you’ll also need to help them with college applications.

Private colleges may be more inclined to accept homeschooled students. Private schools can be more selective in general, and should appreciate the unique background that your child brings.

, This document will need to be sent to colleges and universities as part of the application process. When making a transcript for your student, note each course title, the semester the course was taken during, the dates of the semester, and the student’s grade in the course.You should keep the transcript up-to-date during throughout high school, as it will be easier to update biannually than to compile the entire thing as the student graduates.

Aside from the transcripts, you should keep permanent records which note which textbooks your students used, how many credits were given for each class (if you assign credit values to courses), and a 2–3 sentence summary of each course your child took during high school.

First, ask your parents to let you switch to public/private school.,
Pick the closest High School near you.,
After picking a school make sure you register.,
Now all that's left is getting your stuff.,
Before attending the school try to get to know some of the kids that go to your school, and even if you aren't best friends still talk to them from time to time.,
Once you get to the school check in at the front desk, and ask for your schedule, your locker number and combination (have someone show you how to open your locker since lots of homeschooled children don't know how they work), and request someone to show you around.,
Now have a little heart to heart with your teachers.",How to Go from Homeschool to High School," If they don't like the idea then tell them it's a good opportunity to learn new stuff your parents or a tutor can't teach you (like how to play an instrument, and chorus, or woodshop). If they still say no tell them it's good for you to socialize, and get to know your peers. Parents may say that you are social enough because most homeschooled teens are.;
, Go with your parents and look around. You don't want to jump ahead and make a decision before making sure you like the school. Meet the staff and see if you like them, get a tour, and check out the classes they offer and the after school activities. You can sometimes shadow someone for a day to get the feel for the school. If you don't like the school and there's another in town (maybe even a private school; if you can't afford it, many offer scholarships), look around the other schools and pick the one you like the most. If you live in a small town and there's only one school you may be able to go to another school in a bigger or different town; however, some towns won't let you.

, You'll need at least one of your parents to come with your birth certificate, Social Security card, and health records (actually shot records -- can't get into school without them).

, Get at least five notebooks, 3 three ring binders, trapper is optional, pencils, pens, colored pencils, erasers, a ruler, a calculator, and a backpack (nowadays shoulder bags are in, but backpacks are more convenient).

, It will make you feel more comfortable with your new school.

, When you get someone to show you around make sure that they show you other important places like the cafeteria, the gymnasium, the auditorium (if they have one), and the locker rooms.

, Tell them what you know, also ask them about what they expect from you. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help when it's needed.

Be faithful to homeschooling but don't let it take all of your time:


You can let other parents be your child's sports/PE coaches, specialized home school math, art, or science teacher, etc.,
Follow your beliefs and understandings while observing governmental principles, but substitute your own views on morality to avoid intrusions into the traditional, biblical Christian family.,
Get right with God every day and keep it fresh: ""living one day at a time..."" is an important part of avoiding ""weak values"" without meanness or hate.,
Keep up family relationships, along with home management, well considered and done, in all areas -- and especially natural affection: hugs all around, kissing the face, thanking and praising your children for job well done, etc.

,
Discipline your children fairly but firmly which is a big part of education.,
Use nonviolent spanking mostly for urgent corrections -- to correct dangerous behaviors: for young children going into the street or on to the roof, playing with fire, or gasoline...


Reason when you discipline older children (young people), wait until you may be able to be reasonable, as they can probably be talked out of dangerous notions.,
Teach the children the important doctrines of your faith in loving, fun, exciting and thought provoking ways.

,
Teach the history of the influence of Christian principles on the important issues of republican democracy in the USA and other places, patriotism, family, bible teaching and prayer in school -- exciting and thought provoking.

,
Build your home school's standing with people of the faith by using appropriate curriculum, books and materials from people of like, love of faith and God, Jesus Christ, and religious and other freedoms (that fit with your personal morality).

,
Set your priorities and keep them in some kind of decency and orderly plan to be up on subjects and their finer points too.",How to Have a Christian Homeschool,";
, Be a proud conservative or be a proud liberal if you hold strong opinions.


Remember ""...all things in moderation..."" but of course some things are not done at all so that is moderate...

,


New Testament: ""In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down upon your wrath: ..."" (Ephesians 4:26)
Old Testament: ""be angry, but do not sin ... the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds..."" So, that means get calmed down and be peaceful; repent, so that you may get your rest. (Psalm 4:4)

,,


Fair - treating everyone the same.
Fair - allow each to be an individual (liberty) but with reasonable/firm rules.

,
Sometimes a child acts on the spur of the moment without thinking, i.e: carelessness or lapse of good judgment, or just has no idea of the danger.

,,,, The way to keep peace, truth, and order is to seek that which is good, to bear with that which is not hurtful to its welfare, and to keep up good behavior. (Corinthians 14:40)

Consider the structural differences between the two.,
Check the curriculum.,
Consider how much freedom you want as a parent responsible for your children's education.,
Think about the cost of supplies.,
Think about the available support.,
Be on notice for ""busy-work"".,
Consider the impact of having, or not having, a school identity.",How to Evaluate  Homeschooling Vs Cyberschooling for Your Child," The biggest difference is the highly structured learning for the kids the cyberschool offers. This can be a blessing and a curse. While the kids can be better kept on track by the cyber school's pace and external pressure, this sometimes is detrimental and potentially very devastating to students who do not learn at the school’s pace. This is not to say cyberschooled kids are physically more structured however; they still may school in PJs around the house, sit on the floor, read in bed or whatever. Usually older cyberschooled students may spend more time online to complete their studies than homeschooled students.


Parents of cyberschooled students definitely must spend more time online for reporting and monitoring.;
, There are a variety of curriculum choices in the different cyber schools. These choices however are dependent upon the state’s education laws. So if you are in a highly regulated state, all the schools within the state are going to end up requiring kids to ""jump through hoops"" so that they can perform well according to the state standards. Again, this can be a blessing and a curse. Also, if you have differing faith-based views than the standard curriculum, you have to do more monitoring and re-teaching. This may end up requiring more work in the end than just homeschooling.

, This one goes without saying. Teachable moments arrive in every family. While cyberschools go on to the next lesson as usual, homeschooling allows the family to stop for a while and pursue interesting lessons and concepts or character issues. The schedule also continues even if the child has not mastered challenging content which can lead to frustration and motivation issues. Homeschooling also lends itself well to family travel and responsibilities. Cyberschools tend to be very controlling and time consuming.

, Public cyberschools are usually free, with little financial impact on the family. Homeschooling can cost quite a bit as the students get older. These paid materials, however, are usually more tailored to the students’ learning modality. They may also better reflect the faith and values of the family.

, One of the biggest potential benefits of cyberschooling is the help that the home facilitator receives from teachers and administration outside the home. This same benefit can be had to some extent with a curriculum based homeschool co-op (group of families working together & usually meeting on a weekly basis). The truth is that cyberschools vary in the support the students actually get. Some cyberschools give mostly pressure to perform and not much tutoring help while others are extremely supportive and nurturing.

, Cyberschools tend to require students to complete more busywork to create an effective paper-trail that proves learning. Homeschoolers are also required in most states to prove learning has taken place. Overall, however, homeschooling tends to require less time on the student’s part doing busywork. Busywork time then can be used to pursue the students personal electives.

, Many homeschoolers grow up outside of the traditional “school pride” and identity that is had by attending a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn’t seem to affect them later in life, especially if they go on to graduate from traditional college. Some cyberschool students engage in their own online “community” within their schools and attend their scheduled events and activities in person. This lends itself to more socialization of the child. Homeschoolers can also get a sense of school community if they grow up attending a homeschool co-op that is useful and has a lot of families.

Take into account your interests, passions or current line of work. The right degree can act as a stepping stone toward success.To become a nurse, for instance, it will be necessary to have a nursing degree, while someone looking to move up in the engineering world may find it useful to study physics or advanced mathematics.
Focus on schools that are highly-rated for the programs you’re most interested in.;
, Most major universities offer curriculums for students that live out of state or are too busy to attend lectures in person. Signing up for one of these programs will allow you to earn a degree from a prominent accredited school without ever stepping foot in the classroom.Not every program or specialization taught at a given school may be available online. Do some research to find out which schools offer the subjects you’re interested in.
Major universities will likely have tougher entrance standards, which may be a speed bump for people who are going back to school or have limited college experience.
A low-residency program might also be an option, if you have the ability to travel or commute periodically. These types of programs involve spending a certain number of hours on campus throughout the course of a semester for special lectures and events and completing the rest of your requirements via distance learning., There are also a slew of colleges that operate entirely over the internet. With an online school, you’ll have access to assignments, projects and study materials all through your own computer. These sometimes offer courses of study that are hard to find anywhere else, and can make a fine alternative to traditional universities.Online universities are becoming more recognized by employers as the technology of education continues to improve.Tuition and other expenses will often be much lower for these schools, making them a practical option for those with financial constraints.

, To ensure that you stand to receive a quality education (and a useful degree), do some research to find out whether the school you're looking at is a legitimate accredited university or technical school. This can be done by locating the name of the accrediting organization listed on the school's website, then checking that name against the list recognized by the Department of Education. It's a painstaking process, but it's crucial if you want to avoid being deceived.Scammer have been known to set up phony schools or degree programs in an effort to separate students from their hard-earned money.Attending an accredited university doesn't guarantee more advantages later in life, but it does look better to employers and graduate schools.

, Once you’ve seen what a few different schools have to offer, prune your list down to the top two or three. Make a note of what impressed you about each program, or how feasible it would be to complete given your schedule and other circumstances. When you’re ready, pick the school that you think will make the best fit for you.Some factors to consider when choosing a school to attend online include accreditation, overall cost, the quality of instruction and the ability to transfer existing credits.
Looking up testimonials from past students who have gotten their degrees from a given school can help you decide whether it would be worth the time and expense to enroll there., Locate the option to enroll online on the school’s website, then follow the directions you’re given to complete your application. You’ll likely be asked to supply a few pieces of personal information, education and/or employment history and transcripts from previous schools. When you’re finished, send off your application for review.Online applications will usually be accompanied by a fee of $30-$60.Make sure the information you provide on your application is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge.

, Along with your transcripts, most schools will ask to hand over a copy of your high school diploma or GED. You might also be expected to furnish one or two additional forms of identification. All of this information will be used to officially cement your status as a student, should you be accepted to the school.Recognized forms of ID might include a valid driver’s license, birth certificate, social security card or passport.International students will need to be able to show proof of citizenship in the country where they’ll be attending school., After you’ve sent off your enrollment materials, all that’s left to do is wait. You can typically expect to hear back from the school within 2-4 weeks, though it may take longer depending on how they process applications. In the meantime, be patient and start getting your affairs in order to make room for study time, the cost of textbooks and other considerations.If you’ve applied to multiple schools, wait until you get all your results back before coming to a decision.

, Tuition payments can be made online as soon as you’ve been formally accepted and begun signing up for classes. The amount you owe will be based on the number of courses you take—you can either pay the total sum up front or opt for an installment plan, which most schools offer. Take into account your schedule and funds when planning out your semester.Make sure you get your tuition paid in full on time. If you don’t, you won’t be permitted to attend classes.
Your tuition will be partially determined by whether you’re a part-time or full-time student. Those with busy work schedules or financial restrictions may find it more manageable to work toward their degrees on a part-time basis., Sign up for the courses required to complete your degree, as outlined by the details of your program or specialty track. One advantage of online universities is that they’re usually not limited in terms of class size, which means you won’t have to worry about securing a seat. Try to only take a course load that you know you’ll be able to handle on top of all your other responsibilities.At first, you may have to fulfill a few prerequisites, like English composition or college algebra, but once these are out of the way you can proceed to the more specialized coursework you’ll need to complete your program.
Email your academic adviser (one of these will likely be assigned to you as a new student) or the head of your program to find out what courses you’ll need to take, as well as the best order to take them in., As an online student, you’ll still be held to strict due dates, but the time in between will be much more flexible. You might choose to work on your assignments early in the morning, in the evenings before bed or on your days off. Iron out a schedule that’s sustainable and works for you, and stick to it.You’ll need to have (or have access to) a working computer with a fast internet connection in order to get your work done on time.
Since you won’t have the benefit of working in a classroom setting, it can help to set aside a dedicated study space (like a coffee shop or a separate room in your home) to keep you from getting distracted.

, Different programs will have different formats, structures and standards. To obtain an undergraduate degree, for example, you’ll be judged on your test scores, essays and grades on weekly assignments, whereas for a master’s or doctoral program you might have to write and defend an in-depth thesis on a certain topic. Be prepared to devote whatever time and effort it takes to meet the demands placed on you as a student.Make sure you’re clear starting out about what will be required of you in order to graduate.
Keep a planner or journal that you can use to record details about major projects, deadlines and holidays., After you’ve passed all your courses, successfully completed the requirements of your program and applied to graduate, you’ll be awarded your degree. Be proud of your accomplishments! The pursuit of higher education is a noble goal, and one that allows you to shape a brighter future for yourself.

Find out whether the school helps students find internships and work. Many schools offer great placement programs that can be extremely helpful to graduates.
Ask whether the students feel that they got value for their money.

Takes finances into account.,
Factor in the size of your family.,
Think about homeschooling goals.,
Consider special needs or health concerns.,
Recognize your own strengths and weaknesses.",How to Decide if Homeschooling Is Right for You1," There are a lot of financial considerations to think about with regard to homeschooling, which can cost a family anywhere from $300 to $1000 per year.In order for a parent to homeschool their child or children, they must be home for most of the day, which precludes most regular, full-time employment. If you are living in a two parent household, determine whether you family can subsist on one salary alone; if you are a single parent, determine if you can support your family by working on a part-time basis, or reconsider homeschooling as an option.Alternatively, you should also factor in the money you will save by homeschooling children – e.g. not paying private school fees (if applicable), or travel costs to transport your child to school and back every day.;
, Consider the size of your family before deciding whether or not homeschooling is right for your children. Home education can be difficult for large families, and requires a prioritization of subjects learned and age groups focused on. Some subjects will likely have to be combined, while children with large age gaps will have to be separated at different junctures.Try plotting out a hypothetical school day to see if it would be feasible to cover lesson plans for all of your children, while ensuring that they are all monitored, entertained, and properly cared for (e.g. completing lessons on fractions and spelling with a seven year old child, as well as lessons on geometry and the solar system with a twelve year old child.)

, When deciding whether or not to homeschool your child, consider what your goals would be with this undertaking. Make a list of things that you would like to achieve with your child during the first year of homeschooling. Some of these aims might include:meeting or exceeding state requirements for grades
adapting to your child's learning style
getting closer as a family
keeping control of school days

, If your child suffers from health problems or has special needs, homeschooling may be an ideal option. Learning at home may provide a safe, peaceful, and healing environment for your child to thrive in. Additionally, there will be significantly less exposure to colds and viruses often spread between students in classrooms; this is important for sick children who are especially vulnerable, but worth considering for any child’s health., Taking on the responsibility of educating your child means assessing your own strengths and weaknesses and deciding what areas of study you might require help with teaching. Make a list of subjects that you don't have a strong background in, or that you struggled with as a student. Consider seeking help from your partner, family, friends, a homeschooling co-op, or tutors.Consider online classes, where you can access expert teaching in the subjects on your list to supplement your homeschooling curriculum.

Make a study calendar. Online students need structure. By making a strong schedule and planning your calendar ahead of time, you can help ensure you get your work done.Know when to relax and when to pull an all-nighter. There are definite times to celebrate, take it easy, and relax during a semester. But if you don't know when to fire on all pistons, you may put your grades at risk.
Do a little bit of schoolwork every day. This can make classes seem less overwhelming., It is easy to overlook a detail, but that is not the same as being lazy. Read everything carefully. Deadlines and instructions are not negotiable in most cases. You do not want to jeopardize your academic career by not carefully considering all the guidelines in each assignment, class or program.


Pay close attention to any syllabus you are given.
Double check periodically on particular deadlines.
Keep a schedule of due dates for easy reference.

, If you find yourself unable to pass a class, look for another way to satisfy the requirement. Talk to an academic counselor or adviser with your program to see if any accommodations can be made. Remember that your school wants you to graduate as much as you do.


Students are more likely to succeed with material they find engaging.Take a college transition class if offered. These “college skills” courses are designed to help people ease into college. For people who have struggled in the past, these courses can make a big difference in student outcomes., If necessary, make arrangements to postpone or reschedule other responsibilities that conflict with your online study times. School is a top priority. You are not only supposed to treat it with the respect you might give a paying job, you have to pay for it.

, Many schools will withhold a diploma until you pay all the fees associated with attending the program.Be sure that you will have covered any due costs you may have incurred, to insure you graduate in a timely manner.


See if there are special fees associated with graduation.
Make sure you do not owe any fines for lost or damaged materials if you rented them from your school.
Be sure that you are current with your tuition.

, This is one of the best parts for most people. It is possible to decline the diploma, and so it is a step that you must choose in order to complete the degree. Unless you have a well-thought and supported reason to do so, you should not decline the degree.

Evaluate your child’s learning style.,
Think about your child's social habits.,
Be prepared for questions your child might ask.,
Discuss the issue with your child.",How to Decide if Homeschooling Is Right for You2," If you are thinking about homeschooling, ask yourself how your child learns best - most importantly, do they have difficulty learning in a traditional school environment? Homeschooling allows parents to customize lessons based on the learning style (or styles) that their child responds best to. Based on feedback from your child's teachers or your own observations, determine which of these three primary learning styles fits best:Auditory: learning through hearing
Visual: learning by visually organizing information
Kinesthetic: hands-on learning

, Take your child’s social habits into account before deciding on homeschooling. If they are highly social and feel the need to be around other children their age, homeschooling may not be the right option for them; if they shy away from social situations or experience bullying and teasing at school, homeschooling might be a positive change for them. Assess your child's social habits by asking them questions about their friends; if your child is currently in a traditional school, ask teachers for some insight into how they interact with other students.Note that homeschooled children can experience a level of socialization comparable to what they would have in a traditional school if the effort is made to focus on their social skills (e.g. enrollment in group sports, play dates).

, Questions are an important part of learning as they encourage critical thinking. For the most part it is your child's questions, and not thought-stopping answers, that promote learning. Be prepared to follow your child's unique train of thought and learning process by researching topics beforehand or by finding reliable, easily accessible online references to ensure that you're leading them in the right direction.Bookmark reliable websites to consult to answer your child's questions about particular subjects, or to guide their thought process along (e.g. bookmark the NASA website for answers to your child's questions about the solar system.)

, Before making any decisions with regard to homeschooling, it is important to speak with your child and understand their feelings about it. Let your child know what home education would entail, and what they might like and dislike about it; be sure to let them know that their feelings are very important. Forcing a child to be homeschooled against their wishes may result in poor learning performance, and cause a strain on your parent/child relationship.To get honest answers, be direct and ask your child questions like, ""Instead of going to school during the week, would you like learning your lessons with me at home?""

"
"
Read up on the rules.,
Consider possible curriculum plans.,
Look up local homeschooling co-operatives.,
Look into extracurricular activities.",How to Decide if Homeschooling Is Right for You3," Before making a decision about homeschooling, look up the rules pertaining to your state. Homeschooling is legal in all states, but some states may require you to outline the curriculum you’ve chosen to teach, or provide proof of your own educational qualifications.Visit the Home School Legal Defense Association’s website at https://www.hslda.org/laws for the homeschooling regulations of your state.

, One of the biggest draws of homeschooling is the ability to develop a unique curriculum for your child, but that endeavor may be overwhelming to some. There are also pre-made curriculums available, which are ideal for those who are new to homeschooling as they are simple to follow, establish a schedule for learning, and allow for simple record-keeping. Start with a free pre-packaged program, many of which are available online.For instance, visit lessonpathways.com – a free web service offering online resources for homeschooling.

, Homeschooling cooperatives are groups of families who join together to educate their children. Families can split up teaching and activity-planning between themselves, with responsibilities being divided based on preferences, experience, availability and resources. Search online for homeschooling cooperatives near you; with home education rising in popularity, the number of support groups and resources is constantly growing., Extracurricular activities can provide homeschooled kids with social opportunities and friendships, physical activity, team participation and leadership skills; they can also give your child an advantage when applying to college. Inquire about available lessons, courses, or hobby groups at community centres, churches, or local volunteer organizations. Allow your child to choose an activity that reflects their interests, which could include:joining the Scouts or Girl Guides
music lessons
team sports (e.g. soccer, basketball)
dance lessons
joining a choir group

Earning a bachelor's degree may take longer than an associate's, but it will likely pay off in the long run. You may earn as much as 50% more with a bachelor's and experience than someone with an associate's.
Some positions that rely on accounting require a bachelor’s degree in similar fields.;
, Certified Public Accountants, or CPAs, need to complete 150 credit hours at the college or university level before they can take the CPA exam, which is thirty more credits than is required for most bachelor’s degree programs.Some people choose to complete a bachelor’s or four-year degree program in accounting or business first, then return to graduate school to complete the additional credits necessary before taking the CPA Exam.

, Accreditation is a certification a school is awarded when it can demonstrate adhering to an academic standard required for its students to be able to transfer to other reputable institutions.National accreditation has less stringent standards than regional accreditation.
Credits from nationally accredited schools transfer to many schools throughout the country, but may not transfer to all schools if you choose to pursue a postgraduate degree or transfer schools before completing the program.

, It's important to know your education plans and validate them with the schools you are considering. While nationally accredited institutions will usually accept credit from regionally or nationally accredited institutions, regionally accredited schools often do not accept credit from nationally accredited institutions.This is often because regional accreditation is reserved for schools that adhere to the highest educational standards. Programs in these schools often cost more than nationally accredited programs, but their credits also transfer to more institutions.Regional accreditation is considered to be the “gold standard” in college accreditation.

Create a schedule you can stick to and create a workspace that you use particularly for your school work.Write assignment deadlines in your calendar to make sure you don’t fall behind on work when its due.
Utilize your workspace only for school work if possible to help keep you in a productive mindset while sitting at it.

, Depending on what level of education you are pursuing and if you transferred any courses from other colleges and universities, the amount of time it will take to complete your plan can vary widely. Regardless of how long it takes, it’s important that you stay motivated and keep at it.

Find the humor in your days. Kids are constantly saying hilarious things and if we are not careful we can be all too busy to catch them.
, Some days things are just going so far south that it’s time to simply throw in the towel for the day and head to the park or turn on Netflix or just send the kids outside to play while mom takes some time to scream into a pillow., Go on a date with your spouse or partner, hang out with friends, or simply go shopping or get your hair done. You need this time to get away from your children and be in adult company. It's so important to foster relationships that matter to you, and assure your family and friends, that they don't always take a back seat to homeschooling., Sometimes the burnout may be due to using a curriculum that is not best suited to your needs. You may want to take a good look at what you are using and reevaluate its usefulness for you. Do your kids balk at using it? Is it difficult for you to understand how to use? These may be indications that this curriculum is not a good fit for your family., Nearly every state and county has a local homeschool support group. You can most likely find one in your area by googling “homeschool support group”. There are also online support groups. You don’t have to do this alone. This can go a long way to helping avoid burnout., Homeschool parents have a tendency to neglect themselves. Having a hobby that you enjoy addresses this issue and makes sure that you are spending some time doing something that you like to do, at least a few hours a week. It can be anything, from scrapbooking to running. Even just finding time to read a book you've been wanting to read., This can apply no matter what age they are. Of course, the way you play with a teen looks a lot different than how you play with 1st and 2nd graders. However, you will never regret this one.

When you are home schooled, you can get an extra couple of hours of sleep.;
, When you are homeschooled, you get to eat whatever you want for lunch and snacks. You don’t have to eat terrible cafeteria food. Your mom or dad can cook for you, or you can make some yummy food for yourself.There are lots of things you could have for lunch at home!
You could have soup, salad, or leftovers from dinner the night before.
In traditional school, you would probably need to bring a sandwich or eat from limited cafeteria options.

, When you go to school at home, there is no dress code! You can wear your pajamas all day, or dress in a costume. You can even wear your bathing suit when it’s hot outside. Most of all, you can just be comfortable.Some schools require uniforms, and almost all have dress codes.
When you are homeschooled, you can wear whatever you choose.
You can even change your clothes in the middle of the day.

, In public schools, there can be a lot of bullies or other dangers. When you are at home, you can always feel safe and comfortable. You don’t have to worry about mean kids or school shootings.At home you are free from the dangers of mean kids (or even mean teachers).

, Being stuck in school means being stuck at a desk all day long. When you are homeschooled, you can get up and move around when you need to. You can take breaks and run around outside, or just get up and stretch every once in a while. This is much healthier for you!Schedule time to play soccer with neighborhood kids or play tag with your siblings.
You could also try doing yoga or just running around your house.

, In regular school, you pretty much have to wait until lunch to eat. So what if you’re hungry at 9am and lunch isn’t for three more hours? That’s too bad. This isn’t a problem with home school. You can eat when you are hungry.Eat healthy snacks to fuel your learning.
Try ants on a log (peanut butter and raisins on celery), grapes, or fruit leathers.

Read the books you want to read.,
Learn at your own pace.,
Study things that interest you.,
Make choices about your schedule.",How to Enjoy Being Homeschooled3," Eating and running around when you want to are cool, but the best part of being home schooled is having a little control over what you study. If you are reading novels, for example, you can talk to your mom, dad, or whoever is in charge of teaching you and talk about books that you want to choose! You don’t have to read the same boring classics as the other kids in your grade.Maybe you would like to read the Harry Potter series, or The Hunger Games.

, If you struggle with some subjects, but do really well in others, you can move quickly through the things you are good at, and spend more time getting help with the things that are hard. This isn’t so easy in a classroom where a teacher needs to work with 30 students. At home school, you can always work at your own pace., You may also be able to make your hobbies and interests a part of the lesson. If you love snowboarding, you can use that to study physics, science, or weather. If you love art, you can spend time studying art history. Whatever you are really into, you can find a way to work it into what you are studying.Talk to your parent/teacher about creative ways to include your interests into your school lessons.

, When you are home schooled, you might be able to make choices about what when you study. In regular school, you must follow the schedule set for you.For instance, maybe you work better if you spend a long time on certain subjects, and break the subjects up over different days (like block scheduling).
With home schooling, you can develop a schedule that works for your parent/teacher and you.
Even if you don't get a lot of choice when it comes to scheduling, be grateful that you don't have to sit in a classroom from 7am-3pm!

Organize a Study Timetable.,
Find a Study Space that is best suited for your subject.,
Study Corner at Home You are at school about 6 to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, you sleep approximately 9 hours a day, and you will probably have out-of-school activities such as sports and work.,
Explain to your parents your situation.,
Be Proactive A correspondence course is made up of mini-assignments that you send to your Correspondence Teacher every week.,
Prevent Getting Side Tracked Because a Correspondence Course is self-motivated, it is very easy to get side tracked and lose concentration, this can happen by seeing a friend and talking to them, getting distracted by music, or coming across a website and not doing your work.,
Utilize Resources If you have access to a library, make sure that you use it to research and study in.,
Study, Study, Study...Relax.,
Utilize Face-To-Face Meetings Many Correspondence Teacher's will provide face-to-face teaching every term or a few times a year.,
Be active in your study Don't get stuck in a rut, if you are getting tired during study, go for a walk and stretch, have a glass of water or juice and do some heart-pumping activities.,
Be Happy With Your Study Efforts Don't be too hard on yourself.",How to Excel in a Correspondence Subject at School," Because Correspondence Courses require a self-motivated person, it is essential that you have a study regime that you can stick to. Most of the time you will have a Timetable or Class Schedule, and if you are studying by Correspondence, then classes will be set aside for you, these are not Free Periods, but scheduled time for your Correspondence Class.;
, If you are studying Agriculture, then try using the Library or Agricultural Plot or Shed. If you are studying Computers, go to a computer room where you have access to a Computer, Printer and Internet. Your study space should be quiet and clean, it is best to do your work in a class room rather than the playground It may be tempting to study at your Lunch Seats, but this can be quite distracting

, This only leaves you with a few hours a day to study at home. Therefore it is important that you have a quiet study space with almost everything at your finger tips. Ensure that you have a tidy and neat desk, with drawers and folders dedicated to each subject. Have a pencil tin and pencil case, with high-lighters and markers, assorted colours of pens, pencils, ruler, Eraser, and anything you may need. Lighting is important, so if your bedroom or study light isn't appropriate or bright enough, buy a lamp or light that shines over your head and in front of you. The worst thing is straining your eyes and the second is being too cold or too hot. To prevent this, make sure you have a heater or air-conditioner and if your unable to have one in your room, try having a fan or a wheat bag. You can also use water bottles, Warm Cups of Hot Chocolate or Tea, (Coffee doesn't help) and layers of clothing.

, Most parents are positive towards school, some...are not so positive. Make sure you explain to your parents and family what you're doing, more often than not, you will be able to have a quite study time when you get home from school, but make sure that they understand that a Correspondence Course means that you don't have a Teacher to help you if you have questions, and in many situations, you may not have the resources right at your finger tips. This is when parents need to be active in helping you to learn, by driving you to a library on the weekend, or making sure you have folders and cardboard for assignments.

, Because at school you have heavy study loads anyway, as well as family commitments, relationships and social lives, it is essential to be proactive. If a section of work is due on Friday, and it's only Monday, get stuck into it, once it's out of the way, you will not have to worry about it. If you have a BIG assignment due in a month, try to get most of it done in the first few weeks, and then plan to have it finished a week prior to the Due Date. This way you won't be cramming and working till the early hours of the morning trying to finish it.

, A good way to prevent getting distracted and keeping on track, is to eliminate the distractions. Remove all music devices, (at school other people may have them, try not to become distracted), when using the Internet or computer, don't stray off your scheduled task, if a friend comes over to you, tell them you will only be a few minuets and ask if you can talk later and explain that you are busy. (Most friends will understand). If you do become distracted, save your work, and pick up doing the scheduled task at a later time, when you are not tempted by distractions.

, If you have access to a computer and Internet, use them to research and type up assignments. It's no use having resources at your disposal if you are not going to use them.

, There will be times that you have to put the hard yards in, during exams, or over the holidays. Be sure that you make as much of an effort to keep up with your work, and when your holidays and breaks do come around, make sure you take full advantage of them. If you go to a camp, sit back and relax, and don't worry about school.

, This is a great opportunity to meet your teacher, and other students studying the same subject as you.

, If it's late at night, and your tired, go to bed, many students try to over-lead their brains with study and assignments. Sleep is when your brain reinforces the efforts made during study and helps make your short term memories into long term.

, Doing a Correspondence Course can be hard, and it takes guts, determination and confidence in yourself that you can do it. At times your marks may fall, other times you may get 100%. Whether you achieve the best, or strive to be the best that you can be, that's all you can ask for. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't do as well as you had hoped, or that you find you didn't answer a questions right. You have already proven that you are dedicated to the subject, so just make sure you stick to it and keep trying.

Contact people who have studied abroad before.,
Get a part-time job.,
Save all of the money that you can.,

Make a list of the benefits you expect to receive from studying abroad.,
Tell your parents where you expect the money to come from.,
Explain that you are academically serious.,
Discuss your personal safety.",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Become an Exchange Student," Before attempting to convince your parents, you need to clarify in your own mind what your reasons for studying abroad are. Is being an exchange student sometime you’re willing to dedicate serious time and money to? Ask yourself:


Are you studying abroad because it’s personally important, or because a friend or movie made it seem fun?
Are you willing to learn a foreign language if needed?
How much time are you willing to spend away from your family, friends, and home?;
, You’ll find vastly different experiences—both academic and cultural—in different regions and countries. Think about countries and cultures you’d like to travel to, and narrow your list of potential study locations to about three.Find a location that’s a good fit for you personally by:Asking yourself if you would rather be in a rural or an urban setting. An urban setting would give you more opportunities for travel within your host country.
Asking yourself if you want to be in a location where you can get by speaking English, or if you’d rather speak a foreign language.
Once you’ve narrowed down your options, start looking into schools directly. Research universities (or high schools) in the area(s) you’re interested in, look into their academic standing, and contact the respective study-abroad program.

, Most exchange organizations offer both short (1–3 months) and long-term programs (either for a semester or a year). At this point, you should contact the host program directly, and see what type of timeline options they provide.


If your parents are okay with you going to a neighboring country for a short time, but are less comfortable with the idea of you going jet-setting around the world for a year, perhaps you can meet them halfway and spend a year in a nearby country.

, Your guidance counsellor will be able to help you find a trustworthy organization. Your parents will want to know who is facilitating the exchange program; is it through a university or school itself, or a study-abroad program? Showing your parents the legitimacy of the company will help reassure them.


Talk to your teachers about whether your school has any sister schools overseas. This way, you could inquire about doing an exchange through your school. This will probably be a cheaper option, and cut out the “middle man” of an exchange company.
Ask your exchange company (or the hosting university or high school study abroad program) to confirm that the work you complete in your host country will be credited when you return home. You may need to reach out to representatives of the host school to confirm this.

, Ask their opinions on whether they think it was worth the money, and what they learnt from the experience. If they live in your local area, you could see if some of them could meet for coffee with you and your parents, in order to talk about their trip. This will help you better understand how the exchange program works, and let your parents hear first-hand what others have gained from the experience.


This step will be especially useful if you can find individuals who studied in the same country you’re planning to study in.

, Working while you’re in school will show your parents that you are self-sufficient and understand the value of money.Studying abroad—especially for long periods of time—is expensive, and your parents may be concerned that it’s too expensive. They may also feel that you don’t understand the value of money, especially if you’ve never worked before.


Show your parents that you’re interested in, and capable of, generating income and dedicating that money towards being an exchange student.

, Being an exchange student has many costs associated with it, and you’ll need to plan ahead in order to cover your costs.Even if you’re still in the early stages of study-abroad planning, start saving as much money as possible.


Try to set aside at least one third of every paycheck to cover your exchange-student costs.
To show your financial responsibility and your ability to budget and plan ahead, make a financial plan with your parents.Factor in flight fees, travel fees, room and board, tuition costs, and then calculate where the money will come from.
Ask for a stipend from your school. If your school offers this, it will help you to pay for your time abroad trip.

, Your parents will miss you while you’re an exchange student, and may be concerned that they’ll never hear from you. Reassure them that you’ll be in touch regularly, and plan to send letters and postcards when you have the opportunity.


Plan to set up a weekly or monthly schedule of Skype times.
With your parents, research how international phone calls and texts work in the country you’ll be in.

, These should be concrete, specific examples that you can show to your parents that will justify your studying abroad.A list of benefits will help immensely when you sit down to convince your parents.


If your list only includes benefits like “I want to party with locals in Spain,” or “I’ve always loved British accents,” your parents will likely be justified in not allowing your travel abroad.
Instead, make it clear that you would like to learn a new language, expand your understanding of the world, improve your resume, or gain other valuable experiences., Travel and studying abroad can be very expensive, and parents will balk if you expect them to foot the entire bill. If you’ve already saved a few thousand dollars or can expect financial assistance from your university or high school (or the school you’re traveling to attend), this may diminish your parents’’ financial concerns.For example, your parents may not consent because exchange programs cost too much. Include in the list how you can pay part of the trip.
This way, you can show your parents that you are independent and responsible, indicate that you want to experience studying abroad and will do all you can to make it happen.
Also investigate the health care you’ll be entitled to receive in your destination country.Your parents will feel more comfortable with you studying abroad if they know you’re covered by health care.

, Many parents are worried that their child may fall behind with their schoolwork while on exchange program, or that their child will party and travel, while neglecting academics., It’s natural for parents to feel concern for your safety abroad, especially if you are an inexperienced international traveler. Rather than brushing aside their safety concerns, show that you take the issue seriously.Take precautions to keep yourself safe, like:


Research instabilities or potential safety risks in the country. The political climate abroad is often very different than at home (for better or worse)—check with the U.S. State Department to find out if there are any health scares or areas of violence to avoid.Find out more detailed safety information about the specific city you’re staying, as well.
Keep the address of the place you’re staying. This will be useful if you need a late-night taxi ride home, or if your phone dies and you can’t find your way home. Write the address down both in English and the native language of the country you’re in.Watch out for pickpockets and thieves. This can be a serious problem in some foreign countries. Carry cash and valuables on your person (not in a bag that could be snatched away).Learn how to contact the local police, should something be stolen should locals start becoming aggressive with you.
Know the emergency call number for your country. 911 in the USA is equivalent to 112 in Europe, and 000 in Australia."

In that case, you need to get an associate's or bachelor's in nursing, depending on what level nurse you want to be.When looking at your career, think about aptitude. That is, what are you good at? If your a person who loves to care for your friends and family, maybe you want a career where you can do the same, such as nursing.
If you want to one day open your own business, maybe you want a degree in business.
If you're not sure what you're good at, think about the subjects you excelled in at school or take a career aptitude test.

, Another way to help you choose a career is to look at what fields need people. If you pick a growing field, you'll be more likely to get a job when you leave school, and you'll likely have higher earning potential.The Bureau of Labor Statistics is a good place to look for information on growing fields. In addition to data on how a field will grow, you can find information broken down for each type of job, including salary, what the job is like, and what you'll need to get the job., If you feel drawn to more than one field, you can always double major.Double majoring means you focus on two fields of study while you're in school, and both will be listed on your diploma. You can also major in one field and minor in another. A minor is sort of a mini degree that requires fewer hours to complete.


You may think it will take you longer, but that's not always true. In many degree programs, you often have a number of built-in electives, meaning you must find classes to fill those hours, but you get to choose what they are. In that case, you can fill your electives with another major, so that you get done in the same amount of time it would take you to do one degree.

, If you can't make up your mind exactly what you want to do or you'd like to check out several options, you need to make sure to pick a school that offers multiple programs you can do online. That way, you can switch majors if you decide you don't like what you're doing., Any number of college databases are available where you can find schools based on your preferences. For instance, you should be able to narrow by whether they offer online programs, what majors they offer, and the cost.You may also be able to narrow by criteria such as teacher-to-student ratio and overall school size.
You can also pick between community colleges, large, public universities, and small, private universities.

, Online degree programs come in all shapes and sizes. What programs they offer can vary widely, so you need to find one that offers the program you want. That way, you can get a degree in the major you've chosen. Also, some schools only offer some of their programs online, so you need to do your research.Community colleges, for instance, often have online degree programs, but they offer a narrow range of majors and degrees. Another option is for-profit universities, which also offer a narrow range of majors and degrees, usually in things like nursing, business, and accounting. One problem with for-profit universities is they don't always have the same clout as other universities and colleges.
Many traditional schools also offer online programs, though some may only offer a low-residency program, meaning you do most of the work online, but you may need to visit the school from time to time for intensive workshops and classes.

, While being older doesn't necessarily make a school better, longevity does command some respect. In other words, if the school you're looking at was started 2 years ago, you may have a harder time getting a job with that degree than a school that's been around much longer.Nonetheless, if the school opened more recently, it may be able to garner respect based on what other organizations it is connected with. For instance, if a new school is somehow associated with an Ivy League school, it will likely be respectable.

, Some schools offer financial aid such as scholarships, while others do not. More traditional schools are more likely to offer scholarships than non-traditional schools, such as for-profit universities. Community colleges often don't offer as many scholarships, but the tuition is relatively cheaper compared to other schools.If the school doesn't offer scholarships, you should still be able to get some form of financial aid from the government if you need it, usually in the form of grants or student loans.
However, schools with scholarships can make things easier, as you may not need to take out as many loans. In addition, you can search scholarship databases for relevant ones to apply for outside of your school, even if your school doesn't offer them.
One reason to make sure your school is accredited is not being accredited can affect financial aid. If your school isn't properly accredited, you may not be able to get government financial aid.

, In an online program, you're going to need support from staff members at the school, even more so than you would in person. Therefore, you need to spend some time researching how much support the school offers students.Check to see if the school assigns an advisor to each student.
Also, see if the school has tutoring options, as well as people to call when you run into administrative problems.

, Another statistic you can look at is on-time graduation rates. Basically, that means the average student graduates in the amount of time it normally takes to finish that degree, such as 4 years for a bachelor's degree. You want to go for schools were students tend to finish on time.This number tells you how much students are spending to graduate. The more years you spend in school, the more money it takes you to get your degree.
To keep your debt in check, pick a school with a higher percentage of on-time graduates.

, Many websites now offer free courses taught by university professors and experts from around the world. While these courses usually won't give you a degree, some will give you a certificate of completion. It's also a good option if you just want to expand your knowledge in a certain area.You probably won't get the same interaction with the professor that you'd get in a normal course. However, you will often be able to interact with other students who are taking the course.
Some of the major websites offering MOOCs include Coursera, Khan Academy, Lynda, and Princeton.

, Most of the time, the school will list who they are accredited by. Accreditation means an outside body, one approved by the Department of Education, provides oversight for the school's academics. In turn, that means that you get a better quality education. Accreditation is important. Without it, your degree will have less impact, as many employers may not accept a degree from a non-accredited school.Look on the ""About"" page on the school's website.
You can also use Google to search the school's website if you can't find it. Type in ""accreditation site:schoolname.edu."" Put in the main website address in place of ""schoolname.edu,"" and Google will search just that website.

, Once you find out who provides accreditation, you need to find that accreditation company's main website. You want to make sure the accreditation is legitimate and that it provides accreditation for other schools in the area.Checking up on these companies is important. You can look up their websites to see if the company even exists, for instance, and if their website is professional.
However, while a non-professional website (such as bad grammar or graphics) can indicate a company that's not reputable, a professional website does not mean the company is necessarily reputable. If you find a professional website, you need to dig deeper by looking at listings with the Department of Education.
Accreditation is often done regionally, meaning that a regional company accredits many schools in the same area, even ones with online programs.

, When looking at an accreditation company, you can check up on it by making sure it is listed with either the Department of Education or the Council for High Education Accreditation. If the company is reputable, it will be listed on one of these two websites.The Department of Education has a College Navigator tool. You can use it to look up your school and make sure it is accredited instead of looking up the accreditation company.

, You can also simply use a database to search for schools that focuses on accreditation. In other words, some databases only list schools that have respected accreditation. Still, you always want to check up on the school, as accreditation can change from year to year. For instance, a school or a part of a school can lose accreditation."

Do you have access to enough information to make a decision about the course content and format? Does the course content match what you need? If the description does not match, neither will the course.

, Beware - if you need to buy a book, the course may be just an instructor-led reading group. An online course should be all-inclusive.

, The syndicator is an organization that offers the SAME online courses to hundreds of schools and colleges. It’s an easy way for your local school district or college to offer the convenience of online programs and it’s a great way for the syndicator to market their courses through locally recognized institutions. In the syndication model, the course developer, the instructor, the school, and the syndicator each earn a percentage of the course price that you pay. While there are certainly terrific courses offered through this channel, given the revenue sharing model, I would challenge the quality and effort of the individuals involved in the process.

, You should be able to find out how many students will be in your class. Even for an experienced online instructor in a virtual classroom, it is difficult to provide personalized attention on a discussion board with more than 25 participants.
