Some smaller states do not accept licensing courses from online schools. If this is the case, you may have to enroll at a local college or university instead. It’s possible that you can complete some or all of your coursework online through these institutions.
The real estate commission website for your state will likely have a list of approved schools.;
, You can usually find this information on a school's website. If an online real estate school is not accredited by a qualified accrediting agency such as The Association of Real Estate License Law Officials (ARELLO), find another school. Why? Accreditation is your assurance that the course you're taking will lead to a viable certificate or diploma. It tells future employers that your courses were legitimate. Accreditation means that the school


operates on a sound financial basis,
has an approved study program,
employs qualified instructors,
follows approved recruitment and admissions policies, and
advertises its courses factually. , Schools that have been in business for longer will likely run more smoothly. They may be more familiar with state and federal regulations. At the same time, older schools may be more likely to use outdated instructional platforms, so be sure that your school is using the latest technology., If the school’s prices are much higher or much lower than others, this should be a red flag. If you cannot pay for the entire course upfront, look into the school’s options for paying in installments. Some schools that offer payment plans charge an extra fee for this service. Narrow your search down to schools whose prices and payment plans work for you.

, What do former students have to say about the course? Check to see if anyone has complained about the school to the Better Business Bureau., Check exam pass rates. Ultimately, the real test of how effective your school is will be whether you pass your licensing exam or not. The percentage of students who pass their exams will give you a good idea of how good a school is. Also check on course completion rates. Low completion rates may indicate that the school does not offer adequate student support. , You did your research, but how do you know if the course you purchased is really worth it? Some online real estate schools have a money-back guarantee that allows you to return the course materials within a specific timeframe. Take the time to understand how these guarantees work and take careful note of deadlines.

, Make a list of questions about the course, and call the number provided on the school's website. If you reach a computerized answering service, try to select an option to speak to an actual human. If there is no option to reach someone who works there, consider that you may not get the support that you need from this school.

, There are dozens of online real estate schools out there. A spreadsheet will help you keep track of which ones meet your personal criteria. Use your spreadsheet to help you eliminate schools that won’t work for you as a learner. You may want to include categories for


Your finances. How much can you afford to pay for real estate school right now? Will you need to seek out a program that offers a payment plan?
Your schedule. If you have a lot of work and family obligations that fluctuate from week to week, you may need to select a school that has flexible due dates.
Your learning style. Consider how you have learned best in the past. Do you need visuals? Do you require a lot of contact with your instructors?

, A student support department should help your online experience run smoothly. Make sure your online school's support department is staffed by more than one person. Ideally, they should have multiple contact options including email, phone, and fax.

, Educational support staff ensure that you're never left floundering because you don’t understand the material. The school should employ experts who know the ins and outs of real estate laws and procedures. If you’re struggling with the escrow process discussed in chapter six, an online school's educational support department will walk you through the steps.


If the school offers no educational support or does not staff experts, you may want to reconsider the school.

, You don’t want to miss a deadline because of a glitchy website. Your online school should offer a tech support department that quickly answers your questions and remedies your computer frustrations via phone, email, or fax. Check to see whether this department has limited hours or is available 24/7. A school where the tech support is slow to respond or unhelpful when they do respond is probably not the best choice for distance learning.

, Many online real estate schools have videos or “quick tours” that show you how their courses work. This can be a great way to weed out the schools that aren’t right for you. If there isn't a demo class, call or email the school and ask if there is another way to preview a course before you sign on.

, Compare your findings to the priorities you listed on your spreadsheet. Try to find out


To what extent will the courses feel like in-person courses? Are there instructional videos?
Can you interact with professionals who lead the courses? Are they available by email and phone? Do they hold office hours?
Can you access the course from a tablet or phone, or is it restricted to computers?
Can you work at your own pace, or are there strict deadlines?
Are there student study groups that you can join?
Are there quizzes throughout the course to ensure that you are staying up to speed?
Will you need to purchase a textbook? If so, is the format an ebook or a physical textbook?
Can you take practice exams?

, Does the school offer both general real estate courses and state-specific content? Be sure to the school offers everything that your state-based licensure will require.

, Pick the one that best meets your personal criteria as a student (affordable, works with your schedule, delivers content in a way that makes sense to you) and offers the content you need for your licensure.

Do you have a reliable Internet connection?
Do you have a reliable laptop or computer?
Do you have the time to study and complete your assignments?;
, Before you consider taking a course online, figure out the types of programs you will need to use and get comfortable with them. Many course require you to discuss in a forum, which might be new to you, so try to learn about different programs.  Online courses depend on technology, so get familiar with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Wordpress, and etc.

, If you are a student who finds the traditional lecture courses hard to follow, then online courses might be for you. If you hate teaching yourself, consider staying away from online courses.


Think about how do you like to learn - hands on, visual representations like PowerPoint, listening to audio recordings, etc., are some examples.

, Online courses appear to be very helpful for students who don't have a reliable method of transportation or just can't afford to travel to campus many times a week.

, If you are already working in your career field, but want to update your skills, online course may benefit your busy work schedule and give you that competitive edge in your career field.

It takes a lot of self-teaching and time management to pass an online course.

, Schedules are set. If you are thinking of taking online course because you want to turn assignments in whenever you want, then think again. Most online courses are planned weekly and have specific due dates just like normal course. Also, if you aren't good with keeping track of due dates they will pass by and you will end up failing the course.

, Online course can sometime be shorter than traditional courses. They can be 8 weeks instead of 16, which means you have half the time to do the same amount of work.

, Communicating is harder when taking an online course. When attending an online course, your method of communication is limited to emails, there's no way to ask a ""quick"" question. You should expect replies after 12+ hours. Collaborating with group members can be so much harder through email.

, Online courses have large class sizes. The class sizes range from 30-200 students, which can make connecting with classmates and your professor so much harder. When classes are that large, emails can get lost in the flurry of confused students. It also makes finding a classmate you can ask for help from almost impossible.

, Some colleges provide online degrees that cost less than traditional degrees. So, if you want to get a degree, but can't afford to pay, try looking for a college that provides cheaper online classes.

,  If you are someone who is extremely shy, has anxiety, or any learning disabilities online courses can be a more comfortable learning environment.


If you have ADHD, then focusing in a classroom can be a challenge. It might be easier to work by yourself on your own time.
If you suffer from anxiety online classes can be a good option if traditional course become too challenging.

, Your online course will have specific deadlines for assignments, just as any other class would. Always meet these deadlines and produce your best work on assignments.

,, Depending on your school’s set up the icons may represent updates to a discussion board, or grades, or they may indicate that you have a quiz, homework, or dropbox assignments due soon.

, It is also important to try to submit these assignments prior to their due date in case you have a technical problem.

,, This way your answers will be retained even if you have technical problems. Also remember to click submit when you are finished with your quiz so that it can be graded.

, Have a planner with everything on it and a separate calendar for each class with important dates and when assignments are due.

, Have all work in folders or binders and keep everything organized by date, topic or chapter.

, For example, what if you get sick? You should do everything early in case something would happen that would keep you from doing your homework.

, When taking an online class, its easy not to read the designated chapters, since the professor will never know the difference, but you should always try to read them before doing assignments so you know what you should be doing.

, You should study, read, take tests and quizzes and write papers when you can concentrate best. Usually, this is when you are wide-awake, alone and it is quiet around you.

, It is very important to study for all tests and quizzes, but if you are taking them online it is often very easy to just not study and use your book for test taking. If you study ahead of time, you won't need your book and you will end up obtaining so much more knowledge.

, It is hard to not procrastinate in an online class because you don't meet with the professor to turn in assignments. Try to stay on top of things and finish a little at a time, not a lot right before everything is due.

Make sure you have reliable internet access.,
Read the syllabus.,
Make a schedule.,
Work several days of the week.,
Learn your way around the classroom.",How to Be a Successful Online Student1," One of the keys to succeeding in the online world is being able to reliably get online. Before signing up for an online course, make sure that you have regular opportunities to work online for several hours at a time. It is best if you have high speed internet at your home.

Your campus likely has many computers with internet access that you can use. But if you want to devote the proper amount of time to your class, it is much easier if you can work from home.
High speed internet access is best. Most online courses include large files as well as audio and video material. You will want these course materials to load quickly.;
, On the first day of class, the most important thing you can do is to carefully read the syllabus. The syllabus is a document created by the professor to serve as an outline and a guide for the course. It will contain important information such as the professor's contact information, preferred method of contact, and office hours.The syllabus will also provide information about the required course materials. If you're wondering what books to buy, the syllabus will tell you.
You will also find important information such as due dates. Refer to the syllabus to know when assignments are due and when exams will occur.
The graded components of the course will also be on the syllabus. You will be able to see how heavily participation, assignments, and exams are weighted.
Print out a copy of the syllabus. You will want to refer to it several times throughout the semester to make sure you are on track.

, Online courses are excellent if you need flexibility. With many online courses, you can complete the work on your own time. However, it is important to understand that online does not mean self-paced. You will still have deadlines to meet.Set aside time for the class. Treat it as if it were a typical face to face class.
For example, you could choose to devote Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7-8 to working on your class.
Put it in your planner. If you write your study time into your weekly schedule, you will be more likely to make it part of your routine.

, Online courses take just as much time, if not more, than ""regular courses."" You will need to spend time reading the course materials, listening to or watching the lectures, looking at powerpoints, and completing assignments. Most instructors recommend spending between 9-12 hours per week on your online course. For this reason, it is necessary to devote time to the course several days each week.Try having a regular system. For example, on Monday you could set aside time to review the requirements for the week. Tuesday, you could begin reading the course materials, and so on.
Leave yourself time for questions. If something is not clear, you will need to ask your instructor.
You may not receive an answer the same day, so leave yourself some breathing room. Plan to complete assignments before they are due.
It is not a good idea to try to cram all of your learning into one day. Give yourself time to process the information and carefully edit your assignments.

, It might not be a physical classroom, but you still have a designated learning space for your online course. The course website serves as your virtual classroom. Spend some time learning where everything is located. For example, make sure to locate the message function. You'll want to be able to read and send messages to and from your instructor and classmates.Figure out how to turn in assignments. Make sure that you know how to upload assignments so that they can be graded.
Locate the proper place to post discussion messages. Most online courses include a discussion forum for students. It's important to know how to post and read the messages.
Plan to spend 1-2 hours exploring the course site during the first week of class. This will help you feel more comfortable and confident once you begin engaging with the material and requirements.

Behave professionally.,
Write good discussion posts.,
Ask questions.,
Communicate with your instructor.,
Interact with classmates.",How to Be a Successful Online Student2," Online courses are different than social media websites. You are not there to just share your opinions. It is important to behave in the same manner that you would in a traditional classroom. That means that you should use proper grammar. No text speak or internet shorthand allowed.Use common courtesy. Address your classmates and instructor by their name or title.
Do not be disrespectful to others. Disagreement is fine, but make your points in a respectful manner.
For example, if you are taking an online history class you might be required to discuss politics in a forum post. Refrain from saying negative things about another point of view.
Avoid saying things like, ""That's a stupid statement."" Instead, say, ""Based on example XYZ in our book, I disagree.""

, Discussion forums are an important component of many online courses. Your professor will use them to evaluate how well you are absorbing the material. Making the required amount of posts each week is also usually a significant percentage of your grade. Don't just post without thinking. Spend some time working on your posts.

A good discussion post addresses the question that is posed. Do not try to take the conversation off on an unrelated tangent.
The best discussion posts are focused and use specific examples. When you reply to another student, be specific.
For example, don't just say, ""Great post, Natalie!"" Instead, try, ""Natalie, I am very interested in your views on the causes of the Civil War. This seems to relate to the third paragraph in chapter three. Do you agree with the author that economics were the main factor?""
Participate regularly. Make a habit of checking the discussion forums at least twice a week., Taking an online course can feel intimidating and confusing. You might be unsure where to find materials and you might not understand the pacing of the course. Don't be afraid to ask questions.If something is unclear, ask. The best way to clear up misconceptions is to ask questions.
Spend some time trying to find the answer first. But if you can't locate the syllabus after 10 minutes of earnest looking, ask someone where it is.
Make your questions clear. Since you are communicating electronically, it is especially important to make your messages efficient.
For example, avoid asking something like, ""I'm confused about the assignment. Can you help?""
Instead, say, ""Assignment 10 requires us to access a short video. I'm having trouble getting the video to load. Do you have any suggestions?""

, Just because you may not meet face to face does not mean that you can't forge a good working relationship with your professor. Make an effort to introduce yourself to your professor. During the first week of class, send an e-mail with some basic information about yourself.

Try saying something such as, ""Dear Professor Smith, My name is Sara Brown and I am a student in your online intro. to biology class. I just wanted to take a minute to introduce myself. I'm a Philosophy major, so I'm new to the world of online science classes.""
It can help your confidence to begin a rapport with the professor. Later, if you have a question or concern, you will have already had a positive interaction.
If your professor holds in person office hours, stop bye to say hello. Even a brief face to face meeting can make an online course feel more personal.

, Make an effort to get to know your classmates. If there is an open discussion forum on the course site, utilize it. Post a message introducing yourself and sharing a little basic information about yourself.Use your classmates as a resource. If you have a question about where to find a podcast, your classmates might be able to point you in the right direction.
Study together. You can set up an in person study group. Or you can quiz each other on the material via instant message.

"

Be goal oriented.,
Create a productive study space.,
Learn from feedback.,
Edit carefully.",How to Be a Successful Online Student3," Being self-motivated and goal oriented are important qualities of successful online students. You must be able to work independently. It is up to you to make sure that you complete the weekly requirements on time.Since there are not regular class meetings, it is up to you to set your own schedule. Make sure that you set a goal of getting all of your work done on time.
Be proactive. Take the lead in starting a discussion thread. If something intrigues you about the topic, make a post asking others to share their thoughts.Prepare for long-term assignments in advance. Look ahead at the syllabus and figure out when the mid-term is. Don't just start to study the week of the test.

, Having a place where you can concentrate is critical to your success. Find a physical study space that works for you. It might be a desk in your home office.If you live with others, make it clear that you are working. If your brother asks you to hang out, say, ""I need to spend another hour on this course. Then we can shoot hoops.""
Try to limit distractions. Don't study in front of the tv or in a room with a lot of other activity going on.

, You may not receive an A on your first assignment, and that is okay. You can learn from the comments that your professor makes on your work. For example, if your instructor tells you to use more specific examples from the course materials, make sure to integrate that advice into your next assignment.If something in your professor's comments is unclear, ask for clarification. Send a polite e-mail saying, ""You noted in the comments that my essay needs better organization. Would you recommend a chronological approach for the next paper?""
Read the comments with an open mind. Don't take it personally if you do not receive the grade you want. Figure out how you can make improvements.

, Make sure to look over everything that you submit in an online course. This obviously applies to papers and assignments. You should edit, read out loud, and use spell check and grammar check.You should also proofread your discussion posts. Make sure that your points are clear and concise. Remember, these posts are graded, too.
Proofread your e-mails. You want to make a good impression when you communicate with your professor and classmates.
Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors indicate a lack of attention to detail.

Jot down a list of the last few places you can remember seeing it.;
, It may seem a little silly, but remembering what you were thinking and feeling when you last had your item can sometimes help you track it down. You’ll bring yourself back into the moment when you last had the item you’re looking for so little details that can help you find it come back to you., When you remember the last time you saw your missing item, you’ll want to go back to all of the spots you’ve been since you last had it.

If you always toss your keys in the basket next to the door, that’s the first place to look.If there are a couple of spots where you usually keep the item, search all of them to be sure you don’t miss it.
Do a slow, careful search. If you start throwing things around in a panic, you’re just going to make a bigger mess and make it even harder to find your item.
It may seem like common sense, but don’t forget to check your pockets and bag. You may have tossed the item in to get it out of the way.

, If your missing item isn’t in the spot where you usually keep it, it’s time to look in a larger area. Search a few inches out from the spot where you started and see if the item turns up.If you still don’t find what you’re looking for, expand your search again. Keep widening your search area little by little until you find what you’re looking for.

, Sometimes, even expanding the search area doesn’t help you find what you’re looking. Unfortunately, there’s usually only one solution if that happens -- you’ve got to do some cleaning. If the room you’re searching is a mess, you’re probably going to miss the item. Tidy up the area to get rid of any clutter and your missing item just may turn up..

, Sometimes, you may think you’ve lost something when someone else just borrowed or moved it. Ask anyone who’s been around the item if they’ve seen it or know where it is.If you keep losing items because friends, family, or coworkers are always “borrowing” them, don’t feel bad about telling them to ask before they take anything. That’s the only way to keep track of your stuff.

, If you lose your item at a store, restaurant, or other public place, you can get lucky if someone else finds it for you. Head to the lost-and-found to ask if your item’s been turned in.If your item isn’t in the lost-and-found yet, leave your contact info. That way, they can get in touch with you if it does show up.

, If you can’t find your item and you know you lost it in a certain area, make up a flier with all the important details. Describe the item and give your contact info so people can get in touch if they’ve found it. Hang the fliers up in the area and cross your fingers.Post the fliers on telephone poles or bulletin boards in the area where people are most likely to see them.
If you’re really desperate to find your missing item, a reward can sometimes convince people to turn it in.

, You’re more likely to lose stuff if you’re not thinking about what you’re doing throughout the day. Try to be more conscious about what you’re doing in your daily routine so you don’t wind up leaving your keys, wallet, or cellphone where you shouldn’t., If your home or desk is always a mess, it’s much easier to lose something. Don’t clutter up tables, desks, counters, and other flat surfaces or you can wind up hiding things that you’ll need.Think about it this way: if you throw your cell phone down on an empty coffee table that isn’t covered with magazines and books, you’ll always be able to spot it.

, The easiest way to keep from losing stuff is having certain spots where you put your items at the end of the day. Keep your keys on a hook beside the door, charge your phone on your nightstand, or store your wallet in the same pocket in your bag so you always know where you stuff is.Be as specific as you can when you store your items. Don’t just hang your umbrella on any hook in the hallway -- always put it on the middle hook.

Tackle depression.,
Keep your mind active.,
Get more exercise.,
Drink in moderation.,
Minimize distractions.,
Use image associations.One way to help you remember something, whether it is the title of a book or where you left your keys, is to take a moment to visualize the item at hand.,
Repeat names.,
Employ ""chunking.""",How to Get a Photographic Memory," Many people who suffer from depression describe memory loss and difficulty focusing as one of their main symptoms. Anxiety, depression, anger, and other stress-inducing conditions increase cortisol levels in the brain, which can lead to cell damage to the hippocampus, the area in the brain responsible for memory retention.Every case of depression is different, and may call for a different treatment option. For some, talk therapy may be enough, while for others, medications like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) may be necessary to restore normal brain function.There are many ways to alleviate anxiety and stress. Spend more time doing activities that you enjoy, especially those that involve being outdoors. Take up activities that promote mindful awareness, like yoga or tai chi.
Another way to help alleviate anxiety and depression is to socialize more often.Reach out to friends, family members, and loved ones and avoid spending too much time alone with your thoughts.

, Your brain is like the muscles of your body; the more exercise you give it, the better it will perform. Unfortunately, many people get so caught up in their daily routines that they can go days with their brains performing on ""auto pilot."" Try to incorporate some of the following brain-stimulating activities into your week:



Do crossword puzzles.

Read a book (preferably non-fiction).

Read the newspaper.
Play board games.

Learn a new language or instrument.
Sign up for a class at your local community college.

, Physical activity increases blood flow to every part of your body, including your brain.This can help get more oxygen and essential nutrients to your brain so that it will perform better. Aim to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five days a week.


It's important to spread out your exercises throughout the week so that you are regularly increasing blood flow to the brain. Even if you don't have time for a formal workout, everybody has time to squeeze in at least a brisk 10 minute walk.
Make small lifestyle changes to increase your mobility, like choosing the stairs over the elevator.

, Excessive drinking can block key receptors in the brain that are necessary for memory retention, and may release a steroid that interferes with learning and memory.There is some evidence, though, that drinking in moderation can actually protect your memory in the long run. One French study found that in people surveyed over the age of 65, those who drank moderately (1 to 2 glasses of wine per day) were less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than nondrinkers., For many people, forgetfulness is not a memory issue, but a result of being too distracted to effectively learn the information in the first place. When possible, try not to multi-task and instead focus all of your attention on completing one activity at a time. Though it's tempting to take care of several things at once to save time, you will be more likely to retain the information if you do each one individually, saving you time in the long run.

, For example, if the object is a book called ""A Thousand Splendid Suns,"" take a moment to visualize what a thousand splendid suns would look like. Having the image imprinted in your mind can help you recall the title of the book later.


Similarly, if you place your car keys down on the kitchen counter, try to imagine your keys doing something silly in the kitchen like cooking or eating the fruit in the fruit bowl. When it comes time to look for your keys later, you'll be unlikely to forget that silly image you created in your head.

, Many people struggle to remember the names of people they have just met, even after only 30 seconds. This is likely because we tend to focus so much on ourselves (how we look, whether we're being polite, etc) that we neglect to listen to the other person's name. This can be especially difficult if you are being introduced to several people at once.


One way to combat this is to repeat the person's name right after meeting him or her: ""Nice to meet you, so and so."" If you didn't hear the name properly or couldn't catch how to pronounce it, be sure to clarify this right away to avoid having to ask again later.
Another way to remember names is to associate the new name with somebody you already know by that name. If you don't already know anybody by that name, then try to think of a character in a book or film with that name. Making this kind of association can help you recall the name later.

, Chunking is a psychological term for a memory retention technique that involves clumping numbers, words, or items on a list together to help remember them.


If you are trying to remember items on a grocery list, then try clumping them together in different categories like fruits, vegetables, frozen items, condiments, meats, etc. Alternatively, divide grocery lists into potential meals; for example, you could group lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, goat cheese, and vinegar into one ""chunk"" called ""salad items.""
The same can be done by dividing sets of numbers into smaller sections; this will come in handy when trying to remember your credit card number, social security number, or a telephone number. For example, instead of trying to remember the following sequence: 77896526, you could break it up into 77-896-526. Repeating the number back to yourself will be a lot easier if you do it in smaller sections.

Keep on trying, and looking for what works for you.",How to Have Fun With Memorization," It is important to have a general picture of the material.


Reading the table of contents, sub contents, headings then eventually the material in each heading.;
, Easier said than done? It's actually easy.


Try to see what you read in your mind if possible using your imagination. Imagine yourself or someone you know being the character in the material or as if you were watching a television show but only in 3 dimensional view.
Look for examples, if you are having a hard time trying to understand the scientific of technical material, an example will be easier to visualize and understand.

,


Rote memory - contrary to common belief, knowing how to rote memorize in itself is a valuable tool for quick memorization of things or short materials which you need to quickly imprint in your mind.

ex. Fly me to the moon (which is my favorite song)


First step is to read the whole line (imagine this to be the whole song but for sake of shortening the example)
Read the whole line and recite in your mind as well as saying aloud the word moon.
Read the whole line and recite in your mind as well as saying aloud without looking at the paper ""to the moon.""
So and so forth till you memorize the whole thing.

Rhyme - I do not have any experience with this one, so I'll pass. It may work for others but it doesn't seem to work for me.
This does not mean it does not work for you. Experiment who knows.

do believe that in order to memorize a certain material, it is best that we do make an outline out of it, or underline the book we read. If you do make an outline, memorize the outline therefore you have a general knowledge of the topic.

number the topics according to the outline. example. animals, birds, equations and language.


supposing this is the outline or the topics at hand. Number them accordingly. 1. animals 2. birds 3. equations 4. language
put a picture representation for 1 - 4 using your own style. My personal style is using anime characters to represent the numbers, of course you can use whatever means memorable to you.

0= Rei - Zero Child
1= Shinji - First Child
2= Asuka - Second Child
3= Trinity - Matrix
4= Death - the sandman
5= L - fifty
6= Playboy bunny - sexy
7= G - ghost in the shell
8= yin and yang - infinity
9= red dragon - 999999999

Take notes while you work.,
Doodle.,
Speak out loud as you work.,
See the right answer and only the right answer.",How to Concentrate1," One of the most effective ways you can actively concentrate on what you're doing is to write things down by hand. As opposed to typing, writing by hand forces you to actually engage with what you're learning in a more physical way, sticking in the mind more clearly and engaging with it in a more visceral way.


If you struggle to pay attention during meetings or during class, take notes more actively. Keep your pencil moving. Even if it's not something that will be super-helpful later, you'll keep yourself from wandering into other thoughts if you take notes.;
, Long-thought a sign that people weren't paying attention, it turns out that some of the most active thinkers are also active doodlers. If you draw, even just squiggly lines and nonsense while you're trying to pay attention, some studies show that it can help you engage your mind and stay focused, keeping boredom at bay and keeping your mind active and learning., Similar to doodling and note-taking, speaking out loud while you work or study might have your roommates thinking you've got a few screws loose, but it's also proven to actively help you to internalize what you read and the ideas that you're engaging with. Like writing, verbalizing forces you to give words to knowledge, creating a two-step process in the learning that makes it easier to recall and makes you more engaged.If you're embarrassed, try finding an isolated super-quiet place to study, or wait until your roommates are gone to get some alone time to try it out. Or just don't worry about what they think. Talk to yourself! We all do it.

, To escape a skid, professional drivers are trained to look not at the oncoming tree they'd like to avoid, but the space to which they want to go. Successful soccer players move to open space, successful guitar players find an empty space to play a perfect note, and successful learners fixate on the right course of action and the right way of doing.


It might sound so obvious that it's silly, but if you're reading a text and find your mind wandering into other thoughts, picture yourself doing it correctly. Tell yourself to actively read and pay attention. Change your mind and look toward the space where you're doing the right thing. Then do it."
"
Find your best time to work.,
Structure each day at the beginning of each day.,
Work on both short- and long-term goals actively.,
Create a routine and then shake it up.,
Take scheduled breaks.",How to Concentrate2," Are you a morning person? A night-owl? Maybe just after lunch is your peak period. Find the time in the day that you're at your best and structure your life around that fact. There's no sense in pretending to be an early riser if you crave the 3am study session in your soul. Listen to yourself and do what works.

, Creating a plan for yourself helps to eliminate distracting thoughts and stress. Compartmentalize each thing you need to do in a given day, trying to anticipate how much time you'll need to accomplish it. Try to leave in some wiggle room in case you end up needing more time to bash out a draft of your paper, or more time to prepare for that presentation at work.


Try your best to do one thing at one time. When it's time to eat breakfast and read the paper, just eat breakfast and read the paper. You don't have to worry about studying for that English essay if you know you're going to study for it at 4:30, after you get off work and before you meet up for dinner.

, It's best if you can help to remind yourself why you're doing what you're doing to help keep you on track and remind yourself of the bigger picture. Remember your long term goals, and how the little things you do fit into your larger plan for yourself.


One of the most nagging distractions when you're trying to sit down to study trig notes might be, ""Why am I doing this? I should be out partying and living my life!"" In those moments, it's helpful to remind yourself why you're studying: ""I've got to pass this class so I can get my degree and go to grad school and become the most powerful pediatric neurosurgeon in Whitman County. My plan is in effect."" Take time for an evil laugh, then get back to it.

, Monotony can be its own distraction. Learn when you're getting bored of the same old, same old. Try to structure your day by doing different types of activities back-to-back. So you don't have to do one housework thing after another, alternate studying and housework, or throwing in some exercise. Don't answer all your emails at once, answer a few, then take a break to do something else productive. At the end of the day, you'll end up being more productive if you shake it up.


This may not be true for everyone. Learn how you work best. If it's more efficient for you to plow through and grade 20 papers all at once, more power to you. Pour a glass of wine and get to it.

, Breaks are important, but the temptation of a break can start to creep in at particularly insidious moments, like just as your essay starts to get hard and you might be better served by getting over the difficult hump of that paragraph or that page. If you schedule breaks regularly and try your best to stick to that schedule, though, you'll be able to keep yourself more productive and more relaxed.


If you've got a long day ahead of you, some people find it effective to go for a 50-10 breakdown. If you've got a bunch of work to do, go all-out for 50 minutes and then take 10 minutes to do something relaxing. Get up from your desk, take a walk, watch a YouTube video of a bulldog bouncing on a trampoline, do what you need to do to get the break you need. Then get back to it.

"
"
Find a comfortable work environment.,
Embrace the distractions you cannot control.,
Get offline as much as possible.,
Prioritize your efforts.,
Get to it.",How to Concentrate3," There's no perfect place to concentrate. You may find it best to get out and work or study among people, sitting at a coffee shop or cafe, or you may find that unbearable and distracting. Likewise, the best place for you might be in your living room, seated at your writing desk, or you may find the call of the Xbox way too tempting. Try to identify your tendencies toward distraction and create an environment that eliminates those distractions.


Take a day and Try to write down everything that distracts you. If you're supposed to be studying and you click on Facebook instead, write that down. If you should be working on a paper and you're playing guitar, write that down. If you're supposed to be listening in class and you're daydreaming about your boyfriend, write that down.
At the end of the day, look at your distraction habits. When you get down to work tomorrow, Try to create a space where you'll eliminate those distractions. Close your browser while you study, or go somewhere without wireless. Put the guitar in the basement, or leave the house. Put away your cellphone and stop texting the dreamboat. They'll all still be there when you've got free time.

, Sometimes, there's just no way around it: something will distract you from your work. Even if you've gone to the perfect spot in the library where it's quiet, where you can get work done, where it's perfect, and suddenly, the old guy reading old New York Times papers starts barfing up a lung at the desk next to you. What do you do? Two options:



Leave. If the distractions are insufferable, don't overreact, and don't sit there stewing and wasting time. Get up, pack up your things, and find a less distracting corner of the library.

Ignore it. Plug in your headphones and cue up some ambient music and drown out the distracting wheezing from the other people, or just focus in on your reading to such a degree that you don't notice it. He's not trying to annoy you on purpose. Get on with it.

, Sometimes it seems like the browser window is designed to ruin your life. The distance between your English paper and a rabbit hole of old wrestling videos and emails from your girlfriend is just in an adjacent tab. You don't even have to close out of your paper! If you can afford to do it, stay offline while you're working. Put your phone away, turn your Wi-Fi off and get to work.


If you struggle to work on a computer, or you need the Internet to do your job, head yourself off at the pass. Block the websites you find the most distracting by using a program like Anti-Social, or download a time-restriction software that will only allow you to use the internet as set times. In between, you'll be in charge, not the evil vortex called YouTube.

, One of the most distracting things can be dwelling on all the stuff that's crashing down on you: work, school, relationships. Something's gotta give! When you prioritize those items, however, you can control them, working through them and accomplishing them in order of importance and deadlines.


Make good friends with the ""to-do"" list and stick to it as close as possible! Pick one thing at a time to work on, and keeping working on that one thing until it's done completely.
You can't do two things at once, can you? Check your list for possibilities to double up and make your day more efficient. Need to study up for a math exam AND do the laundry? Review your notes at the laundromat and cross them both off your list, keeping up with home commitments and schoolwork.

, The most debilitating distraction has nothing to do with YouTube, Facebook, or the animated couple chattering next to you in the coffee shop; it's got to do with you. Our minds can be like keyed-up lizards bouncing around a rubber room, and it's everything we can do to get them to sit still and do what we say. No matter where you work, what you've got going on today, and what you need to work on, it's you who has to make the decision to do it. Calm your mind and get busy. Nobody's stopping you but you.


Try meditating in the mornings, or doing some deep-breathing exercises to center yourself when you start feeling overwhelmed. People who have trouble concentrating have a tendency to spiral into different levels of distraction, making it worse rather than pulling themselves out of it. Reverse the cycle by learning to anticipate it and chill out.

Evoke isolated sounds.,
Get a Dictaphone and record a sound and play it back after a few seconds.,
Listen to snippets of classical or instrumental music.,
Focus on recalling daily events, such as where you went for a meal.,
Try to imagine friends and loved ones saying your name or a phrase they are known for.,
Read as many notices as you can during the day.,
When you have time during the day try to get into the habit of naming everything in your head in another voice.,
Read familiar childhood books or comics.,
Read your diary back to yourself in someone else’s voice.

",How to Improve Verbal Memory1," The idea is to try to recall sounds that cannot be represented by your internal voice (examples are below). Try to evoke as many sounds as you can. Don’t focus too much on one sound, you must try as many as you can for a little while then go on to another if the sound doesn’t come to you. This will be easiest to do at night, when you are relaxed.


A beeping alarm.
A single note from a familiar or pleasant sounding instrument (i.e. piano).
The noise of a buzzer from a familiar game show.
A crashing noise.
Smashing pans.
A door closing.
A popping sound.
Clicking buttons
Putting a cup down on a table
The high pitch screaming of a child or even a baby screaming.
Belches
Any other interesting sounds you hear throughout the day;
, Try to recall it exactly. Imagine the sound then play it back after a few seconds.

, Try to recall the melody or keep it in your head. Make sure you concentrate on the quality of the notes. Start with a few simple notes at a time and gradually progress to more complicated melodies.

, Try to recall some of the incidental sounds such as the clinking sound of the serving staff placing food, footsteps or the noise of pouring a drink.

, Then move on to people that you do not know well. Finally, attempt to remember voice-overs from adverts and slogans. Avoid voices that are similar to yours. Strong emotions assist recall, so familiar phrases and familiar voices will be the easiest at first. Try to do this with as many varieties of voices as you can. Be sure that you are recalling the actual voice, rather than simply restating what was said in your internal voice. See if you can build a repertoire of voices.


During conversation be attentive to the the voice of a speaker. If you are left out of the conversation for a little, listen in and try to hold a phrase that has been spoken then after a while try to hold another in your mind. A little later try to recall a phrase from earlier on.
Use the dictaphone and record a spoken phrase, play it back after a few seconds. Try to recall it exactly. Imagine the phrase then play it back to yourself.
Turn the television right down till you can just make out what is being said. Then, recall the vague impressions of their voices. You’ll probably find this will be slightly easier than trying to recall someone’s voice cold. Furthermore, it will be easier with repeats of programs you have seen before!

, try to hear them in a familiar voice.

, Use different voices for each object; again lock the internal voice occasionally.

, This should be done for at least quarter of an hour each night. Do not get frustrated if you cannot remember the text word for word—the goal is to evoke sound, not memorize the book. Remember to lock your internal voice now and again.


Read them in a familiar voice. You may occasionally, lose the voice. If this is the case, switch to a more distinctive voice or one that you have heard more recently.
Read a passage, then recall it. After the next passage has been recalled, recall the passage prior to that, then read it out loud again, and continue this until you have a progression of passages.
As you get better, progress to longer and less familiar novels.

Grab the moment.,
In order to get in touch with our inner child, we have to rediscover our childhood.,
We have to take time to enjoy the moments that were special in our youth and pass them unto our heirs.,
Keep the memories close.,
Watch old movies.,
Give 3 hours a week and receive a lifetime of memories.",How to Hone Your Memory Through the Beauty of Art," Everything seems to revolve around our childhood. The problem is that as we age we tend to forget that which shaped and molded us into who we are today. Today society is way too high paced and we just don't seem to have time to reflect on times past. The truth is, we have the time, we fail to grab the moment.


There's nothing wrong with taking a moment for ourselves. In fact, we need to open that can of worms from time to time. Here's how to really hone your memory through the beauty of art. In this article, I'm going to stick to the arts of literature and filmography.;
, I'm talking about sitting down and enjoying a good book or movie. Today the standard isn't the same as it was. Movies aren't nearly as satisfying as they were in the past and most books don't have the same charismatic appeal as they did when we were young.

, Look at your children, then remember your childhood, then try to visualize your parents childhoods. For example, I remember one story my grandma read to me. Before she read the story, she started by telling me, ""this is a story I read to your father, when he was your age.""

, That's the type of moment we need in our lives. It's not only about the love of a story; it's about sharing moments with our lineage. Those moments included the Three Musketeers, Romeo and Juliet, the adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, Moby Dick, and many more. I got to experience stories that gripped my grandparents as children. I got to see a glimpse of their childhood. For that reason alone, literature will always carry over to our future generations.

, The same holds true with movies. Classics like The Wizard of Oz, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Darby O'Gill and the Little People, The Sound of Music, and many more hold our imaginations. They inspire and connect us with times long past. They live on because they touched us in such a way that they can never fade away.


A classic novel or movie is very similar to a baby's blanket. You can wrap yourself up in them. They fill you with love, wonder, and comfort. A simple knowledge and wisdom shared among past and future generations.

, The most fruitful treasure you can ever pass on.

A basic palace could be your bedroom, for example. Larger memory palaces can be based on your house, a cathedral, a walk to the corner store, or your town. The larger or more detailed the real place, the more information you can store in the corresponding mental space.

, If you will need to remember things in a certain order, it is essential that you follow a specific route through your palace, both in the real world and in your mind. Thus, once you’ve decided what your memory palace is, decide how you will travel through it. If you don’t really need to remember things in order, this step is unnecessary, but still useful, as it makes memorizing your palace easier.

, When you use your memory palace you will put individual things to be remembered (a number, a name, or a part of a speech that you will be giving, for example), in specific locations. Thus, you need to identify as many locations as you think you will need. Walk through your structure or along your route and really observe it. If your palace is actually a route, such as your drive to work, the storage locations can be landmarks along the way: your neighbor’s house, a crossroads, a statue, or a skyscraper, for example. If the palace is a structure, you can put things in the different rooms. Within rooms, you can identify smaller locations, such as paintings, pieces of furniture, and so on. The key is to make sure the locations you choose are distinct from each other so that no location can be mistaken for another.

, For your memory palace to be effective, you need to commit it to memory perfectly. The best way to do this is to actually draw out a blueprint (or a map, if the palace is a route) which shows the landmarks or storage locations you have chosen. Try visualizing the palace when you are not there, and then check your mental image against the map to make sure you have remembered every location and put them in the correct order. Picture the landmarks in as much detail as possible: make sure your mental image includes their colors, sizes, smells, and any other defining characteristics.

, Once you have constructed your palace and have it firmly implanted in your mind, you are ready to use it. Put a manageable amount of information in each place. For example, if your palace is your house, and you are trying to remember a speech, you might place the first few sentences on your doormat and the next few in the keyhole of your door. Don’t put too much information in any one place, and if certain things must be kept separate from others, put them in different places. Make sure that you place things along your route in the order in which you need to remember them, if applicable.If you are a beginner, it is not a wise to pick up same kind of objects from different places of your mind palace to put different informations as it may confuse you.

, You don’t necessarily need to put a whole string of words or numbers in a given location in order to be able to remember it, and trying to do so can be unwieldy and counterproductive. Generally, all you need to store in each location is something that will jog your memory, something that will lead you to the actual idea you’re trying to remember. Thus, if you are trying to remember a ship, picture an anchor on your couch. If the ship is the U.S.S. Wisconsin, picture the anchor made out of cheese. Symbols are shorthand and make memories more manageable, but they also can be more effective than picturing the actual thing you are trying to remember.

, The images you put in your palace should, obviously, be as memorable as possible. Generally, images will be more memorable if they are absurd (out of the ordinary) , or if they are attached to some strong emotion or personal experience. The number 124 is not particularly memorable, but an image of a spear shaped like the number 1, going through a swan (which looks like the number 2), and splitting the swan into 4 pieces is. Yes, it’s disturbing, but that’s part of what makes it stick in your mind.

, There are many simpler mnemonics that you can use in combination with the memory palace. As an example, suppose you need to remember a great deal about music composition. As you enter your kitchen, you could see a little boy eating a piece of chocolate fudge, which would evoke the first-letter mnemonic “Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge,"" which would in turn allow you to recall the order of notes on the lines in treble clef (EGBDF).

, Once you have stocked your palace with evocative images, you need to go through it and look at them. The more you explore your palace, the more easily you will recall its contents on demand. In your mind you want to see James Joyce, for example, sitting on your toilet as if he belonged there and was really an integral part of your bathroom décor.

, Once you have memorized the contents of your palace you can recall them simply by mentally walking through it or looking around it. If you need to give a speech, just follow your route in order as you do so. If you need to remember that your girlfriend’s birthday is March 16, simply go into your bedroom and see the soldiers “marching"" on the bed to the tune of the 80s cult classic “Sixteen Candles."" With practice you will be able to start anywhere in your palace or along your route to recall a specific piece of information.

, A memory palace can be reused over and over again if you need only commit things to memory for a short time. Just replace the existing contents with new ones, and you’ll soon remember only the new ones. If you need to remember the contents of your palace for a long time, you can keep that palace as it is and create new ones in which to store other information as needed. If your house contains the phone numbers of everyone you know, you can walk to your workplace if you need to remember the order of a deck of cards.

Make up a silly sentence.,
Sing a song.,
Make up an acronym.",How to Remember the Order of the Planets in Our Solar System1," A mnemonic device is a trick that you can use to help you remember something.Use acrostics,or silly sentences, which start with the first initial of each planet name, to help you remember the order, starting with Mercury and ending with Neptune (Pluto has been changed to a 'dwarf planet' so it doesn't count as an actual planet) (or just until Neptune, if that’s all you need to learn). Some examples are:My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Names
My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine
My Very Educated Mother Just Showed Us Nine
My Very Elderly Mother Just Sat on Uncle Ned
Mom Visits Every Monday, Just Stays Until Noon
My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles;
, Setting the names of the planets to a song may help you remember the order. There are a number of songs that help you recall a basic fact about each planet and help you remember their order. One example is “Planets Song,” which can be downloaded as an audio file from Amazon or iTunes.


Search online for other examples, downloadable music files and videos of other planet songs.

, An acronym is made up of the first initial of each planet’s name.For the planets, an acronym would be: MVEMJSUN. This may be hard to remember until you make the acronym sound like a word by adding necessary vowels here and there. The acronym might sound like “Move-em-jason” if it were spoken out loud.

Gain a working knowledge of the phonetic alphabet and the mechanics of speech.,
Speak a phrase and then imagine saying that phrase whilst concentrating on the sensation of speech.,
Complete these tasks again.",How to Improve Verbal Memory2," This will provide you with the necessary mental framework to recognize and make sense of the motor and touch sensations of verbal articulation.


The mechanics of speech is best presented via study sessions using a series of pictures to present the position of the tongue and mouth, etc., for each sound, which in turn is related back to the study of phonetics. The learning of phonetics and the mechanics of speech is best aided with an illustrated and detailed breakdown of how each sound is made, which can be found in the title ""The Missing Memory Link"" by J Rowan.

, Then, practice this in the reverse order: imagine or evoke a phrase and then say it out loud, all the time concentrating on the sensation of each component. This swapping round of the activities will help you to build a stable and more accurate physical representation of speech.

, However, give yourself a secondary task designed to create interference. This use of a secondary task is intended to inhibit the functioning areas from assisting in verbal representation and potentially drowning out the benefits of the therapy by forcing the under functioning area to assume the full workload.

Listen to an audio recording of yourself saying the planets.,
Write down the planet names.,
Say the names in a chant.",How to Remember the Order of the Planets in Our Solar System2," Many people are auditory learners, meaning that they retain information better when they hear it spoken out loud. Make an audio recording of yourself speaking the planets in order. Repeat it several times in the recording. Listen to this recording over and over., For some people, it helps to write down information in order to lock it into their memories. Writing down the planet names in order over and over can be a useful way to remember the order.It might help to use a different color marker to write each planet’s name. It might help you remember the names if they are associated with a particular color, especially if the colors are in rainbow order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple).

, Saying the names in order over and over is another way to use repetition to remember the order. Chants are usually easier to remember when they are just a few words, and they do get more difficult when you have 8 or 9 planet names. But for some people, this is still an effective memorization method.

Assign each number a rhyming object.,
Associate an image with the numbers’ words.,
Assign planets to each number.,
Associate your image with the planet.,
Review your image sets in your mind.",How to Remember the Order of the Planets in Our Solar System3," Memory pegs are things that information hooks onto inside your brain. Use this method to associate images with the things you need to memorize.Each number will be given a word that represents an object.


For example, 1 will be given “bun,” 2 will be given “shoe,” 3 will be given “tree,” and so on.
This method is particularly useful for a visual learner.

, For each of the words assigned to each number, imagine that object. Imagine a shoe for the number 2. Have a clear image in your mind and always think of the same type of shoe for this number.

, Give each planet a number in the order that they need to be memorized. Mercury will be 1, Venus will be 2, Earth will be 3, and so on.

, Connect your number image (1-bun, 2-shoe, etc.) with your planet name. For example, connect Mercury and bun (1) by imagining a hamburger bun with a thermometer sticking out of it., Go through each image set and link the images together. Go systematically, reviewing them one by one. Give yourself a written test to see how well you remember the image sets. Continue to work on linking the images together.

"

Use the journey method.,
Link the names together in a story.,
Teach the planet order to someone else.,
Give yourself a test.,
Have someone quiz you.",How to Remember the Order of the Planets in Our Solar System4," The journey method involves you mentally moving yourself through a location such as a house. Imagine a large house and assign each planet to a different room. Associate an image with each planet and give them a reason for being in a given room. Mentally visualize going through the rooms in the right order, visiting each planet along the way., The linking method of memorization involves taking the names of the planets and working them into a story that will help you remember the proper order.One such story is this:


“Imagine the hot sun. What do you see coming out of the sun? A tube that contains MERCURY of course. Who gets covered by the Mercury as it falls? The goddess VENUS. What does Venus do to escape from the burning metal? She digs a hole and builds up a pile of EARTH. Who gets upset by the noise made by digging the hole? The little red faced man (MARS is known as the red planet) eating a MARS bar. When he throws the MARS bar, who does it hit? It hits JUPITER the king of the gods. What has Jupiter got on his T-shirt? The letters S, U and N which stand for SATURN, URANUS and NEPTUNE. Who is the little dog following the chap wearing the T-shirt? The little dog looks just like PLUTO.”, When you have to teach information to someone else, you need to know the information pretty well yourself. This can help you with memorization.If you can’t get someone to help you, speak to yourself in a mirror as though you are teaching your reflection.

, See how well you perform by testing yourself as you study the planet names. Try to write down from memory all the planet names. See which ones you get right, which ones are wrong, and which you’ve forgotten altogether. After you study some more, test yourself again.

, Ask a friend or family member to help you study. Recite the names of the planets to them, and they can give you prompts in order to remember.

Recognize disruptions in your daily life.,
Notice a difference in your problem solving abilities.,
Interpret your productivity.,
Recognize if you lose things.,
Keep track of how often you forget things.,
Determine normal memory problems.",How to Evaluate Your Memory1," When your memory changes, it will disrupt your life. You may notice yourself forgetting recently learned facts, forgetting important events, or not remembering dates. This will make your life harder or cause problems in your daily activities.


This may manifest in an increased need to write things down, rely on electronic devices to keep track of things, or have others remind you of important events and dates.
Your family and friends may call attention to these issues if you don’t notice them yourself.;
, When you experience memory problems, you may notice changes in your ability to do every day problem solving.This will likely affect your ability to follow through with a plan, develop solutions to problems, or concentrate on the task at hand


This may manifest as difficulty with paying your monthly bills, trouble playing a favorite game, or difficulty following recipes., When your memory starts to fail, your ability to follow through with your tasks at work and at home will start to diminish due to an inability to remember the things you need to do. At work, you may fall behind on your projects or stop fulfilling your work duties to the best of your abilities. At home, you may fall behind in your responsibilities or forget to take care of certain family tasks.


This can cause problems with your boss and coworkers or cause tension with your family., When your memory starts to go, you may start to lose things more often. You may misplace your keys more often than before, forget where you parked your car when you are out, or find where you left the stuff you use every day.


Doing this every so often is common, but if it becomes a continual problem, it may point to some sort of memory problem., Everyone forgets things from time to time, especially as people age. However, if you notice that it happens more often than before, especially if it is numerous times a week, your memory may be getting worse.


Keep a list of how frequently you forget things so you can evaluate it over time. Write down each time that you forget something that you typically should remember., Every memory lapse you have may not be a sign of memory problems. There are situations where lapses in memory are not a sign of a larger memory problem but are instead caused by situational issues. These situations include:


Starting new medication
Only you are worried about occasional slip-ups, but your family hasn't noticed a change in your memory
You’re overly stressed out"

Create and memorize a room in your head.,
Spend a little time each day revisiting your room.,
Test yourself by making a list of 10 words to remember tomorrow.,
Place each item on the list somewhere in the room.,
Visualize people’s and place names as items.,
Try to remember your whole list the next day.",How to Remember Lists of Words With the Roman Room Trick1," Make it as big and beautiful as you wish. Smaller rooms are easier to remember, but big rooms work just as well.


This can be a temporary room, if you’re using it only for a specific list, or a permanent mental place you can return to any time you need. Having a permanent room will make it easy for you to memorize the space and go into smaller details about its design.
You can use an existing room, like your bedroom or kitchen. This will save you time and make it handier for you to return to it anytime you want to. ;
, As you go back, don’t change details or move items: just memorize everything and familiarize with it as much as possible.


Each time you can get into smaller details about where things are located: for example, you can add furniture, objects, paintings on the wall or decorative plants. This will give you more cues to link your memories to.

, For example, consider the following random list:


shoe
dog
desk
the date 12/09/1990
cow
your grandpa Billy Bob
turkey
$20 you owe your landlady
computer
eggs

, This will create a link (association) with the elements that are already present in the room.


For example, you can add an ugly shoe-patterned wallpaper to the walls, have a barking dog on your couch, put an elaborate desk below the window, write the date in pink neon letters on the frame of a famous painting, put a fat cow in the doorway, have Grandpa Billy Bob eating sloppy Joes on your new carpet, picture a Thanksgiving turkey on the dining room table, have your landlady standing in the middle with a $20-bill in her hand, a broken computer on the floor, and eggs smashed into the door.

, If your list is made up of proper nouns, like the main battles of the Civil War or writers’ names, replace them with words you can picture first, and then place these in your room.For example, if you have to memorize a list of modernist writers for your next exam, like Virginia Woolf, James Joyce and Ezra Pound, you can have: a wolf tearing off your wallpaper, a joystick on the table and a bunch of British pounds scattered on the floor.

, Picture the room again and go through all the details to check how many you’ve memorized so far. The more vivid the associations are, the easier it will be for you to remember the list. For example, writing a date in big pink neon letters on the bottom of the Mona Lisa will give you a better chance of remembering it.
Try to have your items engage actively with something in the room, rather than just dropping them somewhere. For example, placing the dog on the couch might not be enough: visualizing it while it gnaws on the couch cushions and smash them into pieces is much more effective.

Establish a group of things that you cannot ever forget.,
Get a basket or other receptacle where you can leave the things you should always take when you leave home.,In your home or cell phone, and as soon as you get home and retrieve the message, put the item in the basket so it's there waiting for you the next morning.,
Try this memory trick as a check-list when making quick trips: ""Sell M.I.L.K.,

Make a big list and post it prominently by the door where you leave your house.,

Buy a white board and place it next to your preferred exit, next to the other list.,

Count the items.,

Place clocks in strategic locations throughout the house.,

Organize your room and your home.",How to Remember to Take Things with You," This group includes such items as:
Keys to your home, car, or office
Purse or wallet
Money and/or credit card
Identification
Badge for work
Key card for opening doors
Watch
Cell phone
Memory stick
A pen;
, There you can place your wallet, your cell phone, your keys and your calendar or planner. Make it a habit to leave these items (and any others you consider necessary) in the basket so that you can easily take them when it's time to go. If you need to take something special with you on a particular day, i.e. a book you're loaning to a friend, leave yourself a voice mail.,,

Instead of ""Sell,"" bring your Cell-Phone
M for money.
I for Identification card.
L for Lipstick,Lip gloss, List or Lucky penny - whichever you use most.

, Write in big letters so you can quickly review it on your way out., On this board, write the things that vary (extra money for a special payment, picking someone up, etc.). Write things down as soon as you arrive home and review them when you leave., If you must always have your bag, your lunch box, your badge, and your keys when you leave, check to make sure you have four items each time you leave., Many times we forget things because we don't have the time to check. The clocks can help to remind us of our sense of responsibility and return our minds to the real world., Slowly become the sort of organized person who knows where everything is. Even if disorganized people know where everything is, it's more likely that something is out of place in a disorganized room than in an organized one. In an organized room, everything out of place is visible instantly."

Link new information with old information.,
Simplify information.,
Strengthen your brain.",How to Cope With Short Term Memory Loss1," When you get a new type of information, no matter what it is, there needs to be a way for you to associate it with what you know. Linking it with your long term memory is a good way to do it. Locker combinations can be easily memorized. For instance, 3-15-23 could be the number of siblings, graduation year, and Michael Jordan’s jersey number.
Directions work well with linking. North 2 blocks, west 1 blocks could easily be your high school (e.g. Northwest High) and Blackjack.;
, Try breaking down information to the smallest digestible piece. When that doesn’t work, break it down even further. If some step begins with grasping a handle and squeezing, perhaps starting the memorization process with simply putting a hand on the item would work.Shorten sentences. For instance, the first line in the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet is, “But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?” That could be shortened to, “Soft light yonder window breaks.”
Break up larger pieces into smaller pieces. The same line from Romeo and Juliet could be broken down into four 2-word portions: “But soft”, “what light”, “through yonder”, and “window breaks”.

, Stimulate your brain with crosswords or Sudoku. Try memorizing items for no real reason other than to challenge yourself. The key is to do enough new things so you are engaging your brain and keeping it in shape. This will help you absorb new information when it’s provided."

Notice changes in your mood.,
Determine if you changed your actions.,
Ask your family or friends if your actions have changed.,
Notice a change in other’s behavior.,
Recognize trouble with making decisions.",How to Evaluate Your Memory2," If you are having memory problems, you may become annoyed or angry over time. This is due to your inability to remember every day things or perform everyday activities. This causes frustrations will build up over time, which causes a change in your overall mood.


You may not even notice the change in your mood. Other people may point out your change in mood or how you are acting towards others., When you are beginning to suffer from memory problems, you may have changed your normal routine to compensate for your memory deficiencies.


This can include making detailed lists of things you need to do, avoiding calling people because you have a hard time remembering what was said, or eating out more because it is harder to follow or remember recipes., If you want to evaluate your memory, you may need to ask your friends or family if they have noticed changes in your memory or your actions. Those around you may be able to tell before you notice it yourself. This may include:


Telling stories over and over again
Asking the same questions multiple times
Relying on them to remember things for your schedule, The way others act towards you can help you determine if your memory has changed. Your friends and family may start taking over conversations if you forget something or are repeating yourself, may take over tasks you’re used to doing by yourself, or covering for you if you forget to do things.


This may be subtle or progress over time., If your memory is changing, you may find yourself having trouble making decisions. This is because you can’t remember each of the choices or you may have trouble distinguishing between different solutions or decisions.


This can be small or large decisions, ranging from choosing what to wear in the morning to making a change in your job."
"
Make your own memory test.,
Take an online memory test.,
Engage in memory training.,
Track changes over time.,
See your doctor.",How to Evaluate Your Memory3," Evaluating your memory requires you to test it. These can be visual based, recall centered, or spatial related. Each of these will help you focus on different parts of your memory to help determine how it is. You can make these tests at home for yourself, such as:


Memorize a tray of 10 to 20 items for one minute then write down as many of the items as you can remember.
Look over a collection of items, have a friend remove an object or two while you aren’t looking, then determine what is missing.
Learn flashcards with certain words or phrases and then try to remember them without looking., A great way to evaluate your memory is to take a free memory test online. There are many free memory tests online that can help you evaluate how good your memory is. Often these will ask you a series of questions that are meant to help test both your short term and long term memory.


You can also take tests specifically to evaluate either part of your memory.
Be careful of the tests you trust online. There are many tests online that are not appropriate or backed up by any medical expertise. Instead, look for tests given out by hospitals, universities, or other respected organizations.For example, you can take the SAGE test given by Ohio State University, which combines simple questions, spatial reasoning, and other baseline questions to determine the current state of your memory. Once you take it, you can take it to your doctor for help with interpreting how to read your results., You can train your brain to increase or strengthen your memory. This may help your brain with its natural ability to compensate for memory loss or issues. These methods include brain strengthening:


Computer games or software
Brain teaser games
Cognitive behavior therapy aimed at memory, In order to determine if your memory is changing or getting worse, you should create a baseline for your memory the way it is now and evaluate if it changes over time. This will help you determine how your memory is changing and in which ways.You can use a memory test and take it a month or two apart, then compare the results. If the your results vary greatly, you may have a memory problem.

, If you notice any change in your memory, you should see your doctor as soon as you can. Early detection is the best way to reverse or slow down any memory problems as soon as you can. Your doctor will be able to do a more in depth analysis of your memory and help you decide the best course of action to take.


Make sure you make note of the types of changes your memory has undergone and how it has impacted your life. This includes keeping track of how often your memory fails, how much it has impacted your life, and any other changes you’ve noticed in your health."
"
Sharpen your mind.,
Interact with other people.,
Use mnemonics.,
Laugh easily and often.,
Try ""chunking"" information.",How to Overcome Short Term Memory Loss2," Your brain responds to activity and stimulation much like your muscles do—it gets stronger with regular exercise. When you learn how to do new things, your brain forms new neural pathways, helping it to grow and make connections to other pathways.


Take up a hobby you've always wanted to try, learn a new musical instrument, or enroll in a college or night class. This gives you longer-term goals that engage your brain on a regular basis, with measurable outcomes.
More immediate activities such as a crossword or sudoku puzzles, or reading up on something you know nothing about stimulate your mind as much as doing new things. These tasks might seem difficult at first, and that's good––challenging means your brain is being forced to work.

, Unlike a hobby, or a crossword puzzle, or even learning new things, relationships stimulate your brain because they're unpredictable and always challenging, forcing you to stay alert and engaged.


Harvard School of Public Health researchers found evidence that elderly people who have an active social life may have a slower rate of memory decline than those who are isolated. In fact, they've found that not only do socially-connected people have slower memory loss, they also have a slower mortality rate. So get out there and meet people!

, This is a great tool for everybody to master, not just for people who suffer from short-term memory loss. Mnemonics is the technique of attaching a word, phrase, or image to an object. This skill can be very powerful, and the memorization will stick in your brain like super glue.


Perhaps you've never heard of mnemonics, but ask yourself: ""Self, how many days are in September?"" Chances are, the first thing that popped into your mind was ""30 days hath September.""
If you meet a woman named Zoe, rhyme a feature on her face with her name. It doesn't even have to make sense. ""Zoe, eyes aglow-y,"" for example.
Make yourself laugh with your mnemonic. Make your memory aid a rude limerick, as in ""The new boss's name is Vig Ronson, who's rumored to have a...,"" etc. (Fill in the blanks—–it's good for your memory!)

, Laughter engages multiple areas of the brain, and listening to jokes while you try to figure out the punchlines will help boost overall learning and creativity.


Psychologist Daniel Goleman writes in his book Emotional Intelligence, that ""laughter seems to help people think more broadly and associate more freely."" It loosens you up, so to speak.
So... a 300-pound gorilla walks into a bar, sits wherever he wants, and orders a drink. The bartender gives him the drink, and figuring he's just a stupid gorilla, says ""that'll be 50 bucks."" The gorilla scratches himself (gorillas do that) then hands the bartender two twenties and a ten dollar note. The bartender, impressed by the gorilla's math says, ""Say, we don't get many gorillas in here."" The gorilla scratches himself again and says, ""For 50 bucks a drink, I'm not surprised.""

, If you need to memorize something important and you're finding it difficult to do so, separate the information into smaller groups. The most common example of chunking is phone numbers––instead of trying to remember one 10-digit number, most people find it easier to remember two 3-digit numbers and one 4-digit number, like 123-456-7890. Try this technique with grocery lists, birthdays, names or other things you want to remember.

Eat brain food.,
Exercise.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Keep a journal.",How to Overcome Short Term Memory Loss3," Unless you're a zombie, this means eating foods that will help your brain function well.


Foods with omega-3 fatty acids are recognized as very good for your mental acuity.You've probably heard a lot about fish being ""brain food,"" and it's true! Cold-water fish like salmon, tuna, trout, herring, and sardines are all rich in omega-3s, and can even lower your risk of developing Alzheimer's. Don't like fish? Many foods are including omega-3 supplements in them, like eggs and organic milk. Natural foods such as soybeans, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and flaxseed (oil and seeds) all are rich in omega-3s––just be sure to consume every food type fresh to avoid rancidity.
Eat your fruits and vegetables regularly. Foods with antioxidants will protect your brain cells (and the rest of your body) from damage by free radicals. Broccoli, romaine lettuce, spinach, and chard are all great veggies to munch on, and they taste great. From the fruit aisle, pick up some mangoes, melons, and apricots. When's dinner?
While you're enjoying dinner, enjoy a glass of red wine. Moderate alcohol consumption has been shown as a factor in improved memory, and it also contains antioxidants and resveratrol, a polyphenol that may help protect the lining of blood vessels and increase levels of good cholesterol.Green tea also contains free-radical-fighting polyphenols.Limit your intake of fatty, processed foods or refined sugary treats. They're fattening, tooth-rotting, trans-fatty, nutritionally deprived foods that do battle in your body rather than support it. If you keep eating these foods, when you get dentures you'll probably forget where you put them!

, Physical activity can help increase blood flow to your brain, improving function. Do a short series of stretches as soon as you get out of bed in the morning to help your mind wake up. If you have the time, aim for 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise three or four times a week, such as brisk walking, cycling, jogging or dancing.

, An adequate amount of shut-eye each night will help your brain perform at its best the next day. Aim for seven to nine uninterrupted hours (the precise amount is dependent on your body's own personal need, which varies from person to person). Importantly, get out of bed as soon as you feel well-rested, at the same time every day––the routine establishes a healthful, regular pattern. If possible, establish a solid routine in which you go to sleep at the same time every night.

, If you struggle to remember what happened during the previous day, start keeping a journal. Jot down important items of information or other things you'd like to remember, even food intake, people whom you said you'd catch up with again and books read. Review as necessary.

"

Consult a doctor.,
Set up a daily routine.,
Enlist the help of a trusted friend.",How to Overcome Short Term Memory Loss4," If your memory loss is bad enough that it severely inhibits your everyday life, visit a general practitioner. He or she can evaluate your symptoms and refer you to an appropriate neurologist, immunologist or other specialist to treat your condition. It is important to set your mind at ease about the possibility of underlying medical conditions causing the memory loss, otherwise you risk adding anxiety to your frustration.

, While a daily routine won't improve your short term memory, it will help you overcome some of the difficulties you experience as a result of short term memory loss and lessen the frustration. The security of your routine will let you focus on the fun parts of improving your memory, not on stressful parts of losing it.


If you regularly misplace your eyeglasses or car keys, try putting them in the same exact place every day, without fail. Create special spots for all items that tend to go missing and make an effort to always put the items in that spot.
If you struggle to remember whether you've eaten or taken your medication, stick to designated mealtimes and purchase a days-of-the-week pill container that you stock up every Sunday night. Set alarms on your phone, computer or clock to remind you.
Write down your routine so you won't forget it. Post it somewhere prominent, like on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator, or enter it into your calendar app with reminders or on a wall calendar in a place you pass often.
Write down every appointment or social engagement as soon as you make it. Program it into the calendar on your phone, or carry a small paper day-planner with you. In fact, doing both is ideal, as the act of writing helps to solidify the memory.

, Explain your problem, and that you'd appreciate occasionally having his or her help attending social engagements. This person can help you remember appointments, directions, your wallet, names and other things that help smooth out your social interactions.

Revisit your Roman Room regularly.,
Add more details to your room if you want to expand it.,
Make as many rooms as you want to!",How to Remember Lists of Words With the Roman Room Trick2," Do this until you know it like the back of your hand. This will make any addition much more noticeable, as if somebody made a drastic change to own your bedroom.


This doesn’t take a lot of time: just devote a little time each day to this exercise when your mind is clear (like, during a bus journey or a session at the gym).

, The room doesn’t have to get bigger: just visualize smaller elements in it, and this will give you more things to associate your memory lists with. For example, furniture can have drawers you can open and put more stuff in. There can be appliances and decorative objects all around, patterned curtains and rugs on the floor.

, This is another way to extend the mental space and expand the amount of information you can potentially store in it. This will also give you different rooms that you associate with different items.


In this case, your landlady can be in the kitchen while the dog is playing in the bathroom.
The extension can go on indefinitely and make your room as big as a palace or town. "

Make a list of key points you want to memorize for your presentation.,
Get to know the room.,
Link your key points to existing items.,
Rehearse on location.,
Rehearse elsewhere.,
Look for your cues on presentation day.",How to Remember Lists of Words With the Roman Room Trick3," Even in this case, make them as visual as possible: proper nouns and abstract ideas should be turned into physical objects., Once you know where the presentation will take place, visit the room in advance and try to notice as many details as possible. If it’s a room you already know well, you can just revisit it mentally. However, going there in person will give you an opportunity to focus on extra details you’d never noticed before.

, However, make sure you associate each key point to items that won’t be removed on the day of the presentation.


If there’s a used coffee cup on a desk, don’t bother taking note of it. It will certainly be trashed before your presentation day.
It’s better to go clockwise as you link your key points to each item. This will make it quicker for you to find the next cue as you present., If you have a chance, it’s always better to practice your presentations a couple of times in the actual room. If you can’t do it, just memorize the room on your first visit and then picture it when you’re practicing.

, Even if you have full access to the room, practicing in a different location is always a good exercise. You never know what might happen on the day of the presentation: having a mental picture of it is safe if there are any last-minute changes. For example, if the room is moved, you can use your mental picture of the previous room as a Roman Room. Picture it in your mind as you present and you’ll find all your items there, instead of in the room where you’ve been moved.

, As you deliver your presentation, look for the cues in the room that you've linked with your key points.


Memorizing a presentation will impress your audience and make your performance more engaging.
Remember it’s always safer to still have some notes with you, in case your memory fails you.

Repeat everything.,
Use mnemonics.,
Convert information into chunks.",How to Cope With Short Term Memory Loss2," Immediately after you speak or hear a nugget of information, repeat it. After that, repeat it again. The more you repeat it, the more likely you are to remember it.When introduced to someone, immediately say their name in multiple replies. “Nice to meet you, John. What do you do for a living, John?”
As you’re walking out the door, “I’m going to get gas and change the oil. I’m going to get gas and change the oil.”
When you hear the total bill at restaurant, “The total is $19.95. The total is $19.95.”

, A mnemonic is simply a method you can develop to improve memory. The more detailed or bizarre the mnemonic, the more likely you are to remember it. Choose a method that works best with what you remember.


Names or word mnemonics work well. FANBOYS works for the primary conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), and HOMES gives you the great lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).
Linking mnemonics use a more story-like approach. If you need eggs, milk, butter, and peppers at the grocery store, imagine yourself doing chores on the farm. Get the eggs from the coop, then milk the cow, churn the butter, and harvest the garden. Image mnemonics is simply substituting imagery for words in your mind. If you can’t remember if it’s supposed to be cream of wheat, cream of celery, or cream of mushroom, the picture of a COW (Cream Of Wheat) would help., By practicing “chunking,” you’re converting information into palatable pieces that are easier to store. It’s the common basis for why phone numbers and social security numbers are so easy to remember. We are trained for as long as we can remember to chunk each number into its respective groups (e.g. Phone numbers are 3-3-4, and SSNs are 3-2-4)."
"
Organize everything.,
Follow a routine.,
Set alarms.",How to Cope With Short Term Memory Loss3," No matter the method, you need to record every single nugget of information you can. There needs to be a database of clues that can be pieced together to tell the entire story of what you’ve forgotten. Jot down dates, medicine you have to take, dates of significance, details about everything.


Try organization via timeline. If you have an lunch appointment at 11:00am, try writing into your calendar or planner the wake up time, preparation time, driving time, the actual meeting time, and then the drive back. Use a diary. Sometimes the quick notes we jot down aren’t enough to fill in all the information. A more detail-oriented diary could help with the missing pieces.Write items as you’re doing or trying to remember them. Don’t wait until you’re finished and try to recollect everything. Make it part of your every-day life to write while you do things. If it helps, use a tape recorder. , A routine serves as a starting point for all memories. It helps you remember everything from the mundane to the complex by anchoring to something that doesn’t require memory. It accelerates other memories. To remember to take your pills every morning, leave a reminder by putting them on top of your deodorant bottle. Deodorant is an every-day routine, and the pills will stick out like a sore thumb. Put your keys, wallet, and change in your hat every day when you get home. That way the items are there without worrying about losing them. , For every date and obligation you have, set alarms to remind you. Ideally, this works best on a phone or a computer. Just set up the reminder in the calendar or app you like best, and let the program do the hard work. If you don’t have a phone or computer nearby, try using an egg-timer. Write a note beside the egg-timer and then set it for the amount of time you need.
Quick items work well on a watch as well. Just set a phone alarm for the desired time and you can rely on it for a single reminder.

Conduct a self-evaluation.,
Consider your age.,
Go to a doctor.",How to Cope With Short Term Memory Loss4," There are a variety of occurrences that can result in, or accelerate, memory loss. Check your physical, psychological, and general mental makeup in order to determine if anything is exacerbating your memory loss issues.Psychological problems can cause memory loss. Stress or depression are very common causes for emotional trauma. The emotional trauma makes it harder to think about other things and recall them.
Head injuries are common causes for memory loss. If consciousness is lost, it’s possible the memories may take quite some time to come back.
Much like the psychological problems of stress and depression, sleep deprivation can bring about memory loss.

, Aging and memory loss go hand in hand. Some types of information may be more difficult to remember than others. It’s very possible the same information will be easily recalled the following day. Consult with your physician if you start to show any of the following signs of dementia. Repeating the same question over and over again
Confusing common words that result in confusing sentences
Misplacing things in odd locations, like keys in a refrigerator, There are a variety of reasons for memory loss that cannot be determined without seeing a physician of some kind. Various medications like sleeping pills, antidepressants, and pain medications affect memory. There are several other medically related possibilities for memory loss. If you have an infection that is related to the lining of the brain, that can obviously affect memory. Some such infections may be related to syphilis, tuberculosis, and herpes.
Problems with the thyroid can lead to memory issues. Whether your thyroid is underactive or overactive, the chemical imbalance could be the cause of memory loss.
Check your vitamin levels. Both vitamin B1 and B12 are linked to memory. Lower B1 could be related to alcohol or drug use. If you are deficient, have the doctor give you pills or an injection to alleviate the problem.

Understand the importance of using another person's name.,
Be aware that the most common reason for not remembering names is actually very simple.,
Ask for the name again if you don't hear it correctly the first time.,
Use repetition.,
Make associations with the person and other people you know.,
Associate the name with objects or animals.,
Study the person's face or other distinctive features.,
Ask a friend or partner to help you.,
Trust yourself.,
Write it down.,
Consider asking.",How to Remember a Person's Name," Sometimes it can help to see the results of using a name rather than focusing purely on your nervousness, skittish memory, or simple lack of willpower to remember another's name. William Shakespeare once said: ""There is no sound so sweet as the sound of one's own name"" and he was spot on – using another person's name creates a connection and is a form of acknowledging them as being special and valued.It makes the encounter meaningful for the other person (and for you too) and it helps them to feel good that you have acknowledged them. Ultimately, remembering a person's name is about being polite and considerate; moreover, first impressions count considerably and you may not get another chance to make a solid and likable impression.


Bear in mind how you feel when someone forgets your name; nobody likes to be forgotten!;
, It is usually because you're not actively listening, or not paying adequate attention.Much of this can stem from nerves and worry about the kind of impression you're making on the other person.The answer is to give the person your full attention when you're introduced to them, and to focus on them, not on yourself. If one of the reasons that you find it hard to remember another person's name is because you're nervous and so busy worrying about a topic of conversation, then you'll probably benefit from spending a brief but useful time learning about how to make small talk so that you can be truly ""present"" when introduced to others and can hear their names distinctly. wikiHow has some excellent choices for you to begin with:


How to Make Small Talk
How to Find Things to Talk About
How to Talk to Someone You've Never Met
How to Be Yourself
How to Stop Talking About Yourself
How to Listen

How to Be Confident.

, Nobody expects you to make a large pretense of knowing the other person's name if you didn't actually hear it when it was first said. Seize the moment though – be sure to say that you ""didn't catch"" the name, or something similar, straight away. This clarifies that the name needs to be said again, perhaps more clearly or slowly. Listen well this second time! This is a good trick to use if you were overwhelmed by nerves, noise, movement, or whatever else has distracted you; you will usually be aware that a name has been stated and you should use that awareness to immediately apologize for not hearing and asking for the name again.


If you do not understand how to say the person's name, this is the perfect opportunity to ask the person to repeat it and then repeat it out loud yourself.
If the name is unusual, ask the person to spell it, if that doesn't annoy them, and perhaps even ask where it originated from.Be prepared to do the same if your own name is unusual and hard to spell or say.
If appropriate, exchange business cards with the person, and have a good look at the name.

, Repeat the person's name when you're introduced, such as: ""Pleased to meet you Verity"". Do this slowly rather than quickly, to make it clear and use the pause in the introduction to also smile and show that you're genuinely pleased to meet this new person.Use their name early on in the conversation, such as in ends of your statements or questions. For example, say ""I was wondering how you found the dinner this evening, Verity?"". Repetition (use of the name at least three times) will help you remember, as the look and sound of the name will make its way into your memory.


Say the person's name at least ten times in your own head when you're informed of it.
Example of some things to say with the person's name involved: ""What are you planning to do next year, Theresa?"", ""How did you feel about that, Fred?"", ""It was a pleasure meeting you, Elisa"". (Using it when you say goodbye is an excellent way of cementing the name in your mind for future meet-ups.)

, Create a mental picture of this new person standing beside somebody else you already know well with the same name, or a similar name (this can even be celebrities!). When you need to remember the new person's name again, you can usually remember the mental picture you had of this person, and who they were standing with. An example: ""Mark is friends with Matt"", ""Hilda looks like Jennifer Aniston"".


It's also easier if the new person you meet, already knows some of your friends. This way, you can ask your friend, but you will also be more likely to remember the name if you think of your friend too.

, There are several methods that you can employ here, depending on what works best for you:


Find an animal or object or alike with the same letter as the person. Some examples: ""Kimberly-Kitten"", ""Billy-Board"".
If it's a name that can naturally be associated with something visual, then make use of this connection.For example, names like House, Gold, Wood, Briar, Paris, Bree, etc., can all be linked to visual images in your mind to help you recall the name.
Associate the name with a word that it rhymes with, for example, ""Terry Berry"".
Associate the name with something of similar meaning, for example, ""Cliff-Mountain"".
Associate the name with what it sounds like, such as Mr Siegel becoming Mr Seagull.Substitute words or even famous people for names that you can't associate with visual images. For example, Alyssa Freiburg could become ""Alyssa Milano fries burgers"" for your memory's sake!
Obviously, keep these associations to yourself, as the person might feel offended by what they might see as a comparison rather than an association!

, Naturally, be discreet, but try to examine the person's face, hair, or other characteristics when you're talking together. Try to find something easy to remember about them, such as jagged teeth, bushy eyebrows, deep wrinkles, suave dressing, or anything else unusual or distinguishing. Try to associate the name with this feature, so that you will remember next time. An example: ""Jenny with the crooked smile.""


Try to select the most outstanding feature and attach the name to that.

, If you're really not getting the name thing down at all, ask your partner or some trusted friends to help you out. You can explain to them that you still can't remember names very well and would appreciate them coming to the rescue if you appear uncomfortable or use a keyword (choose one between yourselves in advance) that indicates you're floundering for a name.Have them either introduce themselves immediately, or state the name of the person straight out in conversation if they already know it. Make sure you're listening!


You can discreetly ask someone you know to help you during the conversation; just be careful to do this to the side, and discreetly. A friend or partner could also tell you the person's name, before you meet them, so that you will get more time to think about the name, thus saving it in your memory.
Some examples: ""Did you know Rick is a painter?"" or ""Sarah and I also discussed this yesterday"".

, It's easy to accept that you are bad at remembering names, but don't go around thinking that about yourself! You're not ""Ben, the guy who can't remember names"", and you shouldn't tell that to everyone you meet because in doing so you're effectively telling your own mind that it's hopeless on this count and letting other people know that you really can't be bothered trying, so they're less likely to be sympathetic with you. Commit to improving yourself, tell yourself that you can be good at remembering names.


Think about how painful it is when someone else jumps in and says ""I'm not good at remembering names"" just when the same thought is on the tip of your tongue. Does that leave you feeling annoyed that they announced their disinterest in remembering your name first? It should be a wake-up call that both of you are not trying hard enough, so show that other person up by deliberately remembering their name!

, While you're practicing at becoming better at remembering names, you could keep a little notebook with you (or you could use your smart phone or other phone if it accepts notes). When you talk to someone new, write their name down in your notebook. Do this immediately after you've finished talking, and you might even like to add some notes about the person's looks and personality, and where you met, in what month, etc. This way, you can look through your notes every day or week, and try to remember each entry. Example for note: ""John, met him at the office in May. Tall, lean guy with glasses. Was a little condescending.""


Use apps like Nameorize or Namerick for iPhone/Android to write down the names of new people you meet.
Don't write anything down when you're talking to them or in their presence. Wait until you are done talking, then go somewhere discrete and write a fast entry down in your notebook. It is worth doing though, as people will appreciate you taking the trouble to remember their name.

, Finally, if all else fails, own up to having forgotten the other person's name, as politely as you can. Say something like: ""I'm terribly sorry, but I've forgotten your name. Would you mind telling me what it is again?"" Smile and don't go into copious details or apologize too much; just treat it lightly and get on with it. The likelihood is that you won't forget this person's name again in a hurry!

Write a one-time pad.,
Give one copy to your agent, and keep the other.

",How to Write an Unbreakable Code1," You will need this to encrypt your messages. A one-time pad is a pad of paper with a random sequence of letters written on it. You will need two exact copies - one for yourself, one for your agent (the person receiving the message). Lets' say our one-time pad is abgsdpeycnghf.;

Draw on a piece of paper the letters of the alphabet.,
Under each letter for row #1 put the number it is for the alphabet.,
Now beside each number from 1 to 9 put a small 1 beside it.,
For row #2, put the numbers from 10 to 18 under each letter.,
Now beside each number from row two, put a small two beside it.,
Put the numbers from 19 to 26 under the remaining letters.

Now that you have mastered the simple code, go out and test your friends!

",How to Write a Confusing Code," On the first row put A through I, on the second row put J through R and on the third row put S to Z. Make sure to leave a minimum of two lines in between each row.;
, (Example: A=1, I=9)

, Each of those ones now represents which row it is from. The one means that the number is from row one.

, You should now have the 10 under the J and the 18 under the R and so on.

, The 2 now represents that those numbers come from row 2.

,, This will represent that those numbers are from row 3.

, Make sure you do this for ROW 1 ONLY and that you copy the large and small numbers fully.

, So for J, you would do 1 + 0=. So J=1 with a small number two to its left.


Keep doing this for row two and once you are done you MUST make sure that R=9 with a small two to its left. (R=9 because R=18 and 1+8=9)

Draw a crosshatch grid and an X.,
Write two letters of the alphabet in each space.,
Put a dot in each space to indicate the right letter.,
Rewrite your code in a list.,
Practice writing in it.",How to Write in Pigpen Code1," The crosshatch should look like a number sign (""#"") or tic-tac-toe board; it will have two horizontal lines crossed by two vertical lines. There should not be any lines on the outside of the crosshatch. The crosshatch grid will have nine spaces while the X grid will have four. Both the crosshatch and the X should be large enough to fit two letters in each space.;
, Fill each box and corner of the grids with two letters from the alphabet. The lines immediately surrounding these letters will form the shape of the symbol for each letter.


Each symbol from the crosshatch grid should be shaped like a closed, two-sided or three-sided rectangle. Each symbol from the X grid should be shaped like a “V”, “<”, “>”, or “^”.For example, if the letter ""A"" is in the top left hand corner of the crosshatch, it will be represented by the “_|” shape. If the letter ""U"" is in the left corner of the X, it will be represented by a “>” shape.

, The dots are called “pigs,” giving the code its name.The pig indicates which letter in the grid is the letter that corresponds to the written symbol. No dot means the left letter, while a dot means the right one.


In a grid where A and B are in the top left hand corner, _| is an A whereas _.| is a B.

, Once you have assigned letters to boxes and dots, it may help to rewrite your code in a list where you clearly assign each letter to its respective shape. This will be your key. Hold on to this. Share it only with those you are entrusting with your code.


Once you have written your code into a new list, destroy the original key with the grids. If someone discovers your key, they can decipher your writing!

, The best way to memorize your code is to start writing in it. Try writing a letter to your friend or copy a passage out of a newspaper or book. Replace each letter in your sentence with its corresponding symbol.


You may need to reference your key at the beginning. As you continue, you will find that you will start memorizing your code.

Choose your message.,
Translate the first segment of you message.,
Encode your next segment.,
Continue taking segments three letters at a time.,
Maintain punctuation.,
Practice by writing in Tri Code regularly.",How to Write in Tri Code2," Before you can translate your message into Tri Code, you'll first need to come up with a message. For the purpose of providing a guided example, the message ""Welcome to the jungle"" will be translated into Tri Code.


While you're still getting the hang of writing in Tri Code, you may want to start with shorter messages. As you become more practiced, longer messages will become easier.

, In Tri Code, the letters of your message will be broken up into groups of three letter segments written in reverse. In the guided example, ""Wel"" are the first three letters, therefore, the first segment is ""Lew.""Generally, each segment is separated by a space. This further distances same-word letters from each other, making it more difficult for others to see the pattern of your Tri Code cipher.
In the beginning, it's likely you'll need to write down your translated message so you don't forget it. When Tri Code is more familiar, you may be able to do this translation in your head.

, The next segment begins where your first left off. Take the next three letters and write them in reverse as a set of three. For the guided example, this would be ""moc."" At this point, your ciphered message should now read ""Lew moc.""

, In many cases, words won't perfectly divide into three letter segments. When this happens, take the remaining letter(s) and complete your three letter segment with letters from the next word, then write it in reverse.For example, the 'e' at the end of ""welcome"" will combine with the next two letters of the following word, ""to"" to create the segment ""eto."" This is then written in reverse to get the Tri Code ""ote.""
At this point, you should have three segments translated into Tri Code, giving you the partially translated message, ""Lew moc ote.""

, The Tri Code cipher is only intended to be applied to letters, so any punctuation, like apostrophes, should be kept with the letter it punctuates. So, for a sentence like ""What's that?"" will become either ""Ahw ts't tah?"" or ""Ahw t'st tah?""


Whether you put apostrophes before the letter they punctuate or after is a matter of preference. However, to prevent confusion, you may want to stick to one or the other.

, Like any new writing system, Tri Code will take some practice before it comes easily. As you practice, the time it takes you to write in Tri Code should decrease. Now that you can write in Tri Code, you can practice reading it.

"
"
Recognize the need for practice.For you to read Tri Code without having to puzzle at it or write it out in English, you'll need to practice deciphering it.,
Find a practice partner.,
Read small sections and increase length gradually.,
Take breaks to prevent mental fatigue.",How to Write in Tri Code3," Writing and reading use different parts of your brain. Just because you can write Tri Code well doesn't mean you can read it well., You'll already know the meaning of messages you write yourself, so a practice partner is necessary to improve your Tri Code reading. This way, you'll have no idea what the message is and will have to decode it completely to find out.


You might be able to find practice partners at a local or school cryptography club, or online through cryptography websites.
If you have difficulty finding a practice partner, you might be able to find Tri Code messages from amateur cryptologists online.

, A page completely full of Tri Code can be overwhelming and lead to you getting discouraged. Start with short messages and, as reading becomes easier, increase the length of your messages little by little.Eventually, you should be able to read even large portions of Tri Code without difficulty.


You can be more consistent with your practice by setting clear daily and weekly goals. For example, an early goal might be writing three short sentences daily in Tri Code. A more advanced goal might be something like writing a full journal entry in code.

, When you brain has to do something new or challenging, it takes a lot of mental energy. Practicing Tri Code too often can lead you to feel fatigued or mentally exhausted. If you start feeling worn out, give your brain a rest day to recharge.Doing enjoyable activities, like playing games and reading books, can also help your brain to relax.

Determine the order of your ciphers.,
Transfer your message completely into Tri Code.,
Use the Caesar Cipher.,
Swap the order of your ciphering.",How to Write in Tri Code4," Tri Roman is a combination of two simple ciphers: Tri Code and the Caesar Cipher. Depending on your preference, you can apply the Tri Code transformation first and then the Caesar Cipher, or vice versa.


Generally, when applying a cipher to encode a message, you should apply the cipher completely to the entire message before applying a new cipher.

, Just as you would normally, take letters in segments of three from the start of your message to its end, then write each segment in reverse. Since you'll be using two ciphers, it's best to write down these transformations to prevent mistakes.


For the purpose of providing a guided example for Tri Roman, the phrase, ""Caesar's a genius"" will be used. In Tri Code, this would be, ""Eac ras ga's ine su.""

, Now that your message is in Tri Code, you can move on to your next cipher. Caesar Cipher, also called a shift cipher, replaces letters in your message with a new letter a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet. Imagine the alphabet from A - Z laid out before you, from left to right. A left shift of three, then, would replace D's in your original message with an B's, J's with H's, and so on.You can choose to shift either to the left or right as many positions as you desire. If you reach the beginning of the alphabet, continue shifting from the end and vice versa. Therefore, with left shift three A becomes Y, and with right shift three Z becomes B.
Basic shift ciphers should only shift letters in a single direction. When using the Caesar Cipher, you should never shift both left and right at the same time.
Using a Caesar Cipher with a left shift of three on the Tri Coded message ""Eac ras ga's ine su"" (Caesar's a genius) gives you the Tri Roman coded message ""Cya pyq ey'q glc qs."", You may find it easiest to write out messages in Tri Code before applying the Caesar Cipher. Alternatively, you may have an easier time doing Caesar Cipher first, and then Tri Code. Experiment with both ways to find what works best for you. An example of Tri Roman code with the Caesar Cipher first, then Tri code, with a left shift of three, would look like:


Caesar's a genius → Aycqyp'q y eclgsq (Caesar Cipher) → Cya pyq ey'q glc qs (Tri Code)

Craft your message normally.,
Write your message backwards.,
Insert a letter and number between each backward letter.,
Flip your letters.",How to Write in Code2," Before you start to write in code, you'll need to know what your message is going to be. Depending on how much secrecy you want in your coding, you may not want to share your information with anyone around you. This means that you'll have to be careful that no one surrounding your desk will see your paper, as the code will quickly be broken.


If you don't think that you can write your message without it being seen, you can try to visualize it in your head instead. While this can be more difficult, it's best not to be found out by those around you, or your teacher.

, This is one of the easiest codes to begin with, especially if you haven't shared coded messages with anyone before.Take your initial message and write it backward, one letter at a time. Start at the bottom right hand corner of the page, so you're moving to the left and up, rather than down and right, like you would normally write. When you're finished with the message, write your punctuation at the end. This will dictate where your message begins and ends.


Make sure that you're separating each word in your message, even though they look a little funky and abnormal. If your letters blend together, then the message will be fairly unreadable.

, If you can without arousing suspicion, write your message on a piece of paper. Proceed to write your message backward, starting from the bottom-right corner of the page and moving to the upper-left. With each letter that you write, insert any number and letter between the letters of your code.


There's no exact science to the letters and numbers that you choose, so don't overthink it. ""Hello how are you?"" would be: ""ua3og5ym9 e8lr1sa5h wr3of2ha7 of8lq2lc7ed2ho2"".

, Another fun strategy in writing code is flipping your letters in reverse, so you're left with a strange looking, non-English code. You might want to practice this one before trying it in class. Write a letter in regular handwriting and study its form. You'll start from the right side of the page and move to the left, writing with your left hand. Each letter will be flipped in its form, so you'll be writing backwards while also drawing the shape of the letter in reverse.


After you've written your message, hold it up to a mirror. You will see it written in normal English. This is a fairly advanced code and may take some time to master.
If you're left handed, this one might be a bit more difficult to learn, but you can still try writing from right to left and mirroring the letters.

Make a list of the alphabet.,
Correlate each letter with its opposite in alphabetical order.,
Compose your message using your reverse alphabet.,
Learn the half-reversed alphabet.This method, while fairly similar to the reverse alphabet, can save you time in both coding and decoding.",How to Write in Code3," Start your coding by writing out the entire alphabet neatly, giving ample space to write directly below it. You'll be organizing your codes on a single sheet of paper, so you don't want to run out of room. Your alphabet should fit into one uniform row.

, Go through the alphabet, after you've written it out in normal order, and write it in reversed order. This means that Z will sit under A, Y under B, X under C, and so on. It's good to write it out completely, as this will help you visualize the entirety of your code.


Start to memorize the code, as this will save you time in writing it out in the future. Know that by practicing it, you will grow more comfortable working in the code eventually.

, Using the code as a guide, you'll begin to translate your message into your reversed code. Start by writing out your message in normal English. Below this, you'll use your key to translate this message into the reversed alphabet. The message ""HELLO,"" for example, would be read as ""SVOOL.""


When decoding a message, look at the bottom row of your key and follow to the letter above. The letter above will correlate to the letter in English.

, It will also save you time in writing out your key. To prepare to write in this code, simply write the letters A through M and then write the rest of the alphabet, N through Z, underneath them.


When translating using the half-reversed alphabet, A will equal N, and N will also equal A. It's a two-way correlation, so some people find will find it easier and quicker to assess when translating.

Connect each letter to its numerical equivalent.,
Dictate in Morse Code.,
Learn hieroglyphics.,
Invent your own code.",How to Write in Code4," This code, while fairly straightforward, is an easy way to begin assigning symbols to your alphabet. Write out the alphabet in its standard order. After this, go through and number each letter of the alphabet from 1 to 26 so that A=1, B=2, and complete this pattern.


This code, while fairly simple, is also easy to crack. You could try switching it up by reversing the order of the numbers from the beginning (A=26), or by numbering normally for the first half of the alphabet and reversing your numbers when you hit the half-way point, so that N=26, O=25, and so on.

, While most people think of Morse Code as a series of sounds and lights, rather than something that can be written, there are shorthand symbols for each letter in the code.Morse Code, named after its inventor Samuel Morse, was used to quickly send messages through telegraphs in the 1830's. Each letter will be composed of a series of dots and dashes. Compose a key of the various correlations and use it as a guide when writing in this code.


For advanced coders, there are Morse Code symbols that also represent all forms of punctuation. Try spicing up your messages by writing full sentences, divided by periods, commas, and exclamation points, within your Morse Code.

, Invented in Ancient Egypt, hieroglyphics is old system of writing language that combines a more traditional alphabet with symbolic drawings.What's a bit tough about learning hieroglyphics is that it not only relies on letters, but also on sounds. When writing the letter A, for example, you'll have to memorize the symbols for both the long and short vowel sounds.


Write out a key that not only includes the letters of the English alphabet, but also the sounds that have been assigned their own symbol in hieroglyphics. You'll see that the shared letters often have the same basic design, and that there are small modifications that correlate to each sound or combination of letters.

, While you can certainly use these existing codes, or other codes that exist in the world, it can be fun to create your own. Get together with a friend and assign a symbol to each letter in the alphabet. Keeping these designs fairly simple will be helpful in mastering your own code. It's also very important that you hold onto your key, as you don't want to forget your methods.

Draw two crosshatch grids and two X grids.,
Write one letter in each space.,
Place dots in one crosshatch and X grid.,
Separate your symbols into a list.",How to Write in Pigpen Code2," In this version of the code, you will create the code using multiple grids. This will randomize the order of the alphabet a little bit more than using one crosshatch and x grid. It also may be a clearer key for you to work with.


Traditionally, the order of the grids would be crosshatch, X, crosshatch, X or “# X # X.”You can, however, mix up the order as you please to complicate your code. You can write it as “# # X X” or even “X # X #.” Whichever order you choose will determine the order of symbols when you write your substitution code.

, You can choose to write this in alphabetical order or, if you want to be extra careful, reverse alphabetical order. In this version, however, there is only one letter in each space.

, One set of each type of grid should be filled with a dot in every space. To clarify, one crosshatch grid and one X grid should have no dots while one crosshatch grid and one X grid should have one dot per space.

, Like other pigpen codes, the lines immediately surrounding the letters will form the shape of the symbol while the dots/pigs will signal which letter it is. Writing your code out in a list form with each symbol separated will help you keep track of which symbol corresponds with which letter.

"
"
Randomize the order of your letters.,
Replace dots with other symbols.,
Write three letters instead of two letters in the spaces.,
Make your numbers into ciphers.",How to Write in Pigpen Code3," When creating the code, instead of putting the letters in alphabetical order in the grid, try randomly assigning letters to boxes. This way, people who are familiar with pigpen code will not be able to immediately guess which symbol relates to which letter.


The more you randomize your code, the more difficult it will be for others to figure it out. If you are using this code to write to your friends, make sure that they have a copy of your cipher.

, If you use dots, others may recognize your code as a pigpen code immediately. Try replacing the dots with other symbols, such as 0, X, *, or +. Furthermore, if you really want to confuse people, use multiple symbols in coding your grids.

, If you are using a single grid and X to form your code, you can make the code even more difficult by writing three letters instead of two in each space. While writing in this method, each symbol will consist of zero, one or two dots. Zero is the left letter, one is the middle and two is the right one.


In this version, you will have extra spaces. You can fill them with numbers, punctuation (!, ?, &) or leave them blank.

, The tic-tac-toe cipher is a type of pigpen cipher used for numbers. Draw a crosshatch grid and fill each space with a number. You don’t need to add dots. Simply use the shape formed by the surrounding lines of each number. Replace “0” with an X.For example, 101 would appear as _| X _|

To use, determine a number to use a cipher, for example: 4.

, If the square root isn't a whole number, round up). We can put 16 into 4 rows of 4 (I.e. the square root of 16 is 4). If we had 25 letters we could put them into 5 rows of 5 (square root of 25 is 5) and so on. In cases where the number doesn't divide so neatly, use the number of rows for the next ""boxable"" (perfect square) number up. The ""boxable"" (square) numbers are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, etc. If the code has 22 letters (square root of 22 is 4.69), the next number up is 25, which would mean 5 rows (4.69 rounds up to 5).

Get a dictionary.,
Learn.,
Now you will start looking for the actual word.,
Now you know how it works.,
Go ahead; try it out!",How to Use the Dictionary Code," If you want to use it, make sure that you and your partner have the exact same dictionary, or else your ""language"" would be totally ruined. A more advanced dictionary works best because it has more words.;
, Now is time to understand the code. Open your dictionary to a random page into the middle. Since dictionary's are usually printed in 2 columns, you will have to adjust the code from the book code. Enter the first numbers (triple digit, unless you have a dictionary that has 1000+ pages). There should be 3 or 4 numbers in your code right now, depending on your dictionary. Now, search your actual word in a column. The columns can be numbered 1 or 2, so if you are using a dictionary, and you found the page and column, it should look like this: 435(for page)1(for column)...so it would be 4351.

, You search the word in the column and when you found it, see if it is the first word, the second word, etc. This will be your final numbers (double-digit(e.g. isolationism is word 21 in the first column on page 435; that means the code is 435121)).

, It must have 6 or 7 digits or else it won't be the dictionary code.

, Use your dictionary, record the page, column, and find your word. This may take a little while, but when you get used to it, it can be an effective code. Below is an example of some words printed in dictionary code from the Webster's Universal College Dictionary.

Alter your language with a sliding scale.,
Work with the Block Cipher method.,
Master the Pigpen Code.",How to Write in Code5," A sliding scale, sometimes known as a cryptograph, takes our traditional alphabet and slides it in one direction, giving each letter a newly assigned code letter.The simplest way to do this is to slide the entire alphabet down a single letter. This means that A will be represented by B, B by C, until Z will eventually be represented by A.


You can go beyond this single move, however, and slide the alphabet down multiple places. This will make your code more advanced, as a one letter slide can be cracked fairly easily.
You can also slide the alphabet backwards. This requires a bit more planning, however, as you'll have to work from the latter side of the alphabet, move past Z, and then start from A.
This strategy is also known as ""ROT1,"" which stands for ""rotate one letter forward."" You can apply this to more advanced scales if you would like. ROT2, for example, would stand for ""rotate two letters forward.""

, Start by writing out your message in one rectangular block, moving one row at time.You'll want to preplan this a bit, as each row should be as close to even, in its length, as possible. It may not line up perfectly, however. Once you've written out your blocks, move vertically down each column. Each vertical column will be its own word of a nearly equal length, if you've planned your rows evenly.


When decoding these messages, write your code words as individual columns again, and you'll be able read the message in row form again.

, The Pigpen Code, often referred to as to masonic cipher, is one of the most advanced codes to write within. Make sure that you write it out clearly in an organized fashion, as you'll want to be returning into it when you're writing and decoding these messages.Draw your two major grids. One will look like a tic-tac-toe board, and the other will look like a massive X. You'll fill in the thirteen holes of the two grids with two letters each.


Compare the codes for A and B. Both will have the same major shape, but B, because it's the second letter in the box, gets a dot attached to it. This will apply to all of the shared spaces. The first will be plain, and the second has a dot. It may help to write each letter out individually in its code to compare them with each other.

By using a reflected alphabet, the message ""Hello"" would instead become ""Uryyb."", Draw a tic tac toe grid on a piece of paper. Write out the letters A through I in the grid going from the left to right, top to bottom. In this example:


The first row is made up of the letters A, B, C.
The second is made up of D, E, F.
The last row is made up of G, H, I., Draw another tic tac toe grid beside the first one. Fill the grid in with the letters J through R, similarly to the first grid. Then mark dots in each space of the grid of each row as described:


In the first row, starting on the left, place a dot in the lower right corner (letter I), on the bottom middle side (letter K), and in lower left corner (letter L).
In the second row, starting on the left, place a dot on the middle right side (letter M), on the bottom middle side (letter N), and on the middle left side (letter O).
In the second row, starting on the left, place a dot in the upper right corner (letter P), on the top middle side (letter Q), and in the upper left corner (letter R)., These two X shapes will also be filled with letters to complete your pigpen cipher key. In the second X, place dots in the open spaces surrounding where the X crosses so there is a dot on each side of the center of the X. Then:


In the first (undotted) X shape, write S in the top of the X, T on the left side, U on the right, and V on the bottom.
In the second X shape, write W in the top of the X, X on the left side, Y on the right, and Z on the bottom., The grid shapes (including dots) surrounding letters are used as substitutes for the letters themselves. Use your pigpen cipher key to translate messages into and out of pigpen."

These will signify the basic sounds for A, E, I, O, and U, which make up the English language.(for the purpose of making this easier, we will use English as our example, but it's not limited; just make sure you put the basic vowel sounds in your grid);
,(hard c, b, h, whatever you can think of; don't forget ñ if you think you may need it)

, How this translates is completely up to you. The consonant sound might be the beginning sound,(""ta"") or the ending sound.(""eb"") While you're at it, you'll need to make an ending or beginning sound symbol, for those words that end in consonant sounds. You can make a new symbol to add to your five vowel symbols, or you can make your consonant symbols so you can leave them on their own and tell them apart fine. It's up to you.

, You can use the standard 10-base everyone does... OR you can make your own set of numbers! Here's how: Choose a base. I'll use base-8 for this, which means I'll have the numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7. After 7 is 10, which actually equals eight. For 9 I have 11, and for 10 I have 12. And when I reach 17, my next number will be twenty, which will actually equal 16. Get it? Just make sure it's 10 or below, unless you want to figure out how to make a base-13 number code.(my first choice)

, Notice how I didn't tell you any specifics about my code? With the exception of the example in step four, this is as one-size-fits-all as I could do! I don't use base-8, either. The main idea is not to go bragging about your oh-so-great-code or showing your grid to anyone you don't want to learn your code. Otherwise, don't bother, 'cause it won't really be a secret, will it?

, This is almost as important as keeping it a secret! You don't want to go back to your cheat-sheet every time you want to write an encrypted message. As with any code,(or a foreign language, hint hint) try to memorize it as best you can. Make sure you're friend knows it too, if this is your friendship code or something. Write a little every day. Think of it as an extracurricular activity if it helps.

The word you choose is entirely up to you. Any word can be encoded using the skip letter code method. If you want to encode an entire message, start with the first word in your message.


Any word will work for the skip a letter code.
Encode each word in a phrase or longer message.
Avoid encoding an entire message at once when using the skip a letter code.;
, To start the skip a letter code you will need to find the center of the word you have selected. To do this, count how many letters are in the word. If the word is even, split the word exactly in half. If the word has an odd amount of letters, put the extra letter on the left half of the word.


For example, the word “code” would result in “co” and “de”.
The word “codes” would result in “cod” and “es”.

, Take a look at the first half of your word and locate the first letter of this group. This letter will be the first one that you record in your encoded version of the word. It's important that you use the first letter of the first group to make sure the code can later be decoded.


For example, if you used the word “secret”, we would have two halves; “sec” and “ret”.
The first letter you would write down is the letter “s”.

, After you've written down the first letter from the first half of the word, you can move onto the next. In your code, the second letter will be the first letter of the second half of the word you are encoding.


If you were using the word “secret”, you would have two groups of letters; “sec” and ret”
You will have already written the first letter of the first group down. In this case, the first letter was the letter “s”.
Now you will write down the first letter of the second group. The first letter in the second group is “r”, resulting in “sr”.

, Once your first two letters are written down, you can continue encoding your word in the same way you started. Take the second letter from the first half of the word and write it down. Write down the second letter from the second half of the word after that. Keep going in this way until you've used all the letters from both halves of the original word.Using the word “secret”, you would have two groups of letters; “sec” and ret”
You should have already written down the first letters of each group, giving you “sr” as a result.
Go back to the first group and write down the second letter. Here it would be “e”, giving you “sre”.
Move to the second group and write down the second letter. This would give you “sree”.
Going back to the first group, write down the final letter. The code would be “sreec” at this point.
Finish the code by writing the last letter of the second group. The final code word would be “sreect”.
Once you've used all the letters from the original word, the encoding process is complete.

, If your message has more than one word to encode, use the same skip a letter code on the remaining words. Each word should be encoded using this method to create a fully encoded message. Once you've got the entire message encoded, you can safely share it with someone who knows how to decode it.

, Once you've received a coded message, write down the very first letter of the encoded word. From here, write down every other letter you find. This will help you break the encoded word into it's original halves, letting you recreate the original word.For example, start with the encoded word “sreect”. The letter “S” would be the first letter to write down.
Write down every other letter in the code after “S”. This would result in “sec”, which is the original first half of the word before it was encoded.

, After you've written down the first letter of the word and every other letter after it, you can start on the second letter. Write this second letter down and then write down every letter after it. This will help you recreate the second half of the original word before it was encoded.As an example, imagine you are decoding the word “sreect”. The letter “R” would be your starting point for this step.
Write down every other letter after “r” to complete the second half of the original word. In this case, the result is “ret”.

, Now that you have the two original halves of the word, you can put them together the recreate the original word. Take each half of the word and join them together to reveal the original word. If everything worked out properly, you should now have successfully decoded the word and you will be able to read it normally.


As an example, the original coded word may have been “sreect”.
When the original halves of the word were recreated, the result was “sec” and “ret”.
These two halves combine to form the original word “secret”.

, You may have a message that is longer than one word. To read the entire message, use the decoding technique on each individual word. Once you decode each word, you will be able to clearly read the complete message.

Recognize the limitations of codes.,
Determine the goal of your code.,
Develop your code book.,
Apply your code book to messages.,
Use a key to encode your message, alternately.,
Decode messages.",How to Create Secret Codes and Ciphers2," Code books can be stolen, lost, or destroyed. Modern cryptoanlaytic techniques and computer analysis can oftentimes break even strong codes. Even so, codes can condense long messages into a single signal word, making them great time savers.Codes serve as good pattern identification practice. This skill can be put to use when encoding, decoding, enciphering, or deciphering messages.
Codes are naturally used between close friends. Inside jokes could be thought of as a kind of ""code."" Try developing your code language with your best friends.

, Knowing the purpose of your code will prevent unnecessary work. If your goal is to save time, you might only need a few specific code words. If you're trying to encode detailed messages, you may need to develop a code book that is more like a dictionary.


Select common phrases that occur in the messages you want to encode. These are prime targets to be condensed in a code word.
Codes can be further complicated by using several different codes in rotation or combination. However, the more codes used, the more code books necessary for decoding., Condense common phrases, like ""Reading you loud and clear,"" to something like ""Roy."" For every conceivable word in your encoded messages and common phrases as well, designate alternative code words.


Sometimes, partial code can obscure a message sufficiently. For example, if ""walk"" means ""tango"" and ""museum"" means ""restaurant"" and the previously used code word ""Roy"" holds its value,


Message: About yesterday. I wanted to say, Roy. I'll tango to the restaurant as planned. Over and out.

Meaning: About yesterday. I wanted to say, reading you loud and clear. I'll walk to the museum as planned. Over and out., Use the code words in your code book to encode messages. You may find that you can save yourself time by leaving nouns (like names and pronouns like I, me, she) as plain text. However, this decision depends purely on your situation.


Two-part codes apply two different code books to encode or decode a message. These are much stronger than one-part codes.

, A key message, group of words, letters, symbols, or a combination of these can be used to encode your message.The recipient of your message will also need this key phrase or key of letters/symbols to decode the message.For example, with the key word ""SECRET,"" each letter of your message would convert to the number of letters between it and the corresponding letter of the key word. As in,


Message: Hello

Encoding:
/H/ is 11 letters away from the key /S/
/e/ is the same (zero) as the key /E/
/l/ is 9 letters away from the key /C/And so on...


Coded Message: 11; 0 ; 9 ; 6 ; 10



, As you receive coded messages, you'll have to make use of your code book or key word/phrase to make sense of them. This may be difficult at first, but will become more intuitive as you become more familiar with the code.To strengthen you encoding ability, you may want to invite your friends to join an amateur code making group. Pass messages to improve your skills.

Employ the code used by Mary, Queen of Scots.,
Use code phrases similar to military alerts.,
Encode messages with a book key code.",How to Create Secret Codes and Ciphers3," While trying to send messages during a time of political turmoil, Mary, Queen of Scots, used symbols as a substitute code for English letters and common words.Some features of Mary's code you might find useful for your own crypto-education include:


The use of simple shapes for high frequency letters, like Mary's use of a circle for the letter /A/. This saves time while encoding.
Common symbols used as part of the new code language, like Mary's use of ""8"" as code for the letter ""Y."" These can confuse code breakers who might interpret this as a number and not a code symbol.
Unique symbols for common words. In Mary's day, ""pray"" and ""bearer"" received unique symbols, but these were more common then than they are today. Still, using symbols for frequent words and phrases saves time and adds complexity., Code phrases can collapse a lot of meaning into a single phrase. Even many kinds of military alert, like the DEFCON system, are simply well-known codes for a state of defense readiness.Come up with suitable code words/phrases in your everyday life.


For example, instead of saying ""I've got to run to my locker"" among your friends, you might use the code word ""Sloppy.""
To let your friends know that the person you want to date has entered the room, you might say the code phrase, ""My cousin Bruce likes hockey, too.""

, Books are relatively easy to come by. If a book has been decided upon as the key to a code, when you receive a message you can go to a bookstore or library to look up the key to decode it.


For example, you might decide on using Frank Herbert's Dune, with code numbers representing the page, line, and number word starting from the left.


Encoded Message: 224.10.1 ; 187.15.1 ; 163.1.7 ; 309.4.4

Decoded Message: I'm hiding my words.


Different editions of books might use different page numbers. To ensure the right book is used as a key, include publication information, like edition, year published, and so on with your book key."

Determine the suitability of using a cipher.,
Invent an algorithm to apply to messages.,
Encipher messages.,
Decipher messages.",How to Create Secret Codes and Ciphers4," A cipher uses an algorithm, which is like a process or transformation that is applied to a message consistently. This means that anyone who knows the cipher can translate it.Complex ciphers can puzzle even trained cryptanalysts. Sometimes the math behind complex ciphers can prove a suitable defense for hiding everyday messages.
Many cryptographers add a key, like the date, to strengthen ciphers. This key adjusts the output values by the corresponding number of the day of the month (on the first, all output values would be changed by one)., One of the simplest ciphers you can apply is the ROT1 Cipher (sometimes called Caesar Cipher). This name simply means you should rotate a single letter forward in the alphabet for each letter of your message.ROT1 Message: Hello

ROT1 Enciphered: i ; f ; m ; m ; p
Caesar Ciphers can be modified to rotate forward a number of different letters of the alphabet. In concept, ROT1 and ROT13 are essentially the same.
Ciphers can be incredibly complex. Some require the use of coordinates, times, and other values as well. Some cipher process may require the use of a computer.

, Use your algorithm to encrypt your messages. As you learn the enciphering process, your speed should increase. Add to your algorithm to make it more complex. For example,


Include a rotating condition to your cipher, like the day of the week. For each day of the week, assign a value. Adjust your cipher by this value when encrypting a message on that day.
Include a page number with your enciphered message. Each corresponding letter of that page will serve as a key for the message, as in,


1st Deciphered Message: 7 ; 2 ; 3 ; 6 ; 3

Book Key: A_girl (spaces aren't counted)
/H/ is 7 letters away from /A/
/e/ is 2 letters away from /g/
/l/ is 3 spaces away from /i/And so on...


Key Adjusted Message: Hello, When you become experienced reading your cipher it should become second nature, or at least easier. As the application of these processes (algorithms) is consistent, habit will help you notice trends and gain intuition when working with this kind of cryptographic system.


Amateur cryptography clubs are popular online. Many of these are free and offer primers in the basics of modern ciphering."

Master Morse Code.,
Make use of transposition ciphers.,
Convert messages to binary.",How to Create Secret Codes and Ciphers5," Regardless of its name, Morse Code is a cipher. Dots and dashes represent long and short electrical signals which, in turn, represent the letters of the alphabet. This enabled old-time electrical communication (telegraphs). Common letters in Morse, represented as long ( _ ) and short (.) signals, include:


R ; S ; T ; L : ._. ; _.. ; _ ; ._..
A ; E ; O : ._ ; . ; _ _ _, Many greats in history, like the genius Leonardo da Vinci, have written out messages as they would look reflected in a mirror. Because of this, enciphering in this fashion is often called ""mirror writing."" These kinds of ciphers can be difficult at first, but generally become second nature quickly.Transposition ciphers generally treat messages or the formation of letters visually. The image of the message is transformed to hide its meaning., Binary is the language of 1's and 0's used by computers. Combinations of these 1's and 0's can be enciphered and then deciphered with a binary key, or by calculating the values represented by the 1's and 0's for each letter communicated in a message.


The name ""Matt"" would encipher to binary as: 01001101 ; 01000001 ; 01010100 ; 01010100."

Recognize that there’s no one Elvish language to rule them all.,
Know that you’re likely familiar with Sindarin.,
Learn the Feanorian letters.,
Learn the Tengwar alphabet’s supplementary letters.",How to Write in Elvish1," The Lord of the Rings series was written in part as an extension of Tolkien’s interest in creating new languages. You could even say that the characters were literary devices through whom he could use the languages he loved to invent. And invent he did: there are 15 different dialects of Elvish alone. However, only two – Quenya and Sindarin – have enough established words and grammar rules to be functionally used. People study, speak, and write in each of these languages., Sindarin was the Elvish language that Tolkien featured most frequently in the Lord of the Rings series. The names of many places and characters in the series are Sindarin, and the dialect was the most common Elvish language during the fictional time period of Middle Earth.Sindarin is closely related to Quenya. The distinctions between the two have to do with specific aspects of the fictional histories Tolkien created.
Quenya, which uses words that mostly end in vowels or r, l, or n, is based on Finnish, a language Tolkien particularly favored.
Sindarin words almost always end in consonants, and consonant clusters are more common. Sindarin reminds many people of Celtic languages, and was based on Welsh.

, Though Tolkien also invented several alphabets, the Feanorian letters – which make up the Tengwar alphabet – were most prominently featured in his work, and are most commonly used today. Depending on dialect, this alphabet is written in different modes. The Tengwar alphabet is always written left to right, in horizontal lines.Find an image of the Feanorian letters online. Note that different modes will affect the appearance of certain letters.
Further, be aware that different renditions of Tolkien’s alphabets are extremely common. Different renditions may appear differently depending on the fictional historical time period, or specific Tolkien piece, from which they were derived.

, Some common two-letter combinations in English – such as “sh”, “nd” and “ld” are replaced by individual letters of the Tengwar alphabet. These letters should also be included in alphabets that are available online. The important thing to note is that the Tengwar alphabet has more letters than the English alphabet, for instance."

Take a bite out of your word-circle by drawing an inward curving semi-circle in the upper left hand portion of your word-circle.",How to Write in Gallifreyan," Instead of being character/letter based like English, circular Gallifreyan is based, as the name implies, on circles. The symbols that make up letters are collected into words by larger word-circles. Many word-circles are collected together in even larger sentence-circles.The Gallifreyan alphabet was created by a fan of Dr. Who named Loren Sherman. He created this way of writing so he could transform English words to mimic the artistic representations of the Doctor’s native language, Gallifreyan. It is not used by the show and is not a real language.;
, There are many online resources that you can print out so you have your own Gallifreyan writing references. You might also find the official Sherman site for circular Gallifreyan useful, as there are Gallifreyan guides for writing words, math, and music. These resources can be found at Sherman’s Planet.The general guide to writing Gallifreyan has three different charts and a brief explanation of numbers. One chart displays consonants, one vowels, and the third punctuation marks.
If a printer is unavailable and you cannot print these resources, you might keep them open in a tab on your computer or open them in the browser on your phone. This way, you’ll be able to compare your practice words to the Gallifreyan symbol references., A diacritic is a mark used to add meaning, stress, or emphasis to a letter. In Circular Gallifreyan, there are four basic symbols used to represent consonants. These symbols can be written alone, or you can add one diacritic mark or another to modify the base meaning of the symbol and change it into another consonant.


With the four consonant-symbols and five diacritics, there are a total of 24 consonants in Gallifreyan, which is slightly larger than English’s 21 consonant alphabet. The reason Gallifreyan has more consonant-symbols is because Gallifreyan use a graphed alphabet instead of one based on characters/letters.Because of this, Gallifreyan has special symbols for the letter combinations: TH, SH, CH, NG, and QU.
Circular Gallifreyan does not make use of the letter C. If you are trying to write an English word with the letter C, use the consonant the C most sounds like. For example, in the word ‘cake’ in Circular Gallifreyan would be spelled ‘kake.’ The word ‘office’ would be spelled ‘offise.’
The four base consonant-symbols, without any diacritic marks, represent B, J, T, and TH. By adding the appropriate Gallifreyan diacritic mark, for example a pair of dots, you will transform these four base consonant-symbols into every other consonant., It will take some time before you have memorized the shape of and become comfortable with drawing the consonant-symbols. You should take some time practicing drawing each consonant-symbol and so that you’re comfortable using them when it’s time to write your first practice word. To improve memorization, you may want to try to draw the consonant reference chart from memory.


The consonant B is shaped like a full circle with a small gap at the bottom. By adding a diacritic mark to the B-symbol, you can change it into the letters CH, D, F, G, and H.
The consonant J is shaped like a full circle placed on the inside of larger sentence circles. By adding a diacritic mark to the J-symbol, you can change it into the letters K, L, M, N, and P.
The consonant T is shaped like an open horseshoe oriented with its open side facing the perimeter of its word-circle. By adding a diacritic mark to the T-symbol, you can change it into the letters SH, R, S, V, and W.
The consonant TH is shaped like a full circle with a horizontal line through the middle. By adding a diacritic mark to the TH-symbol, you can change it into the letters Y, Z, NG, QU, and X.

, Each base consonant-symbol can be modified by a diacritic mark to transform it into different letters. Each consonant- symbol may only ever have one diacritic mark modifying it. A short description of the five diacritics and the letters they create follows:


The first diacritic is represented by two dots. These can be applied to the base consonant-symbols to make the consonants CH, K, SH, and Y.
The second diacritic is represented by three dots. These can be applied to the base consonant-symbols to make the consonants D, L, R, and Z.
The third diacritic is represented by three vertical lines. These can be applied to the base consonant-symbols to make the consonants F, M, S, and NG.
The fourth diacritic is a single vertical line. This can be applied to the base consonant-symbols to make the consonants G, N, V, and QU.
The fifth and last diacritic is represented by two vertical lines. These can be applied to the base consonant-symbols to make the consonants H, P, W, and X.

, Gallifreyan uses the same vowels as the English alphabet: A, E, I, O, and U. These vowels are depicted as small circles that either float freely, sit within, or sit on the perimeter of a consonant-symbol.


The vowel A is a small circle that should be placed below, but not touching, the perimeter of the symbol it modifies.
The vowel E is a small circle that should be placed in the center of the symbol it is modifying.
The vowel I is a small circle that should be placed so that it is in the center of the symbol it modifies. However, the letter I will also need a line coming off some point of its perimeter pointing inward at the center of its word-circle.
The vowel O is a small circle that should be placed on the topmost part of the perimeter of the symbol it modifies.
The vowel U is a small circle that should be placed at the center of the symbol it is modifying. It should also have a line coming off some point on its perimeter extending outward, away from the middle of its word-circle., Vowels in Gallifreyan can be represented as either a freestanding circles or they can be attached to preceding consonants. Just like many people have different kinds of handwriting, there are many different ways you can create intricate patterns with Gallifreyan writing that’s unique to you.


By connecting vowels to preceding consonants, you gain the benefit of more consistency with your Gallifreyan symbols, which will likely make your writing easier to read. Freestanding vowels may be more confusing to read at first, but can allow for more intricate patterns.
Generally, freestanding vowels only occur when a word begins with a vowel. In this case you will orient your vowel with regard to the perimeter of the larger circle that contains all the letters together into one word. The letter A will float just outside the word-circle; E, I, and U will rest on the perimeter of the word-circle; O will float just inside the word-circle.
Shorter words will have less vowels. You may be able to make these look more aesthetically pleasing by keeping the vowels freestanding. Freestanding vowels can also make some words easier to read., Each word should begin with a circle that is about the same size around as a normal cup. Once you improve your Gallifreyan, you can adjust the size of these word-circles, but for now, a cup sized circle will give you room to make mistakes. This circle will contain all of the letter-symbols that form your word. Your first letter-symbol will occupy the very bottom of the circle. The following letter-symbols should be written around the circle counterclockwise until the word is complete.Complicated words might require larger word-circles. Try to arrange your letter-symbols to be evenly spaced throughout your word-circle. This will create better balance in the overall appearance of your word-circles.

, You should write out words with the same spelling you would normally use in English, except for a few consonant pairs where one Gallifreyan symbol will represent two letters. Other irregularities you’ll need to keep in mind include:A reading order that starts at the bottom and moves counterclockwise. So, in the example of a sentence-circle, your first word will be at the bottom of the sentence-circle, and the next word-circle will be counterclockwise, and so on. In a word-circle containing letter-symbols, the first letter will be the bottom-most symbol, and the next letter will be counterclockwise, and so on.
Interlocking letters and words together. By interlocking letters and words together you’ll make your Gallifreyan writing look most authentic. In particular, the symbols used for the consonants R, S, SH, T, V, and W can be extended throughout word-circles and sentence-circles to connect letters of the same word or words of the same sentence.
The use of double circles for doubled letters. You can use double circles to indicate double consonants or vowels. For example, the word bookcase would use a doubled circle for the O. You may want to keep your double circles separate for shorter words though, like bee, took, and foot. Writing out both doubled consonants in shorter words will give them a more intricate appearance.

, Sentences behave similarly to words in Gallifreyan. Just as letter-symbols are gathered into medium-sized word-circles, words are gathered together in large, doubled sentence-circles. In every sentence-circle, the bottom word-circle will represent the first word in the sentence. Moving counterclockwise, the next word-circle indicates the next word, and so on. Two circles will make up the perimeter of your sentence-circle. These two circles should be drawn differently. The outer circle should be mostly smooth arcs with maybe one or two inward curving sides. The inner circle should have random inward divots to give your Gallifreyan a more intricate appearance.
The inner and outer parts of the sentence-circles are used for the purpose of conveying punctuation and connection. The inner circle is where you’ll add your punctuation marks to a sentence. The outer circle, though mostly circular, should follow the divots created by the inner circle in some places. This will create one or more inward curves in which you can nest other connected sentence-circles.
Circular Gallifreyan makes use of standard English punctuation. For example, the periods you put on the divotted, inner sentence-circle will always occur after the last word-circle. Punctuation should always immediately precede or follow word-circles., To write Gallifreyan effortlessly, you’ll have to spend some time memorizing the symbols it uses. Until then, you may want to print up a punctuation chart or copy one freehand onto a blank sheet of paper. There many resources online, and downloaded versions are available at Sherman’s Planet.Create a period by drawing an open circle on the inner ring of your sentence-circle.
Create a question by drawing two closed floating close to, but not touching, the inside of the inner ring of your sentence-circle.
Create an exclamation mark by drawing three dots floating close to, but not touching, the inside of the inner ring of your sentence-circle.
Create quotations by drawing a single line oriented away from the center of the sentence-circle.
Create apostrophes by drawing two lines oriented away from the center of the sentence-circle.
Create a hyphen by drawing three lines oriented away from the center of the sentence-circle.
Create a comma by drawing a filled in circle or solid dot on the inner ring of your sentence-circle.
Create a semicolon by drawing a single closed dot floating close to, but not touching, the inner ring of your sentence-circle.
Create a colon with a double circle (a circle inside of a circle) on the inner ring of your sentence-circle., Timelords have a very fluid idea of time, and this concept is a central to Gallifreyan culture. In the Doctor Who universe, some events are more probable than others, but for most events, there are many possible outcomes. You can emulate this in your writing by connecting your sentences together so that each sentence has multiple branches. This will represent multiple possibilities each of your sentences.For example, you might want to explore different aspects of a central idea. To do so, you could write that idea in a sentence-circle and branch off from it to the right in different chains. These chains would represent the explored aspects of the idea., A sturdy compass will likely be the most versatile tool you can use to draw circles of various sizes. However, you might find it more convenient to trace circular household items, like the bottom of a bottle/glass, circular lids, large coins, mason jars, etc.Your circular objects don’t have to be perfect. You might want to try your own oblong variation of Gallifreyan that uses an oval shape as the base.
You could also rotate between several different circular shapes when drawing your word-circles. For example, your first word could be bordered by a circle, the second by a fat oval, and the third by a tall oval.

, If you’re still getting used to drawing the symbols of the Gallifreyan alphabet, you should probably write in pencil so you can erase any mistakes. Once you are finished writing your message, you can always go over your pencil in pen to give it a professional look.


While writing in Gallifreyan, you may want your computer or cell phone browser open to the alphabet and punctuation pages online. You could also print out the alphabet and punctuation forms, or copy them onto a blank sheet freehand. Sherman’s Planet, being the home of circular Gallifreyan, has many resources you could use., First draw your word-circle using a compass, lid, or some other round object. All the letter-symbols for the word “doctor” will be around or in this word-circle. The first letter begins at the bottom of the circle. On your alphabet chart, the first letter, D, should look like a loop with a gap at the bottom. First draw a loop inside your word-circle at its bottom. Then you can erase a small portion at the base of the loop/word-circle to create the gap. Next you’ll need to add a diacritic mark to change the letter from B to D. D’s are represented by three dots floating inside, but not touching, your loop.


On your chart, you may notice that the base symbol for the letter D looks something like a horseshoe with flat lines coming off its tips to the left and right. These flat lines should not be drawn when you write this symbol. The flat lines represent the larger word-circle inside which you’re drawing your letter., Moving counterclockwise within your word-circle, attach an open circle to the upper right hand portion of your loop. If you think about your loop as you would the face of a clock, you should attach your O-symbol at about two o’clock position. Remember, vowels are usually attached to preceding consonants.


When thinking about the placement of a vowel, imagine the dotted grid that represents the placement of the vowel as shown in your vowel chart. Then imagine the base symbol for the consonant you will write. Overlay the vowel with the consonant so the circles match. This will show you approximately where on the consonant you should attach your vowel.
Your letter-symbols should always move around your word-circle in a counterclockwise fashion. As the outside of your word-circle becomes crowded, spiral inward toward the center of your word-circle., Continuing to move counterclockwise along your word-circle, draw a floating circle to the right of your loop. This circle should be close to but not touching your word-circle. Then add two solid dots to the inside of your floating circle and add two filled in dots inside it. This free floating circle with two solid dots inside represents K.


The dots inside your K can be arranged in any way you please. However, you might find that by orienting your diacritic marks, in this case the solid dots, in the direction of the next letter, you may have an easier time reading your Gallifreyan.At this point you should have a large circle with a small gap at the bottom. Springing up from both sides of the gap is a loop. On the upper right hand part of the loop is an open circle. Counterclockwise (to the right) to the loop is a circle with two solid dots in it. These symbols represent the letters “doc”.

, If you think of your word-circle like the face of a clock, this would be the 2 o’clock position. Then erase the outer boundary of your word-circle that runs between the ends of your semi-circle.


Make sure the mouth of your T symbol is wide so that it isn’t confused for another letter. The letter B is shaped similarly except it has a narrower gap at its base., This vowel is again preceded by a consonant, so you should attach it to T-symbol. Continue with the counterclockwise reading style by placing an open circle (representing the letter O) along the upper left portion of the inward curving semi-circle (representing the letter T)., Along the outside of this semi-circle, place three solid dots to make an R. This completes the word “doctor!”


Be careful when drawing the letter R. It can sometimes be confused for a wide mouthed letter B.

Start writing Elvish in the Quenya mode.,
Indicate vowels properly.,
Use a place holder for some vowels.,
Draw a wavy line to indicate a double consonant.,
Learn the special rules regarding certain letters.",How to Write in Elvish2," The Quenya mode is most commonly used in written Elvish today. Different modes of writing the Tengwar alphabet are used for different dialects. These different modes affect, among other things, the way vowels are indicated when written down.Barring some specific rules regarding certain letters, you may be able to simply replace most consonants in your English name with their equivalent in the Tengwar alphabet.


For instance, to write the name ""Dan,"" first simply find the Tengwar equivalent of ""D"", ""a"", and ""n.""

, Vowels will usually require a shift in lettering and marking, as opposed to a simple replacement of the letter. In the Quenya mode, vowels are indicated by diacritics that appear above the preceding consonant.Accordingly, shift the marking for a vowel up and to the left, so you end up writing it above the letter that came before the vowel.


Continuing with the example of ""Dan,"" shift the marking for the letter ""a"" above the preceding marking for the letter ""D"". Follow these stacked markings with the marking for the letter ""n"", and you've written ""Dan"" in Elvish!
For “y” and “e”, the markings to indicate these letters go below the preceding consonant instead of above.
In Sindarin mode, diacritics that indicate a vowel appear above the following consonant.

, More specifically, draw a place holder beneath vowels that are not preceded by a consonant. For instance, when a vowel starts a word or follows another vowel, you need something beneath the marking for a vowel. This is most commonly a short vertical line that simply takes the place of the consonant that isn’t there., Double consonants of the same letter are indicated by a wavy line written beneath a letter. More specifically, instead of writing the same consonant twice in a row, write it once, then draw a wavy line beneath the letter. , Depending on where “s” and “r” are located in a word, certain markings most necessarily accompany or replace these letters. For instance, when “s”, “ss”, or “r” follow a vowel, there is actually a different consonant that does not have an equivalent in the English language. Similarly, when “s” follows another consonant, it is written with a downward hook.Another example involves drawing a line above a consonant that follows a nasal “n” or “m” sound.

Take Quenya or Sindarin courses online.",How to Write in Elvish3," If you’re hoping to learn more about Tolkein’s languages, there are two appendices – A and F – in one of the books from the Lord of the Rings series that should be your primary sources. These appendices describe the various languages, as well as different types of letters, in detail.These appendices also contain a guide to pronunciation of Tolkein’s languages, as well as music to which Tolkien wrote Elvish lyrics.

, The manuscripts for many of Tolkien’s works are stored in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at Marquette University. The margins of the manuscripts include all sorts of notes about how and why he chose or developed certain Elvish words. Further, unpublished works contain new Elvish words that continue to be “discovered.”The Elvish Linguistic Fellowship is another source of a wealth of material, some of which was created using some of Tolkein’s unpublished works., An Introduction to Elvish, written by Jim Allen, is widely respected as the most substantial work on Tolkien’s languages. However, many consider it to be outdated. The Languages of Tolkien’s Middle-earth is reportedly “less accurate,” but is still recommended. The Tolkien Society recommends several other sources for further reading., You read that right. You can take courses and tutorials online developed by people who have extensively studied Tolkein’s languages. The modern languages in which these lessons are taught vary, as so the approach and inspiration that led to their creation."

Learn how to form words beginning with vowels.,
Learn how to form words containing the letter ""Y"".,
Learn how to deal with compound words.,
Find someone to practice with.,
Be aware of the variations.,
Learn some handy phrases.,
Speak slowly and carefully.",How to Speak Pig Latin," To form Pig Latin words from words beginning with a consonant (like hello) or a consonant cluster (like switch), simply move the consonant or consonant cluster from the start of the word to the end of the word. Then add the suffix ""-ay"" to the end of the word.Words beginning with consonants would change as follows: the word ""hello"" would become ello-hay, the word ""duck"" would become uck-day and the term ""Pig Latin"" would become ig-pay Atin-lay.
Words beginning with consonant clusters would change as follows: the word ""switch"" would become itch-sway, the word ""glove"" would become ove-glay and the term ""fruit smoothie"" would become uit-fray oothie-smay.

, To form Pig Latin words from words beginning with vowels, all you need to do is add ""-yay"" (some Pig-Latin speakers may add ""-way"") to the end of the word. You don't need to change any letters around, just say the word as normal then add ""-yay"" to the end.For example: the word ""it"" becomes it-yay, the word ""egg"" becomes egg-yay and the word ""ultimate"" becomes ultimate-yay.
This also holds true for the personal pronoun ""I"", which becomes i-yay.

, Words with the letter ""Y"" can be tricky, as whether you treat the letter ""Y"" as a consonant or a vowel changes depending on the letter's location in a word.If a word starts with the letter ""Y"" it is treated like a consonant and is moved to the end of the word, as usual. For example, the word ""yellow"" becomes ellow-yay.
The normal rules apply if ""Y"" is the second letter in a two letter word, such as ""my"", which becomes y-may.
However, if the letter ""Y"" comes at the end of a consonant cluster, like in the word ""rhythm"", it is treated like a vowel and does not move to the end of the word. For example, ""rhythm"" becomes ythm-rhay.

, Compound words work better in Pig Latin when they are split up, as it makes them less comprehensible to listeners.


For example, the word ""bedroom"" becomes ed-bay oom-ray rather than ""edroom-bay"", which is more obvious.
Another example is the word ""toothbrush"", which becomes ooth-tay ush-bray rather than ""oothbrush-tay"".

, Learning Pig Latin is no good if you have no one to speak it with. The whole point of the language is so that you can secretly converse with another person in a way no one else can understand. Plus learning the rules and practicing them together will make the whole experience much more fun!


Learning Pig Latin with a friend will allow you to have all kinds of secret conversations. For example, you can invite them over to play video games after school without anyone else knowing, or comment on how disgusting your broccoli is without insulting your mother!
Pig Latin can be tricky to get the hang of, so you'll have to practice a lot to get it perfect. Try speaking it whenever you and your friend are together, at lunch or after school. You can also write coded text messages and emails to each other in Pig Latin, for extra practice.

, If you find someone who can also speak Pig Latin, be aware that they might form their words a little differently to you. This is normal as there are a number of different Pig Latin variations. Some of the main ones are as follows:


For words beginning with a vowel, some Pig Latin varieties add the word ""yay"" rather than ""way"" to the end of a word. For example, the word ""ocean"" would become ocean-yay rather than ""ocean-way"" and the word ""inbox"" would become inbox-yay rather than ""inbox-way"".
Another variation is to add the letter ""Y"" to the beginning of a word that starts with a vowel, in addition to adding ""yay"" to the end. For example, the word ""extra"" would become yextra-yay and the word ""orange"" would become yorange-yay.
One more variation entails adding the suffix ""ay"" rather than ""way"" to a word that begins with a vowel but ends in a consonant. For example, ""after"" would become after-ay rather than ""after-way"" and the word ""olives"" would become olives-ay rather than ""olives -way"".

, Rather than having to mentally form the Pig Latin every time you want to say something, try learning a few key phrases off by heart that you can say and understand without thinking. This will speed up the communication process considerably! Here are some examples:


What's up? = At's-whay up-way?

How are you? = Ow-hay are-way ou-yay?

What are you doing later? = At-whay are-way ou-yay oing-day ater-lay?

I love you. = I-way ove-lay ou-yay.

I have a secret = I-way ave-hay a-way ecret-say.

The guy next to me has toilet paper stuck to his shoe = E-thay uy-gay ext-nay o-tay e-may as-hay oilet-tay aper-pay uck-stay o-tay is-hay oe-shay.

Can you speak Pig Latin? It's really not that hard. You should try it = An-cay ou-yay eak-spay Ig-pay Atin-lay? It's-way eally-ray ot-nay at-thay ard-hay. Ou-yay ould-shay y-tray it-way.

Holy cow! My goldfish just exploded! = Oly-hay ow-cay! Y-may old-gay ish-fay ust-jay exploded-way!


, Pig Latin can be difficult to understand, even if you know all the rules, so make sure to speak slowly and enunciate all your words correctly when speaking to another person. They'll be able to understand you better and it will save you the frustration of having to repeat yourself all the time!

Choose a sentence to write in Oppish.,
Add the syllable “opp” after each consonant or pair of consonants.,
Practice with more complex words and sentences.,
Choose one of the simple sentences you’ve written in Oppish.,
Choose more sentences to read aloud.,
Speak a word out loud without writing it down.,
Continue practicing with new words and sentences.,
Find another Oppish speaker.,
Start with basic conversation.,
Build on your conversation skills.",How to Speak Oppish," This will be an easier way to begin than speaking, because you can take your time. Try a sentence with simple words that you would use in everyday life. Write down the sentence in regular English.


Make sure some of the words have more than one syllable. This will give you practice with different kinds of words.;
, Do not add an “opp” to the end of the word, however. Try writing each word in Oppish underneath the English version of that word. For example, under the word, “cat” you would write, “C-opp-at”. Under the word “hello.” you would write, “h-opp ell-opp o.”Some Oppish speakers insist on an “opp” after every single consonant, so the word, “flip” would be spelled, “f-opp l-opp i -p-opp.”
For short words, particularly the words ""I"", ""a"" and ""an"" insert an ""opp"" before the word. So ""I"" becomes ""opp-I"". ""An"" becomes ""opp-an"" and ""a"" becomes ""opp-a.""Write out Oppish in a way that you will remember and understand. After all, it’s a secret language for you.

, Try some more difficult words, such as, “computer” (c-opp omp-opp ut-opp er) or “yesterday” (y-opp est-opp er-opp d-opp ay). See if you can write down a sentence only in Oppish without having to write the English version out first. You can also practice translating paragraphs from articles or books into Oppish., Practice reading it out loud. You may need to practice each word several times until it rolls off your tongue easily. Continue to practice one sentence until you can say it as though you were speaking English.


If the way you’ve written the Oppish words is difficult for you to understand, you can re-write them in a way that is easier to read.

, Try reading an entire paragraph out loud in Oppish. If you stumble over certain words, just keep practicing. Oppish is considered the most complex of the invented languages, so it may take some time to master., This step can be a difficult one. Choose a new word that you haven’t written down. Practice saying it aloud in Oppish. It may take a few tries to figure out the translation.Start with a simple word with one syllable. You can use something simple like “house” or, “h-opp ouse”

, Think of a short sentence that you’d like to translate. Say it out loud to yourself, then try to translate it into Oppish. For example, you could say “I feel hungry,” and then translate it to “I f-opp eel h-opp ungr-opp y.”


Try to practice until you can say a sentence fluently, as though Oppish came naturally to you.

, For some people, this may be the most difficult part of having a conversation! However, if you’ve decided to learn Oppish, chances are that you already know at least one other Oppish speaker. Ask them if they’d be willing to help you practice.Some people use Oppish as a secret language because they don’t want to be overheard by others. These people may not want to help someone else learn their secret code.

, As with any language, you need to build up slowly. You can begin with simple greetings and conversations such as, “H-opp ell-opp o. H-opp ow ar-opp e y-opp ou t-opp od-opp ay?”


If your partner starts off speaking very quickly or using complex words, you can ask them to slow down. You can say, “I’m h-opp av-opp ing a h-opp ard t-opp ime und-opp er-opp st-opp and-opp ing y-ou. C-opp an w-opp e pl-opp ease sl-opp ow d-opp own?”

, Once you’re able to easily understand your conversation partner, you can build your skills with more complex words and sentences. You may still have a hard time speaking Oppish fluently, but keep practicing.


If you know multiple people who speak Oppish, try talking with more than one person. People will speak slightly differently, so it’s good to practice with multiple partners.
You may be able to find videos online of people speaking Oppish. You can watch these videos to practice understanding others.

Translate the passage into Double Dutch.,
Have a conversation with a friend or partner who speaks Double Dutch.,
Speak Double Dutch at least once a day.,
Translate television shows and movies into Double Dutch.",How to Speak Double Dutch," The Double Dutch alphabet uses the same alphabet order as English, from A-Z. However, in Double Dutch, each letter is given several extra letters to create words and sounds that appear like a nonsensical version of the English alphabet. The Double Dutch alphabet is:A - “a-va-gaa”
B - “b-bee”
C - “c-va-gee”
D - “d-va-gee”
E - “e-va-gee”
F - “ev-a-gef”
G - “g-va-gee”
H - “h-va-gach”
I - “i-va-gi”
J - “j-va-gay”
K - “k-va-gay”
L - “ev-a-gel”
M - “ev-a-gem”
N - “ev-a-gen”
O - “o-va-go”
P - “p-va-ee”
Q - “q-va-gu”
R - “r-va-ga”
S - “ev-a-gess”
T - “t-iv-a-gee”
U - “u-va-gu”
V - “viv-a-gee”
W - “duvagub-buvagle-u-va-gu”
X - “ev-a-gex”
Y - “y-va-guy”
Z - “ziv-a-gee”
You may notice that almost every letter of the Double Dutch alphabet begins with the applicable English letter, i.e. “v” in Double Dutch is “viv-a-gee”. Several letters also end with the English letter they represent, i.e. “s” in Double Dutch is “ev-a-gess” and “n” in Double Dutch is “ev-a-gen”.
The English letters are used as a jumping off point for the Double Dutch letters, where the English letters are obscured just enough to sound like gibberish. The more you practice speaking the Double Dutch alphabet, the less like gibberish it will sound to you. Keep in mind you can always use English as a reference point for Double Dutch.;
, Forming words and phrases in Double Dutch does not require an extensive knowledge of the Double Dutch alphabet, as words are formed in Double Dutch based on syllable breaks. The English word is broken into syllables and then each syllable is broken into two. The word “vag” is them placed between them. The letter before “vag” is repeated after the “vag” and the letter after “vag” is also repeated.For example, if you translate a name like “Mary” into Double Dutch, you will need to separate the word into its syllables: “Mar-y”. Then, you will break up the syllables into two: “Ma-r-y”. You will then place “vag” between each separate syllable and repeat the letter before the “vag” and the letter after the “vag”. So “Ma-r-y” becomes “Ma-va-gar-r-va-ga-ry” in Double Dutch.
It may take practice and patience to remember to split the syllables and place “vag” in the correct places. It may help to write down the words in Double Dutch first and then practice pronouncing them out loud.

, Once you start to get more familiar with translating words into Double Dutch, you can string these words together to create simple and complete phrases in Double Dutch. Again, you may want to write down these phrases to ensure you translate each word properly and then practice reciting them out loud.For example, if you are translating the familiar English phrase, “Mary had a little lamb”, you will need to translate “Mary” (Ma-va-gar-r-va-ga-ry), “had” (ha-va-gad), “a” (a-va-ga), “little” (li-va-g-t-va-gle), “lamb” (la-va-game). The complete phrase in Double Dutch would be: “Ma-va-gar-r-va-ga-ry ha-va-gad a-va-ga li-va-gi-t-va-gle la-va-gamb”.
You can also practice translating other conversational phrases like “hello, how are you?” In Double Dutch, this would be: “he-va-gel-llo-vago, h-va-ghow a-va-gare y-va-gyou?”
A response like “fine, thank you” would be “fi-va-gi-ne, th-va-gh-ank y-va-gyou” in Double Dutch.

, Practice more complex words and phrases by choosing a favorite passage from a book or information from a document or article and translating it into Double Dutch. Try to use a passage that is in modern English as texts that are in Old English or Middle English may be more difficult to translate.


You may use a passage from Virginia Woolf’s novel To the Lighthouse as an example: “They do not feel a thing there, Cam thought, looking at the shore, which, rising and falling, became steadily more distant and more peaceful. Her hand cut a trail in the sea, as her mind made the green swirls and streaks into patterns and, numbed and shrouded, wandered in imagination...”, Take your time as you do this, as it can be a useful exercise for getting used to applying Double Dutch to English quickly and efficiently. This can bring you one step closer to being a fluent Double Dutch speaker.


Translated into Double Dutch, the passage from Woolf’s To the Lighthouse would be: “Thvaghey dvago nvagnot fvagfeel avaga thavaghing thavaghere, Cavagam thvaghouvaguvaguht, lovagookvagkvagking avagat tvagthe shvaghore, whvaghich, rivagisvagsing avagand favagallvagling, bevagecame stvagteavagavagadivagily mvagore divagisvagstant avagnd movagre peavagavagcevageful.

, The best way to practice conversational Double Dutch is to talk to someone who also speaks or is learning to speak Double Dutch. This will allow you both to have fun speaking Double Dutch and teach each other new words or add to your growing Double Dutch vocabulary.


This could a simple back and forth conversation like:
“Hevagelllovago, hvaghow avagare yvagyou?”
“Fivagine, thvaghank yvagyou. Hvaghow avagare yvagyou?”
“Ivagi gvagood, thvaghanks.”
“Sevagee yvagyou lavagater.”
“Bvagbye!”

, To get in the habit of speaking Double Dutch with others, you should commit to speaking Double Dutch at least once a day for the same amount of time every day. You could read books out loud in Double Dutch, write in your journal in Double Dutch and read it out loud, or have a set Double Dutch practice time with a friend who also speaks Double Dutch. The more you use this fictional language, the better you will get at speaking it fluently.

, Watch your favorite television show and repeat back the dialogue in Double Dutch or write down the character’s dialogue and translate it into Double Dutch. Do the same thing with movies you enjoy. This will help you get better at conversational Double Dutch, especially if you are translating character dialogue and character interactions.

Substitute each letter for another letter.,
Swap the vowels of the alphabet (A, E, I, O, U).,
Practice speaking and writing your new language.,
Decide how to share the language with friends.",How to Make Your Own Secret Language1," Decide which letters in the regular alphabet will be swapped out for new letters in your alphabet. This is a great way to create a new language, because you can use letters that you and your friends already know. Some letters can remain the same if you'd like, or you can change every letter.


For example, you can substitute each letter with the letter directly after it (A=C, B=D, C=E, D=F). This would be much easier to understanding in writing, because you could decode it. Speaking this language may be more difficult.
You could also substitute every letter except for the vowels. For example, H=J because I(the letter in between) is a vowel. This will make it much easier if you want to be able to speak this language.;
, Swap them so that A is E, E is I, I is O, O is U and U is A. This will allow each word in your language to have a vowel, making the language much easier to understand and pronounce when speaking. The language is simple enough for you and your friends to easily learn, but difficult enough for an unfamiliar listener or reader to not understand what you'r saying.


For example, ""I love you"" would become ""O luvi yua.""
Another example would be ""Hello, how are you?"" turning into ""Hillu, huw eri yua?""

, Write words over and over again, practice having conversations with your friends, write notes back and for the to each other in a notebook, or send each other messages online. The more you write and speak your language, the faster it will become second nature to you.

, You’ll either want to create a simple substitution rule that can be memorized and easily decoded by those who know the secret language, or make a cheat sheet / rule sheet if you’d like a code that’s tougher to break. If you decide to go with a tougher code, make sure that all of your friends get a copy of your language code so that they can communicate with you.

Create a list of words to use in your new language.,
Change the meaning of existing words.,
Make a dictionary that reveals the definitions of your new words.",How to Make Your Own Secret Language2," Choose unique words that you don't typically use in an average day. These can be big words, names of celebrities or athletes, names of sports or hobbies, etc. You will use these words to replace names, locations, activities, etc. in your new language. Using this technique is a much faster and simpler way to create your own language.


For example, if you and your friends are basketball fans, create a list of well-known players, and use their names as substitutes for certain people.
If you want to keep things simple, focus on only replacing words that are verbs or emotions. This can change the entire meaning to a sentence without changing every word.

, Replace the meanings of words that already exist to give them your new meanings. Get together with your friends and have a brainstorming session. Write down the words of your language and their new meanings so that nobody forgets.


Try to use words that have very different meanings so that your language isn't hard to figure out. For example, use the word taco for hate. So if your sentence was originally ""I hate math"", your new sentence is ""I taco math.""

, This will help each of your friends to decipher it quickly before the words are learned. Store it on your phones or computers so that you can access the diary quickly.


This dictionary should be akin to an actual dictionary. It should list the words in your made up language, and define what they actually mean in your native language.
This dictionary doesn't have to include every single word in a real dictionary, as many of the words will mean the same thing. It should include all of the words that you have changed the meaning of."
"
Choose a prefix or suffix to add onto words.,
Add your chosen prefix or suffix to words.,
Create this language with friends.",How to Make Your Own Secret Language3," Popular ""secret"" languages, such as Pig Latin and Kimono Jive, simply add prefixes and suffixes to already existing words. This makes languages much easier to learn and communicate with.


Take Pig Latin for example. To speak in pig latin, you simply move the first letter of the word to the end and then add an “ay” sound. Therefore, banana would become “ananabay.""
Now, make up your own prefix or suffix to use. Let's say you choose to use the prefix ""ho"" for every word and also move the first letter of the word to the end of the word. Therefore, the word speaker would become ""hopeakers,""

, Begin implementing your new language system in your everyday conversations with your friends. It will take awhile for you to develop a natural ability to speak in your new language, so be patient with yourself.


Try out basic sentences to start with. For example, using the previously mentioned language structure, ""This is my new language"" would become ""Hohist is my hoewn hoanguagel.""Many made up languages don't alter shorter words that are harder to transfer, such as to, by, of, on, etc. It's recommended to keep these words the same to make your language easier to write, pronounce, and understand.

, Secret languages are no fun if you don't have anyone to talk to! Once you get a few friends involved, make sure that you can all agree on your new language system so that everyone is comfortable speaking it and writing it.

Create an alphabet of symbols.,
Make a dictionary of your language symbols.,
Practice how to write and read in your language daily.",How to Make Your Own Secret Language4," If you're a visual or creative person, making up symbols for your new language can be a great way to secretly communicate with your friends. These symbols can represent entire words instead of creating a whole new alphabet. This is an option if you're fine with only being able to write your made up language. However, if you want to speak your secret language, this isn't the best method to use.


Reference other languages that use symbols for their written language to get inspiration for your symbols. Some languages that use symbols for words are Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphics., Make sure that the alphabet and dictionary have been agreed to by everyone involved. It's ideal to make symbols that are easy to draw so that your friends with poor drawing skills can still use the language. Making symbols for words instead of letters will make for a much simpler language to learn, and a much easier diary to create. Make sure that all of your friends get a copy of this dictionary.

, This way, you can have it memorized close to the same degree you have of your native/first language. Keep practicing and using it often, as new languages are easy to forget.

Multiple-choice tests often provide two similar answers, so focus on key concepts in your studying. Knowing how to study for exams will target your studying and make it more efficient.
Budget your time to make sure you have allowed enough time at the end of the test to review your answers and ensure that you enter them correctly onto the answer sheet.;
, Is it better to leave an answer blank or to make a random guess? The answer will differ in each case, as it depends on the specific policy of each multiple choice test. In some tests you can gain a point for a random guess (assuming that you get it right), but in others a point (or fraction of a point) is deducted for each wrong answer, so guessing is a bad idea that can lose you serious points. Thinking in advance will save you time when it counts in the exam.


Ask your instructor or the test setting body what the scoring policy is.
Make the best decision for your particular test and remind yourself of your strategy before you go in.
In tests where you lose only a fraction of a point for a wrong answer but earn a full point for a correct answer, such as the SAT, you may benefit from taking a guess -- especially if you can eliminate obviously wrong answers., Know what tactics will increase your confidence, and which triggers will knock it. This knowledge will let you seek out and use the best relaxation methods that work for you. Learning how to manage it is the best tactic to succeed under test conditions.


Use online resources to help you identify, manage and reduce your stress levels to deal with your exam stress and reduce stress through exercise.

Exam anxiety happens to everyone, but giving in will simply hand you two problems to deal with instead of one.

, Once the clock is ticking you might be tempted to race to the answers, but time spent correctly interpreting the questions is critical. This is what will truly save you time when it comes to picking the correct answers. Questions give away a lot of information, so read them closely. Always try to think of the correct answer before you look at the multiple answers provided.Cover the answers while you read the question so that you can think without being distracted.
Read all the possible answers. B may be true but remember that it might be in a list of answers in which all are true - making D “all of the above” the correct answer.

, If you cannot answer a question within the time limit which you calculated, move and on and plan to return to it later. Mark any questions you didn't answer with a clear, bold mark to make sure you see them on your second pass through the test.Remain alert as you work through the paper for hints that might help you to answer the questions that you are unsure of.
Set aside some time at the end of the test to return to the answers that you were unsure of.
Make sure to skip the question spot on your answer sheet as well, especially if you are using a scantron. You don't want to end up with a bunch of answers wrong because you filled in the bubbles incorrectly.

, Note or circle the most important words in the question. The specific words used can be incredibly useful tools in finding the right answer. Look for these details in each multiple choice answer. The correct answer must match every part of the question, so pay attention to negatives (“none,” “not,” “neither”), superlatives (“most,” “best”), and qualifiers (“usually,” “often,” “generally” “may.”)Watch out for negatively worded questions, as they can confuse you into picking the wrong answer.
Options that use the words ""not,"" ""none"" or ""never” can turn a true statement into a false one.

, Be wary of questions containing absolutes (“always,” “never,” “every.”) For them to be true there must be no room for alternatives. Watch out for ""none of the above"", or ""all of the above.”If you know that more than one of the answers are correct or incorrect, then the correct answer has to be one of these answers.
If one of the options seems completely out of place, then it’s probably because it doesn’t belong there.

, Cross off any answer that does not match. Correct answers can sometimes be found by looking at the tense of the word, and comparing it to the endings of the various possible answers.


If the question indicates that the answer should end in ""-ing"" but only one of the answer choices does and the rest of the choices end in ""-ed"" this may be the correct answer.
If the question ends with ""a"" or ""an,"" then the first word of the correct answer will most likely match that given article.

, Strike out obviously false answers. This means using logic to rule out answers that don’t make sense, or don’t fully answer the question. Working from two or even three options instead of four will seriously improve your chances.Treat each answer as a true or false question. Cross out any options that are not true. For instance if you know it is definitely not ‘D’ cross it out.
Look for pairs - either two answers that are opposites or two that are identical apart from one word. This is a common tactic of test-setters to separate those who really know the topic from those with a surface understanding of it. In such pairs, one of these may well be the correct answer as the other is worded to distract you from it.

, There are many urban myths about tricks to pass multiple choice tests, but if you must gamble it is wiser to take advice from studies which have looked at the statistical probability of patterns in multiple choice tests.Try choosing the longest answer. It may be more likely to be the correct one because the instructor may have added qualifiers.Ignore the rule that you should never change your first choice. Use your reasoning skills on a case-by-case basis to decide if you should change an answer.

, Now that you have implemented your tactics for answering as many questions as possible it is time to use your pre-planned strategy. You have read all the information provided and now you can bring this knowledge to use in the time slot that you allotted to review the questions with fresh eyes.Think back over the other questions - you may have picked up hints or had your memory jogged by working through the other answers.
Implement your strategy on whether to guess or leave blanks.

, Be very careful about how you fill out the answer sheet. Entering an answer in the wrong space can have a domino effect; that is, not only is that answer incorrect but every subsequent answer will be incorrect. To avoid this be sure to transfer all your answers to the answer sheet at the same time after completing all the questions.


Be sure that you have filled the appropriate answer spaces. If you are leaving an answer blank, be sure that the next answer you enter is in the correct space.

, Make sure you remove any stray marks or notes which could confuse the person who will be marking your test. If you are using a scantron sheet, make sure your answer bubbles are thoroughly darkened and any erasures are fully erased.

Understand what Nadsat is.,
Carefully analyze each sentence.,
Compile your own glossary of Nadsat-to-Enligh translations.,
Mentally replace the Nadsat words with English.","How to Understand the 'Nadsat' Argot In ""A Clockwork Orange"""," Nadsat is a fictional language mainly derived from Russian words, but with an Anglicized twist. For example, the Russian word “golova” (which translates into something along the lines of “head”) is written as “gulliver” in the book. While the words are spelled differently than their Russian counterparts, many words (such as ""gulliver"") still retain the original Russian meaning. There are words of other origins as well, such as French, German, and even some that Burgess invented.;
, Don’t just read it. . . comprehend it! Dissect the meaning and emotion behind the Nadsat lingo. Some of the more common words like “viddy,” “droog,” and “tolchock” will be easy to grasp, while some of the less common ones like “yeckat,” “zoobies,” and “vareet” will require a bit more contextual analysis. Use context clues to help you extrapolate your own definition.


Here's an excerpt from Part 1, Chapter 1: ""There was a doddery starry schoolmaster type veck, glasses on and his rot open to the cold nochy air.""

From this sentence, we'd be able to immediately deduce a few things: we know that it mentions an old school professor (""schoolmaster"" should give that away), he has glasses on, and some part of his body is open to the cold air (not many parts of the body can open or close, so it'd be either the eyes or the mouth (and for the sake of brevity, it's the mouth)).
Here's what that same sentence would look like in normal English: ""There was a strange old school professor, glasses on and his mouth open to the cold night air.""


, Whenever you have an indication of what a word may mean, write your interpretation on a piece of paper for future reference. Go back after you’ve finished the chapter and see if still makes sense.

, Once you’ve finished the book and have accumulated a sizeable glossary of the most commonly used Nadsat words (or better yet, memorized them), reread the book and mentally replace the Nadsat argot with real tangible English words. Once you can read the book without thinking what the words mean, you've mastered the language!

Take good notes over the course of your classes to make sure you'll have a good resource to study when it comes time for the exams. Highlight important material for the books to make it easier to find at a glance.


During lectures, learn to recognize digressions your teacher might go on and important information that seems central to the topics. Teachers like to talk. Don't confuse their enthusiastic details for something you'll be tested over later.Look back over lectures and notes the night after your classes to make sure the information is lodged in your mind. If you get it in the first time, you won't have to worry about playing catch up in the few hours you've got before test time.;
, Will it be multiple choice? Essay? Short answer? A mixture of many different types? If you know what sort of activity you'll be required to perform, you can prepare appropriately.


Ask your instructor about the possibility of sample tests or for a list of concepts that will be covered on the test. If you can get hold of an older version to use for practice, time yourself taking it to make sure you'll be able to finish your work in the amount of time allotted.
Look in your textbook for sample quizzes or tests that you might use for practice. Even if the format isn't the same, you'll be testing yourself on the content, which is the most important thing.

, Instead of focusing on memorizing every tiny detail, date, and formula you might need for the test, study the broad concepts and the ideas to make sure you have an understanding of the material. Tests are usually designed to test this kind of knowledge, rather than tiny details.


In your textbook, focus on bolded vocabulary and subject headings. You don't need to waste a lot of study-time reading over the chapters word-for-word. Learn the basic concepts and skim the rest.Look back over your lecture notes. What themes or ideas repeat? What did your teacher focus on talking about?

, A common mistake some students make is in reading endlessly, usually while television or music blares in the background, or right before bed when your brain is worn out and less useful. Take a more active approach to your study and treat it like an activity. Make lists, write notes about what you're reading, and look for the connections between ideas. 30 minutes of studying in this way will be worth 2 hours of passive reading.


Also know that there's no magic to writing. Recopying a classmate's notes because you think it'll be more active than reading them won't help you retain the information any more than reading it. Read and write, actively thinking about the concepts and forming your own ideas. If you do copy a classmate's notes, put them in your own words to force yourself to digest the information.

, If you're being tested over things you studied in a particular book, whether it be a textbook, novel, or other kind of reading, familiarize yourself with the main ideas. It's not a great idea to try to cram in a word-for-word reading the night before the test, so focus on the big ideas.


If you're studying for a broader range of subjects, get a study book appropriate to the test you'll be taking. SAT, ACT, and other entrance examinations regularly provide materials for you to study before taking the test, so you can prepare for the vocabulary and themes that you'll be tested over.

, Studies have shown that studying the same material in different locations makes it easier to remember. Even walking around your house and studying in different rooms can have a helpful effect on your ability to recall the information when you need it. During the test, you might find yourself remembering ""I read about that at the library,"" which will help you recall information.Try chewing gum when you study and then chewing the same gum during the test (if this is allowed). Sometimes repeating a similar activity helps your brain find the same avenue that you were in during study sessions.
If you'll be tested over vocabulary, hang words and their definitions around your house. Change them out regularly when you become familiar with them so you can work your way through a vocabulary list without much extra effort on your own part.

, The day of the test, stop studying. If you don't know it by now, trying to memorize a few extra words right before the test is only going to push out what you've already put in, stress you out, and make it worse.


Prepare enough before the test so you can relax on the day of the exam and focus on taking the test itself. Eat a good breakfast, get enough sleep the night before, and relax. Settle in for a long test.

, As soon as you get the test, flip through it and briefly examine all the questions. Look for the different types of information you'll need to use and the different tasks you'll have to perform. Get a sense of how long it'll take you to perform the different parts of the test and then get started quickly.


You don't need to take a bunch of time reading every question without answering them, just scan through the test to see what's there. This should take no more than a minute or two at the most.

, Consider starting with the most time-consuming aspects of the test to make sure you'll have enough time to complete them. Start with the most difficult parts, or the parts you want to do the least. Get them out of the way and settle in for the easier sections that you'll be able to do more quickly.


When you look over the test, do a quick calculation of how long each part should take. Say you're taking a test and there's an essay component worth 25 points and multiple choice questions worth 50 points. You've got 45 minutes to complete it. You might take 5 minutes to plan for the essay and 10-15 minutes to write it, using the rest of the time on the multiple choice components. If you're writing and 20 minutes have passed, you know it's time to wrap up and move on quickly.

, Sometimes, in one part of the test, the test will teach you things you need to know in another part of the test. Look for context clues that will help make sure you're on the right track and you're not making an obvious mistake.


If a multiple choice question is ""Who was the first person to walk on the moon?"" and an essay question is ""Describe the impact of Neil Armstrong's moonwalk"" you won't have to think very hard about the question.
There probably won't be obvious answers, but you can at least use the wording of the questions to help jog your memory and recall the information you studied.

, Teachers aren't that different than students. Writing a test isn't much fun. To try to spice things up and make it more entertaining, some teachers will throw in obviously-wrong answers and things that are completely unrelated to the subject to try to throw you off. Eliminate these to give yourself fewer choices and make the test simpler.


Only consider vocabulary, ideas, and names that you recognize as possible answers. Don't worry about ""trick"" questions. If it feels like you remember it in your gut but you're not sure, go with it.

, Don't spend 10 minutes wracking your brain over a single multiple choice question. Move on to other questions and use that time effectively. Go back through and answer the questions again when they come back to you.


If an answer doesn't come to you after a few seconds of looking at it, put a check mark beside it and move on to the next question. When you look back through the test, look for your check marks and make educated guesses, or see if you remember them after a second look.

, It can be tempting to jump straight into the writing phase, especially if you're a slower writer. It's a much better idea, though, to spend a few minutes planning out what you'll say and doing a brief outline of the main concepts you'll need to write about to get a good score on the essay.


Don't make a formal outline (no roman numerals!). try to think of the main points you need to hit in the essay and write them in an ordered list.
Don't waste time trying to ""sound smart"" in an essay test. They won't be grading your mellifluous prose, they'll be checking to see if you've understood the content and can say something complicated about it. They'll be willing to overlook spelling and punctuation errors at the expense of content.

, An educated guess is better than a blank space. Look at the questions you're not sure of and try to eliminate obviously wrong answers, trying to fill it in with something that'll be at least in the ballpark. You don't need to spend a whole mess of time thinking about questions you don't know the answer to. If you know you don't know it, make a guess and move on. Don't dwell on it. Study more next time.

, If you've budgeted your time well, try to save yourself enough time at the end to check back over the test and make sure you haven't made any obviously-wrong choices, that you've answered every question, and that you've done the best you can possibly do. If you finish and still have 15 or 20 minutes to go, don't turn it in right away and sit like a bump on a log. Check over it, think about your answers, and use the time you've got.


Don't be afraid to go back and change your answers. If you second-guess yourself, make changes when they occur to you.

, You're done! Don't worry about your score or that pesky equation you weren't sure you got right. Put the exam to the back of your mind and worry about other things. If you've got another essay to take, start focusing in on preparing for the new set of tasks you'll have to perform. Reset the clock and chill out. You're almost there!


It's common to experience a ""test hangover,"" continually going back over the test and remembering points that you should have made, better ways to have written, etc. Don't go look up the right answers or spend more time dwelling on it. It's over. Move on.

, When you get your score back and it's an A+, great! Keep doing what you're doing. If you get your score back and it's something less than great, learn from it and study next time. Dwell on neither good nor bad scores. It's common for students who get good scores on exams to slack off as the year progresses, getting a worse score the next time. Don't let that happen. You're not a genius.

, If the girl who sits next to you got an A+, don't let yourself feel rotten because your highest grade all semester has been a B. try to improve. You don't have to be her. Don't get caught up in a comparison that'll stress you out and make you feel inadequate. As long as you're doing your best and improving your own scores and skills, that's all you can do.

, If you get a test back and it's not as good as you hoped it would be, make an appointment to talk to your teacher about it. Meet calmly and rationally to ask how you might improve for the next exam. Ask ""I was hoping for a better score this time around. What do you think I could do better next time?"" This both shows your teacher that you're committed to improvement and concerned about your own success.


This is especially smart and effective for essay tests. Ask the instructor to explain any comments you don't understand and accept their explanations. Don't argue.

Never ask your teacher to change your grade. Whining about a bad score and coming up with excuses for why it should be better is immature and undignified. No teacher gives a score because they don't like you personally or have some stake in your failure. A score is something you earn, not something that is given arbitrarily.

Miupla Xeti Dn has a simple key - the two first letters of each word are put together to create one word.,
For example, ""How are you?"",
Then you would take the next two letters (in this situation there are not two letters left, so you would just take the remaining letters), ""W"", ""E"", and ""U."",
The result would be ""Hoaryo weu?"",
Miupla Xeti Dn has the same punctuation as English, so it is simple and easy to use.

Make a schedule. Your life is probably jam packed with hobbies, social obligations, and a whole bunch of stuff you'd rather be doing. So make a schedule and stick to it.



 


Get all your papers. Even those assignments you completed a long time ago may come in handy. It's vital to have the most important thing of them all - your syllabus.






Get everything you could possible need. From paper clips to highlighters to extra pillows, get it now.






Have water, something healthy, and something not so healthy (recent studies say dark chocolate increases cognitive function!). If you're feeling sluggish, have some caffeine. Don't feel bad about the extra large latte -- caffeine (at least in moderate amounts) can totally up your game.;
, So you manned up and set aside a 2 hour chunk this Thursday for studying history. Awesome -- that's step 1. Now actually make it useful! Devote this Thursday to the Seven Years' War. Monday you can read about the French Revolution and next Wednesday you'll make it all the way to Napoleon and his delusions of grandeur. Have specific goals in mind -- whether it be by concepts, time, or number of pages or chapters. It'll seem infinitely more doable.


If you have more than one exam to take, be sure to balance them out as need be. You don't need to study the same amount -- concentrate on the harder one. You can use the other subject for a break from the other if you're really strapped for time.

, The great thing about studying is that you can do it however you want to. So take that naptime of a lecture you were victim of and turn it into something enjoyable. Something that you'll remember.

Use highlighters to highlight important information. Use one color for main concepts, one color for vocabulary, and another color for dates, etc. When you go over your notes, they'll be that much easier to skim.






Make your own charts, graphs, and diagrams from the information. Pictures are so much easier to look at and to recall when you're sitting at that desk at test time. 40% of all carbon emissions come from the agricultural industry? Sounds like time for a pie chart.






It may actually benefit you to rewrite your notes. Studies show that exposing yourself to the information in different ways (that is, instead of just reading it, you're writing it, too) makes it stick in your mind longer.But don't rewrite them all -- stick to a loose outline.







, In one study session, all the science is pointing to studying different concepts in different places. Turns out that when your brain is bored with reading about photosynthesis while sitting in your bedroom that it'll actually do you good to go to the cafe and start reading up on Punnett squares. Here's the gist:

Study in different places.Turns out our brains make associations between our surroundings and what's going on. The more associations you have, the stronger the connection.






Study different concepts.You wouldn't expect a basketball player to work on his lay-ups for three hours straight, right? Same goes for students. If you do division problem after division problem, your brain is going to go on autopilot. Work on different concepts to keep your brain from turning to mush.







, It's not slacking -- it's you supercharging. It's science you can blame -- it says that breaks help your brain get back into the game and replenish your attentional deficits.So take a 5 or 10 minute break every hour.It'll help -- not hinder -- your memory and focus.


If you really want to get serious, take that break to do some jumping jacks or go for a quick jog. Getting your blood pumping gets your brain pumping. Also, if you can sneak off to the gym for a bit, even better. It turns out that exercise can increase work stamina., This seems like logic, but too many of us just read concepts over and over waiting for them to cement themselves and magically make sense -- when all we need to do is back up for a second and then let it all fall into place. Before you spend hours reading things you don't quite get, work on the bigger picture. See the painting before you can zoom in on the details.


Outlines will help with this -- it's part of the reason your syllabus is so helpful. If you don't already have one, create one. Then you can concentrate on a portion of the outline at a time.

, The best study groups have no more than 3-4 people, and the best study groups are extremely effective (if you work well with people, that is). In order to make sure your study group gets you where you need to be and isn't just you and three friends eating snacks and discussing the latest TV shows, keep this information in mind:Have one person designated as the leader (you can take turns if need be). They have to keep the group on track.






Establish what you're studying and how before you meet up. Having goals makes them easier to reach.






Have everyone come prepared as much as possible. One person who's slacking and doesn't take it seriously will ruin the whole group. If that happens, kick them out. Seriously.






Bring food, drinks, and make it as fun as possible. Quiz each other, start discussions, and make the information interactive. The more stimulating it is, the more you'll remember it when test time comes around.







, The fact of the matter is that everyone is different. Some studies say that you should study just before bed or just upon waking -- those are times when your brain is the most likely to ingest the information and retain it.Others say that your golden ticket is in the afternoon.Some people work well in groups while others prefer to be alone. At the end of the day (figuratively, not literally), do what seems to work for you.


While some studies say that the whole what-type-of-learner-are-you stuff is nonsense, you may want to give it a shot anyway. Do you prefer listening to new content? Reading? Talking about it? Which way helps you remember it? Focus on that methodology when you're studying.

, If you get stressed out about tests, the anxiety will the-opposite-of help you. It's in your best interest to be as calm as possible. Here are some ideas to get your zen flowing:


Do yoga. It turns out that yoga can help with anxiety and your attention span.And if it burns calories, that's a triple threat!







Do meditation. You probably already know that meditation leads to lower stress levels and less anxiety.Just a few minutes a day may be all you need.






Sniff some essential oils for a blast of aromatherapy. Taking a whiff of lavender or rosemary can actually reduce your test anxiety.Could it be easier than that?







, In order to function at 100%, your brain needs sleep. Point blank. 8 hours is good spot to aim for, but anywhere from 7-9 should do the trick. If you don't get enough sleep, your attention, focus, and memory all suffer. So don't risk it!


In other words, don't stay awake and study all night. You won't be doing yourself any favors, and you definitely won't retain the information you were studying when you were half-awake on coffee and chocolate bars at four in the morning. If you ever find yourself in that position, know that you're better off going to sleep., Having the right diet before a test can also be the icing on the cake: if your body isn't feeling up to par, your mind is going to lag, too. Try to stay away from too much processed junk -- crashing from that constant sugar high won't be much fun.


Want some diet direction? Go for Omega 3s and 6s. These nutrients found in fish, nuts, and olive oil can actually help with test anxiety., Scientists are hard at work determining the link between creative potential and aerobic exercise -- turns out doing the latter increases the former for about 2 hours post-workout.So if your brain is feeling sluggish, turn to the pavement or the pool.


Even low-intensity workouts can do your test scores a favor. Studies show that those can make you more alert and energized, turning your brain on for test-dominating time., No, listening to classical music won't make you smarter, but listening to music you enjoy can boost your brain potential, sharpening your mental acuity temporarily after listening.So if the latest pop hits still make your toes curl, go for it, but if you prefer listening to melodic, uplifting beats, that's good too.


Actually, the above goes for anything. Have your favorite novel on CD? Throw it in. Anything that gets your happy receptors going gets the rest of your brain going as well.

, Turns out humans really are quite something: we're betting at recalling information if we're in a situation that mirrors when we first had access to it. In other words, did you study for your test in the library, wearing purple, and jazzed up on an energy bar? Then take your test in the library, wearing purple, and jazzed up on an energy bar.


It's called state and context-dependent memory. It even holds true if you were to study while drunk!So if you have access to wherever you're going to take the test, try studying there at the same time of day, with the same diet, and in the same mood.Yep, mood, too!

, You may think sleeping or studying is your best bet, but you've got to take care of your body. Studies show that those who had a complete breakfast before a test have remarkably better test scores. So take ten minutes out of your day to, quite literally, refuel.


We're not talking about a donut here -- we mean protein-packed, like eggs, oatmeal, or some low-fat dairy and lean meat. You've got to replenish your blood sugar and give your body some energy in order to do your best!

, When you sit down for that test, you shouldn't have a thing to worry about. Bring a handful of pencils, pens, erasers, your calculator, some scratch paper -- anything you could possibly need and then some more. Not only will being over-prepared relax you, but when problems do arise, you'll be ready!


Have a pocketful of peppermints while you're at it. Studies have shown that taking a whiff of peppermint increases your concentration abilities, makes you more alert, and gives you a tiny boost that can make all the difference. So if the answer is eluding you, pop a peppermint and then take another crack at it.

, Since your test is timed, the last thing you want to be is preoccupied by the clock. Instead of that ticking getting louder and louder as you stare at the blank question, just skip it. Tackle all the ones you could do with your eyes closed and your hands tied behind your back and then get to the harder questions. Your mind will be primed with everything it definitely knows, making the rest a bit easier.


When you've answered all of the easy ones, go for the ones that have the greatest point value. If you don't answer a question that's worth 10% of your grade, there's little hope for the rest of your test. So if you're in that position, weigh your options.

, If there's any chance you missed a question, misinterpreted a question, or just filled in the wrong circle, you'll know you've caught it if you check and double-check your answers (provided you have the time, of course). Also, remember to consider the most important of all -- did you write down your name?


Avoid the temptation to change your answers. Often your gut instinct is the right one. If you find yourself checking your answers and wanting to change them, only do so if you've had a revelation you had forgotten about.

, You know the whole ""fake it till you make it"" mantra? That totally goes for test taking. Thinking positive and being confident can actually help you do better -- if for no other reason than it keeps you relaxed (and being relaxed helps your mind think straight). Walk in there with your head held high so you can walk out the same way.


Turns out trusting yourself is a big part of the game. When you trust your memories, they strengthen and become concrete.So be confident in your brain! The more you rely on it, the more it can reward you with the right answers. In case you didn't know, your brain is pretty phenomenal!

Gather all of your materials the night before.",How to Pass a Private School Entrance Exam," There are a few different types of exams that you could be taking as an entrance exam. If you are not applying for a Catholic school, you will be taking either the ISEE or the SSAT.If you are applying for Catholic school, you will be taking one of these three exams: HSPT, COOP, or TACHS.The test needed will be specified by the school that you are applying for.
In addition to knowing which test you are taking, you need to know which level of the test you’ll be taking. The levels are based on which grade you will be entering.
For international schools, you will need to talk to the school directly about their entrance exam.;
, The main differences between the ISEE and SSAT are the guessing strategy, writing sample, and verbal section. The ISEE does not penalize for guessing while the SSAT does; the ISEE writing sample involves an expository essay while the SSAT is a creative writing prompt; and the ISEE has sentence completion while the SSAT uses analogies to test vocabulary.The Catholic school entrance exams are all quite similar and test both ability and achievement with no penalty for guessing and no essay., All of these exams test reading comprehension, mathematical achievement, verbal skills, and quantitative reasoning. Although the exams differ slightly in the way they test these skills, they all have multiple choice sections. The Catholic school exams do not have an essay.Purchasing a test prep book or looking at the information provided online will help you get an idea of what to expect from the exam.

, If you require extended time on an exam, make sure that you have all documentation submitted at least 5 weeks in advance of the test day.Verify with the testing site before test day that you will be given extended time.


You will need formal documentation of learning disabilities and a written statement from your school that verifies this.

, The most common way to register for the test is online. If your school is a testing center and you want to make sure you can take the exam in a familiar environment, register early to guarantee your preferred test site.After registration you will receive a verification letter. Check over the verification letter to make sure there are no mistakes. Make sure to call the testing office and correct mistakes if there are any.

, A few months before the exam, take a diagnostic test to see what your strengths and weaknesses are. The diagnostic test is usually a full-length practice test. After scoring, you will know what areas you need to spend more or less time studying.Don’t be discouraged if you do poorly. Make sure you have plenty of time to study and boost your scores by starting at least 3 months ahead of time.

, The verbal portion of the exam will test your vocabulary skills either through sentence completion or analogies. If you don’t have a strong vocabulary, this section will be very difficult. Making and studying vocabulary flashcards is an easy way to strengthen these skills.Aim to learn 20 new words a week. If you start studying three months in advance, you will have learned 240 new words by the exam day!

, Practice exams will give you a good idea of how much progress you are making in your studying. You can find practice exams online or in test prep books. As you continue in your studying, take practice tests to make sure you are improving.Take a practice test every two weeks to monitor your progress.

, The skills tested in these exams are ones that are learned over time, but a good test prep course can help you learn test taking strategies. Knowing how to stay calm during the test itself and knowing the types of questions that you will see are very helpful ways to prepare.You can also purchase a test prep book to help familiarize you with the test and questions.

, Practicing the essay will make you comfortable writing under a time constraint. It will also strengthen your writing skills with each essay you complete. Aim to complete at least one practice essay a week with writing prompts from practice tests.


The more you practice, the easier the actual exam will be.

, If you feel like you need to do a bit more studying, make sure you do it in the afternoon, long before bedtime. Stop studying at least two hours before bed and relax. Read something for fun or do some other activity that you enjoy.If you are a parent, encourage your child to stop studying and enjoy the rest of their evening.

, Go to bed at your normal bedtime or even a little bit earlier. A full night’s sleep is important for you to be alert and in the best state to take a test. These exams are long and you need to be fully awake for the whole thing.Set an alarm for the morning to make sure you’re up in plenty of time.

, You don’t want to be starving during the test. Your brain needs fuel just like your body does before exercise. Eat a healthy, balanced breakfast before leaving for the test. If your test is in the afternoon, eat a good lunch.Scrambled eggs, some fruit, and a glass of milk make for a great breakfast.

, For the test itself you will need pens and pencils. Have at least one backup of both. Also, pack a water bottle and some snacks for the breaks in the middle in case you get hungry.Having everything ready to go and by the door will make your morning more relaxed and less of a scramble.

Prepare for class.,
When you go home, take your notes and/or textbook.,
Review the new concepts and processes, plus math tables, if any, that you need.,
Study the math theory.,
Eat a good breakfast.,
Take the test.,
Know how to use the whole time allotted for the math test.,
Master the art of multiple choice.,
Master the art of math homework.,
After you get the marked test back, review your mistakes.,
Take your math scores to the next level, not only ensuring that you get all of your homework done as described above (by redoing the homework until it is all correct--and then giving it another go), but about a week or maximum two weeks before the exam, not only continue to do the homework -- but also take extra time each night to redo every single past homework problems that will be tested on the exam.,
Experiment, if you have a problem you can't figure out -- or if you can't remember a rule: Use simple numbers to simplify it to its easiest form to work through by, for instance, substituting in the smallest numbers possible to determine the solution.,
Choose between reading the text and getting problems done: The solution is always to do problems (sigh of relief).,
Learn more than one way to understand the subject (develop depth in whatever you are studying) and enjoy the good results!,
Think positively to improve your confidence and effectiveness on the test.",How to Pass a Math Test," This is your main job (full-time if possible), and ""choose to enjoy yourself doing your job"": Before the new semester classes start, at vacation time, don't take the time off to relax, but, instead, get your math text (buy one or pay a deposit, if necessary) as soon as your prior semester lets out and as soon as the texts are posted. Then, when you get the text, inquire with your teacher, if possible, where to start, but start studying in any case. By the time classes start, you will have a solid handle on the subject.
But, it doesn't end there (prepare like that for any difficult/tricky class such as physics, biology, chemistry, law, computer language, or foreign language, etc.).



Pre-read each chapter and attempt to pre-do the problem set the day before they will be taught. Get extra traction, with this solid footing; you will know enough to sit at the front of the class and answer questions rapidly when asked, and ask questions for anything that may surprise you!

Engage in class: Near the front of the class, sitting up, leaning forward to make ""killer"" notes, fully prepared (neither lounging nor being stiff). Then answering questions spit-fire. It just reinforces the lesson! If you do this, and if you halfway like math (or if you previously hated math), it is almost guaranteed that math will take on new meaning for you, and you may even find yourself taking home the highest grade of the entire class! Even a student who failed his math previously may shock himself by scoring honors through using this and the following details of the method. You can, too!;
, If you didn't make any notes, spending all class doodling, or made bad notes, it's best to take home your textbook. If you make okay notes, take both. If you make awesome or ""killer"" notes on all of what your teacher says, you may not need your textbook, but you should take it home anyway, just in case.

, All too often, one makes the greatest flaws not because of not understanding the content, but because one makes a mistake on applying it. But, it's best to look over them, to be refreshed.

, Math theory is how to understand and do thought processes, starting with the simplest things. To study this, you can:


Look at the textbook. This is the basic method, unless you make good notes. However, the downside of using the textbook is that (i) you don't have those special connections that come with good notes and (ii) the textbook isn't usually very direct but is teaching the basics while you often need projections/variations of those.
Look at your notes. This is only a valid option, if you take good (killer) notes. If you, in some strange space-time paradox, take good notes and still fail math tests, then you should improve your notes (assuming the instructor covered the topic). They're usually faster and easier to learn from than your textbooks.

, It's hard to work on an empty stomach because of the mind-body connection (your lifestyle, good nutrition, and enough exercise) affect your enthusiasm and vigor. So, it's only natural that people who eat a balanced breakfast, with some protein and long lasting complex carbs, do better on tests: They're less stressed and have more long-term energy. And, don't overeat to avoid focusing on the discomfort.


Drink some water to keep hydrated. But, be careful drinking too much before a test because then you will have to use the bathroom, and lots of times you have to wait an hour before you are allowed to leave the room! There's nothing worse then trying to think while ""holding on"".

, Scan over the test as soon as you get it. Do the easy ones (that you know) quickly, first, then go back to the harder ones to work on them. Often, using some steps of the ones you know can help you do the more difficult ones.

, Start off by answering all of the questions you can do more quickly, even if you find nothing that seems to stand out, for finishing the other questions you didn't get at first. Mark a very small ""x"" next to your doubtful work results, to check later. Go through the exam again, erasing any tiny ""x"" that you can, repeating this elimination process -- until you come to a standstill, as follows:



Check/redo doubtful questions that you had marked, that you have tried/answered, without looking at your original answers to see whether another process comes to mind. If you come up with the same answer, make a small check mark, and proceed with redoing/double-checking the next unsure answer.

Don't accept either of the answers yet, if your second answer is different from your original solution: try again. This third try may confirm one of your two prior answers, otherwise decide which is probably better, and move on.

, Multiple choice questions are an art form. You need to have studied enough to know how to solve the problems independently in order to achieve high score. Go through the multiple choice, filling in answers by working out the solutions on extra/scrap paper.


On the original question sheet (that you are allowed to write on), place a small check mark beside the questions of which you are most certain and an ""x"" beside the ones you are not. This enables you to easily go back to identity questions that you should spend more time on. If your entire page starts as ""x""s, bear in mind that it may sometimes take several tries, combing through the exam before check marks begin to replace the ""x""s.
On your second run through of the exam, go to the ones you marked with an ""x"" and spend more time on them. Cover up your original work and answers, and rework the question on scrap paper. This will help you by going in with a fresh perspective and possibly get the correct answer.
Keep going through the exam in this process, and if you have time spend some ensuring that your multiple choice answers that you marked with a check mark are really correct.
It would be advisable to cross out/eliminate choices (on the sheet that you are able to write on) if the choice is probably wrong in order to limit the possible better choices, but some exam questions may not be suitable for this (i.e., it is not advisable to cross out strictly numerical responses until you try the problems, but in some worded questions there might be an internal contradiction or misuse of terms that makes the answer clearly incorrect).

, Some student are stricken by an inability to pass math, until learning a method for mastering math homework.


Have someone (a tutor) to help you work out of a question that you may be at a roadblock (but use the tutor sparingly).
Get a math book that works out similar problems in full (i.e., with a detailed answer key), so that you can learn how they were solved.
Work out each question and refer to the answer manual once you have finished. If you don't know how to solve some, refer to your math book or contact your tutor for guidance. Even if you rely heavily on the answer manual, try to finish the questions without copying the key.
Put aside the answer manual, and redo the questions a second time -- all of them. If you miss any, spend time at the end trying to work out the answer until you know how to do it. If you still can't get an answer, go to the detailed solutions manual or the tutor until you have it understood well enough to solve it yourself. But you are not finished. You keep up this process until you can answer all of the questions without any assistance. Once you answer all of the questions without any assistance whatsoever, you can stop -- although one more go through wouldn't hurt. Keep this process up each day, and bear in mind that although it requires time, still you will be rewarded very well when it comes to exam time.
Before exam time, ensure you take the time to redo all of the questions that you did in homework ""at least"" one more time through, and preferably until you get all of them right. If you do this, you will succeed remarkably at math - even if you feel like you cannot pass math, your marks will increase dramatically.

, As it's said on The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks, ""The zombie may be gone, but the threat lives on."" Well, in this case, the test may be gone, but the results live on. So it's best to get in some early study for your final or midterm exam, and ""plant the seeds.""

, If the exam covers 12 homework assignments, for instance, continue to not only do regular homework, but spend the time (time yourself) to finish the past 12 homework assignments within, say, 6 to 12 days, giving yourself one day to strengthen the overall review before the exam! If you continue to do all the regular assignments as described above, and do a review of the entire scope being tested over a week or two, it is almost guaranteed that your marks will skyrocket, and you might amaze yourself with the results!

, As an example, if you need to know what direction a parabola opens, try substituting in the equation a 0, a 1, and a -1 (easy, simple numbers), and see whether it gives you a sense of the direction. If you need more input, substitute in other odd numbers, or try evens (0, 2, -2) or multiples of ten for larger numbers. Trying to simplify a problem by such number substitutions often results in finding the solution to a very tricky question., How To Become A Straight-A Student (published in 2007 by Three Rivers Press), outlines how you should do all of the problems for the math assignment and only do the readings if, when they are covered in class, you don't understand the material (problems with solution sets are the very best, so opt for classes that have fully worked out solution manuals or go get a solutions manual for your topic, if one is available).



Do the whole assignment over to reinforce part you got right, also -- but when pressed for time, the marked missed-problems method will allow time for other activities in your life such as sports and writing for the school newspaper! What could be better than making the grades and having a life, too?

, This is like learning the principles, theorems and steps, but also learn any shortcuts to get the answer, but always work it out on the test as fully as is required by your teacher.

,


Nod ""Yes!"" and smile as you mentally pronounce the terms/topics while taking a final scan over your techniques/methods. This can cause confidence--instead of being nervous before the exam.
Be fresh and alert; so have a enough sleep the night before your test. Don't stay up too late while studying; that could cause you to be tired and not think so clearly on the test.

Go to class.,
Sit in the front row and participate in class.,
Do your homework.,
Ask questions.,
Review before the test.,
Relax.,
Pace yourself.,
Pay attention to neatness.,
Check your work.",How to Pass a Math Test or Paper With a Good Grade," Especially if you're in college, you may find it tempting to skip a class now and then. While you can get away with that in some subjects, math is like a ladder. If a rung is missing, or if you don't get a good grip on it, you'll struggle to reach the next rung. If enough rungs are missing, it will be impossible to climb higher. In addition (no pun intended), teachers often emphasize the most important topics in class, so come test time you'll know exactly what to study.;
, By sitting in the front row, distractions are minimized and performance heightened. Asking questions or providing answers helps the student to stay engaged in the learning process, thus improving attentiveness and retention of materials learned.

, Homework may seem like torture, but it's really designed to help you learn. The key to learning math is repetition: do enough problems with the quadratic formula, and you'll eventually be able to recite it in your sleep. Plus, as you do your homework, you'll be able to identify concepts you don't understand. It also doesn't hurt that test questions are often based on the homework assignments.

, OK, so you did your homework, but you still don't understand how to factor a polynomial. Go ahead and ask your teacher, TA, professor - even other students may be able to help. There's no such thing as a stupid question, and if you think it's embarrassing to ask a question imagine how you'll feel when you get a big red ""F"" on the exam. Everybody has questions about math; successful students ask theirs.

, Good job! You went to class, did your homework, and got your questions answered. Now, the test is tomorrow. Do you a) breathe a sigh of relief and go to bed; b) turn on the TV and watch the Simpsons; or c) review what you've learned? That's right, it's time to review. This is not the time for cramming, however; you're better prepared than that anyway. Go over your notes, take practice tests, and make sure you have important formulas memorized. Of course, you could just watch The Simpsons, but don't be surprised if your grades turn out more like Bart's than like Lisa's!

, Make sure you get a good night's sleep the night before the test. You'll feel better and think more clearly if you're well rested. Right before your test look over the important formulas one last time, but other than that, you're done preparing. Remember, you're ready for this, and no matter what happens it's not the end of the world.

, Once you have your exam in front of you, look it over to see how many questions there are and what kind of questions are included. This will give you an idea of how much time you can spend on each problem. If you get stuck on a question, move on to the next one and come back later. Sometimes a later question will even jog your memory so that you can answer the one you skipped. Most importantly, don't rush yourself.

, Any math teacher will tell you that sloppy work is the test-taker's worst enemy. Even if you know the material cold, a smudged digit here or a forgotten negative sign there can ruin an entire problem. If you make a mistake, use your eraser--that's what it's there for.

, Great, you finished the test with plenty of time to spare. Don't turn it in yet, though! Good test-takers make mistakes all the time, but they find them and fix them before they hand in their exams. This can't be stressed enough, you will always find a mistake somewhere. Anyway, depending on what kind of problems you're doing, your teacher will probably give you some hints on how to check your work. In general, though, carefully reread each question and ask yourself if your answers make sense. You still may not get every problem right, but you'll increase your chances of success exponentially.

Take breaks.",How to Maximise Your PCAT Scores," PCAT prep courses are offered by various educational testing companies such as Kaplan and Dr. Collins. These courses are taught by Professors of Pharmacy and offer a structured, in-depth approach to the PCAT. The downside is that these courses are expensive, ranging from $999 to $2500.Look up reviews of the various courses before you choose which one to use. Several programs also offer sample classes that will give you a feel for how the course is run before you have to commit to spending any money.
Most courses are available in three formats: online, in-person, and private tutoring. Online courses offer pre-recorded lectures so you can watch them whenever you have time. In-person courses require you to attend classes at set times. The private tutoring option will provide you with a one-on-one learning experience—unsurprisingly, it is the most expensive option.;
, This the most popular way to study for the PCAT. The same companies that offer prep courses also publish PCAT study guides that contain all of the information you will need to know to do well on the PCAT. In addition to study guides, many companies produce flash-cards and other study aids.Don’t reinvent the wheel. If flash-cards have never helped you before, don’t rush out and buy flash-cards to study for the PCAT. Stick to the study methods that have worked for you in the past.
If you choose to study on your own, make sure you look up and practice questions from previous tests. The Pearson website offers free access to previous test questions., Whether you choose to take a prep course or study on your own, remember that you’ve learned all of the material that will be on the PCAT in your college classes. Look back at your old class notes to jog your memory of PCAT subjects.It likely won’t help you to simply review your various course notes without having a focus. Instead, you should read the descriptions of each of the six sections of the PCAT and look at practices questions from previous tests. After you’ve done so, you can go back to your coursework and study only the areas that are relevant to the PCAT.
The PCAT consists of six sections: Writing, Biology, Chemistry, Critical Reading, and two Quantitative Reasoning sections.
The Writing section asks you to discuss a solution to a given world problem.
The Biology section covers general biology, microbiology, and anatomy & physiology.
The Chemistry section covers general chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry.
The Critical reading section tests your ability to read difficult material and answer questions about it.
The Quantitative Reasoning sections cover basic math, algebra, probability & statistics, precalculus, and calculus.

, You should do this before you start studying. This will give you an idea of where your strengths and weaknesses are so you know what areas to focus on while you’re studying.Every test prep course and study guide will include many practice tests.

, You will learn more if you study one hour a day for seven days instead of seven hours over one day. The PCAT covers a lot of material, so it’s important to absorb it slowly and steadily.Strive for one-to-one-and-a-half hours of study per day. You don’t need to study full-time for the PCAT, and doing so will likely be counterproductive.
If you’re using a PCAT course as your study method, your instructors will tell you exactly what you need to accomplish everyday.
If you’re studying on your own using a study guide, the guide will give you suggestions for what you should study everyday. In general, you will spend part of your time reviewing the material and part of your time doing practice questions and analyzing your answers to the questions.
Set aside one month leading up to your test date to study for the PCAT.

, The PCAT covers six subjects: writing, biology, chemistry, critical reading, and quantitative reasoning. If you ace the biology section during your first practice test and you feel like you’re a master of the subject, don’t waste your time studying biology. Instead, focus on the areas where you can improve your score.You should still study the subjects you do well in—but focus your greatest energies on the subjects you need to work on.

, Practice tests provide the best opportunity to test your knowledge and whether your study habits are working. For each section of the test that you study, take a practice test in that section. For example, if you spend Monday afternoon studying chemistry, take a practice test only in the chemistry section. In addition to these mini-practice tests, take at least one full practice test a week.Use your performance on practice tests to adjust your study habits. If your score on the critical reading section bumps up to 99% after a week and stays there, you should reallocate your study time to subjects where you are doing less well.

, If you’ve followed a daily study schedule for a month, you should be well-prepared for the PCAT come test day. Studying on the day before the test is not going to improve your score and it is likely to increase your stress levels. Force yourself to take the day off and do something relaxing., Sleep is the time that our brains recover and consolidate information that we’ve learned while awake. Try to get seven to eight hours of sleep the night before the PCAT., Taking the PCAT on an empty stomach is a recipe for disaster. Eat a healthy breakfast consisting of complex carbs and protein.Good foods include wheat toast, sausage, non-sugary cereals, and orange juice.
Avoid sugary foods on the morning of the exam. They will give you a quick burst of energy, but it will wear of quickly and leave you feeling worse off.

, You have four-and-a-half hours to complete the test. The scores for each multiple-choice section are added together to calculate your composite score. As such, you should make sure to answer every question. If you get stuck on one question, move onto the next one and return to the difficult question later.If you’ve done lots of practice tests, you should have an idea of how much time you need to spend on each question.
Don’t leave any answers blank. If you plan to come back to a question later, make a note of it so you don’t forget to at least guess on the question when you’re almost out of time.

, If you don’t know the answer to a PCAT question, you can still get to the right answer by eliminating the wrong ones. .Start by trying to eliminate the two most obviously wrong answers. This will leave you with two potentially correct answers.
Next, re-read the question and see if one of the two possible answers jumps out at you. If not, take a guess. If you successfully eliminated two wrong answers, you’ve at least increased your chances of getting the right answer from one-in-four to one-in-two.

, Most students will finish the test in less than four-and-a-half-hours. If you need to use the bathroom, do so—and if you simply need to get up to stretch your legs, take a bathroom break. Forcing yourself to stay in your seat for the full test-time will only make you feel stressed and uncomfortable."

Gather your note-taking materials.,
Come prepared.,
Be an active listener.,
Take notes by hand.,
Don't be afraid to ask questions.",How to Take Better Notes1," It may sound pretty basic, but it's important to have all of your note-taking materials organized and ready to go before the start of any class, meeting or lecture.


If you're writing with paper and pens, make sure you have an A4 sized notebook with plenty of blank pages and two of each color pen. If you're using a laptop, make sure it's fully charged or that you can sit near a power outlet.
If you wear glasses, make sure you have them with you in case the teacher/lecturer writes down any important information on a black or whiteboard. If you bring your glasses, make sure to bring a small microfiber cloth so that you are able to clean them should the need arise. Also, remember to position yourself in an area of the room where you can effectively see and hear the speaker.;
, Before you come to a class, lecture, or meeting, make sure to review your notes from the last time round. This will bring you fully up to speed and ready to pick up where you left off.


If you were advised to do any background reading to prepare for the class, make sure that you get it done. This will help you to understand any themes, concepts or ideas that the teacher/lecturer is likely to present in class. A good idea would be to outline the section, article, or chapter before hand. Write your outline on one side of the paper so that you can add your class notes to the other side.Remember the old adage ""By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail"".

, When note-taking, many people make the mistake of mindlessly taking down every word, without really comprehending what is being said.


This is a mistake. If you don't make an effort to understand the topic while you're in class, you miss out on a valuable learning opportunity.
Therefore, you should try to absorb the information you're hearing the first time around, as you won't have as much work to do or risk feeling confused during review time.

, Although taking notes on your laptop is convenient, a study conducted at Princeton University has shown that note takers actually retain information better when they take notes by hand.


It's suspected that this is due to the fact that laptop users tend to transcribe what they hear word-for-word, without really processing what's being said.
Longhand note-takers, on the other hand, can't write fast enough to copy each word verbatim, so they are forced to engage with the material a little more in order to pick out the most important and relevant information.As a result, you should try to take notes by hand whenever possible.

, When you come across something you don't understand, don't just jot it down and tell yourself that you'll worry about it later -- ask the teacher/lecturer for clarification.


Think about it -- if you find something confusing now, you'll find it twice as confusing during your note-review later.
Don't be afraid to ask the teacher/lecturer to repeat themselves either -- particularly if you feel that they've said something important.

"
"
Focus on key words and concepts.,
Use the ""question, answer, evidence"" method.,
Use shorthand.,
Make your notes visually appealing.,
Color-code your notes.,
Take notes from your textbook.",How to Take Better Notes2," The most important change you can make to improve your note-taking skills is to focus solely on taking down key words and concepts.



Identify the most relevant information. Write down individual words or key phrases that are most relevant to the topic at hand -- things like dates, names, theories, definitions -- only the most important details should make the cut. Eliminate all the filler words and secondary details -- if you wanted those things you could read a textbook.

Think about what you want to retain. Why are you taking the class? Why are you attending the seminar? Why did your employer send you to the conference? While it may be your first instinct to try to write down what you hear or see verbatim, you have to remember that you are taking notes in order to learn something from them -- you're not writing a novella.

Prioritize any ""new"" information. Don't waste time writing down information that you already know -- this is useless to you and just wastes time. Focus on writing down any new information that you've never learned before -- this will give you the most value from your note-taking.

, This is a very effective method of taking notes, as it forces you to engage with the material as you write and allows you to describe the topic in your own words. This technique of paraphrasing information has been proven to help students understand and retain material much more effectively.Instead of copying down line after line of information, listen carefully to what the speaker is saying and make an effort to understand the material. Once you've done that, formulate your notes as a series of questions raised by the material, then fill in your own answers.
For example, if the question was ""what is the central theme of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet?"", the answer could be ""more than a tragic love story, Romeo and Juliet is about the consequences of holding grudges"".
Then underneath this answer, you can provide evidence for your conclusion by pointing to specific examples from within the text. This strategy allows you to record all of the relevant information, in a concise, easy-to-read format.

, The average student writes 1/3 word per second, while the average speaker speaks at a rate of 2/3 words per second. Therefore, developing your own system of shorthand writing can help you to write more efficiently and avoid falling behind.


Try writing things like ""wd"" for would, ""cd"" for could and ""w/"" for with. Write a plus sign for the word ""and"". Also try to abbreviate long words that appear again and again throughout the class or lecture -- for example, instead of writing ""popular sovereignty"" 25 times over the course of a history class, write ""pop sov"".
Of course, it's essential that you're able to decipher your own shorthand later on -- if you think you might have difficulty, try writing out a key on the inside cover of your copy.You could also go back and fill in the full-length version of the words after class.
If the speaker is still going too fast for you despite your shorthand, consider bringing a recording device to your next class -- this will allow you to listen a second time and fill in any gaps in your notes.

, You will be reluctant to go back and study your notes if they are messy, disorganized and difficult to read, so it's important that they look nice! Here are some tips on how to create more visually appealing notes:



Always start on a fresh page. You'll find your notes much easier to read if you start on a fresh, blank page for each new class or topic. Put the date in the top right-hand corner and only write on one side of each page, especially if you're writing with very inky pens.

Make sure your writing is legible. Taking notes will be a complete waste of time if you can't read them afterwards! No matter how fast you write, make sure you're writing is small, neat and legible, and avoid using cursive handwriting if possible.

Use wide margins. Line each page with a pen and ruler, giving yourself a wide margin on the left-hand side. This will prevent the page from becoming too overcrowded and will leave you space to write in any additional information once you review your notes.

Use symbols and diagrams. Things like arrows, dots and boxes, diagrams, charts, and other visual aids are often great ways to associate and remember key concepts, especially if you're a visual learner.

, Many people find that adding a splash of color to their notes helps to make the information more readable and easier to retain.


This is due to the fact that color stimulates the creative side of your brain, making your notes more interesting and therefore easier to retain. Color-coding helps you to link color with memory, allowing you to remember the contents of your notes with relatively little effort.Try using different colored pens for different parts of your notes -- for example, you could write questions in red, definitions in blue and conclusions in green.
You could also use a highlighter pen to highlight key words, dates, and definitions. Don't go overboard though -- you shouldn't mistake highlighting your notes for actual study.

, After a class or lecture, you may want to supplement your notes with information from a textbook. Taking notes from a textbook is another skill worth mastering.



Preview the material: Before you jump straight into reading a text, preview the material to get a sense of what it's about. Read any introductions and conclusions, headers and sub-headers, and the first and last line of every paragraph. Also glance over any charts, illustrations or diagrams.

Actively read the text: Now go back to the beginning of the text and read it thoroughly from start to finish. Once you have finished a paragraph, go back and highlight any key words, facts, concepts or important quotes. Look for visual cues in the textbook itself -- things like bold or italicized words and the use of color or bullet points are often used to highlight significant points.

Take notes: Once you've thoroughly read the text, go back and make notes from the information you highlighted. Try not to copy full sentences from the text -- this simply wastes time -- and paraphrase using your own words where possible."
"
Review your notes later in the day.,
Test yourself.,
Memorize your notes.",How to Take Better Notes3," Reviewing your notes after class, or later the same day will help you to retain the information much more effectively. You don't need to study them intensely -- just spend 15 to 20 minutes going back over them each night.


Fill in any blanks. Use your review time to fill in any additional information that you remember from the class or lecture.
Write a summary. Another effective tool for committing your notes to memory is to summarize the information contained in your notes at the bottom of the page.

, Test yourself on your understanding of the material by covering up your notes and trying to explain the topic to yourself -- out loud or in your head.


See how many of the important details you can remember, then read the notes again to recap on any information you might have missed.
Explain the material to a friend. Teaching or explaining the material to a friend is a good way to test whether you've fully understood the topic and whether your notes deal with the topic comprehensively.

, You'll really see the benefit of having good notes when it comes to exam time and you have to memorize all of the material. If you have been consistently reviewing your notes for 20 to 30 minutes each night, you'll find the memorization process much easier. Here are some popular memorization techniques you can try:



Line-by-line method: If you have to memorize a chunk of text, one good technique is to read the first line a couple of times, then try to repeat it out loud without looking at the page. Read the second line a couple of times, then try to repeat the first and second line out loud, without looking at the page. Keep going in this fashion until you can repeat the entire chunk of text without looking at the page.

Story method: This method involves turning the information you have to memorize into a simple story that's easy to remember. For example, if you wanted to remember the first three elements in Group one of the periodic table (hydrogen, helium, and lithium) you could use the following story ""(H)arriet and (He)nry went to the (Li)brary"". The story doesn't need to make sense -- in fact, the sillier it is, the better.

Mnemonic devices: Using mnemonic devices is a good way to remember lists of words in a particular order. To make a mnemonic, simply take the first letter of each word you wish to remember and come up with a short sentence where each word starts with those letters. For example, to remember the lines on a musical staff EGBDF you could use the mnemonic ""Every Good Boy Does Fine"".For more detailed instructions on popular and effective memorization techniques, see this article.

Make flash cards.",How to Take Notes from a Textbook," Check any syllabus, calendar, or notes from class that direct you to read a section or sections from your textbook.Ideally, you should give yourself at least 5 minutes per page of assigned textbook reading.If you are a slower reader, you may need to give yourself additional time to read.;
, Most textbooks are broken into more easily-digestible sections that are often topped with headings. Previewing the chapter and looking at the headings and subheadings from beginning to end can give you a sense of the length and trajectory of the chapter. You may also cue into keywords as you are reading if you have seen them in bolded subheadings later in the chapter.


Also look for any words that are presented in bold.These are often key concepts or vocabulary words that are defined within the chapter or in the glossary.
If there are not headings or subheadings in your textbook, read the first sentence of each paragraph., This is a bad plan, however; that information is often key to understanding or reviewing the chapter’s main concepts. Looking at the supplemental material (and reading the captions below pictures or charts) can help you focus on key information while you read.

, Reading these review questions ahead of time can help focus your attention to the most important aspects of a chapter.

, Reading actively without any background noise or diversions can make it easier to focus and retain the information you learn. It is especially important to be free of distractions if you are learning new material or reading about complex ideas. Find an area that is quiet and comfortable, and settle in to read and learn.

, If you have to read a 30-page chapter, you should try to break that chapter up into smaller focus sections. The length of the sections may depend on your attention span. Some people recommend breaking reading into 10-page chunks,but if you have difficulty focusing on and digesting large portions of text, you might want to limit your sections to 5-pages. The chapter itself may also be divided into more manageable sections.

, It can be easy to passively read something that you find complex or uninteresting. Passive reading occurs when your eyes are looking at each word, but you don’t retain any information or think about what you read. To read actively, try to think while you’re reading. This means that you should be trying to summarize ideas, connect ideas to other concepts that you’re familiar with, or ask questions to yourself or the text while you read.


To read actively, do not try to take notes or highlight anything the first time you read through a section of text; instead, just focus on reading to understand., Be sure that you understand the text as you are reading it. You may need to use a dictionary or the textbook’s glossary or index to define unfamiliar words. #* When you get to the note-taking stage, write down new key words that are important to the chapter along with the page number where you found that term and definition. That way you can refer back to the textbook easily if you need to.

, After reading through each section of text (whether it is a section you divided yourself or a division made by the textbook), think about the main points. Try to summarize the section and identify the one to three most important details of the section. , Hopefully you looked at supplemental materials such as pictures, charts, and graphs when you previewed the chapter. If you did not, be sure that you read them as you progress through reading the section. Viewing these details in context will help you synthesize the information.


These types of supplements may be of particular benefit to students who tend to be visual learners. When trying to recall information, you may be able to conjure the way a graph or chart looked more easily than a piece of factual information.

, You should not write down every piece of information in the book. Nor should you write down one fact per page. Finding the right balance of writing enough but not too much can be a challenge, but it is the key to taking effective notes. Using the strategy of reading a paragraph and then summarizing it can help you target the right amount of information.


Depending on the subject and the level of the textbook, writing 1-2 sentences of summary per paragraph may be the right ratio of information to note-taking.

, You should write your notes in your own words.Paraphrasing information usually shows that you genuinely understood what you read (it’s difficult to put something into your own words if you don’t know what it means). It will likely be more meaningful to you later when you are reviewing your notes if you have written them in your own words.

, Your notes may take on the form of a bulleted list of information. You might draw yourself a timeline of events so that you can see the order that things happened and not just a list of events. You may draw a kind of flow chart to emphasize a sequence. Or you might do a more traditional outline with big ideas at one level and then supporting ideas indented underneath. Ultimately, the notes are your study aid, so it’s best to write them in a way that makes sense to you.

, Visual learners are often helped by visual representations in their own notes. You might want to jot down a brief copy of a graph instead of writing information about it. You may want to draw a simple comic strip to show a specific event or interaction between people. Don’t let adding visual elements distract you from the task at hand—understanding and taking notes on the text—but add visuals if it will help you synthesize or remember the material more effectively.

, Depending on the subject, you may want to organize your notes in a particular way. History notes may be most logically taken in chronological order (or even in the format of a timeline). Science notes, however, may need to be taken in a particular sequence that shows mastery of one concept before moving on to the next.


If in doubt about how to organize your notes, go with the textbook’s organization. If information is written in a certain order in the textbook, and there is usually a reason for it.

, Teachers will often specify which chapters or sections of a textbook will be most relevant for an upcoming test. Knowing this information before you read the textbook can save you time and energy, and allow you to focus on what’s most important to know.Write down whatever your instructor writes on the board. These pieces of information are most likely to be relevant for future discussions and upcoming assignments or tests.
Ask your instructor if he or she would allow you to use a personal recording device to record the lecture and listen to it at home. Anything that you missed while taking notes in class will be heard on the recording, and you can add that information to your notes after class.

, It may be difficult to write notes as quickly as the instructor is speaking. Learning to write shorthand is a great way to ensure that the notes you take in class cover everything the instructor expects you to know. shorthand


Write down major names, places, dates, events, and concepts. If you cover these topics in your notes, it will likely be much easier to remember the specifics surrounding those people or places when you go back to the textbook.
Follow major topics with brief context clues. These can be a few words or even a short sentence, but having some type of brief notes will help you make sense of the names or dates you’ve written down during the lecture.

, Now that you have notes from the in-class lecture, you’ll want to review those notes to begin learning the important topics covered in class.


Try to read over your notes shortly after class has ended. Reviewing your notes immediately after class is over will most likely help you retain that information for a longer period of time.

, If you have notes from class and from your textbook, combine and compare them. You should identify anything that was emphasized by both the textbook and your instructor; this is likely to be a very important concept.

, Think of your notes as a study guide for your course exams. The act of writing might help you remember certain things, but you probably won’t remember everything in the textbook if you’re not studying the notes you’ve taken. Going back to review the notes can help you remember key concepts and specific terms, even months after you covered the information.

, If you work with other students in your class, you may want to exchange and share notes. This can be a helpful strategy, as different students may focus or emphasize different concepts. Additionally, if you have a friend or classmate who missed class or didn’t understand a concept, you can share your notes to help her.

, If you have an impending exam, you can convert your notes into flashcards. These can make it easier to learn and memorize names, dates, and definitions.Additionally, you can use these flashcards to collaborate and study with another student or in a study group, which improves test performance."

Go to the bathroom before the test.",How to Memorize Notes for a Test," If your notes are scattered around on different pieces of paper, you won't even be able to find them to memorize for the test. Instead, have one notebook per class and write down all of your notes in there. That way when you're ready to study, everything will be neatly organized and you can start studying right away.


Also put the date at the top of the page when you start taking notes. This will keep you in chronological order, which can help you conceptualize the moment you were taking these notes and aid in studying.
If you keep notes on your computer, date each document or notebook. Consider making separate folders on your computer for each class, and keep assignments, your notes, and any study aids together in each folder.;
, Don't simply write the instructor's words mechanically. This will not help you remember your notes. Instead, take a few seconds before writing to think about what the instructor just said. Consider the main idea behind her words. Then start writing. That way, you'll actually absorb the information instead of just absentmindedly writing words., Writing out whole words and complete sentences is a waste of time. You'll be paying attention to spelling out everything the instructor said rather than absorbing the information. By abbreviating words and phrases, you'll be able to take down a greater amount of information in a clearer, more manageable way.For example, if your teacher says ""In 'The Tell-Tale Heart,' we have a literary example of a man whose guilt overcomes him,"" just write ""Tell-Tale Heart = guilt."" That is really all the useful information that the teacher's sentence contained.

, The visual stimulation of different colors on the page will keep your brain focused when you study. You can designate different colors for different ideas or concepts. For example, blue might be new vocabulary words, red could be important formulas, and green could be things your teacher said to pay attention to. With this color key in mind, your notes will appear more organized and coherent when you go back to study. You'll immediately know the topic that you're looking at before you even read any words.

, The general rule is that if the teacher took the time to write something out on the board, it is important and will probably be on the test. You might even want to underline things in your notes that were on the board to show what you should focus on while studying.

, If you don't understand something the instructor just said, ask her to repeat or explain it. If you don't, you'll end up copying it down in your notes the wrong way, and you'll get it wrong on the test.

, It is easy to miss information while taking notes. Perhaps the teacher used a word you've never heard before and there was no time to ask for a definition. Make note of this word and look it up after class. Then add it into your notes so it's there for when you study., If you're having trouble keeping up with class and can't take notes fast enough, you could see if your instructor will let you record lectures. That way, you can listen to them later and transcribe notes from the tape.


Make sure to get permission before recording any lectures. Some instructors don't allow recording and might think you're trying to cheat if they catch you.

, Even if you don't have a test coming up, you should look over your notes within a day of taking them. This will put you at a huge advantage when you actually start studying for a test. Your brain will start absorbing the information while it is still fresh in your mind. Then when you study in the days before a test, you will be able to recall the information much better than if you hadn't looked over your notes at all since you took them.

, Pulling an all-nighter and cramming the night before a test in an ineffective method of studying. Not only will you be tired during the test, but you won't retain information as well by cramming. Instead, give yourself at least 3 or 4 days to study. Reviewing your notes on these days will result in a much better absorption of information.

, If you try to study an entire unit at once, you'll probably overwhelm yourself. You might start strong and know the first part well, but lose your energy and zone out while studying the last few parts. Instead, you should break your notes into sections. Set aside blocks you can cover in about an hour, then take a break. This will ensure that you study all parts of your notes equally., Instead of simply reading your notes to yourself, say them aloud. Studies show that speaking out loud aids in memorization. Speaking also keeps you more focused than reading to yourself would. It allows you to hear the information again and gives your brain another chance to process it.When you speak, try paraphrasing sometimes rather than reading directly. Having to paraphrase and then speak aloud requires your brain to do more work, making it more likely that you will remember what you're studying.

, When you've broken your notes into sections, start working your way down. Apply the following system for each section to memorize it before moving on to the next one.Read or speak each line of notes 3-5 times.
Try to repeat that line as closely as possible without looking. This doesn't have to be word for word, but you should ensure that you can reflect the same information that the line contains.
When you've completed a line, move on to the next.

, When you've read an entire section and repeated it back, try to write that section without looking. Go line by line and write out all that you remember. Again, this doesn't have to be word for word, but all the information from your notes should get across in your repetition. When you've written down a section, go back and compare it to your notes. Pay attention to your mistakes so you can correct them and make sure you know them for the test., Flashcards are an effective way to study a wide variety of information. You can make them for vocabulary words, dates, scientific concepts, math formulas, and anything else you might need. Not only are flashcards a handy way to study, but the act of writing them out is studying in itself. Make them whenever you have a lot of information to aid in your memorization.


As an added study tool, use different colors for different ideas on your flashcards. This visual stimulation will aid in your ability to remember information.

, A mnemonic is a mental tool used to jar your memory and help you remember things. There are a number of mnemonics you could use to improve your memory and raise your test scores. These are some of the most popular ones.Make a song. Tuneful lyrics are easier to memorize than words on a page. Try making a song out of things you have to memorize. You don't have to make a whole new song. Instead, just replace the words in a song you already like. This will make memorization even easier.
Use the first letter of each word in a sequence to make a name. Probably the most famous example of this is Roy G. Biv, the colors of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet.
Make a rhyme for different information. Like making a song, creating rhymes helps you remember information. For example: In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
Create wacky associations. For example, to remember that the word ""gregarious"" means ""outgoing, sociable"" you could imagine a party animal character named ""Greg Arious."" Give him a funny party hat and surround him with zebras living it up. You won't forget the meaning of this word any time soon!

, Your brain and body need to be in the right mood to optimize your studying. Studies show that light exercise boosts brain activity. By stimulating the brain, you're warming it up for your study session so it will absorb information more effectively. Try taking a 10-20 minute walk or doing some calisthenics (jumping jacks, running in place, jumping rope, etc.) before you start studying to activate the learning areas of your brain., Sitting in the same location every time you study will get boring. This monotony will cause your brain to tune out, and you won't be able to focus anymore. Instead, try studying in different rooms of your house or alternating between sitting at your desk and sitting on the couch., Between social media and email, it's very easy to get distracted when studying. Remove temptations by putting your phone on silent and leaving it across the room. Also don't study somewhere there is a TV to remove the temptation of turning it on.If turning off your phone is unthinkable to you, give yourself ""time-outs"" from it instead. For example, you could say, ""I will not check my phone for 20 minutes"" and then set a timer. Study hard until the timer goes off, and then check your phone. This way, you maintain focus for an uninterrupted stretch, but you don't feel like you're punishing yourself.

, When we get tired we lose focus and starting zoning out. When you reach this point, it's no longer effective to study. Your brain has shut down and you're not absorbing information. When you feel your focus start failing, take a break. Go for a walk, watch some TV, listen to music, take a nap—whatever it takes to get relaxed. Then when you come back, your brain will be rested and ready to get back to work., When we get hungry, usually the first thing to go is our brain power. Your mind will start wandering and be focused on your hunger. Nip this in the bud early. When you get hungry, take a snack break. Then come back refreshed and ready to keep working.Complex carbohydrates are usually best for a quick energy boost. Whole wheat products like bread and English muffins will produce a sustained release of energy that will carry you through a study session.
Eat sugar with caution. It's true that sugary snacks and drinks will boost your energy and alertness in the short-term. The energy spike also comes with a crash, however, so you could end up feeling even more fatigued before your study session is over. It's much better to eat foods that will provide a sustained release instead of a quick spike.

, Never stay up all night studying. If you've left enough time and started studying early enough before the test, this last-minute cramming session should be unnecessary anyway. It will only result in an improper understanding of the material and a lack of focus during the test. The best way to make sure you do well is to be well-rested for the exam.


Your brain actually transfers information into long-term memory while you sleep. Getting enough sleep will help your brain store all that stuff you're studying so you can recall it later., Just like with studying, you should make sure you're well-fed for the test itself. Have a bigger breakfast than usual the morning of a test to keep your brain nourished and focused. If you have the test later in the day, pack a small snack like a granola bar to keep in your bag. Eat it quickly before the test to keep your brain going.Eat complex carbohydrates, such as whole-grain toast or oatmeal. These digest slowly so you won't experience a crash during the middle of your test.
Eggs are a good choice. They contain protein and choline, a substance that may boost your memory.Have a little lox on a whole-grain bagel. Studies suggest that eating fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, can help improve your brain functioning.Have a cup of coffee or tea if you'd like. Caffeine may benefit your memory, according to some studies., Looking over your notes a few more times can be beneficial. You might catch something you missed before and end up getting an answer right on the test because of it. Do not, however, spend the entire day cramming. If you've studied effectively, this is unnecessary. You'll end up stressing yourself out and by the time you take the test, your brain will be too tired to concentrate. Instead, just look over your notes over breakfast, and maybe once more the period before the test. Any more risks wearing out your brain before you even take the test.

, While it sounds silly, this can be a huge distraction during a test. Your brain will have a tougher time focusing on the test if it is distracted with this. Also, you may not be allowed to go to the bathroom during the test for fear of cheating. Eliminate this worry by visiting the bathroom before the test period.

If the material is easier, you may not need as long as you will if the material is more difficult. Allowing yourself adequate time to study will help you do better., One of the best ways to pass a test is to study the information every day. Cramming for the test at the last minute is not a good practice and can lead to failure. Instead, spend 30-60 minutes every day studying the material you went over in class that day.If you don't want to study every day, spend the week or two before the exam studying every day. This gives you time to revisit concepts you don't quite understand and allows you time to absorb the information.
If you don't understand something, studying beforehand gives you enough time to ask the teacher about it in class.

, Look at previous tests you have taken in the class. What things did the teacher mark wrong? What kind of things is she/he looking for in answers? Figuring this out can help you study better and improve your answers. Also look at the types of questions your teacher asks. Does she focus mostly on broad concepts or specific examples? This can help you study more effectively.Ask your teacher for sample tests. Some teachers and professors will provide sample tests for students. If you are taking a standardized test, it is extremely important to take sample tests to get an idea of how the test will be structured.
Look at previous homework assignments, too. Many times, teachers will use homework questions on the test, or write questions in a similar way., Instead of studying the same way every night, change how you study. Spend one night reading the textbook, one night learning terms and definitions, one night studying with flashcards, and one night taking practice tests., While studying, go through your textbook and your class notes. Look for the most important concepts. This may include things that are brought up again and again, concepts that are explained in detail, or things your teacher told you was important.Listen closely to your teacher when she lectures. She could give hints about what material will show up on the test. Make a note of this in your notes in case you forget.

, If you are struggling with the material, go to a tutoring session. This might be from your teacher or professor, or maybe the school tutoring services. You may also ask a classmate who understands the material to help you., Though you will be reviewing all of your notes and the chapters, you should also make yourself a review sheet. This sheet includes all the major terms, concepts, and ideas that will be on the test. Think of it like the highlights of the material. Having it on this separate sheet makes it easily reviewable and might help you remember it better., If the teacher gives you a study guide, make sure that you complete it. This is a great way to review the material. Many times, teachers will pull questions directly from the study guide or reword questions from the study guide.Study guides also help you focus your studying so you study the correct material.

, Gather a few classmates from your class to study together. Quiz each other, come up with possible test questions, and use each other's notes to fill in gaps in your own notes. You also can help explain concepts to each other that you might be confused about.

, Before the day of the test, talk to your professor or teacher about the format of the exam. Many teachers will tell you whether the test will be multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, or essay. Knowing the format can help you figure out how to study the information.


Ask your teacher for a study guide. If she won't give you one, ask her for any tips or suggestions for studying so you can prepare.
Ask your teacher which chapters the test will cover. Or ask her to help you review what you should study.Ask the professor or teacher for suggestions on how to study for her test., The night before the test, make sure you get a restful night's sleep. Don't stay up cramming. Being sleepy can cause you to forget things or be unfocused. Show up refreshed and ready to take the test., Don't skip breakfast the morning of the test.Make sure to eat a breakfast with protein and fiber instead of sugary foods. This helps keep you sustained, focused, and strong instead of crashing.Eat eggs, yogurt, and granola instead of a sugary cereal or donuts.

, Gather what you need for the test the night before.Leave for class so you will arrive 10-15 minutes early; if you are in middle or high school, don't hang around the halls with your friends. Make sure to bring any materials you need, like pens, pencils, blue books, paper, or calculators.Take a few minutes to relax before the test. Take a few deep breaths, think positive thoughts, and get comfortable and relaxed.Go to the restroom before the test. This will ensure that you are not distracted during the test and focused on needing to use the restroom., Knowing the way the teacher will grade the test can help you approach questions. Will you lose points for incorrect answers? Will you not lose points if it's left blank, or should you guess?Does the teacher give partial credit? These things help you decide how to answer questions you are unsure about.

, Before you start answering questions, take a few seconds to read the directions. This will help you eliminate errors. Sometimes there are multiple parts of an answer or a special task you're asked to do. Read the directions to make sure you don't make any unnecessary mistakes.


For example, some answers may have more than one answer you have to provide. If you have essay tests, you might have to choose 3 or 4 questions to answer., Keep a positive attitude while taking the test.Don't think negative thoughts, even if you are struggling.If you start to get too anxious, pause for a moment. Relax, breathe deeply, and tell yourself that you can do this.Don't pay attention to your classmates. If they are working faster or finish before you, that doesn't mean anything. Everyone works at his or her own pace. Fast work doesn't mean they know everything; they could know nothing and just put something down., Look at the entire test. Decide how you will approach the test. Think about how many minutes you will need for each section. Set a pace for yourself that gives you enough time to complete the questions, but that also ensures you will finish the test.


Start with the easiest sections. Not only will these be completed faster, but it can help build your confidence.Answer the questions with the highest point values next. You want to make sure you give yourself enough time to finish those., For multiple choice questions, eliminate incorrect answers. Spend some time figuring out which ones cannot be the correct answer.Then look for clues in the answers that make one of the remaining answers incorrect. If the question only needs one right answer, something about one of the choices will be wrong.


Don't be thrown by questions that include never, not, least, none, or except. These words can give you important insights into the answer, or help you eliminate wrong answers.You may want to formulate your own answer after reading the question but before you look at the answers. This can help prevent the answers from swaying you the wrong way., Essays require you to demonstrate your knowledge. Read the question carefully and underline key words, especially words like define, compare, or explain. Make an outline of the ideas you want to include in your answer. This way you won't forget anything as soon as you start writing. An outline also gives you a map to follow.Answer the question directly by mentioning key words or the topic of the question.
Give examples along with general information about the topic. Use any terms you have learned in the class.
Write legibly.

, Instead of wasting time stressing about questions you don't know, move ahead on the test. Circle the question and come back to it if you have time. Answer all the questions you know before you spend too much time trying to figure out answers to questions.Look on the rest of the test for clues that might help you answer questions you don't know.
Ask your teacher for clarification if you don't understand what a question is asking.

, When you finish your test, go back and review your answers. Reread and spend a few more moments on questions you were unsure about. Double check that you didn't skip any answers or misread questions.Trust your first instinct. Many times, your first instinct is the correct answer. But make sure you have made a reasoned decision for the answer, not just relied on your gut.

Consider professional counseling.",How to Overcome Exam Tension," Not sleeping right can affect your mood, leading to an excess of stress. In the weeks leading up to the exam, make sleep a priority. Strive for solid nights of high quality sleep.If you're still in high school, aim for 8.5 to 10 hours of sleep a night. If you're over 18, 7.5 to 9 hours should be enough.Make sure you establish a regular bedtime. Go to sleep around the same time each night, and do something to help you wind down. You could, for example, have a cup of herbal tea and read a book before bed.;
, You may be tempted to binge eat on junk food due to stress. However, this is unlikely to make you feel more relaxed. Food has a direct effect on your mood, so make sure to eat high quality foods leading up to your exam. This will reduce your overall stress.Avoid high-fat, high-sugar, and high-caffeine foods. These will only increase your stress levels.
Instead, go for plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like fish., If you exercise regularly, do not neglect your work out routine during exam time. It's okay to cut out ten or 15 minutes from your regular routine if you're low on time, but you should not stop exercising altogether because an exam is coming up. Exercise can help regulate your mood, leading to lower overall stress.If you don't normally exercise, this is a good time to start. Try walking or going for a bike ride for 15 minutes a day, around three times a week.
You can also exercise with others. Play a game of softball or go for a bike ride with friends.

, If you're down on yourself, you're more likely to stress out. Instead of convincing yourself you're doomed to failure, go into the exam with a positive mentality. Adopt a positive personal mantra to keep your mood up while you study.Think of something positive you can say to yourself when you feel stressed. For example, you could say something like, ""I'm working hard and I will succeed.""
When you feel stressed, repeat this mantra while taking deep, soothing breaths.

, If you're stressed out over an exam, you may be placing too much importance on it. It's good to be conscientious of your grades. You should care about doing well in school. However, try to keep things in perspective. One exam is not going to make or break your life. Do your best, but keep in mind even the worse case scenario will not be a disaster.The worst thing that can happen is you will do bad on the exam. This can be a setback for you academically, but keep in mind everyone screws up an exam at least once in their life.
Getting a low grade in one exam, or even one class, is unlikely to affect you much long term. Even if you don't do as well as you hoped, you can bounce back in the future.

, If you establish a study routine you follow each day, you're more likely to stick to it. A lot of stress comes from feeling inadequately prepared. If you're studying regularly, you'll feel more prepared and therefore less stressed.Figure out what works best for you. If you're a morning person, study in the morning. If you focus better at night, study in the evening.
Pick a regular place to study that's free of distractions. If your dorm room tends to be loud, for example, you can study at the library.
Make sure to study a little each day, sticking to roughly the same routine.

, If you panic in the face of a problem, this will only increase your stress level. If you're stuck on a certain subject, don't start stressing out and beating yourself up. Instead, be proactive. Say to yourself, ""There's still time to figure out this concept."" Then, go about increasing your understanding of the subject.You can spend extra time studying the concept that's confusing you. You can dedicate a single study session to mastering a tricky concept.
You can also reach out to your professors or other students for help.
If you respond proactively to struggles, you won't feel stressed. You will feel a sense of power at your willingness to overcome difficulties.

, If your concentration does not last for a full hour, you should take ten to 15 minute breaks throughout your study sessions. Try taking a 15 minute break every hour, for example, and see if that improves your stress level.Do something you enjoy during your breaks. Give yourself 15 minutes to watch television or browse Facebook, for example.

, There is no such thing as a perfect student. Keep this in mind as you study. You need to accept the fact you will struggle on occasion. Allowing yourself to be imperfect will reduce your stress over an exam.Loosen up your definition of success and failure. Anything less than an ""A"" does not mean you failed. If you shoot this high while studying, you will get angrier at yourself for perceived failures.
Instead of focusing on a concrete outcome, like a certain grade, just try to do your best. Don't think, ""I need to get an A."" Instead, think, ""I need to try my best and be proud of the grade I get.""

, Nothing will make an exam more stressful than showing up unprepared. If you start off the exam scrambling to borrow a pen, you'll go in stressed. The night before the exam, get everything you need ready.Prepare a bag with all the essentials. Make sure you have a pen, and anything extra you need, like a calculator. If it's a long exam, you may want to bring a bottle of water.
You also may want to do something like lay out the clothes you'll be wearing. This can help you get ready efficiently in the morning.

, When you're in the exam room, do not let your mind wander. As soon as the exam is set down before you, focus your energy there and nowhere else.Avoid wondering how others are doing. Do not get caught up in the fact someone has finished before you. Keep your energies focused on the exam at hand.
Take it one question at a time. Do not worry about the next question while answering the current question.

, You may tense up at certain points during the exam. During these times, do something to loosen up. Take a few deep breaths. Stretch. Close your eyes for a few seconds. Taking a few moments to relax can help you ease exam anxiety., Scan the exam before you start and look for your strong areas. Tackle these questions first. This way, you'll get a chunk of the exam done right away. You'll be feeling more confident as you move on to the other questions. This will also give you more time to focus on the difficult questions., You do not want to end up scrambling to complete the exam as time is running out. Be conscious of time as you complete the exam. Periodically glance at your watch to make sure you're not giving too much energy or focus to a single question.Break up the exam into sections. If it's, say, three pages, and you have 45 minutes to complete it, try to stick to 15 minutes per page.

, There is no shame in reaching out for help if you're confused. If you're struggling with a concept, talk to your instructor while there's still time. He or she will probably be happy to help you better understand the subject material.You can ask your teacher or professor after class if they can help you with a problem you're having. You can also visit a professor during office hours or email him or her asking for help.
Are there any resource centers for students on your campus? If so, visit them. If you're struggling with a math exam, for example, go to your school's math resource center and ask for help.

, It's never a good idea to keep things bottled up. If you're stressed about an exam, talk to your fellow students. Open up about how you're feeling and ask them for support.Choose friends and family members who tend to be laid back, empathetic, and supportive. These people are more likely to listen and care.
Avoid people who are also high stress. If you vent to someone experiencing their own exam stress, the two of you may only stress one another out more.

, Take advantage of any resources provided to you. Your school may offer classes or seminars teaching basic study skills. Your school's website may also offer advice on study skills. Effective study skills can help reduce overall stress., If you consistently struggle with exam stress, you may have an underlying anxiety disorder. You may engage in certain thoughts and behaviors that worsen you're anxiety. If you're unable to overcome exam stress on your own, seek counseling.If you're a university student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your college.

Use your notes to test your knowledge.,
Review your notes as often as possible.",How to Take Cornell Notes," Whether you use a notebook or loose sheets kept together in a binder, you will want to have pages set aside just for note-taking. You will divide each sheet into several sections; each section has a specific purpose.;
, This line should be approximately one-fourth of the way up the page, about two inches from the bottom. Later, you will use this section to summarize your notes., This line should be approximately two and a half inches from the left edge of the page. This will be used as the section for reviewing your notes., This section on the right of the page should leave you plenty of space to record important points., If you will be taking a lot of notes and/or want to save time, you can find blank templates for making Cornell style notes. Print blank sheets and follow the same steps for use.

, Do this consistently, and it will help you keep your notes organized and make reviewing course material much easier., While listening to a lecture, or reading a text, take notes only in the right-hand section of the page.Include any information that the professor writes on a board or shows in a slideshow.

, Whenever you come across an important point, make a note of it.Look for signals marking important information. If an instructor says something like ""the three most important implications of X are…"" or ""there are two basic reasons why X happened,"" then this is likely information that you will want to record in your notes.
If you are taking notes from a lecture, listen out for points that are emphasized or repeated, as these are likely important.
These tips hold true if you are reading a text and come across statements like these examples. Textbooks will often put key terms in bold type, for example, or restate important information in graphs or charts.

, Think of your notes as an outline of the lecture or reading. Focus on getting just the key words and points down so that you can keep up with the lecture or reading—you will have time later to review and fill in the gaps.


Rather than writing out complete sentences, use bullet points, shortcuts (like “&” instead of “and”), abbreviations, and any personal note-taking symbols you have.For example, instead of writing out a full sentence, such as “In 1703, Peter the Great founded St. Petersburg and ordered its first building, the Peter and Paul Fortress,” you could write simply “1703—Peter founds St. Pete & builds Peter & Paul Fort.” The shorter version will make it easier to keep up while still recording the essential information.

, Go for the big ideas in the lecture, rather than trying to record all the examples the instructor may give to illustrate these ideas.Paraphrasing not only saves time and space, it forces you to make connections between the ideas presented and your own expression of them, which will help you remember material later.For example, if your instructor says in lecture (or a book states) that: ""In constructing St. Petersburg, Peter hired engineers, architects, shipbuilders, and other workers from many European countries. The immigration of these intellectuals and skilled workers gave St. Petersburg a cosmopolitan atmosphere, accomplishing part of Peter's goal to make the Russian city a 'window on the West',"" don't try to copy that word-for-word!
Paraphrase the information, for example: ""Peter hired engineers, architects, shipbuilders, etc. from all over Europe -- his plan: St. Pete = 'window on the West.'""

, This will help you to mentally organize the material. It will also help you to focus on studying different parts whenever you need to., If there is something you do not understand, or want to know more about, jot this down in your notes. These questions help clarify what you are absorbing, and will be useful for studying later.For example, if you were taking notes on the history of St. Petersburg, as in the examples above, you might make a note ""Why couldn't Peter the Great hire Russian engineers?""

, If there are any parts of your notes that are hard to read or don't seem to make sense, fix them while the material is still fresh in your mind., As soon as possible after the lecture or reading, pull out the main ideas or key facts from the right-hand section. Write very condensed versions in the left hand column -- go for key words or short phrases that communicate the most important information or concepts. Reviewing course material within a day or so of the lecture or reading greatly improves retention.Underlining main ideas in the right-hand column may help you identify them. You can also try highlighting or color-coding, if you're a very visual learner.Cross out unimportant information. Part of the beauty of this system is that it will teach you how to identify the crucial information and discard what is unnecessary. Practice identifying information that you are less likely to need.

, Working from your notes on the right, think about questions that might appear on an exam, and write these on the left. Later on, these can be used as a study tool.For example, if in the right hand section, you have written the note ""1703--Peter founds St. Pete & builds Peter & Paul Fort,"" then in the left hand section, you could write the question ""Why was Peter & Paul fortress 1st building in St. Pete?""
You can write higher level questions that are not answered in the notes, like ""Why did...?,"" or ""Predict what would happen if...?,"" or ""What were the implications of...?"" (e.g., ""What impact did the change in capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg have on the Russian Empire?). These can deepen your learning of the material.

, This helps to clarify all of the information you have recorded. Putting the gist of the material in your own words is a good way to check your comprehension. If you can summarize the page of notes, it means you are well on your way to understanding the material. You might ask yourself, ""How would I explain this information to someone else?""


Often, an instructor will begin a class session by giving an overview of that day's material, e.g.: ""Today, we will discuss A, B, and C"" Similarly, textbook sections often include introductions that summarize the main points. You can use such overviews as a guide for taking notes, and think of them as a version of the summary that you will write at the bottom of your page of notes. Include any additional details that seem important to you or that you think you need to pay special attention to when studying.
Just a few sentences is usually fine for the summary of a page. Include any important formulas, equations, diagrams, etc. in the summary section, if appropriate.If you have trouble summarizing any part of the material, use your notes to identify where you should take a further look or ask your instructor for more information.

, Concentrate on the left-hand column and summary at the bottom. These contain the most important points you will need for your assignment or exam.You can underline or highlight the most important parts as you review, if you prefer.

, Cover the right side of the page (the note-taking column) with your hand or another sheet of paper. Quiz yourself by giving answers to the potential questions that you included in the left column. Then uncover the right side and check your comprehension.You can also ask a friend to quiz you on your notes using the left column, and you can do the same for them.

, Reviewing frequently over a longer period of time, rather than cramming before a test, will greatly increase your retention and deepen your understanding of course material.With your effective notes made using the Cornell system, you will be able to study efficiently and with minimal stress.

Log-out or temporarily disable social media like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. The effort of logging in or enabling it will deter you and after a day you'll start to forget about it- you lose a lot of time to vines and stranger stalking! Also science proves that our brains have an optimum irritation levels-basically we work better if we're a little too cold, or on a rigid chair. sit to a desk or table- its more formal and re-creates the environment you'll be tested in. Yet feel free to get down to it in your jammies- you can wear comfy clothes on the day .Some people like to designate one specific study-place, while others enjoy moving between the their room, the coffee shop, the library, and other study-places to break up the monotony. Choose whatever works best for you and your habits.
Some studies show that studying information in different places allows you to compartmentalize the information, making it easier to recall at a later date if you can associate the information with the location.
Some students find studying in public to be more effective, making it more difficult to watch television or fiddle with other distractions found in the home. Know yourself and head your bad habits off at the pass.;
, What do you hope to cover by the end of the week? By the end of the day? Working from a revision timetable helps you to make clear goals for each revision session and allows you to check them off as you progress. Revision plans can reduce anxiety, reassuring you that you've taken the necessary steps.


Alternatively if this isn't your style and your life is more un-predictable, write up a tick list/ to-do list of all the subject areas or units you need to cover. You can do a separate colour or page for each of your subjects and see clearly exactly what what you've covered or what needs doing. This allows for chunk revision or a variation of topics in one day.

, Going over twelve chapters of trigonometry the night before a big exam is probably going to do more harm than good. Likewise, trying to revise all that Shakespeare several weeks out before being tested might not be the best way to remember the information by test-time. Organize in the most effective way to remember the most important information you've got to study.


You could revise throughout the year by spending 15 minutes each day making notes you'll be able to rely upon later. By doing it in short stretches, you will remember more and feel less stressed. A month before your exam, you will have finished all your notes so you can spend a few hours a day reviewing notes and doing timed writing practice.
If your exam is a long way off, (although this is probably not the case for 80% of you) after each lesson write up your new notes on a Q card (it only take a couple of minutes!) and keep it with your work-this way you're consolidating your knowledge and saving time and panic at the end of the year. If you are the 80% of last minute panickers with 7 exams in 8 days just around the corner- DO NOT PANIC- it is NEVER too late. You've already started the journey here, and stressing out is the last thing you need to do.

, Rather than simply reading quickly over the sometimes-dull texts you've got to study, take a more active role by making Q cards with your own questions on, 5 or so questions per card is appropriate and should cover all the information in the text. These questions can then be used for self-testing or get a friend/family member to quiz you-if you get it wrong, the answers are on the back! Bright colors help make this bit more fun too as-well as organizing your subjects.


Also, you could: highlight your notes/book, mind map/summarize the ideas on each page or TEACH what you've learned to a friend or family member. The best test of knowledge is if you can teach it-remember: ""If you cant explain it simply- you don't know it well enough."" (Albert Einstein) By turning your revision into activity you must participate in, you can liven it up a bit and help your memory work more effectively.
Ask open-ended questions of each text or subject you revise by writing questions in the margin, or on a separate sheet of paper. Try to think about the consequences should certain elements of it be changed, or should certain features occur differently. Whether it is science or history, small changes can make big differences and your thinking process is the important part., As you're studying, stop every few minutes to recap what you've read. Write a short summary--a few sentences--in your notes, or at the bottom of the page. Use your own words. A good way of recalling is writing your notes down from memory and then going back over them and filling in the gaps with another color of pencil or pen. You'll know the different color refers to information you might have trouble remembering.


Periodically, Try to repeat the process of summary, writing down on a separate sheet of paper what you know about a given topic or subject without consulting your books or your previous notes. Compare your new notes to your old, finding what you've left out and what you still need to memorize., For a visual learner, it's important to break down information into drawings or diagrams, to make recall easier in the long run. Diagrams, mind maps, and freehand drawings can be useful ways of improving both your understanding and creating a much easier memory aid than reading the text alone. Do not be afraid to use colors in much the same way––color your drawing or highlight the text.

, Even if it is explaining to the mirror or your cat, just take the time out to talk to someone as if the person is learning about it for the first time, and you are the teacher. It is hard to forget information once you have done this, and also forces you to clarify the information and lay it all out in the most concise and simple way possible.


If no one's around, pretend you're on TV or the radio being interviewed about the topic. Ask yourself a series of questions and reply as succinctly and clearly as you can, pretending people are listening and wanting to learn all about it.

, Answering past exam or test papers in the same time limit, as the real exam or test will be gives you an opportunity to test yourself under the same constraints. It will be a chance to see whether there are gaps in your knowledge that you need to go back over and it'll also be useful to see if you can get down all that you want to say in the time allotted. Do the practices under timed conditions by using a timer, which could be on your phone.You may also find some important questions, who knows?

, If you take breaks regularly, your concentration will be better and you will find yourself retaining more information than if you try to plow straight through. Don't waste energy and time revising with an over-tired mind that won't remember what it just read.


Try to stick to your schedule. Make sure to check off topics and subjects as you accomplish revising them. It may even be a good idea to reward yourself with a treat on the completion of a target to help you get there. It is a good motivation to not consider giving up as an option.

, Look on your teachers and professors as part of your support network and use them for the resource they offer. Ask for their assistance when it becomes clear you need it. Knowing earlier rather than later in your revision will make it easier to approach them and get their help.

, Find a suitable group of good students who hope to succeed, and schedule regular meetings in between your other revision activities. Discuss the topics of revision, helping each other solve problems, understand the materials, and test one another over the reading. Studying in a group can be a great way of reducing anxiety levels and making revision fun, as well as productive.


Find ways to test each other, playing revision games as challenges. Use flash cards or structure your study sessions like a quiz game. Chat online if you haven't time to catch up in person.
Make sure your revision time with friends is spent actually revising. You may actually be better off revising with classmates you're not friendly with to make it productive.

, Your family can help support you even when they cannot understand what you are learning. Ask them to test you, clarify problems for you, read with you, and help you to stay organized. Parents and siblings who have already experienced revision will have some good ideas to help you prepare. Moreover, family and friends can be good moral support when you are feeling down or anxious about the revision.


You may need emotional support as much as other support and if you can trust in someone to talk to about your anxiety or worries, this can help you to offload many unneeded troubles to a caring listener. Even having someone, you can trust like this available online or by phone is better than no one.

, Spend time doing something relaxing each day, such as listening to your favorite music, going for a walk or swim, spending time with your pets or talking with a good friend. These activities will help you to feel relaxed and connected to others and the world as you keep working through the revision. You can also practice relaxation exercises, meditation, or simply just lying back and chilling out now and then...Possibly with a Q card in your hand.

That amount will vary depending on whether you're in high school or college, and also varies by field of study. Make sure you stick to your schedule as much as possible but don't be afraid to go off of plan sometimes to study more for the most recent upcoming exam. Make sure this study plan is realistic and not impossible. Don't forget to schedule in everything, from eating, dressing, and commuting, to labs and scheduled classes.You need to balance school, work, and extra-curricular activities. If you are really struggling with your classes, you may want to give up the afterschool job or an extra-curricular activity until your grades come up. You need to prioritize your time. Remember: your education is the most important thing because it is the foundation of your future success. For college classes, you should base the hours you study per class on how difficult the class is and how many credit hours the class is worth. For example, if you have a 3 hour physics class that is really hard, you want to study 9 hours a week (3 hrs x 3 for hard difficulty). If you have a literature course that is worth 3 hours and is kinda hard, you may want to study 6 hours a week (3 hrs x 2 for medium difficulty).;
, Find the best speed for you to study and adjust accordingly. Some concepts or classes will come to you more naturally, so you can study those more quickly. Other things may take you twice as long. Take the time you need and study at the pace you feel comfortable.


If you study more slowly, remember that you will need more time to study., Make enough time in your schedule to get enough sleep. Get a good night's sleep every night and you'll be making the best of your study time. This is important as you lead up to the test, and especially important right before you take the test. Studies have shown that sleep positively impacts test taking by improving memory and attentiveness. Staying up all night studying may sound like a good idea, but skip the all-night cram session. If you study throughout the weeks, you won't need to cram anyway. Getting a good night's sleep will help you perform better.If you end up a little sleep deprived despite your best efforts, take a short nap before studying. Limit your nap to 15-30 minutes. After you wake, do some physical activity (like you would do during a break) right before you start.

, If you’ve got a lot on your mind, take a moment to write yourself some notes about what you're thinking about and how you feel before you start studying. This will help to clear your mind and focus all your thoughts on your work.

, One of the worst distractions for studying is electronic devices. They are hooked up to social media, you receive texts through your phone, and your laptop is hooked to the internet. Silence your cell phone or keep it in your bag so it's not there to distract you if someone calls or texts you. If you can, don't open your laptop or connect it to the internet.


If you are easily distracted by social networking sites such as YouTube, Facebook, or others, download one of the available applications to instantly block some of the distracting sites on your computer. When you are done with your work, you can unblock access to all the sites as before., Gain control of your study space. You should feel comfortable so that studying is more enjoyable. If you hate sitting at a table in the library, then find somewhere much more pleasant, like your sofa or a beanbag chair on your floor. Try studying in comfortable clothes, like a cozy sweatshirt or yoga pants.The place where you study should be free from distractions and relatively quiet.Don't choose a place so comfortable that you risk falling asleep. You want to be comfortable, not ready to fall asleep. A bed isn't a very good study spot when you're tired.
Traffic outside your window and quiet library conversations are fine white noise, but interrupting siblings and music blasting in the next room are not. You may want to go somewhere away from people who may provide distractions.

, Some people prefer silence while they study, others prefer music in the background. Music can be beneficial to your studying by helping you be calm, elevating your mood, and motivating you. If you listen to music, stick to instrumental music, which is music that has no words like classical, movie scores, trance, or baroque.If it doesn't distract you, listen to familiar music with words. Turn off anything that distracts you from your studying. You may be able to listen to rock music with words but not pop. Figure out what works for you.
Make sure to keep the music at a moderate to low volume. Loud music can distract you while quiet music can help you while studying.
Skip the radio. The commercials and the DJ's voice can bring you out of your study zone., Background sounds can help you ""get in the zone"" and focus on your studies without getting distracted. Natural sounds such as waterfalls, rain, thunder, and jungle sounds can give enough white noise to keep you focused and block out other sounds. There are many places online to find these kinds of sounds, including Youtube., Having the television on while you study is generally a bad idea. It can distract you a lot and make you focus on the TV show or movie instead of the book. Plus, voices are extremely distracting because it engages the language center of your brain., Eat healthy, nutritional foods while you study instead of foods filled with sugar and fat. Go for energy boosting foods, like fruit, or foods to make you feel full, like vegetables and nuts. If you need something sweet, eat dark chocolate. Drink water to keep you hydrated, and drink tea if you need a caffeine boost.


Avoid foods with high amounts of sugar and carbs, like instant noodles, chips, and candy. Don't drink energy drinks and sugary sodas; they contain high amounts of sugar which will cause you to crash. If you drink coffee, skip the sugar heavy drinks.Have your snacks prepared when you begin a study session so you don't get hungry and go rummaging for food.

, SQ3R is a study method that involves active reading to help you comprehend and start learning the material. The method gets you to preview the material and actively read so you are more prepared when you read a chapter or article.


Start with Survey, which means to glance through the chapter to look for tables, figures, headings, and any bolded words.
Then Question by making each heading into a question.

Read the chapter while trying to answer the questions you made from the section headings.

Recite the answers to the questions verbally and any important information you remember from the chapter.

Review the chapter to make sure you include all the main ideas. Then think about why this is important., When you are beginning to study a new chapter, it will make the information it contains much more meaningful and easier to learn if you preview the chapter using THIEVES.


Start with the title. What does the title tell you about the selection/article/chapter? What do you already know about the topic? What should you think about while reading? This will help you frame your reading.
Move to the introduction. What does the introduction tell you about the reading?
Scan the headings and subheadings. What do these headings and subheadings tell you about what you will be reading? Turn each heading and subheading into a question to help guide your reading.
Read the first sentence of every paragraph. These are generally topic sentences and help you think about what the paragraphs will be about.
Look at the visuals and vocabulary. This includes tables, graphs, and charts. More importantly, look at the bolded, italicized, and underlined words, words or paragraphs of a different color, and numerical lists.
Read the end of chapter questions. What concepts should you know by the time you finish reading the chapter? Keep these questions in mind as you read.
Look at the chapter summary to get a good idea of what the chapter is about before going on to read the chapter as a whole.

, Use a highlighter or underline the most important points in the body of the text, so that you can spot them more easily when you review the material.Don't highlight everything - that defeats the purpose. Instead, only highlight the most important phrases and words.It also helps to make notes in pencil in the margin in your own words to summarize or comment on important points.


You can also read just these portions in order to quickly review the material you have learned while it is still fresh in your memory, and help the main points to sink in.
If the textbook belongs to the school, then you can use highlighted sticky notes, or a regular sticky note beside the sentence or paragraph. Jot your notes on a sticky note and paste it beside the paragraph.
It's also a good way to periodically review in this manner to keep the main points of what you have already learned fresh in your mind if you need to remember a large amount of material for a longer period, like for a final examination, for a comprehensive exam in your major, for a graduate oral, or for entry into a profession.

, One good way to study is to write the material in your notes and in the textbook in your own words. That way you can think about it in your own terms instead of textbook language. Incorporate your summaries into your notes, if there is a connection. You can also make an outline. Organize it by main ideas and only the most important subpoints.If you have enough privacy, it also helps to recite your summaries aloud in order to involve more senses. If you are an aural learner, or learn better when verbalizing it, then this method could help you.
If you're having trouble summarizing the material so that it sticks in your head, try teaching it to someone else. Pretend you're teaching it to someone who doesn't know anything about the topic, or create a wikiHow page about it! For example, How to Memorize the Canadian Territories & Provinces was made as a study guide for an 8th grade student.
When making summaries, use different colors. The brain remembers information more easily when it is associated with color.

, This is usually done with index cards. Place a question, term, or idea on one side and have the other side contain the answer. These are convenient because you can carry them around with you and study them when you are waiting for the bus, for class to start, or have a few down moments.You can also download computer programs that cut down on space and the cost of index cards. You can also just use a regular piece of paper folded (vertically) in half. Put the questions on the side you can see when the paper is folded; unfold it to see the answers inside. Keep quizzing yourself until you get all the answers right reliably. Remember: ""Repetition is the mother of skill.""
You can also turn your notes into flash cards using the Cornell note-taking system, which involves grouping your notes around keywords that you can quiz yourself on later by covering the notes and trying to remember what you wrote based on seeing only the keyword.

, The most effective way to retain information is to tie it to existing information that's already lodged in your mind. Using memory techniques can help you remember difficult or large amounts of information.


Take advantage of your learning style. Think about what you already learn and remember easily--song lyrics? choreography? pictures? Work that into your study habits. If you're having trouble memorizing a concept, write a catchy jingle about it (or write lyrics to the tune of your favorite song); choreograph a representative dance; draw a comic. The sillier and more outrageous, the better; most people tend to remember silly things more than they remember boring things.
Use mnemonics (memory aids). Rearrange the information is a sequence that's meaningful to you. For example, if one wants to remember the notes of the treble clef lines in music, remember the mnemonic Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge = E, G, B, D, F. It's much easier to remember a sentence than a series of random letters.You can also build a memory palace or Roman room to memorize lists like the thirteen original colonies in America, in chronological order. If the list is short, link the items together using an image in your mind.
Organize the information with a mind map. The end result of mapping should be a web-like structure of words and ideas that are somehow related in the writer's mind.
Use visualization skills. Construct a movie in your mind that illustrates the concept you're trying to remember, and play it several times over. Imagine every little detail. Use your senses--how does it smell? look? feel? sound? taste?

, One way to study is to break things into smaller sections. This helps you learn the information bit by bit instead of trying to understand everything at once. You can group things by topic, keywords, or any other method that makes sense to you. The key is to lessen how much information you learn at one time so you can focus on learning that material before moving on., Try to condense the information you will need into one sheet, or two if absolutely necessary. Bring it around with you and look at it whenever you have downtime during the days leading up to the test. Take your notes and the chapters and organize it into related topics and pull out the most important concepts.If you type it up onto the computer, you can get a lot more control over your layout by changing font sizes, margin spaces, or bullet lists. This can help if you are a visual learner.

, If you are studying for a few hours at a time, take 5-minute breaks every half hour or so. This helps your joints by moving them around after sitting for a long while; it also helps your mind relax, which can help you more effectively remember the material. This also helps keep you from losing focus.


Do something physically active to get your blood flowing and make you more alert. Do a few jumping jacks, run around your house, play with the dog, do some squats, or whatever it takes. Do just enough to get yourself pumped, but not worn out.
Try integrating standing into your studying. This may mean walking around the table as you recite the information to yourself or standing against the wall as you read your notes., Find a keyword related to what you are studying, and whenever you lose concentration, feel distracted, or your mind wanders to something else, start saying that keyword repeatedly in your mind until you come back to the topic at hand. The keyword in this technique is not a single, fixed word but keeps changing according to your study or work. There are no rules to select the keyword and whichever word the person feels that it will bring back his concentration can be used as a keyword.


For example, when you are reading an article about the guitar, the keyword guitar can be used. While reading, whenever you feel distracted or not able to understand or concentrate, start saying the keyword guitar, guitar, guitar, guitar, guitar until your mind comes back to the article and then you can continue your reading.

, When in class, make sure you take the best notes you can. This doesn't mean going for neatness or writing everything in complete sentences. You want to catch all the important information. Sometimes, you may write down a term the teacher says, then go home and copy the definition out of your textbook. Try to write down as much as you can.


Taking good notes in class will force you to stay alert and pay attention to everything that is going on in the class. It'll also help keep you from falling asleep.
Use abbreviations. This helps you so that you can quickly jot down words without spelling anything out. Try coming up with your own abbreviation system, or use common ones like b/t for between, bc for because, wo for without, and cd for could.

Ask questions in class as they pop into your brain, or make a contribution to the class discussion. Another way to question or make a connection is to jot it in the margin of your notes. You can look the question up when you get home, or you can piece together the connection when you are studying that day., When you take notes, focus on recording the information over understanding or neatness. Rewrite your notes as soon after the class as possible, while the material is fresh in your mind so that you can fill in any gaps completely from memory. The process of rewriting your notes is a more active approach to studying by making you actively engage your mind with the information. You can easily zone out if you're just reading. Writing them makes you think about the information.That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to understand or organize your notes at all; just don't waste time doing something in class that you can figure out or neaten up at home. Consider your in-class notes a ""rough draft.""
You may find it easier to keep two notebooks--one for your ""rough draft"" notes, and another for your rewritten notes.
Some people type their notes, but others find that handwriting enhances their ability to remember the notes.
The more paraphrasing you do, the better. Same goes for drawing. If you're studying anatomy, for example, ""re-draw"" the system you're studying from memory.

, Logical arguments will not give you motivation to study. Thinking, ""if I study hard, I will get into a good university and get a good job,"" will not interest you. Find something interesting in what you study. Try to find the beauty of every subject, and most importantly, try to link it with the events of your life and things that interest you.


This linking may be conscious, like performing chemical reactions, physical experiments, or manual mathematics calculations in order to prove a formula, or unconscious, like going to the park, looking at the leaves, and thinking, ""Hmm, let me review the parts of the leaf we learned in bio class last week.""
Use your creativity to make stuff up. Try making stories to go along with the information you are studying. For example, try to write a story with all subjects starting with S, all objects starting with O, and no verbs containing V. Try creating a connected story with vocabulary words, historical figures, or other keywords., Start with the most difficult subjects or concepts at the beginning of your study session. That way you have enough time to study them and you are more energetic and alert. Save the easier stuff for later.Learn the most important facts first. Don't just read the material from beginning to end. Stop to memorize each new fact as you come to it. New information is acquired much more easily when you can relate it to material that you already know. Don't spend a lot of time studying things that won't be on the test. Focus all your energy on the important information.

, Look for vocabulary lists or words in bold in the chapter. Find out if your textbook has a vocabulary section, a glossary, or a list of terms and make sure that you understand these completely. You don't have to memorize them, but whenever there is an important concept in a particular field, there is usually a special term to refer to it. Learn these terms, and be able to use them easily, and you will have gone a long way towards mastering the subject itself.

, Get 3-4 friends or classmates together and have everyone bring over their flash cards. Pass them around and quiz each other. If anyone is unclear on a concept, take turns explaining them to each other. Better yet, turn your study session into a game like Trivial Pursuit.


Divide concepts among the members and have each member teach or explain the concept to the rest of the group.
Divide lectures among the group and have each group summarize the key concepts. They can present it to the group or create an outline or 1-page summary for the rest of the group.Develop a weekly study group. Spend each week covering a new topic. That way you study throughout the semester instead of just at the end.
Make sure they are people who are actually interested in studying.

So what are you waiting for, get to your homework!",How to Find Motivation to Do Homework," If you have a study period, do as much of your homework as you can. The more you do while you are at school, the less you will need to do at home. Don't try to do everything at the last second.Try to do all of it in class (if time is provided), at lunch, or any other spare time you may have. This way you may also get help while at school, if you don't understand the work. Ask your teachers while they are available: they're there to assist you. Let them help you.


Put the hardest homework at the top of your list. Why? Well, this allows you to kick it up a notch! You can start, move on, and then continue re-thinking it (starting gives it a place in the ""depths"" of your mind -- an inventive part of your mind) and then going back to it, to do more, so you won't get too bogged down, but it will have priority for the subconscious mind to work on it! See, you don't have to get stuck in that problem -- that might take all of your time:
Do a quick effort; make it a worthwhile try, then go onward to less demanding homework. Later, going back -- and seeing how you can improve the first one with fresh bits and pieces.
Open ""secret back-channels"" -- just starting, even if you have to come back to finish, gets your creativity to kick in (this gets dark recesses of your mind to really work for you!). Creative juices can be inspiring, refreshing, helpful!;
, Make piecework; quickly overview the topic: scan!
~ Read headings, intro, maps, charts, pictures, captions, bold or italic lettering, footnotes, and chapter summaries to get ideas and perspectives/angles for ideas to start yourself thinking.
~ Begin your answer to each problem and essay question, by doing parts! How? Make a first sentence or step, do any logical, little bits and bites (go step-by-step).
~ Add a second thought/step and another -- each flowing from the previous one. Going one phrase or sentence at a time makes it possible to write or do something.
~ Skip some lines, to leave room to fill in later -- if you need to move on to another area.
To re-kick-start an answer: Read what you have already written/or have done to check it, and see what flows from there', to lead your thinking to your next thought/step, and so on.

, Once you've completed your goal and finished your homework, reward yourself with some little thing that you would find enjoyable and double after you finish. Save a special book to read when homework is done, or make plans to talk with a friend on the phone as soon as both of you have completed your assignments. Go on your favorite website, or even dedicate yourself to a great project you've always been wanting to do.


Take advantage of any holidays or vacations that may be coming near as a motivator. On a Thursday, remind yourself that it is almost the weekend, and the moment this homework assignment is done you'll be one moment closer. Remember that Thanksgiving, winter break, or summer break is nearing, and the moment your homework is done you can enjoy it to its fullest.

, The surest way to get over procrastination is to take care of a task as soon as you think of it - don't delay and tell yourself you'll do it later.


Think of it this way: if you procrastinate, you're spending time worrying about the task in addition to the time you actually do it. If you just take action and complete it as soon as you think of it, then you'll have more time to relax.

, A fried brain absorbs little information. Break up your homework time into chunks. Take regular breaks. Set a timer; take a five to ten minute break for each hour you study. Get up, stretch, and move around. Drink water and eat a little fruit: water will refresh your system, and half an apple provides a better effect than a sugary energy drink.

, What will happen, if you don't do your homework? Will you get a bad grade? Will your teacher be disappointed in you? If none of these things seem to apply to you, remember that homework is to help you learn, which everyone ultimately wants. In the real world, knowledge helps you master the rules of the game.

, What will happen, if you do your homework? You'll probably get a good grade. Your teacher will appreciate your efforts. You have learned a great deal, and you'd be paving your way for a better life simply by putting your pencil to paper! Putting yourself in a positive state will reap in the benefits and ultimately surge you with the energy and hope to focus back on your work, and even enjoy what you're doing!

, Set up your special study place. No friends, television, or other potential distractions should be present. Your homework place should also have a hard surface, like a table, to write on. If you need to do some of your homework on a computer, as many high school students do, make sure to avoid chat programs, unrelated websites, etc. If you have difficulty keeping focused, or awake, consider doing your homework at the library, at a table with some amount of foot traffic passing by it. The quiet atmosphere will help you focus, the surrounding mild activity will help keep you from falling asleep, and if you get stuck, there are those helpful librarians and references.

, It's easier to concentrate on your homework when you don't have clutter in your workspace. Take five minutes to tidy up your immediate area before you get started.


Don't go on a cleaning binge as a way to procrastinate. Focus only on where you'll be working, and leave it at that.

, Make sure this person isn't one of your crazy friends who'll distract you. Find someone to sit with who is quiet and focused. This will help you feel comfortable working, because someone else is working along with you. Just be sure not to end up talking more than working.

, Everybody learns at their own pace and uses different methods to help memorize the material. Some find walking helpful, while others like to listen to music while they study. Whatever it is, experiment until you find something that seems to work well for you.

, Listening to music and studying does not work for everyone. If you are going to listen to music, try to listen to classical music or instrumental songs. Or if classical isn't for you, just pick quiet songs that you don't know, and start working, so you don't get caught up in the words.

, It will help relieve tension, clear your mind, help you focus and make you feel awake. For example, walk around, stretch, do jumping jacks, or jog in place.

, A routine will get you into doing homework as a habit. Schedule times and days so you are totally organized as to what you're doing this week, the next, and even the week afterwards. Surprises will occur, but at the very least, you know what you're doing!

, Turn off your computer, phone, etc. that could distract you easily. Don't get wrapped up on the computer or phone on a break because you will not remember what you were learning about and it will delay your finish time. Stay away from them at all costs unless you must do the homework on the computer.


Put your phone, computer, and anything else that might distract you far from your reach. Then stay in a quiet room where you know you won't get distracted. Keep a timer for every 30 minutes to an hour, so you know how long you've been working and can still keep track of time.

, Divide your homework according to your ability in the subject. If you're not so good, do it first. If it's an easy assignment, take a break and do it in 15 minutes or so, then get working again! If it's a long-term project, do it last. Not that it's not as important, but you need to save your time for the things with near-due-dates.

, Diving right into the hard stuff can be discouraging, and studies show that many people learn well when they start with easier material and work up to the harder stuff. Getting a few easy tasks done quickly can remind you of how good it feels to be productive. Some people, however are more motivated to dig into the hardest stuff first. It will make the rest seem like a breeze. Find out what works best for you.

, Most problems can be broken down into simpler problems. That's a key to try on most math and science work and exams.

Try to find a quiet place where you'll be able to study in peace and focus on what you need to do. If needed make some changes in the room.


Your room is often the best bet, but anywhere can work. Try to set aside a specific spot to do your homework every night, like the kitchen table or a desk in the living room.
If you can't find a quiet place in your house, or you don't have your own room, try staying after school to finish your homework. Or head to the public library to study.;
, Before you get started, make sure you gather all the right materials and utensils, gathering them neatly on your desk. If you have everything you'll need, you'll be able to concentrate on what you're doing, not where your protractor is, and where you need to find your notes. Tidiness is essential, so clean the clutter before you study.


Bring a glass of water, or a healthy snack, so you won't find a reason to leave your work when you get a little craving. Keep your butt in the chair.

, Turn off the computer, Facebook, Twitter, or anything that will distract you. If you're trying to focus, get rid of everything except the assignment in front of you and anything directly related to that assignment. If you need your computer for finding information, then try concentrating on the information, not on anything else.


If you struggle with wanting to check your phone or your computer, put them in another room, or give them to your mom or roommate to watch over them. Only get them back when you're on break time.
Some recent studies suggest that listening to soft, instrumental music can actually improve concentration when you're doing homework. It doesn't work for everyone, but experiment with music and see if it works for you.Also make sure the place where you are studying is at a comfortable temperature. If the place you are at cannot have the temperature changed, make sure you brought something warm to keep you nice and focused instead of being focused on being cold.

, Before you start, write out everything that you need to do to finish your homework in a detailed list. Even if you have a school planner or something similar, it's good to have a clear list in front of you at home before you start, so you can check things off as you work.


Write down the subject name and a brief overview of what you have to do for the assignment. Write down the due date and a rough guess about how long it might take to finish each assignment. Take in consideration other assignments, if you have any.
Order your to-dos from hardest to easiest, so you can tackle the toughest stuff first. Or you can order them in order of how long you think they'll take, so you can focus on the most time-consuming tasks first. Both ways are effective.

, Without a plan, it can sometimes be pretty hard to stay on task. Try setting a certain block of time for each thing you need to get done. For example, science homework will be done from 4:00-5:00, then math work will be completed from 5:00-6:00. This will help you stay on track so you’re not straying from your work. The deadline for the work will help you complete tasks with some intensity, so that you’re not leaving it all to the last second.


It’s pretty important to know when your assignment is due so you can budget your time properly. It can be pretty rough if you’re working on 4 different assignments the night before they are all due.
Try to keep your work area organized as well. Having math work in the middle of all your English notes isn’t the best way to stay focused on your work.

, It can be hard to go from regular life to studying with the flip of a switch. Give your brain a chance to change from TV-watching mode to reading and studying mode. Try flipping through your textbook before you start, so you can get into the mind set.


Re-copying your notes quickly can also be extremely effective. The notes you copied down Friday afternoon probably aren't imprinted on your mind yet. It's an easy way to study and get your thinking cap fitted properly.

, Lots of people find the most effective way to approach homework is to start with the toughest tasks and get them out of the way. If you absolutely hate math, but get a kick out of reading for English, do your math homework first and treat yourself afterward with the easier English reading. As you get more worn down over the homework hours, the work will get easier.


Alternatively, you might find it more effective to do the most time-consuming tasks first. These might be the same as the hardest, but not necessarily.

, If you struggle to focus while you're doing something repetitive, speaking your math problems out loud can help to keep your mind centered on what you're doing. This will help you keep from getting distracted.


If you feel silly, you don't have to speak them very loudly. Just whisper. When you're trying to puzzle out what to do with the problem, speak out loud as well. Hearing what you're thinking can help with creativity., Don't switch between assignments. Instead, finish one before you move on to the next. According recent studies, multitasking temporarily drops your IQ and your cognitive abilities on each task, making the work even tougher.Check things off as you go. As soon as you have completed a task, put a check next to it-you can even have several check boxes for different parts of the task. Being able to put a tick next to something and think: I've done this, is a great feeling, and can encourage you to keep going.
If you really can't figure something out, put it aside for a while. Staring at something useless only gets you frustrated and it takes lots of time. Starting another task makes you feel a little better (a fresh start-feeling) and you'll probably feel a lot better when you begin some other time.

, Looking at a late night of homework? Try to never work longer than an hour or maybe two past your normal sleep time. Do as much as possible, and finish up in the morning if you've got some leftover. If you can't finish, plan better next time.


Your work will start to suffer as you get more tired, and you'll hurt your focus for the next day as well. Once you start mixing your work time and sleep time, you'll have trouble planning, budgeting time, and estimating your workload.

, Instead of one super long break, take a few short breaks in between different assignments. Maybe have a five minute break for a snack after 30-60 minutes of work.


Take five minutes to stretch, pop outside for a walk, or do something active, instead of just sitting and checking Facebook. It's important to make sure that you aren't sitting at a desk for hours and hours at a time.
When you don't take breaks, the work can seem kind of endless. Productivity and concentration suffer, because you end up wasting some time doing other things like going on social media, doodling, or just doing poor work.

, Caffeine gives some students a much-needed jolt of concentration juice. For others, it's a fast-track to jittering around like a squirrel on speed. Don't drink more than the normal amount of coffee or caffeinated drink you usually consume. It will make concentrating harder.


Better than caffeine is just staying hydrated. Drink water or juice instead to make sure your brain is functioning on all levels.

, It can be kind of hard to focus if you’re alone in a tiny room with just your books and papers. Sometimes it can be helpful to work out in the open where there are other people, or to study in a big group. They can be helpful in keeping you accountable. If you say that you’re working on an essay and they see you browsing Tumblr, they can point it out and keep you in check.


As long as you're not sharing answers, working on homework together isn't cheating. Really, it's just smart time management and study skills.

, It's important to give yourself a reward for the hard work you're doing, each time you finish a task. Working toward a fun activity, treat, or some leisure time helps to motivate you to finish your work quickly, which means you'll have to concentrate.


Try this: Cut some colored paper into strips or squares and write all of your assignments you have for that day. Put these in one pile. Create another pile with an equal number of rewards. Put checking your phone or Facebook page on one, playing a game for 10 minutes, watching the new episode on TV, or anything that you want to do or would do in your free time.
When you finish one task, pick a treat from the pile of rewards. This is a great way to get work done and enjoy the things you like to do. Don't get too carried away with the rewards. Only one episode TV, not the rest of the season.

Don't go overboard.",How to Make a Study Space," You want to be comfortable, but not so comfortable that you lose focus or fall asleep. (Your bed’s not the greatest option for homework, it turns out.)You also need adequate workspace to spread out.


Find a desk or table with a top that rests somewhere between your waist and ribcage when you sit at it, so that your elbows can rest easily upon it without having to hunch your shoulders forward. You also want to be able to rest your feet flat on the ground.Use a comfortable chair that fits the height of the desk / table. You may want to skip the fancier desk chairs that rotate, roll, recline, lift, etc., if these will only become distractions.






If you are using a computer, you want enough space to place it about 1 ½ to 2 ½ feet away from you.;
, A study area that is too dark will not only make it easier to nod off, it can exacerbate eye strain, which will put a damper on any study session. Harsh lighting, such as fluorescent light, can be bad for your eyes too.Use a desk lamp to focus light on your workspace, and also a nearby table or overhead light to brighten the area.If natural light is available, certainly make use of it. Be aware, though, that while the natural light provided by a window can be refreshing and calming, the temptation to stare out the window may hamper your studying.Consider draperies or translucent blinds, or face away from the window.

, Make sure you have all the materials you need for studying close at hand, so you don’t waste time fumbling around for a ruler or pencil lead refills.Keep classic school supplies like pens or pencils, erasers, paper, notecards, highlighters, and so on in assigned areas on the desk or in a handy drawer.
Keep a traditional pocket dictionary, thesaurus, and calculator nearby, even though your phone can probably do the jobs of all three. Using your phone to do long division or spell-check is an open invitation to distraction by the million other things you can do on it., Make use of the desk drawers to keep things you need close by but not spread out all over the desktop. If you don’t have enough (or any) drawers, use boxes, small crates, etc. that you can stack on the desktop along the perimeter of your study area.


Organize your study materials by course / subject in folders or binders. Mark each clearly and store them for easy access.
You can also organize assignments and notes by using bulletin boards, cork tiles, and wall calendars.
For more ideas, see How to Organize Your Desk


, Being organized should extend to your online stuff as well as what’s physically around you. Have you ever looked for a draft of that essay you were writing only to be unable to find it? Or lost the notes you needed to study for your psych test because you can’t remember where you saved them? Create specific folders for each class or subject, and keep all your files in the right place.Label things clearly so you can use the search feature to find them. Skip cutesy names in favor of descriptive titles. And label drafts!

, This depends on the type of person you are. Will a clock motivate you to keep studying for an hour more, or remind you that your favorite show is on in only 15 minutes (or make you think “I’ve only been studying for that long?!”)?Try using a clock to set time-related study goals. You can also use the clock or timer feature on your phone or a watch to help you do this. Decide to study in a “chunk” of time, such as 30 minutes. Don’t allow yourself any distractions for that period of time. When it’s up, take a little break to reward yourself!You could also try out a timer for even more precise time-keeping, especially if you are preparing for a timed exam like the SAT or ACT.
If the tick-tock of an old-fashioned clock bothers you, go digital.







, This ties in with the need for proper desk organization, but also means that you need to keep tabs on the mess of papers, pens, open books, and so on that may build up on your workspace as you study. Too much clutter can leave you feeling overwhelmed and stressed out, which will put a damper on your study session.It is a good idea to take short study breaks along the way anyway, so when you do, take a moment to tidy up your workspace before resuming.
Excess clutter can lead to unnecessary distractions. Keep only what you need at that time in front of you. A cluttered workspace can lead to a cluttered mind., It is hard to ignore the lure of your phone when studying. The modern smartphone is perhaps the ultimate tool and the ultimate distractor. Put it away when you study, or you may find yourself browsing Facebook or texting a friend without even realizing you’d picked up the phone.Shut your phone off or put it in silent mode so the lure of notification chimes doesn’t drag you away from your studies. Also try placing it well out of reach so you can’t reflexively grab for it.If you are using your phone as a calculator or other tool, consider putting it in “airplane mode,” which shuts off wireless and cellular connections. You can turn them back on for your (brief) study breaks., Some people do well with “white noise,” background noises such as those in a coffee shop that aren’t really distinct enough to be distracting. Others need total silence to work. Figure out what works well for you, and plan your space accordingly.”Multitasking” is a myth. You simply can’t watch TV or surf Facebook and study at the same time, no matter how much you think you’re “really” a multitasker.Focus your study time on studying, and save things like TV and music for leisure time.
If your study space shares a room or a thin wall with a TV in use by someone, or people engaged in conversation or some other potential distraction, try to block out the distraction with your own background noise.
Try choosing something like rain sounds or white noise; there are websites and apps with samples of these. If you prefer music, try light classical or at least something without lyrics. You want something that negates audio distractions without becoming one itself.Don’t use headphones if you have a choice. They seem to hinder focus and information retention for many people, probably because the sound does not as easily blend into the background., If your study space is your bed, you’ll be more tempted to think of (or actually) sleep. It it’s where you play computer games, gaming; the dining room table, eating; and so on. You’ll be more likely to create distracting associations.If it is possible for you to carve out a space -- even a corner, a niche, a large closet, etc. -- dedicated exclusively to studying, do it. Associate your presence there only with studying.
If this is not an option, do what you can to transform the multipurpose space into study space. Clear away food, dishes, centerpieces, etc., from the dining room table. Put away your computer games, scrapbooking supplies, and so on.

, Studying is hard, hungry work, but you need to be careful. It’s easy to nibble into oblivion when you’re hitting the books. Junk food in particular is a bad idea. If you have to have some snacks handy, choose fresh fruits, vegetables, or whole-grain snacks like crackers.Try to avoid over-consuming sugar and caffeine while studying. These can make you feel jittery and lead to “crashes” later.
Try saving your snack for when you take a study break. You’ll be more aware of what you’re eating, and it’s a nice way to reward yourself for a job well done.
Don’t ignore your body’s needs, though. Set yourself a meal or snack break, or give yourself a specific amount of time before you replenish your coffee. This way, you take care of your mind and your body.

, Try to locate your study space in an area that suits you. If you need dead silence, find a tucked away corner, an attic, a basement, a spare bedroom, whatever you can find. If you prefer some sound, locate it near (but not within) an area of more activity.If the location can’t always be your dedicated study space, let others know when it is being used as such. Go ahead and make a “Do Not Disturb,” “Quiet, please,” or “Hey, knock it off -- I’m studying here!” sign to post, depending on your personality.

, Adorning your study space with posters, signs, and photos that are important to you may help give you that boost to keep going. Just make sure they don’t become distractions rather than motivators.Figure out what kind of motivation works for you. A picture of your family or a beloved pet? A poster of the car you hope to get after you pass these exams and graduate? Copies of your earlier exams in chemistry with poor scores that you are determined to improve upon? Determine whether you need more of a “push” or a “pull” (or a carrot or stick, if you prefer) to keep you motivated.






Decorating the space also identifies it as yours, even if only temporarily, as in the case of a dining room table or shared space. Bring along a few motivating mementos for your study time that can be easily packed up when you’re finished.

, If you can add color to your study space, keep in mind that cool colors like blue, purple, and green tend to inspire feelings of peace and balance, while warmer colors like red, yellow, and orange tend to inspire activity and even restlessness.So, if you tend to get overly anxious for upcoming exams, consider going with a cool color palate for your décor; if you need a kick in the pants while trying to study, go warmer.
Don’t shortchange your other senses, though. Some scents, like lemon, lavender, jasmine, rosemary, cinnamon, and peppermint, seem to boost mood and productivity in some people. Try out different scented candles and essential oils.While white noise, rain sounds, or classical music are generally the best choices for background sound during a study session, if you can’t bring yourself to choose such options, select music that is very familiar to you. Create a soundtrack with songs you’ve heard a million times before; these are more likely to fade into the background than a new hit that you just begs you to sing along., Remember that the purpose of a study space is to help you study more effectively. If you spend too long trying to set up your space just so and end up significantly reducing your actual study time, you will be doing yourself a disservice. A study space meant to limit distractions can become a distraction itself.


Remember: You're better off studying in a less-than-ideal space than not studying in a perfect space.

Attend all your classes.,
Sit at the front of the class.,
Resist using your computer for non-class related items.,
Put your hand up.,
Speak to your instructor.,
Finish your assignments by the due dates.,
Enroll in classes you actually enjoy.,
Get lots of sleep.",How to Improve Your Grades Without Studying1," It can be really easy to skip a class or two, but attending every class can help ensure two things: you get participation marks (if the instructor is giving them); and you’re more likely to remember something taught in class., Sitting at the front of the class isn’t so you can suck up to the instructor, it’s to increase your chances of paying attention and remembering what is being taught. You’re less likely to be distracted by other students if you sit at the front of the class., If your class is being held in a computer lab, or if you bring your own laptop (or tablet) to class, resist the temptation to use it for non-class related stuff.


Close all your email and social media programs while in class.
If you’re only using your computer to take notes or view presentation slides, disconnect from the internet.
By disconnecting yourself from the internet (and email and social media) you are giving yourself a chance to resist the temptation to pay more attention to your computer than your teacher.
Any activity that is not class-related should be avoided while in class. Use your in class time to pay attention.

, If you have a question in class, ask it. If you think you know the answer to a question the instructor asks, answer it. If class participation is part of your class grade, asking and answering questions in class will help you get those points.Being verbal in class will also draw the attention of your instructor, who may then get to know you and consider you a student who is interested in learning.

, The best person to help you get better grades is the person who gives out those grades. Make an appointment to speak with your instructor about your performance.Let your instructor know that you aren’t satisfied with your grades and you want to improve.
Ask your instructor where you might be going wrong. Ask if there are any specific areas where you should focus.

, Many instructors will allow assignments to be handed in late, but they’ll deduct points automatically for late assignments. Therefore, work it into your schedule to submit your assignments on time to ensure you can get the most possible points for your hard work., Chances are, not all your classes are required or mandatory. For your elective classes, select topics that you actually like and want to study. Liking and enjoying the subject matter not only makes attending class easier, it makes remembering the material easier., Scientific studies have actually shown that cramming for an exam or test the night before doesn’t actually work. You are actually more likely to do better on the test if you stop studying and get some sleep, than if you spend the whole night attempting to remember everything for the test.Teenagers need at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep every night to be able to function effectively the next day.Children between the ages of 6 and 13 need 9 to 11 hours of sleep every night in order to be able to function well the next day.While it may seem like a good idea to grab an extra cup of coffee or drink that can of Red Bull, the more caffeine you consume in the afternoon means you’ll have a harder time sleeping that night. Try to keep drink caffeinated beverages only in the morning."

It's easy to lose focus when your teacher is going on and on about something that's not interesting, but you should not tune them out. Really listen to what they're saying and keep yourself engaged by asking questions and taking notes.;
, It might seem silly, but notes are actually a great way to help you improve your grades. Good notes are like a road map, when you go to study later on. They'll also show your teachers that you're serious about doing better in your classes. You don't have to write down everything your teacher says: just get down the basics. You know when you tell your parents about what happened to you during the day? That's how you should take notes. Just get the broad strokes, with the really important things written with greater detail.


If you know something is confusing to you or seems really complex, write that down too! Even if you don't understand what your teacher is saying, you'll have a note to yourself that you need to look that up and get more information later.
Write out your notes by hand, instead of on a computer. You will have an easier time remembering them this way.

, When you don't understand a concept or fact that your teachers talks about in lecture or that you encounter in your text books, don't be afraid to ask! Smart people don't just know everything instantly...they're curious enough to ask and find out when they don't know something.


If you're nervous about asking in front of everyone else, you can also talk to your teacher outside of class time and ask about getting some extra help or explanation.
You also shouldn't feel like your teacher would be angry about you not understanding. Teachers are happy when you're interested enough and invested enough to ask for help.
If your teacher doesn't explain it in a way that you can understand or if you still feel uncomfortable, try going on the Internet to find a new explanation. You can often find YouTube videos covering common school concepts, and there are also forums and other websites that might deal with your question and explain it to you better.

, Your teacher will probably give you a syllabus at the beginning of the year or semester. This is a written outline of all of the subjects you will study over the course of the year. You should go over this syllabus carefully and ask your teacher about anything on it that doesn't make sense. Paired with your notes, it's another great road map to your learning.

, You might not realize it, but your problems concentrating might be because you're hungry! Try eating a small snack between classes, as well as a drink of water, in order to help your brain concentrate and have the best chance at absorbing the material.


Your snack should be high in protein, which will give you the most energy. Try salami sticks or a handful of almonds or soy nuts.

, Everyone learns in different ways. Some people learn better when they're moving and using their body. Some people learn better with lots of pictures and visuals. Some people learn better when they can hear things like words and music. Think about what helps you remember things the most and then find ways to work that into how you learn your course material.


For example, if you're an auditory learner (someone who learns better with sounds), ask your teacher if you can record lectures to listen to again later.
If you don't know your learning style, you can take a test here or you can take any number of other online tests. You can also just analyze your own classroom experiences.
If you're a visual learner, draw up some charts or webs which visually represent the information you need to learn and how the ideas are connected.

, Don't procrastinate! Waiting until the end of the quarter to study or, even worse, cramming the night before a test dooms you to poor grades. Your brain won't have enough time to really understand the material and log it away. Cramming leads you to remember things incorrectly or not at all. Basically, you should set aside time every night to go over material from the previous week and make sure you remember and understand everything.


This means that when you study for a test, all you have to do is a quick refresher.
Try to return to old material as much as possible, to help solidify the ideas in your mind.

, Having good notes allows you to quickly go over the material and refresh your memory. If you didn't understand it the first time, your notes will give you a road map to finding the information that you need. Organize your notes by topic and go over them one topic at a time.


Sometimes topics that are related are covered at very different points in the year. You might have to pair information you learned in September with information you learned in January, to get a full picture of it.

, Sometimes your teacher may give you a study guide, but if not, you should make your own. A study guide breaks up the information that might be covered on the test and then lists out the most important facts and ideas. These are usually used for preparing for tests but they can also be used for keeping up with regular subjects as well. Make one for yourself each time you finish a unit and you will be prepared for anything your teacher could throw your way.


Make study cards. Study cards are like little study guides, with a single concept or set of facts to one note card. You can then study these like flash cards, giving yourself 2-3 per day, covering material from previous weeks so that it stays fresh in your mind.

, Have you ever seen a mind map? This is where someone writes down an idea on a card and places it on a wall, then connects other cards with similar ideas to the first. You can do this for studying too! Make charts, graphs, and written descriptions on pieces of paper or note cards, and then organize these by taping them to your wall. Study from your wall and when it becomes test time, you'll be able to think of where the information you need was on your wall and you'll have a much easier time remember it!

, You'll probably have to do at least a little memorizing, for information that you can't remember easily. Different people memorize things better or worse using different techniques, so you'll probably have to do some experimenting. The most important thing is to remember to start the process early and spend a lot of time working on it, so that your brain has enough time and experience to really log it away. You can try these memorization techniques:


Work only on small sections at a time. When working on memorizing lists (such as vocabulary words, place names, or groups of people), never work with more than five items at a time. Thoroughly memorize these five items before going on to the next five items. If you try to do all at once, you'll really struggle.
Use mnemonics. Mnemonics are when you use acronyms or other keys in order to remember lists or concepts. For example, ""Memory Needs Every Method Of Nurturing Its Capacity"" is a mnemonic for how to spell mnemonic. Look up if there are any mnemonics for what you're studying, or make up your own!
Use flash cards. Flash cards are useful for studying vocabulary words and other things, like dates. Write yourself a question or word on one side of a note card, and the answer or definition on the other.

, Your studying will be most effective if you break it up with mental rest periods. MIT recommends 50 minutes of study or work followed by 10 minutes of rest. They also recommend using this time to do things like eat and get a few minutes of exercise, since this will keep your mind sharp and productive.

, You need to have a productive environment to study in. Your study environment should be free of distractions, so turn off those cell phones! You need to focus because each time you do get distracted, studies show, it takes 25 minutes to really get back on track. Sometimes, you might be able to find a quiet spot in a busy house if you think outside the box: try a basement or bathroom. If your home isn't good for studying, try a library or coffee shop.
A lot of the time, we tell ourselves that we need certain things, like television and music, to help us focus when really we just want to justify a distraction. If you're one of the 30% of auditory learners, your learning will be more productive if you speak aloud the information, rather than trying to learn it while other noises are competing for your attention.

, Eating poorly can make it hard for your brain to work, because it won't have the tools it needs. The same goes for sleep. Scientists now think that when we sleep, our brains clean out toxins and other dangerous materials that keep us from being able to think clearly. Get your 8 hours of sleep (or however much leaves your body feeling refreshed for the entire day) and eat a healthy, balanced diet.


Skip out on junk food, sugar, and too much fat. You should eat fruits, vegetables (kale and spinach are good), and healthy protein sources like fish and nuts.

, Keep all of your work organized in folders and binders and keep a calendar of due dates. Staying organized like this will help keep you from forgetting assignments and tests. It will also help you schedule in study time and relaxation time, in a way that you can create a healthy balance.


Staying organized extends to your work space as well. You should keep extras off of your desk that might cause distractions.

, When you study, start by evaluating what you do know. You can set aside the information you do know for last minute review. Just make sure that you really are comfortable with the material and do set aside at least a little review time before going in for a test. Once you've set this aside, you can focus on conquering the information that you don't know or aren't comfortable with.

, When you know you have a test coming up, you'll need to really buckle down and devote extra time and focus to making sure you understand the material. Talk to your teacher for some extra, pointed advice on how to prepare for your test. You should at least ask them about the format that you can expect, as well as how it will be graded.


Study for tests in the testing room. Visual learners especially will benefit from this technique. Your brain will associate the visuals in the room with the studying you did and the information you learned, making it easier to recall.
Some studies have argued, however, that moving around to different rooms can help you remember information better. This technique, however, may cause too much distraction so use it carefully and if it doesn't seem to help, stop using it.
Take a practice test. Practice tests can help you overcome test anxiety and help you understand what you're likely to encounter on the test. Get together with a group of friends and make several practice tests. You can even ask your teacher with help on this!

, Time management is crucial to making good marks on assignments and exams. A lot of the time we feel like we've spent more time on studying than we really have (because of distractions) or we'll feel like we shouldn't spend more time on studying because we have so little free time to begin with. When you cut out activities that really don't add anything to your life, like playing Candy Crush or checking Facebook, you'll find that you have way more time for both studying and relaxing! Really prioritize what's important and you'll be setting aside a good amount of time for study before you know it.

, If you're really working to turn your grades around but you're not making any headway, try talking to your teacher. Set up a meeting after school or at lunch and explain your problem to them: you're trying to improve your grades but studying more, taking notes, and other traditional methods aren't working. They might be better able to understand where you're struggling and help you find a way to overcome the problem.

, If you're working hard on your coursework and you've shown your teacher that you've really changed your approach to learning, you should consider asking for extra credit or even a special, big side project. This can help make up for poor grades you got earlier and help you end with an A...even if you had a C!


Make sure you explain to your teacher everything you've been working on, so that they know you're serious. A lot of teachers don't like extra credit, but they'll probably have sympathy if they see you really working to put yourself on a better path.

, If you're really having a hard time, ask your teacher or your university's tutoring center if they can help you find a tutor. Getting a tutor isn't admitting defeat and it doesn't make you dumb: a tutor is a tool, like a code book or a translator. Everyone has something that they don't understand at some point and you're making the smart decision by using every weapon in your arsenal to defeat your lack of understanding.

, When you study with other people, you're pulling together all of your different pieces of intelligence and understanding to make one academic ace! You can compare notes and discuss the class to make sure that you all have the fullest, best understanding of the material. Just remember: you have to give a good as you get when working with others or no one will want to work with you.

, Sometimes, if you take your learning into an immersive environment or do it in a way that gives you a way to really see what it is you're learning, this can help you learn the information a lot better. Find a way to make your subject real and give yourself context for what's happening and you'll find you connect with the material in a way that you haven't before.


So, for example, going to a history museum and seeing actual items people used as you learn about the history. Another example would be doing science experiments instead of just reading about reactions in books.
If you want to try some science experiments, wikiHow can help. Try making colored fire or making your own personal cloud!

, There are lots of online tools that can help explain the material you're trying to learn. You can just go looking for communities that are interested in the material you don't understand or you can go to websites that are specifically designed to help. Just remember: you're not just looking for the answer so you can copy it down. If you really want to improve your grades, what you really want is to find someone that can help you understand the material. Some good places to start include:

The more organized you are, the easier it will be to study, to get good grades, to improve your GPA, to focus, and to be on top of your game.


Buy a planner. Write down your homework every night, project deadlines, and anything else that's on your to-do list. Cross it off as you go, keeping an eye on what you need for tomorrow. This way your mind is allowed to not worry about what's happening next Tuesday, because you already have it written down.
Invest in some folders and binders. Keep your syllabi at the ready for each subject for easy access later. You can also keep old homework and readings available, too, for when you need them for study reference come test time.
Keep a pocket or bag for your studying tools, like highlighters, white out, pens, pencils, rulers, and scissors. The less time you spend searching around needlessly, the better.;
, Let's face it: you are not superman (or superwoman). You cannot take every AP class ever offered, 4 language classes at a time, some college classes, and get all straight As. While you may feel the need to be uber-competitive, don't burn yourself out. Only take the classes you can handle. If that means 3 AP classes instead of 4, good. Your GPA will thank you for it.


If every class of yours is difficult, you'll get exhausted. Don't begrudge yourself the ability to take a study hall or even gym. Everyone needs a bit of down time, and it'll let you concentrate on the classes you really need to concentrate on.

, Plenty of schools have ""retake"" options. If you get a grade you're not happy with and you have the room in your schedule (be sure to think long-term, here) to retake it, consider this as a second chance. That C, D, or F could get wiped from your record permanently.And it'll definitely be easier the second time around.


Find out what any of your options are, not just retaking the class. Can you retake a specific test? Complete another project? Take another class that's related in lieu of a different course? Most schools want to see their students succeed – and there's certainly no harm in asking.

, You'd think it'd be simple, but so many students don't do it: just go to class. Even if you're just there in body and not mind, go to class. Many teachers offer points just for attending. Some even give out the answers to bonus questions to reward the students that show up.


And when you get there, sit in front. You'll be more likely to pay attention and your teacher will be more like to know your face. While that may seem awkward, it's going to be very helpful if and when you need help later (or when they're thinking about nudging you up to an A- from that B+.

, Imagine if you were a teacher and you had a class full of silent duds. No one talked, no one looked interested, and no one really seemed to care. How would that feel? Pretty terrible. Now think if you had a kid who paid attention to you, listened to what you said, and participated – even if they were wrong. How much better would that be? Teachers don't care if you're right – they care if you care.


Show them you care by participating. Why? Well, for starters, they'll like you more. You'll be a student who tries and deserves the benefit of the doubt. And apart from that, participating means the information is actually processing in your mind and it'll be harder to forget later on.

, In the same way that no two people have the same results on the same diet plan, no two people have the same results on the same study plan. You need to find a way that works for you. Does that mean recording lectures and listening to them over and over? Does that mean turning your notes into pictures and charts? Does that mean typing out your notes into a book you can review later on? Does it mean quizzing with friends? Everyone is different – what helps you remember?


How do you learn? Odds are you probably know how you remember things. Is it by hearing? Seeing? Using your hands? Whatever helps you, do it. Find a friend and relay facts to them. Create your own mnemonic devices and draw pictures to help your brain remember. Anything to engage you will do the job.

, From now on, your Sunday nights are time for Sunday weekly review (SWR). This is when you sit down at your super clean, well-organized desk, bust out your folders and binders, and review everything you covered in your classes from Monday through Friday. Whatever you don't remember deserves extra time and whatever you do remember you can gloss over. This way you and your GPA are up to snuff at all times.


And at the end of your SWR, take a quick look at your syllabus. What will you be covering next week? Do you have any tests or project deadlines? If there's anything you should write in your planner, write it now.

, Research shows that the mind easily gets saturated and stops processing information at 100% if you don't give it a rest.Ideally, you should study for about 50 minutes and then take a 10 minute break. This allows your brain to recharge, and also giving the information a second to sink in.


Turn your phone off while you're studying. Just do it. Then, when you're on your break, turn it back on and do everything you've been dying to do for the past 50 minutes. Your break time should be the only time you're ""multitasking"" and getting distracted from the topic matter at hand.
Break down larger projects into hour or so chunks. This way you have clear stopping points where you can stop, take a breather, grab a bite to eat, and get back to it ready to go.

, Research shows that studying in groups is a highly effective way to study – so long as the group is around four people and they're actually focused. Why? It's because talking about the subject cements it in your mind, forcing you to listen, think about, and speak about it all at once. All these skills being used together makes the concept process in your brain at a deeper level. Designate a leader for the group to keep everyone on track. Bring some snacks and have some questions ready. Cover all your material, and then be sure to circle back to what stumped the group. Make sure to utilize individual's strengths as much as possible, too.
And don't mess around. Study groups are not beneficial if you're just sitting and gabbing, gossiping about your friends and munching on snacks. That's why a leader is so beneficial – sometimes you'll need someone to wrangle you back to the correct path.

, The fact of the matter is that cramming does you no good. Studies show that students who study the night before and don't sleep actually do worse on tests than those who study less and actually get some shut eye.This is because the brain needs sleep to get all gears functioning properly – if you don't get any sleep, that study session won't do you much good.


If a test is coming up and you're not ready for it, all you can do is study for a bit the night before, get a decent night's rest, get up, study a little bit more, eat a protein-packed breakfast, and do your best. During the test, pop a piece of peppermint or gum into your mouth for an awakening blast – studies show that it could improve academic performance., Sitting in the middle of your dorm while your roommate is watching TV and eating nachos isn't going to do your GPA any favors. You need a spot that makes you feel calm and is enjoyable enough that you can spend hours there without consistently looking at the clock.


Find a couple of study spots you love. Research shows that studying in multiple locations actually solidifies the information in your brain. It's thought that in a new environment, the brain has to take in more stimuli – and the information comes along with it., Almost every teacher is willing to give extra credit, even if it's not something they talk about openly to the entire class. If you'd like to raise your grade, talk to them in private. Ask if you can do some extra work for a few extra points. They'll likely be impressed that you want to work so hard – most students are dying to work less.


And if you're a good student already, this can get your grade up to above 100%. What's that mean? Wiggle room for a different, harder class. Now that's a win-win.

, Sometimes in order to get a rockin' GPA you've got to make some sacrifices. If you're taking a hard class load, play soccer, do gymnastics, are in the school play, participate in jazz band, and head the debate team, something's gotta go – you're spreading yourself too thin. Take a step back and think about what matters the least to you. What could you live without the easiest? Then you can re-allot that time to studying.


In other words, make time. Is one of your activities a daily afternoon nap? That could be cut, too. It doesn't necessarily have to be connected to your school. What it boils down to is that you need time for studying and studying well. If time isn't in your schedule to do that already, you'll need to make it.

, Turns out teachers are human beings, who knew? If you're a good student who wants to do better, they're going to want to help you out (when their students do better, it makes them look good, too). Don't be shy – talk to them. Ask them for pointers. Ask them what you can do to get your grades up. They may have the answer.


Some schools have something that's called ""Course forgiveness."" They'll let you retake a class or drop the lowest grade from a class. Talk to your professors if something like this might be available for you.
Sometimes students are on the cusp of a better grade. If a teachers knows and likes you, you may get the benefit of the doubt – a 79% could be upped to a C- instead of a D+. If nothing else, talk to your teachers to get into their good graces.

, Developing a relationship with your teacher, as you can probably tell by now, is important to get your GPA as high as it can be. Most teachers have office hours, so use them. Not just to ask for extra credit and to brown nose them, but just to talk about the coursework. Ask them questions about what you're finding difficult, talk to them about concepts that you want to know more about. Friends are great, but your teacher is your ultimate resource.


Teachers have connections, too. If you show you're made of the right stuff, they may be able to get you into a different class, connect you to an advisor at a college, or pull some other string for you you didn't even know could be pulled. There are plenty of reasons getting to know your teacher works in your favor.

, Even with being organized and studying, sometimes school is hard. We can't all be Einsteins at everything, so you may have to buckle down and admit ""I need a tutor."" If you don't know where to start, ask your teacher or a student counselor. Most schools have tutor programs to help their students who need it and to give students credit who are offering the help. It's a win-win for both sides.


There's no shame in it. Even some ridiculously smart students get tutors so they can be even ridiculously smarter. Competition is getting more and more fierce, and any leg up you can get is the right way to go.
Some schools offer free tutors. However, if you can't find one that fits your budget, even working with a friend, or older sibling or neighbor will be helpful. Two minds are always better than one.

Get rid of old papers or assignments unless you think you'll refer back to them. Have your syllabus tucked away nicely but still easily referable, and keep a pen in there for good measure!


That goes for your desk and locker, too, no clutter -- really any area you use for studying and being academic. If it's intimidating to even dig through, you definitely won't be sitting down to study. You'll be spending all your time looking for some things!;
, The more accurate statement would be ""make smart, focused friends 'and make them to your advantage'."" Plenty of your friends are smart, but when's the last time you sat down with them and combined mental powers?


Spend your free time with them -- just watching each other study. Pick up on their better habits. If you have a class together, make time once a week or so to talk about the content -- not about your teacher's phlegm problem or that cute guy who sits in front of you.
Sit with them in class, if you weren't already! When your friends' hands shoot up to answer questions, you'll be less inclined to snooze away.

, Along with that 4.0 group you travel with, find someone who's taken the class already. Lots of teachers recycle tests -- if the person has kept their old ones, double score. It's not cheating at all -- it's being logical.


They can also tell you what the teacher is like and what you could expect. If you go in knowing their tendencies (and maybe even how to butter them up cough-cough) and how they operate, you'll have that much of a leg up even before the first class.

, This idea has probably been drilled into you since kindergarten. In order to squeeze the most out of your day -- to study, play basketball, practice the violin, eat right, stay hydrated and sleep (yes, those last three are important) -- you've gotta rock the time management skills. But...how?


The most basic thing you can do is to create and follow a schedule. Make sure to give weight to the stuff that requires a longer amount of time or is more thought-intensive. Having your priorities in order will make that schedule simple to figure out.
Be realistic. Saying you're going to study 8 hours a day isn't feasible. You'll burn out and then the next day will be spent in bed with a tub of Jell-O. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but what does kill you... kills you.
Don't procrastinate! If you have a paper that's due in two weeks, start now. If you have a test coming up, study now. Some people work well under pressure, sure -- if that's you, at least do a little now. There's no time in your schedule for freak-out sessions, unfortunately.

, If you're in your dorm room or bedroom, your TV risks growing a voice that keeps screaming, ""WATCH ME."" Instead, get out. Go somewhere else. Go to the library. Find a quiet place away from distractions. Ever read Moby Dick the entire way through, and then realize you didn't absorb a single thing; so, you have to go back and read it again? It was a waste. So take your study to the library.


At the very least, make a special spot in your house that's devoted to serious studying. You don't want to go to bed every night feeling like you should have been studying! Get a table, a desk, or some common couch that you use only for studying. It'll help zone your brain once it makes the connection. Be habitual.

, You know that feeling after you've slammed down a gorging breakfast and finished it off with a killer chocolate shake and a piece of pie: Yeah, a heavy stomach and a ""dead"" head. If you want to stay focused, energized, and feeling vigorous (and your brain working right), eat for only ""one person"", and healthy food. Limit the sugary, and greasy foods. You'll be much more likely to retain information, if your brain, body and stomach don't feel like mush.


For breakfast before an exam, keep it light. And don't drink so much coffee you get the jitters! Have some toast and an apple or whatever you might reasonably need. But do eat breakfast. It's just harder to concentrate when you're shaky from hunger!

, Avoid horrors of cramming all night; it's bad for you: get enough sleep, for feeling right and for your grades! When your mental energy is running on fumes, it's hard to concentrate; you can't focus, and all that information your teachers are trying to cram into your brain is going to go in one ear and out the other. So cultivate your brain!


Aim for 8 hours every night -- not much more or less. Stick to the same schedule so it's easy to get up Monday through Friday. Though you can sleep in on weekends, it'll be easier to hear that 7 AM alarm clock -- or earlier, if you stay rested up!

, Live joyfully, smiling, being optimistic. You've probably heard about the pressures many students all over Asia feel and about the massive student suicide rate among them.""Stay sane!"" means just that. Studying until you're crazily praying for death is not a joke. It's a very crushing thing. So schedule time to go to a nice party. Catch a movie. Take an occasional nap, for your sake.


The world will not come crashing down around you if you get an A-. Sure, it'll stink, but lots of things are rough. You'll still get into a good school. You'll still get a job. You'll still be worthy of love. You're not struggling with cancer or poverty or being hunted down by the mafia. It is Okay!

, Alright, you're on this page because you want to maintain a 4.0, right? That probably means you're smart and driven with a good head on your shoulders -- the only thing you gotta do is stay there! Keep wanting it. This 4.0 will get you a lot places, because you never slack off. You gotta make it fresh every day.

, Really. Though sleeping on top of your textbook every night won't result in some type of mental osmosis, you'll be surprised how much you do gain from going even if you don't pay attention 100% of the time. Some teachers reward those who go by giving attendance points or even giving out extra-credit answers or ""secret"" info to those present. Score.


And while you're there, take good notes. But you knew that right?
Going to class, while also helping with knowing the content and what will be on the tests, will alert you to deadlines and test dates. Sometimes professors switch things up on a whim. If you go, you'll know what to expect and when you have to show up.

, Turns out your teachers are just as bored with you as you are with them. If you can be one of the students that actually engages and that they like, it can work wonders for your grades, sure, but also your class experience. So participate! Ask questions, make comments, and just be attentive. Teachers are sick and tired of snoozers.


You don't have to break new philosophical ground with every comment you make. Even answering questions your teacher poses can get you in good. Some teachers have participation points or will round up your grade if they know you do. So do it!

, If your teacher has office hours, go to them. If not, seek them out after class. Think about it this way: You have to give $50 to an acquaintance or to a friend. Who would you give it to? So when you get 95.5% on that test, it's that extra effort to get to know them that can bump you up to that A.


You don't have to ask about their kids or invite them out to lunch. No, no, no. Simply go up to them after class, ask them about a point they covered and go from there. You could also ask them for scholarly advice (potential jobs or schools, maybe?) and talk about yourself, too. You both need to get to know each other!

, Teachers are people; they are not machines. If you need something, they may be able to accommodate you. Especially if you're a good student that they've gotten to know! If you got a less-than-stellar grade on a piece of homework or exam, ask to do extra credit. Even if they say no, no harm done.


Even if you didn't get a less-than-stellar grade, ask about extra credit. When you're rocking a 105% class average, you can slack a little (but not too much) on the next test!

, Don't take seven, but do take one. Everyone needs to take pinball or choir or cake baking. Use it to recenter and focus yourself. And to be well-rounded! You can't all be about academics. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, remember?


You still gotta ace it, you know. So go to it, try your hardest, but go home not having any homework, you know?

, The world you live in is amazing. There are textbooks online. Tons of schools post their lectures in either video or audio format online. There are websites dedicated to helping you learn. USE THEM.


Ask your teacher for his/her powerpoints. Get on Memrise and make yourself some interactive flashcards. Go to Khan Academy to brush up on the Korean war. This ain't the 50s and you don't have to rummage through your library's card catalogue anymore to find extra resources. They're right at your fingertips.

, Whoever you are, there is someone smarter than you. Okay, so they may not be smarter than you at English or at math, but they could be an absolute whiz when it comes to the fall of the Roman Empire. So get a tutor! There's no shame in it. There's certainly no shame in ensuring your future.


If you're in college, there are some students that have tutoring as part of their graduation requirements. They get credit, you get tutored. And it's free! If you can find a pedagogy class, go for it. No stress on you or your wallet. Double win.

, Studies show that if you take breaks while studying, your attention lasts a lot, lot longer.So study for half an hour, take a ten minute break, and get back to crackin'. You're not losing time -- you're letting your brain re-energize.


Also try studying at different times of day. You may find that you like studying more in the morning or at night. Everyone's different!

, Another brain hack is to study in different places.Turns out your brain starts getting used to an environment and stops processing information (or something like that) and when you go to a new place it gets all excited and starts taking in things and remembering them better (until it gets used to it again). So if you can, find two or three places to do your dirty work.

, Studies also show that studying in groups can help you retain and understand information.When you get to explain something to someone else or hear other people explain it in different ways, it's a lot easier to process and remember. Here's a few other reasons studying in a group is awesome:


You can break up a boatload of content into manageable pieces. Assign each member a chapter to become an expert on.
Problem-solving and consensus reaching. Especially great for the sciences and math.
Predicting test questions and testing each other.
Making studying more interactive and fun (and thus memorable).

, Turns out students who cram frantically, generally get pretty average grades.So don't do it! The last thing you want is to be sleep-deprived all the time; your brain can not function well when it's exhausted, so don't bother.


Seriously. Totally study the night before, yeah, but do not lose sleep or your mind over it. You're better off getting a full seven or eight hours. You've been studying the whole time, and should know the topics, right?

, For some, taking notes isn't going to do a thing. If they recorded the lectures on the other hand, that might work. If you know whether you're a visual/aural/kinesthetic learner, you can tailor your time to studying the most effective way. And it might be an excuse to get mom to buy you that new pack of highlighters.

, Seriously. There are a billions of tricks on wikiHow can teach you on this topic. Like did you know dark chocolate is a super brain food?!That people who write in cursive generally have better grades?Tons of neat stuff! Here's a list to get you started:

Make sure if there is anything your teacher wants you to do that you do it.,
If you have a math test next week, make sure to study.,
Make sure to do all your homework.,
Focus in class because the teacher also looks for class work done and participation, and show that you are prepared.",How to Improve Your Math Grade," When learning a certain concept, try to compile a list of steps to review later. Write down key points and important things to avoid. When your teacher writes examples on the board, copy them down as well as how to solve them for future reference.

, While you cannot learn math by watching it being done, you usually need to see it done at least once. Then you need to do it. The key to understanding mathematics is to be an active participant. By being active you engage both sides of the brain. Listen to the problems your teacher gives you and complete them. Raise your hand to explain what you did, or listen carefully to what the other students did and their answers to make sure you got the same.

, Finish all of your homework and do extra questions to help lock in the material. Make it a habit to do your homework well, as if you were taking a test. It's like rehearsal for a test. Refer to your notes and your textbook while doing your homework. Ask your teacher, a friend, tutor, or smart student for assistance if you're having trouble.

, Otherwise you will move on to the next subject without knowing the first one. This is a potential grade downer as for not knowing your material. Always check in with your teacher if you have been checking your answers and suddenly realize you have gotten 5/7 wrong. Do not go to a friend! A teacher is always your best bet for help., After you have done math for a while, you will begin to see patterns and connections that you cannot experience as an observer. By getting involved in the problem, you get to see and feel how problems are solved. The answer to all problems, be it math or otherwise lies within the problem itself. Finally, after you have learned a skill, it is extremely effective to pass it on. When you teach, you verbalize the connections you made while practicing. By teaching you have to understand the problem so that you can correctly explain it and work through it in order to arrive at the correct answer.

, When you have extra time, search for math problems online or run through extra problems in the textbook. Look over notes and textbook pages whenever possible. Make sure you thoroughly understand how to solve a problem and check your answer. If you don't, ask your teacher.


Don't cram for tests. Start studying about a week before, and about 30 minutes to an hour each day. This allows you to do a review the night of the test, rather than relearn concepts you may have forgotten. It will also help you get a good night's rest and feel confident for your test, helping you avoid careless errors.







, You can learn a skill in math by watching a good teacher do and explain one thousand problems or you could learn the same skill by doing one hundred practice problems, but the most effective method is to learn the same skill by teaching only ten problems. So, look for classmates who are having trouble with the lesson. Give them extra problems and show them how to complete them to lock in your own skills.

, Study groups will give you a chance to merge ideas and concepts with a group of peers. You will be able to teach and learn from each other. Math clubs will help you exercise your ability to learn.

, The night before, prepare your calculator, at least two pencils, in case the other one breaks (preferably #2), and an eraser. Look over your notes one final time and go to bed immediately after. Go to bed early and wake up earlier than usual so you can prepare and devour a delicious, healthy breakfast. Take a long drink of water and do some jumping jacks or run in place. Take some dark chocolate. Stay energized throughout the day by carrying a bottle of water with you and sipping from it repeatedly. Before the test, visualize achieving a high score on the test and smiling. Pace yourself and highlight key points in the questions. Go back to questions you don't understand after finishing all the others. Check your answers more than once.

, After all, you worked hard!

, It can help improve your grade and also it's good to help your studies.;
, Don't do it all the night before. Study every little time about 30 minutes to an hour each day. That way the night before you test, you can just do a quick review on what you studied throughout the week. Make sure you get a good night's rest so that you're not too tired when you're taking the test.

, on your way home from school, you can do some of your homework so you won't get overworked when you're at home. When you get home, relax for a maximum of 2 hours, if you get home early. If you get home late, then rest for a maximum of 1 hour, so you won't be up all night and go to sleep late.

, Don't talk to your friend and not pay attention because not only are you not participating and being focused you're losing work that is going to be on the test or homework and it will be hard to understand.

Reduce your stress levels.,
Keep a positive attitude.,
Figure out where you’re going wrong.,
Pay attention to the signals from your body.",How to Improve Your Grades Without Studying2," Learning and studying shouldn’t be stressful. Being stressed out can actually make it harder to learn and remember things. Think about the reasons why you’re stressed out and try to resolve those reasons (remove them from your life).For example, if you get stressed out about assignments because you leave them to the last minute to finish, create yourself a study schedule. Build enough time into the study schedule so that you finish your assignments well enough in advance of the due dates to eliminate any of the stress you were feeling.

, If the grades you’re receiving aren’t that great it can be easy to let negativity take over. Bad grades are disappointing, but the mere fact that you’re looking for ways to improve your grades means you’re trying to think positively.Acknowledge to yourself that your grades aren’t that good, but you’re going to do something about it. Start thinking about how you’re going to make things better, rather than concentrating on where you are right now.

, If your grades are lower than you want or are expecting, chances are you’re not doing something you should, or you’re doing something you shouldn’t. The best way you can fix whatever is wrong is to first figure out what is wrong.If you already know what you might be doing wrong — great, you’re on the right track!
If you aren’t sure what you’re doing wrong, take a ‘deep dive’ into your study history and grades. Look for a pattern or a sudden change.
Were your grades always not-so-good, or did they start to decline after a specific time period?
Is there a specific subject or task that you seem to have the most trouble with, or does it seem to be an overall problem?
Are there any reasons, other than school, that might be the cause of your problems? Is there anything else going on in your life that may be impacting your grades?

, Learning may not seem like a physical process, but it can take a physical toll on your body. If your body and your brain are telling you to take a break, then take a break. Restart whatever you were doing once you feel better.If you’re tired and find you can’t concentrate on what you’re learning, take a nap. Taking a 10-45 minute nap can actually improve your ability to learn."

Work to improve your note-taking skills.,
Use a metaphor or an analogy.,
Combine visualization with something visceral.,
Pretend you have to explain something to a kid.,
Draw a diagram or mind map.,
Create a story.,
Break your work down into smaller pieces.",How to Improve Your Grades Without Studying3," Depending on the type of course you’re taking, being able to take good notes may be vital to your success. Take a look at your current notes and see where you might be able to improve.Make sure your notes are legible. If you can’t read your own notes, you’re not going to be able to use them.
If you take your notes by hand, type them out after class both to help you remember what you learned and to help make them more legible.
Make sure your notes are organized.

Have a separate notebook or binder for each subject.
Includes titles and dates where a new class starts so you can keep them in order.
Use headings and subheadings throughout so you can skim your notes to find what you’re looking for quickly.
Use coloured pens or pencils or highlighters to make certain points stand out.



, When trying to memorize complex concepts and ideas, don’t try to memorize the concepts and ideas as they are, use metaphors and analogies to remember them.A metaphor is a word or phrase that has one meaning but it is used to describe something else in order to show how the two things are similar. In other words, a metaphor is an object, activity or idea that is used as a symbol.An analogy is the comparison of two things based on the fact that they are alike in some way.An example of a metaphor is “the test was a breeze.""
An example of an analogy is “life is like a box of chocolates.""

, Visualizing something isn’t always enough. Instead add some additional items associated with your other senses like sounds, textures, feelings and smells. When trying to remember something important, don’t just visualize it, add these visceral items as well.An example might be a pie chart you need to remember that shows some important information. Visualize the pie chart like various pieces of pie. Maybe the larger pieces of pie are your favourite types of pie (e.g. strawberry), while the smaller pieces are your least favourite types of pie (e.g. pecan).

, Simplifying an idea or concept to its lowest and most basic elements can help you remember them. When trying to remember a particular difficult concept or idea, pretend you need to explain that concept or idea to a 5 year old., This method starts off similar to a visualization, but instead of just making the one idea visual, connect that first idea to other ideas and concepts using a mind map. The multiple ideas in the mind map can be pictures or diagrams of the concepts., Strict memorization can make it difficult to remember a lot of information all at once. Instead of simply memorizing everything, turn it into a story. Create a story that goes along with the concept or idea you’re trying to remember.Instead of a story you can also try acronyms. If you need to remember a list of things, use the first letters in each of the items to create a word that’s easier to remember than the actual list.

, One of the best ways to learn a complex idea or concept is to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Don’t try to tackle an entire complex concept or idea as a whole, break the material into smaller pieces you can review and learn separately."

Understand that it is your subconscious mind that determines the results you get in life.,
Start to realise that you have been running your life on autopilot.,Make a decision to turn off your autopilot and start taking control of your results

,When you go to a class, enter the room, start a test, think about a test or exam - start to recognise your thoughts that are running through your head

,
If those thoughts are negative like ""I am going to fail"" or ""this class is going to be difficult"" then let those thoughts slide by without giving them any attention.

,
Now is the important part.,When you walk to a class think ""This class will be easy and effortless"" when an exam approaches ""I will complete all the questions and easily recall all the answers""

,
Start to focus your thoughts continuously on what you want not on what you don't want.,
Give this a chance for at a minimum of 30 days.",How to Improve Your Grades Through Creative Visualization," That is the little voice you hear in your head at times.;
, This autopilot works on your past results and experiences. If you done poorly in tests then autopilot kicks in and you get more of it, regardless of the amount of work you do

,,,, Consciously start to take control of your thoughts

,, This may seem simplistic but what you are doing is actually reprogramming your subconscious mind so that when it next goes into autopilot it is focused on your success not failure.

, This is how long it takes for real lasting change to occur.

, It may sound pretty silly but it makes it so you have more time in the morning to get your school work together, do some quick studying, eat breakfast, or anything else that you have trouble getting done because you spent an hour and a half finding an outfit. If your school has a uniform policy, make sure that you have your uniform set out before you go to bed. It will save you the time of going through the closet to find it, which, believe it or not, normally takes 5-10 minutes!

, It will give you energy throughout the day to concentrate. Breakfast can be bacon and eggs, English muffins, or a cereal that is low in sugar (a breakfast burrito is good too)! If you eat in the morning you will concentrate more in class without having those nasty hunger pains.

, You'll find that actually listening to the teacher, no matter how boring it is sometimes, will help you understand your homework.

, If you do step number four then you should understand what you have to do and maybe you'll be able to get it done in class and have more time after school to do other things. Instead of chatting with your best friend, do your work and who knows, maybe your friends will start asking you for help when they don't know what to do.

, If you eat a bag of chips with a few cookies, you're wasting your money, not going to feel good and not going to be able to concentrate on your next few classes. It's also a good way to lose a few pounds for those on that diet to get slimmer before swimsuit season.

, Have you ever seen those kids who always seem to be writing something down in their notebooks, always raising their hands and getting every answer right? Those are their notes! They use them to look back to for studying and to answer questions with.

, Try to get home as soon as you can so you have more time later to hang out with your friends.

, If you don't, you will be distracted by them, and will be tempted to use them. Make sure the place is comfortable enough to work at but not so comfortable that you will fall asleep; make sure it isn't really cold so you get all comfy in a big sweatshirt but make sure it isn't really hot because that will make you really tired.

, Just make sure it doesn't drive you away from the work. Also, keep some ""brain food"" nearby, like fruits, vegetables, or maybe a sandwich. Just don't use anything messy!

, Look in your agenda and see what you have to do. Example: in math, you have to do page 537, numbers 2-28. So instead of putting it off, just do it! That's only 27 problems!

, Let's say for the same example above, you have three days to complete it. Rather than doing it all in one night, why not just do ten a day?

, The possibilities are endless. Just remember to put your outfit out before you go to bed at night.

, She/He may be surprised to see that you are interested in doing your work.

, Go to the library, and research your topic. Find magazine articles, newspaper clippings,or how they dressed, what they imported/exported,and what were the most important things that happened during that time period. Find key information.

, If you have 1 month to do a book report, spend the next day getting books from the library, 1 week reading it, etc. It's a lot easier when you have a plan.

, Ask them to take you to Walmart, Longs Drugs, or any other store near you that sells tri-fold boards or BIG posters. If you wait until the night before your project is due, you will be in trouble and you may not have enough time to do everything you need to.

, If you get a Tri-Fold Board, put a time-line on one of the tri-fold parts, and on the other one, put the most important thing (if it's a company) they sell and (if it's a time period) how the people dressed and what music they listened to and (if it's a person,artist, or band) their music or any random fun facts about them.

, Do the essay before you do your board. In your essay you always need a topic paragraph, 3 body paragraphs, a conclusion, a bibliography, and a reference page.

, Start out with something that will catch their attention. For example: if it's on the atomic bombs, dress up as a mad scientist or the person who made them and act out what you say, jump around. You could start out with, ""BOOM! (Jump towards the students) In (year A to year B) the Atomic Bomb was created! I, (whoever made the atom bomb), was (and so on). "" The reports can be really boring when you hear them so try to keep the students awake and not falling asleep. If you see someone starting to get bored, improvise and wake them up!

, Get some help and make your board colorful with bold fonts and rainbow colors.

Understand what a “class ranking” means.,
Talk to your academic counselor.,
Think about the type and level of colleges that you want to apply to.,
Consider other benefits that a high class ranking can bring.,
Find out how your specific high school calculates class ranking.,
Take Honors courses and AP courses.,
Take more difficult classes as you progress through high school.,
Ask your counselor about bringing up high-school-level classes from middle school.,
Apply yourself to your studying.,
Set aside time in each day to study.,
Aim to earn an “A” in every course you take.,
Recognize that there is only so much you can do to influence your class ranking.",How to Improve Your Class Ranking," The College Board explains that class ranking is a summary of a student’s academic record that is mathematically compared to those of other students in the graduating class.Your class ranking compares you with other students in your graduating class; a ranking takes into account the grade you earn in a class and—in many cases—the difficulty of courses you take (including AP classes).;
, This should be the first step of any academic endeavor; your counselor will be able to tailor academic advice to your personal situation, and will likely have helped many other students with questions similar to yours. Your counselor will be able to direct you into what courses you should take, advise you about selecting AP courses, and help you keep your GPA high.

, Different colleges have different requirements for incoming applicants; some schools may prioritize class ranking, while others may be more concerned with extracurricular activities or a strong writing sample. In general, private schools, Ivy-League universities, and nationally known public schools are more difficult to get into than smaller, less well-known colleges.Ask yourself (and get input from your parents and college-bound friends):


Do you want to attend an in-state or out-of-state school?
Do you want to attend public or private university?
Do you need a certain amount of financial aid to attend a school? (Class ranking can influence the amount of financial aid a school will give you.)

, Even outside of the college-application process, your class ranking has value: class ranking, combined with your GPA, is frequently used to determine the high school valedictorian and salutatorian.These honors are often awarded based on students’ class rank percentile. If you are not planning to attend a college or university, think twice before you let your class ranking slide, especially if speaking at graduation or having valedictorian honors is an important personal goal.

, Although the general definition of “class ranking” is provided above, different high schools can have slightly different policies.Some schools do not “weight” classes (give higher class rankings to students who take more difficult courses and AP classes), and some schools do not rank elective courses.

, These higher-level courses will often be weighted and contribute more to your class ranking than would regular high-school level courses. However, be careful not to overload yourself with difficult AP work; if you receive poor grades in these high-level courses, their weighted status may work against you and lower your overall class ranking.If you enjoy honors-level work and feel that you can excel in it, then take as many honors and AP courses as you can.

, Students are often tempted to front-load their high school career with difficult courses, and to leave easier courses until their Junior and Senior years. However, university Admissions departments are often unimpressed by this; it can look like a student stopped caring about their academic success near the end of high school.At the same time, be aware that course grades from every year will count equally. Many students do not start taking their class ranking seriously until they begin considering college. To determine which level of classes you should take each year, consider:


Take more difficult courses (including Honors and AP) in your Junior and Senior year. This will likely raise your class ranking overall, and will show colleges that you take your academic career seriously.
Try to do as well as you can academically, beginning in the first semester of your freshman year—these grades will stay on your permanent transcript and influence your final class ranking.

, If you took any high-school-level courses in middle school, you may be able to add those course grades to your transcript and raise your GPA.You should only do this if you earned “A”s in these courses you took in middle school; otherwise they may lower your GPA and harm your overall class ranking.

, This is the single most useful piece of advice for succeeding in high school courses in general, and this success will be reflected in your class ranking. Even if you have planned out your courses well and have a good college-application plan, your work will be relatively useless if you don’t study well. When you read and write for courses:


Find a pattern that suits you personally; some students use flash cards, others need to write down material so they’ll remember it better.
Read for comprehension; don’t just try to memorize facts.
Don’t compare the level of your work to that of your peers. Instead, focus on finding what your strengths are and develop those.

, High school can be demanding; there are plenty of personal obligations and relationships, and many students have part-time jobs in addition to the difficulties of school coursework and homework itself. To improve your performance in your courses, don’t mix your studying time with social time. Set aside however much time you need each day (start with 3 or 4 hours) and spend that block of time focused only on your schoolwork—no video games, TV, etc.

, Earning an “A” can be difficult, especially if the course is challenging, the teacher is tough, or the subject matter is unfamiliar to you. Nevertheless, it will dramatically improve your GPA and your class ranking if you try to earn an “A” in every course.As a general rule, you should take the most difficult courses (e.g. AP or Honors) in which you can confidently earn an “A.” Plan ahead for success by working hard throughout the semester, and also talk to your teacher to see what advice they can give you to help you succeed in their class. Also consider:


Don’t stress over the specific percentage you earn in a class, as long as it is an “A” on the 4.0 scale (watch out for an “A-”; it will lower your GPA). For example, whether you earn a 93% or a 98% in a course, it will carry the same amount of weight on your transcript.
Study with a tutor—whether a peer tutor or a professional tutor who teaches you at home. This will help you learn material better and will help you learn from a more experienced person.
If your grade is suffering, ask your teacher if there are opportunities for extra credit.
Work after school with your teacher if you are struggling.Often teachers will respect your initiative and will help you work on assignments and improve your grade.
If you’ve already done poorly in a course, talk with your counselor and your teacher to see if you can retake the course in a coming semester, or retake it in summer school.

, While your own planning, foresight, and hard work will play a large role in determining your class ranking, the ranking number is not completely under your control. Since you are being compared with, and ranked against, every other individual in your graduating class, their performances will also influence your class ranking. Since you cannot control the academic activity and success of your peers, this part of your class-rank determination is out of your control.

Consider your feelings about skipping a grade.,
Think about how you handle challenges.,
Make sure your parents are supportive.,
Ask for your teachers’ or guidance counselors’ advice.,
Be tested for skill gaps.,
Explore all your options.,
Request a trial period.,
Expect an adjustment period.",How to Handle Skipping a Grade1," If you are the student who will be skipping a grade, you need to carefully examine the advantages and disadvantages of moving up a grade since you will be the one most affected. If it’s not something that you are comfortable with or happy about, this will make the process more difficult.Try to think about how this decision might impact you in the future. For example, if you are interested in participating in sports, being younger than other students might make it harder to compete on the same level. If you skip a grade, will you be driving later than other students? How would that make you feel?
Don’t let others make the decision for you. Instead, take an active role in your education and share your concerns and feelings about skipping a grade with your parents or school officials.;
, Skipping a grade can cause intellectual, emotional, and physical challenges that you will need to be able to deal with. If you are worried about receiving perfect grades and get frustrated quickly, skipping a grade might not be the best choice for you., To be successful in your new grade, you’ll need the support of your parents. They know you better than anyone else and want you to be ready to advance a grade. They can also help you think about some of the social and academic challenges that might occur when skipping a grade.

, Your teachers and guidance counselors have a great deal of experience working with and evaluating students, and they can help you determine whether you are ready to skip a grade. Ask for their advice on how to handle the change.They will probably appreciate that you respect their opinion, and might offer valuable advice on how best to handle skipping a grade.
It’s also possible that your teachers or guidance counselors will know your new teacher, and they can introduce you or help you adjust to your new situation.

, Although some tests might indicate you are more than prepared to skip a grade, it’s a good idea to find out what you will be learning and work with your guidance counselors or a private tutor to make sure you are prepared to tackle the advanced classes. If there’s anything you need help with, ask your parents and school what you can do to catch up and be as ready as possible.For example, should you have a specific skill such as typing before skipping a grade? If so, arrange to take a typing class or work with a private tutor who can make sure you are prepared when you skip a grade.
This will help you feel more confident about skipping a grade and entering a class with students who are older.

, Learning about all the options available will help you make the best decision for your situation. Skipping a grade is not necessarily the only choice available to advanced students. Consider or ask about these potential options or programs:Is it possible for you to take some advanced classes with older students or receive individual tutoring while still remaining in your current grade?
Can you participate in a summer program or distance-learning program offered by a university in your area? Duke, Johns Hopkins, Carnegie Mellon, Northwestern, and other universities offer specific programs designed to help identify and support gifted students.
Would an independent study project or competition such as the science fair or math team help meet your intellectual needs without requiring you to skip a grade?

, Skipping a grade can be hard, and it isn’t for everyone. So that you can test out what it is like to skip a grade without feeling as much pressure, ask your school or guidance counselors to give you a trial period.Knowing that you can easily switch back might help you feel more comfortable in the beginning.
If you decide this isn’t working out the way you hoped or you are unhappy, don’t feel ashamed or that you have failed. Admitting that you might be out of your depth and overwhelmed demonstrates maturity.

, Adjusting to skipping a grade won’t happen overnight, so don’t be hard on yourself and expect it to occur right away. Give yourself, your parents, and your new teachers and classmates time to adjust to the situation."

Read every day for 20 minutes.,
Ask questions.,
Use dictation to assist with both comprehension and spelling practice.,
Write stories.,
Find the errors.","How to Help Your Children to Improve Their Reading, Spelling and Comprehension Skills"," It is important that children read every day for 20 minutes. Sit with them and listen to them. By doing this you be able to understand their reading abilities, what words and sounds they struggle with.
, After the children have read a few pages, stop them and ask them about what they have just read. This allows them to think about the information they have read and begin to process it and not forget it. This is key to building comprehension skills. Ask them questions and try to coax out as much detail as you can out of them. When they come to do comprehension exercises in school later on, they will answer the questions with detail because they're already used to doing so in the home environment., Read out a few of the passages from the book they are reading and ask them to write down what you read. Read each word slowly, give them enough time to think about the word, then ask them to write it down. Having read the words already, they may remember them; however, some words are spelt differently from how they sound.

Check their spellings after and identify the words and sounds they are struggling with and practice those more.

, Children have a wild imagination. Set them a few story titles, for example: “Lost in the Woods,” “From Another Planet,” “The Coolest Adventure”. Also set a few personal and descriptive titles, such as: “Describe your house, or a friend or a relative” “My Favourite Country” “My School Trip”. Varying the titles will work their imaginations as well as helping to improve their descriptive writing skills., Ask your children to spend some time rewriting any sentences where you discovered errors, to correct them, but without you identifying which parts are errors. This allows the children to spot the mistakes for themselves. For this exercise, use sentences with missed punctuation, bad spelling, etc. They can read their own writing and correct the mistakes, a skill that is essential for the rest of their lives. Check the work; after this exercise, the parts where they have not noticed the errors is where more attention needs to be given."
"
Aim for a 100%.,
Use the Rubric.,
Don't let the Seed of Doubt Escape.,
Complete the End of the Semester gracefully.",How to Go from a 90% to a 95% in School," Start doing this passionately but realistically. Don't let little mistakes slide, and make sure your assignments are done to the best of your ability. Don't spend hours and hours being a perfectionist either; just put in a little more effort than you normally would.;
, The importance of this can't be stressed enough. Make sure everything on the rubric is fully and correctly applied in your project or report. If ""Creativity"" is out of five marks, strive to make sure the creativity in the project is to your full ability.

, Sometimes, when you complete a project, you look at a certain part and have a tiny fractional doubt that you may have done it incorrectly. For example, in a Lab Report, you may have filled out a section in a graph incorrectly - but you're pretty sure you are right, so you let it go, thinking: ""I'll only lose a few marks anyway, right?"" Instead, grab the doubt, and make sure you fix it. Ask a teacher for revision to make sure you did it right. Check it over with a friend. Those little marks add up in the end.

, You may find yourself losing marks as you're in a rush to hand everything in, and the time is so busy and stressful. However, those marks count. Plan your work out evenly to ensure you will have enough time to produce quality work. Exams are another biggie - study, study, study! They are worth so much. The work you do at the end of the semester is often the work that is worth the most marks, so you don't want to let it slide.

Have a strategy.,
Understand your school's grading policies.,
Make the first week of school count.,
Ask questions and volunteer to answer your teacher's questions.,
Don't be afraid to collaborate or ask for help.,

Take practical measures to avoid missing school.",How to Get Straight A's Without Much Work," Get ahead now, so you won't have to dig yourself out of a hole later. Aim to get a solid foundation in all of your classes during the first week, and don't spend too much time in one class, keeping your grades around the B+ or A- range. Then begin working hard on the classes with the lowest grades, bringing all of them to a comfortable position at around 95%.Take part in all extra credit activities whenever possible and increase your scores to the A+ range so during the last few weeks you can focus mainly on projects and maybe even skip a few homework assignments, if your scores are really high.;
, Find out how your school calculates GPAs, if there are weighted grades for honors classes, which grades actually show up on your transcript, the cutoff percentages for each letter grade, and anything else that might affect your final grades. Grades are a game that all students play, and the more you familiarize yourself with the rules, the better you'll do.

, First impressions are everything with teachers, so make sure they have a positive reason for knowing who you are.If your teacher starts off the year thinking that you are polite, respectful, and hard-working, they will be nicer to you and will grade your works more easily. It is much easier to have a good first impression than to fix a bad one.

, You may have to learn the art of faking intelligence and preparedness. It's always easier to appear smart and prepared than to actually be smart and prepared. Try to recall something that you think has some relevance to the topic at hand. Usually the teacher will say something about how good your point was and then give you clues to the answer she was looking for.


This method has two benefits. First, the teacher thinks you are paying attention in class, and second, they will think you are capable of independent thought and will be more likely to grade your papers easier.
Teachers love students who participate, and will sometimes boost their grades by whole letters.Grades aren't rigid; teachers can manipulate an F to an A or the other way around, and although their changes are rarely that drastic, everything helps.

, Ask teachers, parents, and classmates to explain things that you have missed. It is easier to ask then to take more time to discover the answer for yourself.


Come in before school for help. If your teacher offers to give help outside of school, accept. Even if you are struggling with the material in the class, if you show your teacher you are dedicated, s/he will be more likely to give you a good grade.

, Teachers are people too. They are just as busy outside of school as you are, if not more so. Also remember that for every homework page you do, the teacher has to grade it, and since she might have over 100 students, that's a lot of papers. There's no way to grade all of them in depth. If you follow the above two steps, your teacher will probably think pretty highly of you and won't be checking your work too closely. You can be pretty sure an assignment is busy work if:


The assignment is a worksheet.
You see the teacher grading the exact same papers and spending less than a minute on each before entering a grade.

, Don't miss deadlines as late assignments often come with point deductions. Don't lose points because you could not keep up with assignments.


Tackle busy work efficiently. Busy work should take as much time to do as your teacher will spend grading it! If there is an article with questions, oftentimes the answers can be found in order in the article. Read each question then skim the article for the answer. In opinion questions, you don't need to put thought into your answer. Just make something up that sounds good. Many students already have a knack for how to handle busywork, but for others it takes practice. It's a huge time saver once you get the hang of it.

, Try for a style that is legible, but quick. Your teacher isn't grading you on your penmanship and neat handwriting takes valuable time, especially when doing busy work.

, It may seem counter-intuitive if you are trying to get high grades with minimal effort, but learning how to do well in difficult classes will teach you how to excel in easy classes.A difficult schedule will look great on college applications, and after a while you will enjoy the challenge. Remember that these strategies work in almost every class, including the challenging ones.

, Even though it's tempting to text or sleep during class, especially when there's a lecture, don't do it. There are two benefits to this: first, you'll eliminate time spent at home learning the information from scratch and you'll do better on tests because you'll know exactly what the teacher wants you to know. Paying attention is key., If you can, think of something funny to remember them (called a mnemonic).

, That doesn't mean you need to spend hours every night; try utilizing the time at the end of classes.


Tackle one assignment at a time. Your first section should be worksheets as they take the least amount of time. Then you should do any homework that is broken down into independent parts, such as math. That way you can work for a few minutes at the end of various classes without wasting time finding your place.
Eliminate distractions. When you really don't feel like doing homework, but need to, get rid of things that normally divide your attention. Turn off the TV. Put your phone in another room. Log off your social media. Lock yourself in a room., Do the work that you know will be read in depth first, and do a good job so you can build trust with that teacher. Then do all of the work that might not be checked so closely and don't worry so much about the quality; just make sure your writing is on topic and looks lengthy and detailed. If you begin to run out of time with just a few unimportant assignments to do, work quickly through them all making sure to complete them all. Teachers value effort greatly and will appreciate it if you do your homework and the easiest way to an A is to make your teacher happy.

, Compartmentalize the tasks needed to complete the assignment. Read the assignment. Conduct the necessary research. Outline your paper. Write your paper. Edit your paper.Don't spend too much time thinking about what you are going to write and just start writing. Do any pre-writing work you have to turn in after you write the paper to save time. If you make your paper long enough, chances are that the teacher will only read halfway through, so you have two options. You could either make it really short and good, or really long with several mistakes. After the first few times you try, you'll realize how easy and quick it is to write perfect papers with half of the rewriting you used to do.
Use a thesaurus to avoid redundancy and vary your sentence structure.

, As stressed as you may be about the test, think about the differences between studying and doing homework.


Use your homework to study for the test. Most of the time, key points needed for the test are discussed in the homework.
When your teacher assigns homework, s/he also assigns a certain point value to the assignment. If you do the work, you get the points, if you don't, those points are lost. Your teacher doesn't give you points for studying, just for the test. If the test is hard, no matter how much studying you do, you might still get a bad grade. Then you'll want the cushion homework points will give you.

, Don't cram! Your brain will retain the information a lot better if you gradually memorize information. Cramming helps in the short term, but if you hope to retain the information for the entire semester, it is best to study over a longer period of time., The risks far outweigh the rewards., Nap, exercise, listen to music... etc. Calm yourself. The last thing you want to do is freak out right before an exam. You won't be able to concentrate. Even if you haven't studied at all, if you paid attention in class, chances are you will do fine. If you stress too much, you will blank out and end up with a worse grade., Studies have shown that peppermint improves memory and recall., Give yourself permission to do something fun when you have completed an assignment, done well on a test, or written an excellent paper. If you have motivation to work, you will be able to concentrate more., If you are not hungry at the start of the day, you will be able to concentrate better in classes and on your work., Sleep deprivation can seriously affect your ability to succeed.

, These might include:


Getting annual check ups with your doctor.
Getting a flu shot.Having alternate ways of getting to school in case you miss your bus or normal ride.

Know that you don’t need to have all the answers.,
Don’t claim that you are smarter than other people.,
Demonstrate maturity.,
Stay in touch with your former classmates.,
Ask for help if you need it.,
Find fun things to do outside of school.",How to Handle Skipping a Grade2," Before skipping a grade, you might have felt like the work in your classes was too easy and you knew every answer. Now, you're probably in more advanced classes, and you should not expect to find everything as simple as you did previously.Don’t be uncomfortable with the fact that you don’t know it all. Part of the reason you skipped a grade was to be intellectually challenged, and if you already knew everything the classes would be pretty boring.
There’s also no shame in being wrong if you struggle with an assignment or answer a question incorrectly. Instead of feeling bad about being wrong or doing poorly on a test, try to understand how you can improve.

, Although the fact that you are skipping a grade definitely indicates you are smart, it does not necessarily mean you are smarter than the students in your new class. This sort of behavior won’t earn you any friends.Someone who is smart does not have to tell people how gifted they are. Instead of bragging about your abilities, let your work and efforts speak for themselves.
Think about how you would feel if someone told you that they were smarter or intellectually superior.

, Acting emotionally immature or juvenile will not help you fit in better with the students around you, and could make it difficult to adjust to your new situation. Treat others with respect so that they will also treat you with respect., Although you might be skipping a grade, it’s important to maintain connections with your old friends. It might take some time to make friends in your new grade level, and having a support network of friends will make things easier.


If you no longer see your friends during school, set up after-school or weekend activities.
Your old classmates will probably be excited to have a friend in a higher grade level.

, While you might not have needed to ask teachers, guidance counselors, classmates, or your parents for help before you skipped a grade, asking for help when you need it will help you stay on track.It might be hard to admit that you need help, but it’s better than feeling stressed out, behind, or like you don’t understand something.

, Participating in activities outside of school will help you feel more comfortable and self confident. You’ll also meet and connect with people who share similar interests.If you took dance classes or music lessons before skipping a grade and enjoy these activities, keep participating in them even when you switch classes. If you find that you don’t have time for these activities anymore, talk with your parents about how you might be able to adjust your schedule or find new things to do.
If you are worried about being bullied because of your size when you switch a grade, consider taking a self-defense class or participating in a gym class or sports activity. You’ll feel more confident and powerful.

You’ll find yourself less stressed out and better able to focus when you return.Research shows that your brain keeps working on problems even when you take breaks, which should make the work easier when you come back to it.

, The best way to cope with a stressful situation is to identify the source of your stress and take steps to deal with it.This might involve completing a project that you’ve avoided, talking with your parents about your workload, asking a teacher for help, or meeting with a guidance counselor about a problem with another student in your class.
If you’re not sure how to deal with a stressful situation, ask a friend or family member to listen and offer advice.

, You might not be able to eliminate every source of stress, but you can change the way you react to or think about stress.While an assignment or test might seem very important, keep in mind that it is only one small part of your school career and not a reflection on you as a person.
Try to identify something positive about the stressful experience. For example, learning about something new can be scary, but also interesting.

, Maintaining a good sense of humor in the face of stressful situations that might occur while skipping a grade will help you feel more in control and less stressed.For example, it can feel really stressful to get an answer wrong in class. Being willing to laugh at your own mistake will help you feel better and make it easier to meet new friends. People like someone who is willing to laugh at themselves.

, Skipping a grade might make you feel like you are under a lot of pressure, but time-management and organization skills will help you feel more in control. They will also save you a lot of time and energy.Consider purchasing a planner or calendar so you can keep track of due dates and make study plans.
Keep a to-do list of daily homework assignments.

, The schoolwork related to skipping a grade can be stressful, but participating in fun activities will give you something to look forward to and keep you going.Try planning an activity with the friends you had before you skipped a grade.
Join a club, sports team, or after-school activity so you can meet new people while you have fun.

, Physical activity, eating right, and getting enough sleep will help you deal with the stress of skipping a grade.Research shows that a healthy lifestyle reduces stress and improves your mood.
You might feel like you need to stay up all night to complete your schoolwork, but this will make it harder to finish the next day’s work and deal with the stresses of skipping a grade. If you're having trouble keeping up in class, talk with your parents and teachers.

, Things might be stressful right now, but they will get better. You will adapt to the workload, meet new friends, and get used to your new schedule.


If it has been awhile, and things don’t seem to be improving, talk with your parents or teacher about your situation.

Let her know that you're struggling and that you take her class seriously, and see if she's available to talk about your grade and possible studying strategies to turn it around.Remember that your professor may be going out of her way to meet with you outside of class. Be appreciative and show respect.
Meet when it's convenient for your professor. The only prior obligations that should be a factor in your schedule are work or attending other classes.;
, Whether your professor meets with you or not, you should show her a great deal of respect. Teachers do great work and it's often very difficult. Plus, if you badmouth your professor, she may decide not to help you after all.Never accuse your instructor of being ""unfair"" or of singling you out. Your professors want you to succeed, so don't start a fight.
Being rude or impolite to your professor will only upset her, and may make her less willing to help you turn your grade around.

, When you meet with your professor, bring any old course materials with you. Your professor will be able to help you go over the tests, quizzes, and assignments you did poorly on and find ways to improve your grade going forward.Ask your professor what you could have done differently for short answers, essays, and papers. Multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions are clearly an issue of choosing the wrong answer, but you may be able to improve the way you answer written questions.
Find out what you would have to do differently with your paper for it to have been an A+ report.

, This is one of those situations where it never hurts to ask. If your professor does allow you to make up assignments, get right on it and don't delay.Some professors may allow you to make up assignments that you missed. You probably won't be able to get full credit, but anything is better than a zero.
See if you can redo assignments you completed but got a poor score on. This is highly variable, and some professors won't even consider it, but it's worth asking about it.
If your professor is unwilling to replace the grade, then you might also ask about redoing an assignment and averaging the old grade with the new grade. For example, if you got a 60% on the first paper you turned in, and a 90% on the redo, then your new grade would be 75%.
If your professor completely refuses, redo the assignment anyways and when you hand it in, tell the professor, ""I really wanted to do this right even if you don't want to change my grade."" The professor may decide to change your grade as a result of this extra effort.

, Not every professor offers extra credit opportunities, but many do. It's certainly worth asking your professor about it. This is a chance for you to correct your previous errors, and it may be easier to do if you've recently talked to your professor about what you can do differently in that class.Extra credit assignments can vary widely, from a simple written report to a full term paper.
Find out what your options are and make time to work on anything you're permitted to.
Be sure that you turn in any extra credit assignments on time. Find out from your professor what her deadline is on extra credit work.

, If you ask your professor in advance, she may be able to check your grades for each assignment and give you an estimate of what your current grade in the course is. Some professors may not calculate grades in advance. If this is the case, you can use a simple grade calculator online, or calculate your grade on your own.Look at your course syllabus. It should show you a breakdown of what percentage of your course grade each assignment and exam is worth.
You can calculate each assignment and add your scores together to get an idea of what your current course grade is.
You can also use the following formula: x + x / 1.
In the above formula, you would multiply your percentage for each category times your score (for example, if written assignments were worth 20% of your grade you would multiply 0.20 x whatever your combined grades in that category were). You would perform the same function for your test scores and any other graded categories, then divide that sum by one.

, Studying hard and efficiently is the only way to ensure a good grade. You may not ace a test, and that's okay; the important thing is that you try your hardest and do the necessary work.Figure out where you study most efficiently. Your room may be comfortable, but it's got a lot more distractions than the library or a quiet classroom on campus.
Take good notes in class, and rewrite them in your own words when you get back from class. Rewriting things in your own words helps you process the information and commit it to memory.Try using a mnemonic device. These memory tricks rely on rhyming, imagination, or acronyms (like ROYGBIV to remember the colors of the visible spectrum) to recall the subject matter.

, One common reason many people neglect to study (or neglect to study enough) is time constraints. However, if you're in school, your classes should be your top priority.You should be spending 30 to 60 minutes per class studying each day. If you're really struggling with a class you may need to spend even more time studying.
Take study breaks to give your brain a rest and allow it to digest what you've learned. Aim for a 5 to 10 minute break after every hour of study.
Give yourself a small reward during your study breaks. Figure out a healthy and enjoyable reward you can give yourself, such as allowing yourself a dessert after dinner or downloading a new song from the internet.
Snack healthy while you study. Opt for fresh fruit and vegetables for a tasty, nutritious snack.

, Being distracted while you work is a surefire way to do a bad job at studying, writing, or reading. If you really want to study efficiently, it's important that you reduce or eliminate all distractions and focus on the material at hand.If you have a hard time studying without checking your phone, turn it off while you study. You may even want to consider leaving it in your home or dorm room if you plan to study at the library.
Don't study with the TV or radio on. Focus on the task at hand and devote yourself entirely to studying.

, If you have missed several classes, then make a point not to miss any more. Attending class is one of the best ways to assure a higher grade (or at least a fair grade). By attending class, you are essentially showing your professor that you take her class seriously and are committed to doing the work. Plus, you might otherwise miss more assignments and quizzes if you don't come to class every day on time.If you're doing poorly in a class, there's a chance you may have missed a lot of class meetings and/or assignments. However, it's never too late to turn it around.
The only valid excuse for missing a class is a medical emergency or family emergency. Any other obligations (like work or visiting friends) should come secondary to your class attendance.
Some professors deduct points for each class you miss. If you stop missing classes, at least your grade won't suffer any more from your absences.
Some professors may see that you're trying and give you a few extra points for your effort. There's no guarantee this will happen, but remember that there's no harm; the worst case scenario is that you attend all your classes and learn more information.

, Tutors can help you with many aspects of studying. You can work on a paper together, go over assignments, or learn new and more effective study habits.If you are struggling to improve your grades near the end of the semester, a tutor may be able to help you.


Remember that tutors aren't miracle workers. You'll still need to do the homework, complete your assigned readings, and show up to class and tutoring sessions on time.
A tutor can help you review notes from class, develop better study habits, and work on revising assignments before you turn them in.
Most schools have some type of tutoring center on campus. Check online or ask a campus administrative employee where the tutoring center is for your school.

, If you're doing poorly in your coursework, it may have something to do with the way you behave in class. Take an honest look at your classroom habits and ask yourself if you're fully engaged in the lecture/discussion, or if you allow yourself to be distracted.Even if there is only a week or two of class left, paying more attention in classes and being a more active member of your classes may help to raise your final grades.


If you find yourself talking to your classmates during class, using your cellphone at all, or using a laptop/tablet to check email/social media, message friends, or visit unrelated websites, you are not giving the class your full attention.
Reduce the opportunities that enable these behaviors. For example, in the case of misusing media, turn your cellphone and laptop/tablet off before class, or leave them at home if you cannot resist using them.
If you have a tendency to chat with other classmates during class, try sitting alone or in a part of the room where your friends don't usually sit. You might also try sitting in the front row so that you will be able to pay attention and remain fully engaged in the lecture.
Ask questions about any material you're confused by. If you're sitting near the front of the classroom your teacher will see you raise your hand and can answer your questions as they arise.

, Punctual completion of your assignments will help you perform better in school. Professors will see that you're taking the work seriously, and you just might earn a good grade for your efforts.If you have handed in assignments late in the past, make sure that the rest of your assignments are on time.


Use a planner or calendar to keep track of what's due and when. You should also pencil in any upcoming test dates, and any relevant information on those tests.
Start your final papers and other assignments right away. Ideally, you should be able to finish up your assignments in advance so that you're not scrambling the night before the due date.

, If you're trying to ace a final project, you'll need to budget your time wisely. The easiest way to do this is by breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable blocks.Start as early as possible. Do not wait until the last minute, or it's very unlikely that you will do well.
Calculate how much time you have to complete the assignment, then make a rough estimate of how many hours it will take.
Spread the work out accordingly.
For example, if you have five days to complete a project and you estimate that it will take 10 hours total, spread that time out into two-hour chunks across five days of work.

, You can, however, study smart by focusing on the biggest, most important concepts during the last weeks of the semester.


Join a study group. Some professors will organize study groups as a big exam approaches, while others may leave it up to the students to organize their own study groups.
Continue to employ productive study habits, and keep studying until the morning of the exam. Be sure to get adequate sleep and nutrition, though, or you may burn yourself out.

Get ready for high school.,
Strengthen your skills.,
Embrace reading.",How to Get Straight A's in 8th Grade1," In 8th grade the focus will be on preparing you for high school. The exams will probably be harder, you'll probably spend some time with a guidance counselor, and your teachers will expect more from you. Meet these challenges head on! Begin studying for tests far in advance.


Brainstorm ideas about what you'd like to do with your life, so that your guidance counselor meetings are productive.
Take responsibility for your organization and your grades by working hard without being told to. Taking an active approach to these challenges will best prepare you for the transition to a new school.;
, Although curricula will vary from state to state, you can expect certain similarities across 8th grade. Basically, in every subject you’ll be asked to look at things in greater detail, use more critical thinking skills, and make deeper connections.In English or language arts classes, you can expect an emphasis on persuasive and expository writing (writing that offers an explanation). Begin keeping a journal or diary to strengthen your expository writing skills.
In history or social studies, you will be asked to relate the past to the present in greater detail. You can practice this skill whenever you watch a movie. Ask yourself: Which elements of this movie relate to older movies you have seen? Which elements relate to things from your real life?
Across all of your classes, there will be a greater emphasis on class discussion. Write down questions or comments you have while you are at home doing homework, so that you always have something to contribute.

, In 8th grade (and into high school and college), you are going to be expected to do more reading. You will be asked to read longer novels in your English classes, and you will need to read and understand challenging math, science, and history textbooks. If you struggle with reading, now is the time to seek some help. If you hate to read, now might be a good time to let that go. Start reading a little bit each night to strengthen your skills.Try reading the conclusion first. If you know the main idea before you begin, you may have an easier time understanding what you are reading.
Look up words you don't know. Taking the time to look up words will enable you to understand the reading, while building your vocabulary and making you a better reader over time.
Read at the right time. Some people will have a better time reading in the morning, and others at night. Others will read best right after lunch. Find your ideal reading time, and try to get your reading done when it is optimal for you.

"
"
Make sure you have the right school supplies.,
Find your organizational method.,
Use a planner.,
Keep track of your grades.",How to Get Straight A's in 8th Grade2," Before school starts for the year, your teacher should give you a list of anything you’ll need to buy. Make sure that you get everything on this list, and keep all of the necessary supplies with you at school. This can include things like:


Notebooks
Binders
Pens
Pencils
Colored pencils

, As mentioned above, 8th grade is geared toward preparing you for high school, and learning strong organization skills is a big part of that. Different people have organizational different methods that work for them, so you will need to try different things that work for you. Additionally, make sure you clean out your school desk, home desk, locker, and backpack once a week to keep things tidy and organized.


For example, you may want to have one folder and one notebook dedicated to each class.
You may want to create folders on your computer at home where you can save schoolwork.
You may want to use a color system. If you use a blue folder and notebook for math, you can also use blue post-its for math reminders, and highlight math assignments in your planner with a blue highlighter.

, In 8th grade, teachers will expect more from you. You will be expected to remember what readings or assignments are due without your teacher reminding you. You will need to anticipate big assignments or tests and start working on them a while before they’re due. In order to do this, you are going to need a good daily planner. Write everything down in this planner as soon as you can, and check in with your planner every single day.


Write down the dates of exams, quizzes, and tests.
Write down major assignments.
Write down daily homework assignments and/or reading.

, In order to earn an A in each class, you will need to earn 90% or more of the points (on a typical grade-scale). Your teachers can give you a breakdown of how these points are distributed between classwork, homework, tests, and other categories (like participation). Begin a chart (or spreadsheet) for each class. Each time you get an assignment back, mark the points on your sheet. This will allow you to know what marks you need on further assignments to stay at the “A” level."
"
Aim for perfect attendance.,
Take good notes.,
Create a study routine.,
Create a “homework space” at home.,
Prepare for school physically.",How to Get Straight A's in 8th Grade3," If you want to earn straight A’s, you need to be present in class to learn. Every time you skip class, you risk missing an essential lesson, learning the answer to a test question, or getting the explanation for a big assignment. Furthermore, in some classes you may lose points for absences. The first step in earning straight A’s in 8th grade, is to be present for class every day.If you must miss class, be sure to make up what you missed.
Ask a friend to take notes for you, and speak to your teacher to ensure that got all the proper information.

, In 8th grade, you are going to be expected to take notes. But taking good notes does not mean furiously writing down everything your teacher says. Instead, you can follow a few strategies for taking good notes:Start a new sheet of paper every day. Write the date at the top of the sheet, as well as a heading that states the subject of the class.
Write down key facts. Listen up for important facts, dates, or examples and write these down. If you recognize something your teacher is saying from the reading, this is likely something important.
Don’t worry about using complete sentences. Develop your own shorthand, abbreviations, and shortcuts.
Ask your teacher to repeat something you missed.
Review your notes after school each day. You may even want to rewrite your notes for more clarity.
Consider comparing notes with a trusted classmate. You each may have emphasized different things and could benefit from sharing.

, If you want to excel in 8th grade, you are going to need to create a study routine (and stick to it). Set aside time each night to study and to complete any upcoming assignments. Do this each day even if you do not have anything due.Spend 10-15 minutes reviewing material that you learned that day.
Spend 30-40 minutes completing the most urgent assignments.
Spend 10-15 minutes beginning work on other assignments, or studying for tests, that will not be due for a little while.

, Choose a place for you to do your homework at home. Ideally, you will have a desk with a chair and a computer. Keep any important materials here, and be sure to keep this place tidy. Having a dedicated homework space helps solidify your homework routine, and get you in the right mindset to work.


You may have an office in your home that you can claim for an hour or two each day.
You may be able to set up a section of your bedroom for this purpose.
If all else fails, you can probably set up shop at your kitchen or dining room table.
All that matter is that you are comfortable, you won't be distracted, and that you have access to all the materials you need.

, If you want to do well in 8th grade, you need to come to school ready and able to concentrate. This means two things: (1) getting a good night’s sleep, and (2) eating a healthy breakfast. If you do these two things, you will be able to pay attention during class, learn the material, and excel in 8th grade.Try to get 8 hours of sleep per night and keep a regular bedtime.
Studies have shown that adolescents who eat whole grains with milk had better academic performance than both those who had no breakfast and those who had sugary cereals.
It is also helpful to eat healthy snacks throughout the day. Things like ""ants on a log"" (celery with peanut butter and raisins), hummus and veggies, and all-natural fruit leathers are great options.

Look for extra credit, even if you're doing well.,
Limit your social life.,
Take as many credits as you can handle.,
Commit!,
Ask for help.",How to Get Straight A's in College," You have to choose classes that you will be interested in. Of course, you may still have to plow through gen ed courses, but that shouldn't be too much trouble. Once you start learning about what interests you, you might...;
, Don't like to study? It can be tough, but you have to find some motivation to learn, otherwise you may start slacking off. Try a rigid study routine, or try to make studying fun. Try applying what you are studying into a real life situation.

, College professors know who is and who is not paying attention in class, and this could reflect poorly on your grade. Make sure you let the professor know that you are interested and have a real desire to perform well in their course.

, As much as this is a warning, it is also a step. Never walk into class with a cell phone that is on, or an audio device, or anything that may distract you from giving the class 110% of your attention. You never know when the professor may mutter something like; ""yeah, this might be on the test"".

, Going above and beyond never hurt anyone, and it can be a great way of getting your name out in your department.

, College is your future, your social life is your past. Understand that every night you go out is another night that you could have been studying. Once you have your degree, you will have all the time you want to socialize.

, The college will charge you the same amount if you are taking 12 or 19 credits, so don't waste your time or money by taking just a few credits. Make the most of your time and...

, This is a big step, because it means that you'll have to make your education your whole life. Somehow you should always be contributing to your education, whether it is studying that extra fifteen minutes or finding that internship opportunity. Your time and energy are the ingredients to a good college education.

, This may seem obvious, but many kids are too afraid or don't care enough. Showing your professors that you are actively engaged in their material is never a bad idea, even if you really don't understand the material.

Think about why you want to do home school.,
Do your research.,
Contact the local homeschooling groups you find and start palling around with the people you meet so you won't start out isolated.,
Visit the local library.,
This might sound bad, but tell your parents all the 'horrible' things you hate at your school.,
Be more responsible with your chores before your parents know you want to be homeschooled so they'll see that you can be responsible enough to handle a workload without thinking it's just pandering.,
When you finally 'drop the bomb' so to speak, make sure your parents are in a good mood, have time to talk, and have no distractions around.

,
This can be a little hard to swallow for your sibling(s).,
If they say 'no' the first time, don't give up!",How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Homeschool," Home school may be an option because your grades are down, you're being bullied, social issues (making friends), or the kids and/or teachers are making you feel unsafe. Remember this for when you explain why you would want to do this with your parents.;
, Look into all the different homeschool options. Find out how much it costs, if you would have a facilitator in your city, and so on.

, People transferring out of the system aren't used to having to take the initiative in finding friends, so save yourself the trouble while you can.


Ask them to try to persuade your parents.

,


Get books by authors such as Grace Llewellyn, John Gatto and John Holt, and ask your parents to read them.

, Leave out the better things. Such as ""Mom, I can not stand to be in school anymore, so many kids there are into drugs, and I don't want to be in that situation."" Follow that with what will be fixed when you're homeschooled. Also tell them that you can do online school, where you have actual teachers. Your grades will go up as a result of a better environment, and you'll be getting more sleep so you'll be more fun to be around.


Put it in writing. Write them a letter and make a copy or two. Or if you want to be fancy, make a Powerpoint and present it to them.

, If you're having loads of trouble in school and can clean up your act enough to be a respectable student, do it, but don't overdo it or your parents might not take you that seriously.

,, They may think it is unfair that you are doing home school if they stay at normal school. They may try to convince you that this is not a good idea. Just 'stick to your guns', so to speak.

,


Be ready for a bumpy start; virtually nobody finishes homeschooling the same way they started.
If nothing else works, and you're old enough to make the decision (teenager), and you still want to homeschool then consider refusing to attend school and issue your parents with an ultimatum.

In the United States, you can look up each state's approach on the HSLDA website. Don't get caught by surprise because you didn't know you had to register your homeschool, or submit test results and work logs.The requirements can vary significantly depending on the state you live in. It is legal to homeschool your children in all US states. However, beyond that the rules can be very different. For example, some schools requires that you enroll your child in the local school even though they don’t actually attend. Other states require that you set yourself up as a private school.;
, Getting to know other families who are involved in homeschool will be a great way to get to know what works and what doesn’t, which resources are good and which are a waste of time, etc. Additionally, having a support system will mean you have someone you can go to when you feel like you are struggling.Having contact with other homeschool families will also offer opportunities for your child to interact with other children.
You can find a list of homeschool organizations and support groups at http://www.home-school.com/groups/.
You can find out information about homeschooling resources in your area by doing an internet search using the terms “homeschool” plus the name of your city and state. Don’t forget to check social media sites such as Facebook too. These offer great forums for asking questions and reading about the experiences and challenges of others.
There are hundreds of blogs written by homeschool educators, these are a great resource for finding information. You can find them easily by doing an internet search for “homeschool blogs.” There is also a recommended list of blogs that can be found here.

, Though the cost can vary based on a number of factors, homeschooling is generally more expensive than public school and less expensive than private school. Creating a budget will help you know what you can afford to spend. In some places, the state government might be able to help you pay for the curriculum. Set aside some money to purchase ordinary school supplies as needed, and for miscellaneous educational expenses.Generally speaking, homeschooling older children will cost more than homeschooling younger children. This is because the education for older students usually involves dense text books that can be much more expensive. There might also be examinations that your child must take, and that you must purchase for them.While you could, in theory, get all of the materials you need for your child’s education for free from the internet, this will be very time consuming. The most expensive option is to purchase a box curriculum, but this will include the curricula for every subject for the year.

, Besides finding other homeschool families to support you, you should also discuss your decision to homeschool with friends and family so that you are all on the same page. This will ensure that your child has everyone around them helping them to succeed.Some of these people may be prejudiced against homeschooling. If this is important to you, then spend time with those people. Show them how you are ensuring that your children has a balanced and well-rounded education complete with socialization and extra-curricular activities.

, You'll need a solid and thorough plan for your child’s education. There are hundreds of curricula to choose from online sources and books. You may want to pick and choose from several by subject or grade level. If you are new to homeschooling this can be overwhelming so be sure to ask your fellow homeschoolers what they have tried.It can be helpful before choosing a curriculum to set your child’s learning goals. What do you want them to know by the end of the school year? Writing down these goals will give you a clear idea about whether a particular curriculum suits those goals.
You can purchase a box curriculum, which will include everything you need, or you can pick and choose depending on the subject. For new homeschool parents, many experienced educators recommend purchasing a boxed curriculum in the first year. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can venture out and explore different options.Your state likely has a few recommended curricula to choose from.

, Make homeschooling a priority. Keep free time separate from ""school time,"" and don't let interruptions or distractions take over. Many children benefit from a daily schedule so they know what you expect from them. You now have primary responsibility over their education, and you need to set parameters so they complete their work.Homeschooling doesn't have to be six hours a day or five days a week. Pick the schedule that works best for each child. Your five or six-year old may only need a couple hours a day of dedicated schoolwork.
For example, if you are homeschooling your child who is between 1st and 6th grade, you should probably spend about one to two hours per day on their studies. It is a good idea to keep each learning session short (between 10 and 20 minutes for kids from grades 1 to 3, and 20 to 45 minutes for kids from grade 4 to 6). Break up these sessions with fun activities for your child, these could be educational games, but it could also just be independent play time.If you are homeschooling an older child, it is good to aim for at least two hours (or more) of time spent learning. For older kids, you can teach them about a specific subject for a bit longer than a younger child. For example, you can aim for a 45 minute or longer session., Although it is a good idea to have some type of schedule, it is important to remember that you may not always be able to stick with that schedule. An activity might take more or less time than you thought, or an interesting field trip opportunity might pop up. Don’t stress about it if you can’t stick to the schedule all of the time.Many homeschooling parents don’t stick to a strict schedule. If you had planned for a 45 minute session, but your child is obviously becoming very tired and frustrated, then it’s OK to cut it short.
If you have to deviate from the schedule, don’t worry. Do take the time to explain to your child why you are deviating, and how you will makeup for the missed work together.

, Your child will also spend a lot of their time engaged in independent activities. This doesn’t mean that you should let them sit in front of the TV for hours, though. These activities should typically involve some type of learning or physical activity. These activities can be a lot of fun for kids, they will encourage the child’s independence, and they will be completing the required learning at the same time.For example, you can have a part of the day where your child engages in physical activity (such as jumping rope or playing basketball, for example), where they do an art project or experiment with science projects. They can practice an instrument or read a book that they choose from a list you have created.

, Many states will require that you keep records of your child’s learning. If your child hopes to attend college, many college admissions offices will also require evidence of their learning. Besides fulfilling requirements, having records of your child’s education will help you evaluate what is working and what is not working, and where your child is excelling and where they are struggling.There is software that you can purchase, which is designed especially for keeping track of homeschool education. If you don’t want to purchase this type of software, you can also create your own system for keeping track of everything, but make sure to check reporting requirements in your state.

, Every child is different. A big advantage of homeschooling is the ability to teach each your children based on their individual strengths and weaknesses. Most home schools have a more relaxed learning environment, but some kids may excel with a more traditional school lecture approach. Do not hesitate to change something if it's not working out. There will be plenty of trial and error, but you'll get into the swing of things.If your child is frustrated with a particular book, switch to one with a different teaching style. The right book is challenging, but communicates ideas in a way that the student finds clear and engaging.

, Kids blossom when encouraged.Keep your calm even when you don't want to, and remember that taking homeschooling seriously doesn’t mean that you have to be serious all of the time. Make it fund and enjoyable for the both of you..


This doesn’t mean that you can’t have an honest relationship with your child or that you should teach them that they are entitled to everything they want. You should, however, do your best to stay positive and encouraging, especially when your child is feeling insecure or frustrated.

, Time management and responsible behavior stand out as the most essential, but many young adults don't know the first thing about cooking a meal or changing a tire. Learning life skills such as how to manage money, cook, and maintain a job is essential to anyone's development.Teaching practical skills likely won’t be a part of your curriculum, but having practical skills is still very valuable.
There are many different practical skills you can teach your children outside of the more traditional school subjects. For example, financial skills (e.g. understanding credit scores, how to make investments, etc.), daily living skills (e.g. how to swim, how to change a tire, how to cook healthy food, etc.), and even more philosophical types of skills (e.g. how to appreciate what you have, how to find the good in others, etc.).

, Some people wrongly describe homeschooled kids as isolated and unable to interact or function in society. They would be surprised to know that most homeschoolers have the opposite experience. Make an effort to get your kids involved with activities outside the house. Homeschooling associations often plan parties, sport teams, Key Club, 4-H, and many other activities. Empower your kids to become citizens with high levels of aspiration.Depending on regional laws, homeschoolers may be allowed to participate in public school extracurricular activities.
Take field trips to local attractions, especially ones with educational value. If you have close friends with interesting professions, you can even arrange observation days where your children can learn about a specific profession or hobby.

, Extracurricular activities go a long way, but social life is about more than just kids hanging out with other kids their age. Kids and teens benefit from socializing with people of all age groups. Plug yourself in to your local community through community centers, nursing homes, religious centers, and libraries. Have family outings to volunteer at events, take field trips, and visit the park.It is a myth that homeschool children are necessarily less social than children who attend public or private school.
If you don’t take any initiative to help your children get out of the house, they may not meet many people.

, Starting at a young age, teach your child to be inquiring, studious, and self-motivated. As they approach adolescence, they will be getting into subjects that are more difficult for you to teach. The earlier you encourage curiosity and critical thinking, the smoother the transition from childhood to the teenager years, and on to adulthood will go.


Let your children have time by themselves. Especially as kids get older, tension can build between parent and child if you are constantly around each other. Transitioning into adulthood is one of the hardest things a person will go through in life. Preparing your kids for adulthood by giving them responsibility and letting them earn trust is one of the most important things you can do as a parent.

Generally speaking, New England has the most stringent requirements.Before you jump in, research your state's laws and give them the required notice, in addition to making a checklist of future deadlines for yourself (if applicable).


Since home educators have a personal investment in ensuring they understand the homeschooling laws correctly, local support groups are often the best resource to steer you to the most accurate legal information in your area.
Be advised that the legal requirements for home educators vary by country, state, and even sometimes by school district, so a bit of research will be required.
HSLDA and A to Z Home’s Cool provide useful guides to what it means to home-educate legally (see external links below).

You may be required to keep a portfolio of your children's work. It is very important to do this from day 1 if required by your state.

;
, Depending on your take of ""home school,"" the amount of money you'll be investing in your child can very greatly. The job can be done with $300 or it can be done with $2,500. It all depends on what supplies you'll be using and activities you plan on doing.


Activities, unfortunately, aren't always free. In order to get the best of the world (and learn more while they're at it), you could supplement their lessons with trips to planetariums, art exhibits, lectures, showcases, nature preserves and the like -- but these things can cost money.

For the record, those two figures mentioned above represent the ends of the average home-schooling spectrum., Get them involved in some kind of sport or other activity that they like; your child will need social interaction and time spent away from home. Don't force them to do anything, but don't let them give up too easily, either. These activities get children to socialize and also teach important life skills such as making friends and keeping commitments.


Home schooling your child will not ""ruin"" them. As long as you make sure their emotional, social, mental, and physical needs are met, they'll be successful adults in the future. Ask them what activities they'd like to do that span their interests and get them started on the right path.

Research says home-schoolers are just as involved as their publicly-schooled peers. They help the community and can make just as many social connections., Others in your family who care about you and your children can be helpful and give great support to your home education efforts -- or they can be heartbreaking critics. Plan how you will tell them what you are planning to do, listen to their responses, and answer questions and concerns they may have. Help them understand that you are prepared and determined, and don't let any negative attitudes get you down. They care, and over time as your children show success in their education at home, they very well may come around and be your greatest supporters.


In fact, why can't they aid in helping your children learn? Surely they have areas of expertise that you don't. Let them know you want them to be a part of your child's life, too -- how could they possibly turn it down?

, Realize that you care about your child's future more than anyone else does. Therefore, you are uniquely qualified for the role of homeschooling parent. Homeschooling is a big responsibility, but if you mold it to your family lifestyle it can work well -- regardless of your education or expertise. It does not require you to give up the rest of your interests; you can still have a life outside of home school.


While it's pretty easy to get a child through grade school, you may find it's harder to be confident in yourself when it comes to putting them through high school. But it is doable and people have done it. Just know that you'll be learning, too!

, Different styles abound and can be learned from and used as resources. The schools of thought vary widely when it comes to this topic, so it's best to sit down and find where you fall on the spectrum of belief yourself.



Unschooling: This is an anarchic approach where the student is self-directed. It's based on the idea that a student is likely to learn quickly and easily when s/he studies things s/he is interested in.
Diane Lockman offers an approach geared towards reading, thinking, and communicating, with a heavy Christian emphasis. She even offers online high school courses.Unit studies -- where each unit is dedicated to a different topic. You can often find units (and other varied curricula) online.
Charlotte Mason’s methodology is a little less conventional and focuses on ""atmosphere, discipline, and life.Montessori or Waldorf methods, where the child is more independent and ""discovers"" rather than is told.An eclectic blend of different styles
A complete online curriculum package like Global Student Network
A private online school like International Virtual Learning Academy

, Examine your own intentions and motivations. Why do you want to home educate? What do you consider a ‘good’ education? What do you believe about children, teaching, and learning? How do your children seem to learn best? These questions can help you determine what approach to take and help you create a learning environment that will be best for your family and your children.


Consider, too, that an approach that works for one child may not be best for another. In addition, what you may prefer may not be best for them. Talk to your child about his/her expectations before you go about outlining the year.

, The enormous volume of material and methods that are available can be overwhelming for a new homeschooling parent. It's easy to forget how useful it all is! Identifying your approach will be the first step in narrowing things down. There are many resources to help you navigate through the maze of ideas. Research, read, and plan what you want to teach and how.


Libraries and bookstores have books on home education methods, experiences, and proven curricula.
The internet offers a never-ending source of information as well: basic information on various subjects, online purchase of curricula and supplies, articles about methodologies, support groups, and public school curricula. It even has free lessons on most subjects from teachers, other home educators, and even television stations.

Authentic classical education involves teaching reading, thinking, and speaking to substantial mastery. However, Unschoolers, while agreeing with the classical education system, usually have a wide variety of resources for their children to experience, but no formal curriculum. It's all up to you.


You'll want to touch on art, the sciences (Biology, Physics, Chemistry), languages, music, mathematics, history, and geography, for starters.

, You can find local groups that meet regularly, organizations that put on periodic seminars or conventions, or even online groups that swap ideas and resources. Many groups set up co-op classes--taught by other parents--in a variety of subjects. If you start to feel overwhelmed, frustrated, or all alone in your family's educational pursuits, a support group can offer advice or just a reassuring acknowledgment from other parents that you are not alone.


They are also an invaluable resource for tips on how to comply with the home education laws in your area. If you have any questions at all, a local support group should be your place to turn. And your child could meet other homeschoolers!

, Home education supplies vary greatly according to teaching method. You can order textbooks, boxed curricula, and learning tools online or at home-educating curriculum and supply sales. For cheaper alternatives, many home educators use libraries, used book stores, curriculum swaps, thrift stores, and garage sales.


Back-to-school-sales at local discount stores or office supply stores are the perfect place to get some of the basic supplies like pens, notebooks and glue. Stock up in August and you'll last throughout the year.

, If you choose to have a more formal home education environment, you can prepare by gathering your lesson plans, materials, and textbooks together -- or even by setting up a room in your house for studies and activities. However you choose to home educate, it can only be helped by planning and preparing as much as you can before you start.


A different approach might mean your preparation involves setting up field trips for the rest of the year in every subject, placing learning objects around your home, or simply getting yourself into a mindset of using every day as a learning opportunity with no set plans or textbooks.

, Everyone benefits from seeing things firsthand. Some activities that can be educational as well as easy to do are: gardening, cooking, sewing, composting, science projects, hiking, fixing the house, caring for pets, and taking apart broken appliances (just make sure there are no lasers or dangerous electronic components still active). Your children will learn different things depending on their ages, but everyone will come away better educated.


Make sure your activities are fact-filled and concept-checked. Planting flowers can be a learning activity -- or it can be an activity where a child got to play in the dirt. If you do do activities around the house, accompany it with a reading or other supplementary tool.

, Thick, three-ringed binders with tab separators for each student are an excellent way to keep track of schoolwork, along with whatever may be required from a legal standpoint. Label each tab with whatever subjects you are studying. After your child has completed a page, punch holes (using a three-ring hole punch) and snap the page into the proper section of their book. Remember to date each page or it will be a big jigsaw puzzle to figure out later.


This is especially useful if your child is thinking of going to college, as some schools require portfolios of work from homeschool students. And you could always use the materials for reference later for your next child or for your friends or relatives.

, Trust your knowledge and instincts regarding your own children. You are not only the one ultimately responsible for guiding your children's education, but you are often the one person best able to recognize what they do or do not need. Turn to evaluations and insights from others to help guide you, but trust your own instincts about what your children need to learn and do in their educational progress.


Questioning yourself is normal. You may feel like you do it all the time, especially when you first start. This is when your support group comes in handy and you should utilize the tools (like the Internet) you have at your disposal. Odds are you are just as qualified as the next parent who's doing it and have nothing to worry about.

, Progress evaluation happens naturally through the one-on-one process of home educating, although in some areas the law requires periodic formal testing or evaluation of home educators. Personal evaluation, however, should not only consider how your child is doing academically but also how the process is working for everyone in the family.


If the teaching methods are a poor match with your child’s learning style, if the curriculum is too structured or not structured enough, or if the process of home educating seems to be making things worse rather than better, then it’s time for a change. Fortunately, change is something you can do fairly quickly with just a little research.
If you feel uncomfortable with your level of knowledge on the subject, there are standardized progress tests (such as FCAT) that your child can take and then have the scores mailed to you, and you can find many other tests to order or take online.

, Explain to them what is going to happen in the months to come, including how daily life will be structured for them and the rest of the family. Explain to older children that though they may be leaving their school, it doesn't mean they are leaving their education or their friends.


Ask them what they would be interested in studying. For example, if he/she loves stargazing, get a telescope and study astronomy. Be sure to get them excited. Home education should be fun for the students -- not a punishment. That's the best motivator.
If it'll help them, let them know that they're one of 1.5 million (and rising) students that are going to learn from home this year., Often children who leave the standard educational system for home education need some time to adjust. Instead of immediately jumping into ""school at home,"" you may want to do unstructured activities and then slowly work into your routine. Determine how much ""recovery time"" is needed for each particular child, and work with them to create a different and more enjoyable learning experience.


If they're concerned, do research and back up your opinions with others' opinions; they shouldn't think that this is some tyrannical decision on your part. If they think they'll be behind, let them know that this means they can start taking college courses earlier -- if anything, this will speed up their education process.

, Encourage your child to stay in touch with friends s/he already has. You might encourage -- but do not force -- your child to become friends with another home-educated child as well. In many cases this will occur spontaneously if your family interacts with other homeschool families through co-op classes, field trips or homeschool sporting events.


One of the best things about home schooling is that it doesn't take 8 hours to teach your child. In fact, at a brick-and-mortar institution, they'd spend most of their time waiting. You may be able to get done in 4 hours what their old school could get done in 7. That means more time for you and more time for them to spend developing their selves.

Avoid for-profit online universities.",How to Attend Free Online Courses2," Many highly-respected universities offer the materials used in their courses online for free. These include some of the most prestigious universities in the world, such as the University of California at Berkeley and Yale University. While you can find information on the courses and materials available for free on these and other university’s websites, universities are increasingly getting involved with collaborative online course-providers. Further, some universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, make material available through several different online organizations.


Find a class with the Open Education Consortium.

, Many universities that are predominantly or exclusively online are primarily businesses whose main goal is to earn a profit. These universities are not free, but often advertise themselves aggressively, promising large amounts of financial aid for students. Acquiring federal financial aid money is the basis of these businesses’ financial model.The quality of the courses offered by predominantly online, for-profit universities is very low.
Examples of for-profit online universities include DeVry University, Kaplan, and the University of Phoenix, which was found by a federal investigation to systematically operate in a misleading manner and has been fined millions of dollars for doing so.

Stay organized.,
Familiarize yourself with the portal.,
Participate in the collaborative aspect of online learning.",How to Attend Free Online Courses4," It is important to have a place to keep all the educational material you collect during your course. Have a clearly named folder on your desktop with all the electronic files you acquire, and have a tangible folder to hold printouts and notes.

, Online courses will almost always have a portal or dashboard that offers a personalized page you can access by enrolling and/or logging in. Platforms will vary widely. Get used to the online interface as soon as you begin a class by spending time simply examining all of the pages, sections, and links associated with your class.


These user-specific (or class-specific) page with likely provide the materials you need (or information on how to get these materials).
Take advantage of supplementary material. These will include links to outside references and other helpful materials.

, If they hold classes that you can video conference in on, definitely do so! Many classes will also organize chatrooms or blogs that are open to others in the same course. Use these to ask questions or begin conversations about course material.


Join study groups. Study groups will likely include video meetings or live chat sessions. If there is not already a study group of one sort or another associated with your class, start one! You and many of your classmates will benefit from collaborating, and will likely learn the course material more quickly.

Emphasize the diversity inherent in homeschooling.,

Emphasize the opportunities available for homeschoolers.,
Avoid arrogance.",How to Deal With Homeschool Misconceptions," While it is not your responsibility to educate others about homeschooling, you may be asked questions from well-meaning individuals, friends, and family members. Whether you are just beginning to homeschool your children or you have been homeschooling for years, you will likely find yourself having to explain your decision to others.


You may decide to homeschool your child based on personal preference, religious reasons, or if you find the public schools in your area to be unsatisfactory. It can be as easy to share your reason as, ""Yes, my family decided that we weren't happy with the quality of education that our kids were getting at the local elementary school so we've decided to homeschool them.""
Understand that many people are curious about homeschooling because they are less familiar with homeschooling than they are with traditional public or private schooling.
Everyone has different reasons to homeschool. Your decision to homeschool your children may be based on a very different set of circumstances or experiences than another parent’s decision.;
, Look for homeschooling groups or support systems in your area to feel more connected with the homeschooling community and use them as a resource. Support groups are a helpful way to meet other parents who have gone through the homeschooling process before and who have useful advice for new homeschoolers.Other homeschooling parents can share ways that they've confronted misconceptions about homeschooling before, which can prepare you for whenever you may face them.
Homeschooling groups are also valuable resources if you need advice on practical homeschooling matters, such as selecting a curriculum.
Finding a homeschool support group in your area has been made easy by organizations like the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), a homeschool advocacy group, which has sites that allow you to search for groups in your zip code., While you do not need to justify your decision to homeschool to others, you should listen to the opinions of others when you engage in conversations with them.


When you share your decision with people that you care about, be open to hearing the opinions of others. While their opinions may not change your decision, their support can be invaluable to your homeschooling experience.
If you receive unwanted or unsolicited advice from others about your decision to homeschool, feel free to steer the conversation away from homeschooling or end the conversation.

, There is a time and place for explanation. If you run into a hostile individual who is rude or refuses to listen to your reasoning, you must know when to walk away from a situation.


There may be individuals who feel strongly against your decision to homeschool and they will have their reasons for reaching that conclusion. If they cannot be respectful of your decision, you do not have to engage with them on the subject of homeschooling anymore.
Use reason and rationality to explain your decision, even when you're confronted with an emotional response. A simple answer like, ""This is the best decision for my family and if you cannot respect that, I don't think it's helpful for either of us to speak about this again.""

, Many misconceptions about homeschooling come from a lack of information or knowledge about what homeschooling entails. While you are most likely familiar with the benefits of homeschooling, it is often useful to have a wide pool of facts to draw upon when you confront misconceptions.


Education research can provide you with facts and statistics that can help you to better explain your decision. The National Home Education Research Institute, HSLDA, and the Coalition for Responsible Home Education are all great sources for research on homeschooling.

, Many people worry that homeschooled children do not have the same opportunities to socialize as traditionally schooled children. People may ask, ""What do your children do to make friends?"" You can share the ways that you've involved them in groups and you can say that, ""Our children see their friends as frequently as they would if they were in a public school.""


There are many ways that children have the opportunity to spend time with other children. You can enroll your child in an organized sports league, join homeschooling groups that take field trips, participate in religious organizations, and being active in your community.
Homeschooling does not mean that you want to deprive your child of socialization opportunities, but it can protect them from some of the more negative social aspects of the public school system, like bullying.

, If someone is curious about your decision to homeschool, feel free to share your reasons for coming to the decision to begin homeschooling with them.


Don’t feel obligated to share reasons if they are personal. Of course, the reasons that factored into your decision to homeschool may be intimate and private. You are under no obligation to share more information than you are willing to share.

, There are more than 2 million children being homeschooled in the United States in 2016 and they are from every social, economic, and ethnic background.Emphasize that there is no single type of homeschooling family. Many people have an idea of what type of family decides to homeschool their children, but this isn't an accurate depiction of who will homeschool their children.
Just like there is diversity in the type of homeschoolers, there are very different ways that you can choose to homeschool your child. Every family makes an individual decision about how they want to school their children. There are many different types of homeschool services to choose from, like online programs, college preparation curriculums, and families that homeschool their children in groups., If you have older children, they can be involved in your homeschooling decisions. As kids get older, their views on education and how they want to learn may change. If they no longer want to be homeschooled and can offer viable reasons why this is the case, consider transitioning to public schooling.


Bring your children to the library and have them pick out books that they’re interested in, and involve them in small parts of your curriculum development. .
Have your children share what they’re interested in and use that as an opportunity to engage their interests. For example, if your child becomes interested in animals and their health, go to the zoo or have a conversation with a friend who works in the animal care field. Let your child explore their interests, within reason.

, Families that decide to homeschool their children are able to choose from a variety of homeschooling services and curriculums.


In many school districts, homeschooled children are welcome to join sports team and participate in extracurricular activities at the schools.
Homeschooled students are more likely to get into college and to graduate and they test more highly than public school students in standardized exams., Your decision to homeschool your children is your decision, just as it is other parent's decision to enroll their children in a public or private school. Each of your decisions is your own.


Your decision to homeschool your child does not make you superior or a better parent than others who chose not to homeschool their children.
Homeschooling is not a feasible option for many people, including those who would otherwise want to homeschool their children. Being cognizant of other's struggles will help you to remain respectful of their decisions.
Return respect with respect. When other people respect your decision to homeschool, you should respect their decisions as well.

Consider carefully what is involved in being a nurse.,
Decide on which degree course is right for you.,
Find a suitable online nursing degree course.,
Consider your time availability.,
Complete online enrollment for your basic courses.,
Make arrangements with the school to fulfill the clinical requirements at a medical facility near their place of residence.,
Work out your ability to pay for the degree.",How to Earn an Online Nursing Degree," The responsibilities, the long hours and the relatively low pay involved in a nursing career can be challenging. However, it is important to balance these challenges with the rewards of serving for the greater good of society and helping others, including the knowledge that you are genuinely helping to make the lives of many patients a lot better. One of the most compelling reasons to become a nurse is its many job opportunities; the Bureau of Labor Statistics has forecast a large shortage of nurses in the coming years with the aging baby boomer population.Do some research online to see what nurses say themselves (there are lots of forum posts you can check out), and ask nurses to find out what they believe is good and bad about the job before making your decision.;
, If you already have nursing experience, or a nursing degree, you might be looking for more advanced online degree work than if you're starting out for the first time. In general, you can expect to find the following degree courses on offer:


Online or Credit-by-Examination Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) -- this degree leads to RN licensure, and is a good option if you are already a paramedic or a practical/vocational nurse (LPN/LVN)
Online Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) - this will result in you becoming a registered nurse (RN)
Online RN-to-BSN - if you already have a nursing diploma or an associate degree, this is a ""fast track"" way to get a BSN
Online Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) - this is about specializing in one area of advanced practice
Online Nursing Doctorate - further specialization in advanced practice or clinical research, when you are seeking a leadership role.

, There are numerous courses available on the Internet and you will need to spend time sifting through them. There are two main search methods - one is to go to a university that is reputed for its nursing school degrees (ask friends, nurses you know, at the local hospital, etc., if you're not sure), or you can use one of the many online degree collating portals that mention all the major, reputable universities. It is really important though to ensure that you are looking at a reputable degree course; you might get some help by reading wikiHow's article on ensuring online degree credibility to help you avoid any pitfalls. Once you have chosen an online degree that seems right for you, take your time to read up on the terms and conditions, the frequently asked questions, and to learn whether or not everything offered meets your needs and interests.

, It is also a good idea to decide about how much flexibility you want from your degree - if you still need to work while completing your course, find a course with the best flexibility to adapt to your schedule. Most online courses are already aware that their students keep working, and accommodate this well.

, The courses will likely include: Introduction to Professional Nursing, Nursing Management, Health Policy Issues, Nursing Administration, Health and Disease Management, Research Methods, Nursing Theory, and more. Check about residency requirements - many online nursing schools won't have this, although you will need to complete the laboratory and clinical requirements at some stage, so it is important to think in advance about how you will accommodate this at the time.

, This will need to be done once basic coursework has been completed and should be something to keep in mind as part of your enrollment process, in case you also need to plan for a temporary stay elsewhere.

, Expect current online nursing programs offered through public universities to cost between $110 and $170 per credit hour. Depending on the school’s academic calendar, this could be anywhere from 60 to 90 credits. As an online student, you usually won’t be charged out-of-state fees and tuition. There are scholarships and grants available for online nursing degrees, in place to encourage people to enter the nursing field; just look at the university's scholarships and grants section on the Internet, or ask for advice.

Have others quiz you.",How to Memorize Flashcards Effectively," Writing down the information yourself--rather than borrowing a set-- is more effective. The process itself helps the learning and memorization process. Plus, this will help you summarize the information in a way that makes the most sense to you. It can be tempting to borrow someone else’s flash cards, but this won’t help you nearly as much as making your own., When you make your flash cards, make sure you write them on thick cards or paper. You need to make sure you can’t see through the paper to get the answer on the other side. If you are making your own cards, be sure that they are all the same size. You don’t want different sizes of cards giving away the answers. Otherwise, you aren’t memorizing the connection between the terms and explanations, but just what each size card says. That won’t be very helpful when you’re taking the test.
A package of index cards is usually a great starting point, as they will all be the same size and made of nice, thick paper. Plus, one side usually has lines, helping you write neat sentences to explain concepts.
Of course, it is better to use regular paper if you must than no flashcards a all!

, Avoid waiting until the night before the exam to put together your flash cards. Instead, make a nice pile right after class or school. That is when the information will be freshest in your mind, and you won’t have to try and remember everything when you start making the cards.This is also a good way to come up with questions to ask your teacher. If while making your cards, you come across a term that you can’t write a good card for, ask your teacher about it in the next class. Write down the answer on the back of your card, and you’ve got a pre-made flash card ready to join the others.

, In general, limit your cards to one word or one sentence. The less you need the remember for each card, the easier it will be the memorize it.Make sure you keep your information on each card limited to just a few words of information. For example, if you are studying for a history class, and are making a card for George Washington, you’ll want to limit your information. Using small bullet points like “Commander during the American Revolution,” “First President of the United States,” and “Father of the Country” is better than a paragraph listing every detail you can cram onto it.
If you are using your flash cards to ask and answer questions, keep to one question per card. For a history card, don’t ask “Who was the first President, Vice President, Speaker of the House, and Chief Justice of the United States?” That is too much information at once. Not only will you have a hard time memorizing each piece of information, but also remembering which one is tied to which.

, In addition to the words on your cards, consider including a picture. Your brain is really good as remembering visual images, and adding them to your cards can help you associate them with words. These don’t need to be detailed drawings, just simple designs to help remind you of what you are looking at.This is particularly helpful for flashcards to study a foreign language. In addition to the vocabulary you are trying to use, sketching a small picture can help the word stick in your mind.

, While handmade flash cards are a common study tool, there are many new technologies out there for creating electronic cards. You can store these cards on a smartphone or laptop and have them accessible wherever you go. There are many different programs available for free that allow you to create a database of cards from your own notes as well as other people’s work. These programs can create games and other study methods to hep you with memorization., Practice makes perfect. The more you go through your stack of cards, the more you’ll be able to remember. You can set slightly different goals depending on how fast you get the information, but the more times you are able to go through them, the more you will remember.Space out your study sessions. Your goal shouldn’t be to get through your flash cards three times as quickly as possible to skip doing it later. Taking a break between sessions will help you know what information you are having trouble remember. That way, you can focus on that more to make sure you get it right., The best way to help yourself memorize flash cards is to review the in small groups rather than push through the whole pile at once. This will keep you focused on smaller chunks of information, which is easier to memorize. This will also encourage you to pick the cards up for a quick study session between classes or while waiting for your friends to show up, knowing you don’t need to rush so you can get through the whole thing.Take impromptu opportunities to use flashcards. Use odd moments of downtime to review. Waiting for the bus? On hold with customer service? Dinner cooking? Time to use the flashcards!

, Don’t let yourself zone out, or mindlessly flip through the cards. Instead, find ways to keep your attention up. When you read each card, say the words out loud, or say things like “I know this,” or “I don’t know this.” Staying engaged with the material will help you stay focused on what you are doing., Before you begin to go through and review your cards, mix them up a bit. If you just keep repeating the pile, you won’t be memorizing the answers, just the order they appear in. Unless you know that’s how the information will appear on your test, it won’t be very helpful when you sit down to take it., As you go through the cards, separate them into different piles. These can be one for those you know or got right, one for the ones you definitely got wrong, and maybe a third of things you “sort of” know. Once you have finished, go through the “wrong” pile until you can get them all into the “right” pile, then do the same if you have a “sort of” pile. This will help you put extra emphasis on the information you don’t know as well. Just remember which pile is which!If you are squeezing in a quick study session, you may want to skip the piles. That way, you won’t accidentally forget some of your cards when you need to move and do something else quickly.

, Flash cards are quick and easy to use, so if you have a five-minute break between classes or on the bus, you can always pull them out for a quick study session. Cards are nice and small too, especially compared to your notebook or textbook, so they are much easier to carry. You never know when you’ll get a few minutes to get in some quick studying, so always be prepared., Memorizing things can be hard if you aren’t awake and focused when reading your cards. Make sure you find a time during the day when you will be wide awake and won’t be interrupted. This time will be different for every person, so you’ll have to find the situation that works best for you., Having music on in the background when you study can help you remember things. Your brain will be able to connect information to the music by “playing” the song mentally in your mind.Avoid music with lyrics. The best music for studying is instrumental or classical music, or just ambient noise. When you hear music with lyrics, like rap or country, your mind will focus on the words, meaning you aren’t paying as much attention to the cards you are supposed to be studying., It can be hard to study effectively when your mind is somewhere else. If you are trying to study, you should put down your phone, get off the computer and turn off the TV. It might even be helpful to set a timer, knowing that you should only be memorizing flash cards until that alarm goes off., If you can, try to move around a bit while reviewing your flash cards. It doesn’t have to be very far, just pacing a bit can help get your blood flowing. A quick walk around your bedroom or office should be enough. Even just standing in line at the coffee shop, or leaning against a wall can helpful, just something to get you up from your desk., Sometimes asking another person to help you is most effective, and a good way to keep you accountable. It can even be a person who has no idea about the subject, as long as he or she can read...a great job for younger siblings or your own kids!"

Accreditation is necessary for recognition by your employer as well as recognition by other higher education institutions (i.e., in case you want to pursue an advanced degree).;
, Find out up-front - before you pay an application fee exactly how much tuition is and make sure that you have a full picture of all costs including any access fees, texts, other required purchases,etc. You have to be positive you can afford the tuition costs. Keep in mind that many companies have strong tuition reimbursement options. Although online education is generally more affordable than a comparable campus-based education, it is not cheap, so make sure you get your money's worth and know exactly what you are enrolling for.

, Ask about their experience - either real-world or academic - and make sure they are worthy of educating you on the area you are pursuing. It is important that they have the knowledge necessary to do the job. As a point of reference, most associate or junior college teachers have at least a Master's degree in the subject they teach, and the majority of full college professors have a PhD. in their area of expertise. Your online education teachers should have comparable levels of education.

, Try to pin down at least a guideline for student-teacher ratios. Unlike classroom learning, it is possible to have an almost unlimited number of students in an online class, but obviously if the class size is enormous, you will not get the same sort of quality time with the teachers as you would in a smaller class. Making sure your teachers are not overburdened can help you get the education you deserve.

, Schools develop their reputations for producing quality students - who get the job done at the companies that hire them - over time, so for the most part, the longer the school has existed, the better.

, What is the total school enrollment and what percentage of students graduate? They should be able to tell you how many students are currently enrolled. A large amount of students shows both stability and future name recognition in the job market. Also, a higher graduation rate is a great indication that students are very satisfied with the programs at that school. Be leery if they do not share these data points with you.

, Most online classes require that students have access to a computer and may require certain levels of hardware in order to adequately handle and run up-to-date multimedia and word processing types of programs. They may also require certain levels of Internet access. So make sure your equipment is up to the task, or that you are budgeted for buying new equipment. In terms of software, many online programs provide all the materials you need directly from their site, but some may require you to buy supplemental software on your own.

, Top online degree programs offer great access to ""virtual libraries"" and other resources to help you through your education.

, The length of time required to earn your degree can vary widely in the online education world, so make sure you know exactly how long each program you are considering takes and determine which best fits in with your time frame. Some online schools will allow you to complete tasks at your own pace, while others require that students participate in virtual class sessions and have specific deadlines for assignments.

, You want to know if all communications are done online or if you can also call if you need help or have questions. Some schools even offer actual campus locations you can go to for certain classes, sessions or extra help. The more options available to you the better, but at a minimum, the school should have a legitimate phone number for you to reach them at.

,How to Memorize1,
"
Listen to this.,
Take a deep breath.,
Repetition is key.,
Take a short break.,
Check your memorization.,
Listen to yourself.,
Listen to others.,
Move around.",How to Memorize2," If you do best by hearing things, and can retain information that comes to you orally, you're probably an auditory learner. Here are some characteristics to help you determine if you are:


You remember, with great detail, information that you hear in conversations or lectures.
You have a well-developed vocabulary, an appreciation for words, and strong language skills, picking up new languages relatively easily.
You're a good speaker, and can carry on interesting conversations, articulating your ideas clearly.
You have musical talents, and the ability to hear tones, rhythms, and individual notes in a chord or an ensemble setting.

, Scan over your entire course/paper, so you know what you're going to be reading. If it's very long, break it into sections.


Investigate and note intuitive relationships between the elements and your own experience. This is called memorizing by association. The relationships don't need to be rational, only memorable (interesting, funny, enjoyable) and inspirational. If you're memorizing Article 1 of the US Constitution, for example, it begins, ""All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress...,"" you might imagine a congressman in a vest, with a power cord dangling out of his pocket.
Take the first letters of something you're trying to remember and create another acronym for it. For example, the anterior pituitary gland secretes six major hormones: TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), PCR (prolactin), and GH (growth hormone). They're tough to remember, but if you create an acronym out of the first letters of each hormone (for example, The Actor Fails Like Purple Gnomes), they all become much easier to remember.
Create a vivid story with the entities involved in what you're trying to remember. Making a story up with Belligerent Bob, Laconic Linda or Intrepid Ingrid can help you remember those tricky vocabulary words. It doesn't even have to make sense: again, as long as it tickles you somehow, you're liable to remember it.
Create a little or medium drawing that explains what you're trying to memorize! For example, if you want to memorize the definition of scientific inquiry, (which by the way is: The many ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence they gather) you would draw a little drawing of a scientist, someone proposing to someone, and a little folder that says evidence. The other little words like adverbs and verbs you write, next the drawing! Don't get messy, always draw and write in order.

, Use verbal and listening repetition to help you remember the order of things:


Read the first object.
Say it without the paper.
Read the first and second object.
Repeat them both aloud until you're able to say them without the paper.
Read the first, second, and third objects.
Say them aloud until you're able to remember them.
Repeat this process until you can say all the objects without the paper.
Once you're at the end of the list, repeat the list without reading it. Say it aloud three times.
If you cannot do it all three times, start over.

, It's important to keep your mind fresh, so once you think you have something roughly memorized, take a 20- to 30-minute break. Do something you enjoy that's easy to accomplish (i.e., something that doesn't involve a lot of learning) during that time, such as talking on the phone or taking a walk in the park. You're relaxing your brain and giving it time to encode what you just learned into your long-term memory. Excessive stimulation of new concepts and learning different things can interfere with that encoding process.

, After your break, test yourself again to see if you've still memorized everything. If you get it all right, you probably have it. If not, work on the sections you're having trouble with. Then take another short break and come back again.

, Record yourself saying what needs to be memorized once, then play it back to yourself while you sleep. Though this doesn't work well for teaching you new, unfamiliar information, the repetition in your sleep can help prime you to reinforce concepts you have already consciously acquired.


You can purchase or make a special headband that holds headphones from your MP3 or other audio player to your head as you sleep––this is commonly used by people who use relaxation music to help them sleep.

, If you can, and if it's permitted, try taping lectures to help you both fill in the gaps in your notes, and to hear the information presented again. Listening to it a second or third time can often be enough to cause the information to stick without much more effort.

, Pace around the room while studying and repeating the information to yourself. By walking around, you will use both your right and left brain and will memorize the material much easier.

Take a long hard look.,
Sit in a peaceful environment.,
Color code your information by type.,
Go through each color-coded section, writing and rewriting each item down until you can successfully memorize it all.,
Place a Post-It or index card on a location you frequently visit, such as your locker or your bedroom door.,
Frequently write and rewrite the notes.,
Find a partner to study with.,
Highlight the high points.,
Move around.",How to Memorize3," If things leap out at you visually and stick well, you're probably the type of person who collects information visually. If you see it, you can understand it. Ways that you find taking in information easier include:


Information on pictures, charts, or diagrams is much easier to remember than the same information presented to you verbally.
You visualize things as you learn them, often looking into the distance as if you are ""seeing"" the information.
You create vivid images of information in your mind. When learning the Articles of the Constitution, you may envision yourself in the room with the Founding Fathers as they discussed them.
Your spatial skills are very strong: sizes, shapes, textures, angles, perspectives—–these are all easy for you to grasp.
You're able to ""read"" people by their body language, knowing what they're really thinking, even as they say something else.
You're very aware of your environment, and have a strong appreciation for aesthetics, art, and other visual media.

, Go where there are no distractions, nothing that will visually catch your eye. Avoiding ""shiny objects"" will allow you to focus on what it is you need to memorize. That means no TV, open windows, or those cat clocks with the eyes that move back and forth.

, For example, if you're memorizing history notes, then color code them by dates or key people. George Washington is blue, Ben Franklin is orange, anything about the Revolution is red, King George is green, etc.

, Writing each item down on a matching-color Post-It note will not only help cement this association in your mind, it will help with the next step too.

, Read it every time you pass by. Align your notes by color, vertically, and horizontally. by time.

, When you go to your note board, look at an item, rewrite it on a fresh Post-It or card, and replace the existing one. If you are having particular difficulty with one of the existing notes, take the old note and put it somewhere else, where you will see it more often. Replace that one occasionally, too.

, Draw diagrams/graphs, write out explanations, and teach concepts to each other to help each of you better remember them.

, Look for important of key words depending on what you have to memorize, highlight them, remember them, then try to memorize the rest. If reading online PDFs, make use of the highlighting function for key points. This helps your memory, as well as fast recovery of information when searching through the document again.

, Pace around the room while studying and repeating the information to yourself. By walking around, you will use both your right and left brain and will memorize the material much easier.

If you like to touch things to obtain information, you are very likely the hands-on kind.,
Find your space.,
Be creative.,
Memorize abstracts.,
The tips for visual and auditory notes should help you too, especially learning by association and repeating concepts aloud as you pace around the room.",How to Memorize4," You like to feel the information, if at all possible, learning in the doing. Here are some characteristics of tactile learners:


You learn best when you are hands-on––moving, doing, and touching help make the information real to you.
You use your hands when you talk.
You remember events by what happened, but not necessarily what was said or seen.
You're good at drawing, art, cooking, construction—–things that require manual manipulation of objects.
You tend to be adventurous and easily distracted, finding it hard to stay put for long periods.
You don't like to be hemmed in, preferring to be where you can stand up, move around, and take a break.
You don't like sitting in classrooms when there are things you could do that would teach you more.

, You need room to move around, so don't sit in your bedroom with the door closed while you study. The kitchen table might be more suited for your style of learning.

, Act out or pretend to be the object, trying to mimic every detail of the object. If you're trying to memorize the Articles of the Constitution, grab a piece of paper, or better still, cut out a panel from a paper bag: it's more the size of the constitution, and doesn't look like a fresh piece of computer paper. It will also have a smell that you can associate with. Hold the paper in your hand as if it's the Constitution, and point at each phrase and ""read"" it from the ""Constitution."" You've engaged most of your senses—–touch, smell, sight, even hearing—–so you will have a much easier time remembering.

, If you're memorizing abstractions, such as the value of pi, write down the individual numbers or steps on each flash card. Then personalize each flash card with stickers or drawings. After personalizing, scramble the cards and attempt to put them in order. Be sure that you write down the order somewhere or you'll never remember what the sequence was.


Alternatively, you can grab a couple decks of cards; search for, and ""play"" each number after the decimal, in sequence: Ace, 4, ace, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, etc. Lay each one down, then flip them over. Go left to right, flip them face up again, and say the number. Repeat, and next pass say the number, then flip the card.

, Adapt the tips as needed so that you are interactive with your material.

Create a list of colleges in your area.,
Determine which colleges and universities on your list offer online degrees or distance learning.",How to Find the Top Online Degree Programs1," The Department of Education (“DOE”) offers a free College Navigator. This allows you to choose your area, major, and the type of program you are looking for (2-year, 4-year, or less than 2-years), and then generates a list of colleges that meet your requirements.;
, The best way to do this is to visit each institution’s website, which should provide a listing of all degree programs available. You can find each institution’s website using the College Navigator provided by the DOE. If an institution does not offer distance learning programs, cross it off your list.

Write down your priorities.,
Research different schools.,
Talk to professors and students.,
Plan a budget.",How to Earn a Masters Degree While Working1," If you are thinking about going to graduate school, you need to carefully select your program. You will be making a large financial investment, and also investing a lot of time. Your first step is to figure out your priorities.Make a list of what you want out of a Master's program. Are you looking for flexibility? Consider finding a program that is all or mostly online.
Are you looking for a program that will offer a lot of faculty-student connections? Write that down as a top priority.
Maybe you want to finish your degree as quickly as possible. Write down, ""Accelerated program"" at the top of your priority list.
Is reputation important to you? Make sure to list that a renowned school or program is a big factor in your decision.;
, Once you have listed your priorities, it is time to begin looking at individual programs. Make a list of schools in your area. If you are interested in an online program, you can include schools outside of your geographic area.Contact the school directly. You might need to contact various departments to find all of the information you want.
Talk to the admissions office. You can e-mail them with questions about the application process and requirements.
You can also e-mail the program that you are interested in. For example, if you are looking into an MBA, contact the School of Business and ask for information on course offerings and schedules.
Keep all of your information organized as you gather it. That will make it easier to compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each program.

, When you are in graduate school, it is important that you make connections with faculty and fellow students. You will need their support and advice. As part of your research process, reach out to current and past students.It will be helpful to get a perspective of a student in the program. Ask the department if they can put you in touch with a student who will be willing to speak to you.
Ask questions such as, ""How do you handle the workload? Do you find the material stimulating?""
You will also want to talk to a faculty member. You can send an e-mail with questions, or ask to set up a face-to-face appointment.
During your meeting, you can ask questions such as, ""Can you tell me about some of the projects that will be assigned? How often are faculty available to meet with students individually?""

, A Master's program can be very expensive. When you are selecting a program, make sure to take financial costs into account. Find out how much each graduate credit hour costs.Inquire about additional costs. For example, some schools charge more per credit hour for online courses.
Write down a financial plan. Figure out your monthly budget, and look for ways to cut costs so that you can afford school. For example, maybe you don't need to have cable while you are working on your degree.
Talk to your Human Resources department at work. Many companies will pay for at least part of the cost of a graduate degree.

Confidence.",How to Cope with Short Term Memory Problems," Many short-term memory problems can be attributed not so much to the ability of the brain, but the ability of the person to focus on a single task.If you've already forgotten the name of the nice gentleman who was just introduced to you not five minutes ago, it might not be only a memory problem. Were you really listening when you were introduced, or were you thinking ahead to what to say next? Instead, as you shake hands with the fellow, look him in the eye and repeat back the name out loud. Then, say it silently to yourself a couple of times (you'll probably have a few moments when you can tune out the small talk). Make a conscious, active effort to pay attention whenever you know you're likely to forget something., Whatever it is that you have to remember, commit it to writing. Use a white board, bulletin board, notebook, the palm of your hand, or any other format that helps. Write down your shopping list, your errands, your schedule, and even what you needed from downstairs, if you need to., In addition to writing down what you need to do, you can also ""draw"" it in your mind by visualizing yourself performing the task in as much detail as possible. If you need to remember to lock the door, for example, imagine yourself shutting the door and looking down at your hand on the doorknob. Then visualize yourself pulling the keys out of your pocket, hearing them jingle, inserting the key into the doorknob, locking the door, pulling the key out, and putting it back into your pocket. The more detailed your visualization, the more likely it will ""stick""., Leave items where they are visible and where you will see them until you do whatever needs to be done to them. This could mean things like placing things to go upstairs at the bottom of the stairs, putting bills and paper in a certain, conspicuous location until they are processed, or simply always feeding the cat before you make your own breakfast.
It may help to tie tasks to a particular day of the week or a particular activity you already do. For instance, if you have a cactus plant to water once every two weeks, water it on the same day you get your paycheck.
We all know how powerful habits can be, so why not use them to your advantage? Form habits to help keep you get things done subconsciously, so that you're not depending as much on your conscious mind to remember. Attach a new habit to an old habit, like taking your medication every time you brush your teeth.
Make routines. Write them down, too. Then, place a note or other cue in a prominent location until the new routine becomes habit. Every time you get home, place your keys in the same place. Every time you leave, make sure they are with you, along with any other items you place nearby.

, A tickler file is a file that is set up by date. Have folders or divisions in the file for each day of the month. When something arrives in your purview that requires your attention at a later date, place it in the tickler file for that date. Be sure to check your tickler file daily., Don't rely on your memory to tell you when to be where tomorrow, and certainly don't rely on it for next week or next month. Instead, write it down in the calendar of your choice and make a habit of checking it regularly. Keep one calendar for all your appointments. Don't keep one for business and another for personal dates., Computer programs and even websites are available that include such things as calendars that will remind you when the time comes and to-do lists. Of course, you must have access to the computer before you forget an item., Whether in a class, in a meeting, or simply for personal reasons, take notes. Even if you never reread them, often the act of writing something down will cause it to go through your brain. If you do need to look back, you'll have a record of it.

Keep a notebook, or keep one notebook for each general subject, project, or interest. Having different colors and even shapes and sizes will help you to keep different notebooks straight.
If you manage to take notes electronically, a desktop search engine, such as Google Desktop or Copernic, can help you find old notes based on keywords. That means you don't have to spend as much time carefully organizing.

, For example, if fresh vegetables get lost in the crisper drawers until they turn to mush, don't put them in the crisper drawers. Instead, hang them in clear bags or set them on the shelves up where you can see them.
If you need to have things piled on your desk to ensure that they get attention, go ahead and pile. Use baskets or trays if you'd like to make it look neater or keep some order to it.
If you must take certain sets of items with you when you go somewhere, leave them in a bag when not in use. Canvas tote bags and basic duffel bags are inexpensive (try any thrift store), and you can have one for music lessons and another for gym clothes.
Set things up so you don't have to remember. If you habitually leave your shoes by the bed at night, or by the door when you come in, place a basket, shelf, or rack in that spot and make that where you put shoes that are in use.

, If there is something you do routinely, write down that routine. It could be as basic as the order in which you prefer to get ready for work or school in the morning, or it could be as intricate as the procedure for getting a part of your job done. You can use an electronic checklist or place the checklist in a plastic sheet protector and use erasable markers to check things off., For instance, if you cook for your family, write down your menu plans. (Hint: you may be able to do this all at once for the month or even the year.) Then, stick to your plan. In this example, purchase just the groceries you need for the week (take your list!), then prepare those meals this week., Memory has a lot to do with confidence. If you think or believe that you have such a problem, it is likely to come up automatically even if it is not there. This applies especially while trying to remember something. Your lack of confidence would eventually lead to a state where you forget the habit of remembering. Develop confidence by appreciating yourself whenever you remember something you usually forget."

Learn what technology you’ll need for the course.,
Use the resources available to you.",How to Succeed in Distance Learning," Think of your syllabus as the bible for your class. It should contain all of the class guidelines and rules, as well as what your instructor expects from you over the course of the semester. Make sure you read through this document in its entirety and keep track of it all semester.Ask your instructor any questions you might have about the syllabus. Make sure you clearly understand what your responsibilities are as a student from the very beginning.
Knowing what to expect from your course will help you plan how to proceed in the course from day one. So it’s important to figure this out early on.;
, A big part of being successful in a distance learning course involves setting a schedule for yourself that you adhere to throughout the semester. You won’t have a teacher reminding you every day about due dates and reading assignments, so you’ll need to stay on top of this yourself.Create a schedule with all of your due dates listed and when you want to start working on each project so that you can plan your time accordingly.
It can be very easy to fall behind in a distance learning course if you don’t set a schedule for yourself.

, Distance learning courses take time – time that you must commit to spending without any outside encouragement from your teacher or classmates as you might get in a physical classroom setting. You are responsible for completing all of the work on your own time.College courses are said to take about two hours of work per week per credit hour (outside of class time). So a good rule of thumb if you are taking a distance course that’s three credit hours is to expect to spend about nine hours per week completing work for that course.Try to stay on top of your time/scheduling from the beginning. It can be very difficult to get caught up if you fall behind, especially if you’re taking more than one online class.

, Meeting class deadlines is crucial to success in a distance learning environment. Your instructor will expect you to manage your time and complete assignments on time, so they may be less flexible with extensions and less forgiving with your excuses.


If you miss a deadline, there are fewer excuses available to you than in a regular classroom because everything is submitted online.
It is assumed that you are tech-savvy enough to handle the online aspect of the class. And your teacher will receive a timestamp on everything you submit, so there’s no fudging about when you turned something in.

, Even though you may feel somewhat anonymous in an online classroom (as is the case in many online spaces), you are still required to behave as you would in any normal classroom setting. This means treating your professor and classmates with respect when you engage with them.Don’t air your grievances about the class online or exhibit anger in any form in a class discussion post. Your instructor will see these comments and it may negatively impact your grade.
Respond to your classmates’ posts with kindness and respect. You would want them to treat you the same way.

, You may not see your teacher in class every day, but they are still in charge of helping you through the course. If you have questions about an assignment or a subject, contact your teacher for guidance.Most distance learning professors will make themselves available to you via email, internal messaging through the classroom platform, or even via phone.
You may even be able to visit them in person if they hold office hours and you are near enough to the campus.

, Since distance learning doesn’t typically involve actual classrooms full of people engaging in conversations together, it’s important for you to participate in the online discussion posts instead. You will learn a lot from these conversations and you will probably be required to post a certain amount for credit in the course.Most distance learning classes allow the instructor to see how many times a student not only posts, but also whether or not they have even opened specific conversation/posting threads. Keep this in mind, especially if part of your grade is based on participation.
Remember that an online class gives your professor much more access to knowing just exactly what you’re doing in the course. In a traditional classroom setting, you may be able to avoid some of the work and fake it in class. But in an online class, your professor can see exactly what you’ve looked at, what you’ve read, how much time you spent, etc.

, One of the most important parts of learning in an online setting is engaging with your fellow learners. However, if you make your contribution (on discussion posts, project submissions, etc.) after the deadline, or after everyone else has already posted, then it is less likely that your classmates will read and respond to your comments. This cheats you out of a big part of the learning experience.


Also, if you are always commenting late, or at least after everyone else, your teacher will notice and this will probably affect your participation grade.
Participating late will decrease the learning experience of all of your classmates as well as decreasing your grade in the class.

, Successful distance learners do more than just memorize and regurgitate information. They think critically about what they’ve learned and how they can apply it to the real world or how it might be useful in their job.Relating what you learn in class to your real-world experience will help you internalize what you’ve learned in class which will help you be more successful in the future.

, While a college education can be an overwhelming thing to consider (especially if you think about it only in its totality), there are many smaller pieces that you can focus on as you go to make it seem less daunting. For a distance learning course, it’s important to set short-term goals that help you manage the course as a whole and your college career in general.


Short-term goals for a distance learning class might include completing a particularly difficult discussion post on time, achieving a certain grade on your paper, or learning one important thing every day.
Take it one class at a time and complete each step as you go. Before you know it, you’ll be close to the finish line!

, Many people who enroll in distance learning classes do so because they have many other obligations in their lives that prevent them from being able to attend regular in-person classes – often this is because of work commitments or family obligations. For people like this, it is important to think about not only your short-term goals for the course, but also to think ahead to what you want to get out of the class in general.While your short-term goals might include making a good grade on a particular assignment, your long-term goals should be geared more toward how completing this course will further your career, help you provide for your family, etc.
Long-term goals help you look at the bigger picture to see how this distance learning course is actually beneficial in your life.

, When you are working toward a college degree (especially if you are a person who finds it difficult to make it to regular classes), you should be very particular about what courses you spend your time and money on taking. Make sure that this course benefits your specific career goal or counts toward your declared major.


If you take classes that won’t work for the degree program you’re in, taking them is basically just a waste of time, energy, and money.
Figure out what classes you need, when they’re offered, and plan ahead so that you don’t encounter any unnecessary obligations related to scheduling or course requirements that could delay your graduation.

, There are many unscrupulous ""degree mills"" around in the market that are just interested in selling their degrees without necessarily providing a good education. Do proper background checks on the institutions you’re considering.


Carefully look at your prospective school’s website and read other online reviews about them to figure out what kind of school they are and how much these distance courses will cost you.
Talk to a current or past student of your prospective school and ask them specific questions you may have – about cost, credit transfers, degree to completion time, etc.

, Most distance learning institutions allow students to transfer their credits from courses they had taken from other colleges. So if you’ve taken college courses before, make sure you notify your new institution through the necessary channels. This way, you don't have to repeat what you have already learned.


This will also help you balance your work/family/school time since you’ll have fewer overall courses to take because of your transfer credit.
Additionally, you should make sure that credits from your prospective school are transferrable. You don’t want to waste your time taking a bunch of courses that you won’t be able to use if you end up having to transfer schools later.

, Most online courses don’t require a lot of special technology equipment to participate in the course. But you will probably need several different kinds of technology to be able to complete the class.Some items you will almost certainly need include a computer, regular access to the internet, and Adobe Acrobat viewer.
Your teacher may require some additional technology items that are specifically needed for the course. Make sure you find out what you’ll need ahead of time (these requirements should be listed in your course syllabus) so that you can determine whether or not you’ll be able to acquire the needed items.

, Try to take full advantages of the facilities provided by your online school. You are paying for these services through your tuition, so you may as well take advantage of them while you can.Resources available to you may include online libraries and resources, one-on-one attention with your instructors, and online sessions with tutors.
There may even be in-person facilities available to you for research, study, counseling, printing, and other services.

Create a schedule.,
Adjust to online learning.,
Succeed in your courses.,
Seek supportive relationships.",How to Earn a Masters Degree While Working2," Once you have started actively working on your Master's degree, you will want to make sure that you are a successful student. Going back to school can be an adjustment. When you are working full-time, it is crucial that you make a schedule so that you can devote the proper amount of time to your classes.Plan in advance. Read the syllabus for each of your courses when the class begins. Write down important dates on your calendar.
Schedule other things around critical times in the school year. For example, do not plan to go on vacation during midterms or finals.
Devote time to school almost every day. Successful students do not cram all of their learning into one day a week.
Even if your class just meets on Monday nights, make sure to schedule time throughout the week to work on it. For example, set aside time on Wednesday for starting the readings for the next class.

, Many Master's programs take place in an online setting. This is so that professionals like you can continue to work full-time while pursuing a degree. Online courses offer a lot of flexibility, but they can take some getting used to.Treat online classes seriously. Just because you may not have to physically attend class, you still need to be present.
Carefully read all of the requirements. Many online courses require you to interact with classmates through online discussion. You might also be required to be ""in"" the classroom for a certain amount of time each week.
Ask questions. If you are going back to school, you might be unfamiliar with online learning. Make sure to contact your professor with any questions that you have.
You can send an e-mail stating, ""I am unclear on how to access the resources mentioned in the syllabus. Could you please point me in the right direction?""

, A graduate program might consist of online courses, in-person courses, or a mixture of both. Whatever the structure, you want to make sure to find a way to succeed in each of your classes. Take steps to find a learning method that is right for you.Read for information. Master's programs frequently require a large amount of reading. Practice carefully reading the introduction and conclusion of each article or book, and skimming the rest to find the information that you need.
Reflect on the material. This material should be information that you will find useful in your career.
Don't just memorize material for a test and then forget. Take time to think about ways you can actually implement what you are learning in your job.
Try different study strategies. For example, maybe you will find that you do your best work early in the morning. Start setting your alarm an hour earlier each day.

, Try to make friends with other students. Graduate programs can be very stressful. You will find it useful to get to know others who are in the same situation.Form a study group. Try sending an e-mail to the class asking if anyone is interested in joining a weekly group.
Socialize after class. If you are in a night class, ask the students sitting around you if they want to grab a bite to eat. You'll enjoy school more if you can socialize and relax a bit.
Find a faculty mentor. If the department doesn't assign you an adviser, ask one of you professors if they would informally mentor you.
Ask your mentor to help you figure out which classes to take. Your mentor can also offer you advice on future career moves.

Talk to your boss.,
Continue to perform well at work.,
Communicate with your family.,
Life a healthy lifestyle.,
Relax.",How to Earn a Masters Degree While Working3," When you are earning a Masters degree while working, you will need to actively balance your career and school commitments. Once you have decided to pursue a degree, it is important to have a conversation with your boss. Schedule a time to address your questions or concerns.Tell your boss that you are pursuing a graduate degree in your field. Ask how this will affect your career path.
You can ask specific questions. Try saying, ""Will there be a raise once I have earned a Master's degree?""
Ask for flexibility. If your night class starts at 6, you might find that you need to leave work a little early on those days.
Tell your boss, ""I need to leave early a few days a week. Please understand that the information I am learning will help make me a more effective team member here at Business Corp.""

, Earning a Master's degree is hard work. School will take up a lot of your time and mental energy. However, it is important to remain committed to your career throughout the process.Recognize that you might need to make sacrifices. For example, weekends might not just be days off from work anymore. You might need them to work on your school projects.
If you are having trouble finding balance, talk to your boss. Ask for suggestions on how you can remain an effective contributor while giving attention to your coursework.
Use your vacation time wisely. While it might be tempting to use PTO to take of for a weekend vacation, it might be better to save those days to use during finals week.
Apply what you are learning. You don't have to wait to have your degree to begin using your new skills. For example, if you learned about a new accounting system, ask your boss to let you demonstrate your new found knowledge.

, Balancing school and work can be difficult. Finding time for your family and friends can seem even more impossible while you are earning a degree. Take some time to talk to your family about the situation.Explain your motivations. For example, you can say to your spouse, ""I may have less time for fun right now. Please know that I am doing this to further my career so that I can better provide for us.""
Ask for support. You can say to your friends, ""I really appreciate you sticking by me even though I'm so busy lately.""
Make time for the important things in life. You might have to stay up late or get up early to fit everything in, but do make time to attend your child's soccer game.

,How to Use Constrained Writing to Send a Secret Message1,
"
Think of what you want to encode.,
Break the word or phrase down into letters.,
Write a sentence for each letter.,
Check your code.",How to Use Constrained Writing to Send a Secret Message2," Before you can create a coded message, you will need to think of the message itself. You can encode any word or phrase using an acrostic code. However, you should try to keep your messages short. Longer messages can be difficult to encode and may be noticed by people that shouldn't see them.For example, you might want to hide a message like “HELP IN DANGER”
You would likely want to avoid a message like “PLEASE HELP ME I AM IN DANGER”.

, Building an acrostic will require you to break down each word into its individual letters. These letters will be inserted into a larger body of text. It's important that you use each letter of your phrase or word in the acrostic code.If you wanted to hide the word “HELP”, you would need to use H, E, L, and P in your message.
Make sure you don't miss any letters, as this can change the code. For example, missing the letter L in “HELP” would result in the code reading “HEP”.

, Now that you have each letter of your word ready, you can begin building the code. Every letter will have its own sentence written after it. The code will be revealed by reading each first letter of every sentence. Make sure each letter is included in the document you are creating to ensure the code will be readable. As an example, imagine that you are trying to encode the word “HELP”.
Your first sentence would have to start with the letter H. “How is everyone at home?” would be a good choice.
The next sentence would need to start with the letter E. “Everything still going well in town?” could be used in this case.
Continue in this way until the message is fully encoded.
It's important that your sentences and message don't draw attention to the encoded message. Keep your tone and content neutral and natural.

, Complete the acrostic code and double check it. You will want to make sure that each letter of your original phrase or word is included. Every sentence in your document should start with a letter from your original message. If you read the first letter of each sentence, you should find your original message.If you missed any letters, add them to your encoded message to make sure it's readable.
Make sure you didn't add any sentences that aren't part of the code. This could change the meaning of the original message you were trying to encode.
“How is everyone at home? Everything still good? Looking forward to coming back. Please take care of my dog until then!” would be an example of encoding the word “HELP” using the acrostic method.

"
"
Consider which word you want to encode.,
Focus on key-rows.,
Think of words with exceptional letters.,
Spell your code out with odd letters.",How to Use Constrained Writing to Send a Secret Message3," Before you can use this method to create a coded message, you'll need to know what you want to encode. You can choose almost any word you might want. However, it's a good idea to favor shorter messages, as longer codes may be more difficult to create.

, The keyboard code method works by using one row of keys at a time. The message itself is spelled out using letters from different rows on the keyboard. These different letters will build the message and keep it hidden amongst seemingly normal words. Check out some of these examples to get a good understanding of the keyboard code:


There are three rows on the keyboard, one starting with Q, the next starting with A and the last starting with Z.
You will need to think of words that use only one row of letters, with the exception of the letter you are using to build your code.
You will spell out your code one letter at a time, hiding it in another word.

, This method works by spelling a word with one row of keys, with only the coded letter being on a different row. Words that have this quality in your document will be focused on, taking the odd letter from each code word to rebuild your original message. To get a better understanding of how this works, check out these examples:


“Terra” would hide the letter A. T, E and R are all in the top row of the keyboard while the letter A is in the second row. Because letter A isn't part of the row the other letters are, it stands out and is read as part of the coded message.
“Rag” “art” “now” would hide the code word RAN.

, Once you have some words to use for this method, you can encode your entire message using the keyboard code. It's important to remember that you don't need to use every word to build your code. Only words with an odd letter out of one row will be read as part of the code. Make sure your key codewords correctly spell out your message before sending it out.


“Don't rag on me so much. Writing things is an art. Now, send me another message.” would encode the word RAN. The keywords are the rug, art, and now and they hide the letters r, a, and n.
Only the words using the keyboard code will be decoded.
Not every word will be part of the code. In fact, many words in your document will not be used as part of the code.
Be careful not to accidentally include words that might be part of the code. Use only words that are made on one row of keys or all three, if they aren't part of the code.

"
"
Consider a word you want to encode.,
Start writing.,
Include misspellings to hide your message.,
Check your code.",How to Use Constrained Writing to Send a Secret Message4," The first step that you will need to take is to think of a word or phrase that you want to encode. This keyword or phrase will be one that you need to keep secret, encoding it in a larger document using spelling errors. Anyone reviewing your message will likely overlook simple spelling errors and let your message slip through.


Try to keep you message simple and short. “SEND HELP” would be a good example.
Messages such as “PLEASE HELP ME I'M IN DANGER” might be too long or too difficult to hide using the spelling error code.

, Much of the letter you send using this method will look completely normal. Write your letter as you normally would, using your natural writing style and voice. It's important to remember that you will need to spell every regular word normally to make this method work. Any actual spelling errors could change your message.

, You will need to hide your message by spelling it out using spelling errors. These incorrect letters will be read one-by-one, building your message and deciphering the code. Think about how you can spell words in your message incorrectly to hide your message.


Imagine you want to hide the word “RUN” in your document.
“Terrific! Nevur have been there. Another day perhaps?” would encode the word RUN using spelling errors. The letter R is missing from ""terrific"", the letter U is used instead of E in ""never"" and the word ""another"" has an extra letter N.
Try to space out your spelling errors. Make them look like actual mistakes.
Don't randomly place letters that wouldn't naturally be mistaken. For example, “I saw a ghost” would likely stand out too much, if trying to include the letter Z in your message.

, Before you send your code off, make sure your message is properly encoded. Each spelling error should build your coded message and allow the recipient to decipher the code. If everything is in order, you can send your message off and await a reply.


If you missed any letters that make up your code, go back and add them in.
It's important that you spell everything else correctly. Accidental misspellings will change the message.

"
"
Use multiple methods.,
Try breaking other codes.,
Keep the message natural.,
Reply using the same code.,
Practice codes before hand.",How to Use Constrained Writing to Send a Secret Message5," You can try using multiple coding methods to hide different messages in your note. These can act as added layers of security, stopping anyone from discovering sensitive parts of your message. Try combining a few of these coding methods in your documents or letters to help keep your messages secret.


You can combine ciphers with other code methods to increase the security of your message.You might use the acrostic method to hint at the real message which was encoded using the spelling error code. You could try writing ""SPELLING ERRORS"" with an acrostic code to indicate the another message using the spelling error code.
You could try encoding half the message with the keyboard method and the other with the acrostic method.
Try encoding the first letter of a word with one code method and the next letter with another method. Keep alternating codes, using both coding methods, to build a more secure message.

, Spending some time breaking coded messages can give you a better understanding of how codes work. You'll be able to learn what works well or how someone might be able to break your own codes. Try working with a friend to try and break each others codes, allowing your secret messages to stay secret., Whenever you are encoding a message into a larger document, it's important that you keep your overall document natural in tone and writing. Any irregularities could draw attention to your message, causing your code to be broken and intercepted. It's important that your messages always look and read as if they were nothing special.

, If you receive a message using a certain code, you should reply using that same code. Sending a different code might make the original sender think that you missed the message and may cause them to miss your own message. Always communicate using the established code method to ensure the messages are passed clearly.


Ciphers will require you and a contact to use the same cipher., Coming up with a coded message system after it becomes necessary can be difficult. For this reason, it's a good idea to establish which codes you will use and how they will be used before it becomes an issue. This will allow you to more easily encode, decode, and return secret messages in any situation.

Some codes require you to share them with a friend. For example, if you and a friend were using a cipher wheel, you would both need to know the what cipher you are using to decode the message.Get in plenty of practice using your method of choice.
You and a friend can practice both send and receiving coded messages to each other.

Look the barcode up online for most 12-digit barcodes.,
Understand bar code basics.,
Learn how to interpret the barcode if the first digit is a 3.,
Understand barcodes with a first digit of 2.,
Learn about the final digit.",How to Read 12 Digit UPC Barcodes1," The UPC system encodes only the manufacturer's identity and an identification number for the specific product, except in certain cases described in the following steps. More typically, no additional information is included in the UPC system, so there is nothing to gain by attempting to read the barcode yourself. Instead, look it up online using free services such as GTIN's, the official U.S. bar code assignment company, or upcdatabase.org, which is a database created by users. Enter the full 12-digit barcode in the ""GTIN"" or ""Search for a product"" fields, respectively.


There are a couple exceptions described immediately below this step, in which you can find partial information.
GTIN refers to the data system UPC is a part of, short for Global Trade Item Number.12 digit UPC numbers can be referred to as GTIN-12, UPC-A, or UPC-E.;
, While the 12 digit barcode doesn't contain much human-readable information, you can still learn about how it functions. The first 6–10 digits of a 12-digit barcode identify the company that manufactures or sells the product (either company may choose to add a barcode). This code is assigned and sold by a non-profit organization, GS1, upon request.The remaining digits, except for the very last one, are invented by that company to describe each of its products.


For example, a company might be assigned the code 123456. It can then print any 12-digit barcode that begins 123456, creating one for each product. Compare two barcodes from the same company to see whether you can figure out what the company code is.
The purpose of the final digit is explained later on in this section.

, Drugs, pharmaceutical products, and occasionally beauty products usually have bar codes beginning with 3. The next 10 digits are typically the U.S. National Drug Code number. The process of turning a drug code into a barcode can result in ambiguity, so you may not always be able to check against a drug code listing. Instead, look up the drug code on an online NDC lookup.


This type of 12-digit number is sometimes referred to as a UPN, or Universal Product Number.Although drug codes are always 10 digits long, they may also include hyphens (or spaces), which are not shown in the barcode. For example, 12345—678—90 and 1234—567—890 are different drug codes, but only one of them can use the same sequence of numbers as a barcode.

, These barcodes are for items sold by weight. Typically, the first six digits, including the 2, identify the product's manufacturer, and the next five after that are used locally by the store or warehouse to identify the weight of the product, or the price of a particular weight. If you have several products from the same location but in different weights, you may try to figure out the codes for specific weights. Unfortunately, the system is up to each warehouse or store, so there is no universal code to interpret.


Type the entire barcode into GSI's company lookup, in the ""GTIN"" field, to find the manufacturer. This will also show you which part of the barcode is the company prefix (typically the first six digits, but not always). The remaining digits (except for the very last one) should be the code used to denote weight or price.

, The final digit is called the ""check digit,"" and is automatically determined by putting the previous 11 digits through a mathematical formula. The purpose of this is to catch printing errors. While fake UPC barcodes do exist, usually created by companies who don't understand that they need to apply for one, it would be easy to include the correct check digit, so this is likely not a reliable method of finding fakes. (For that purpose, look it up in the official database instead.) If you're curious or enjoy doing math for fun, you can enter your barcode into a GTIN-12 check digit calculator, or follow the checking formula yourself:


Add all the odd-numbered digits together (the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th digits)
Multiply the result by 3
Add the new result to all the even digits (the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th) - this includes the check digit itself
""Chop off"" everything except the final digit of your answer, the number in the ones place.
Subtract the new result from 10 to find your answer. For example, if the previous step resulted in an answer of 8, you would calculate 10-8=2. This answer should be the same as the final 12th digit of the barcode.

Differentiate nouns and pronouns.,
Identify verbs.,
Distinguish between modifiers.,
Spot conjunctions.,
Recognize prepositions.",How to Practice Parts of Speech Using Scrabble1," Identify nouns as words that denote a thing or person (such as man, sky, clothes, teacher, friend). Recognize pronouns as words that take the place of nouns (he, she, they, it, some, others). For example:Take the sentence “The man was both my teacher and friend.” Man, teacher, and friend are all nouns.
However, if you were to say, “He was both my teacher and friend,” teacher and friend would still be nouns, while he is a pronoun since it is taking the place of man.;
, Recognize these as the words that either denote an action or a state of being within a sentence. When a verb is active, it describes what a noun does. When it describes a state of being, it links the noun to another word that describes the noun’s state of being. For instance:In the sentence, “The man teaches,” teach is an active verb describing what the noun man does. In “The man is a teacher,” is links the man to teacher to denote his state of being.

, These include adverbs, adjectives, and determiners, which modify or further describe another part of speech. Spot adverbs as those words that modify a verb within a sentence, while adjectives and determiners describe nouns. With adjectives and determiners, spot the difference between the two by what attribute is being applied to the noun. Determiners always quantify a noun, while adjectives attribute other characteristics.Adverbs: In the sentence, “Our substitute teacher spoke passionately about a few subjects,” the adverb passionately describes how the teacher spoke, with spoke being the verb.
Adjectives: In the same sentence, the adjective substitute further describes the noun teacher to distinguish that particular teacher from the class’s usual instructor.
Determiners: The noun subjects, meanwhile, is quantified by the determiner few to indicate that the substitute teacher spoke about more than one subject.

, This part of speech joins together two separate words or clauses within a sentence. It can also combine two full sentences in one longer sentence. For example:Words: Take the sentence “The man teaches passionately and thoroughly.” The conjunction and connects passionately and thoroughly, indicating that both adverbs are modifying the verb teaches.
Clauses: In the sentence “The man teaches passionately, which was evident in today’s lesson,” the conjunction which links the independent clause “the man teaches passionately” to the dependent clause that follows it.
Sentences: In “The man is passionate about teaching, and you could see that in today’s lesson,” the conjunction and connects what could have been two separate sentences. But by joining them together, it emphasizes the link between each one’s meaning.

, These words link a noun to another that adds meaning to that noun. For example, consider the sentence “Our teacher gave us a quiz on biology.” Here, the preposition on links the noun quiz to biology, which in turn specifies what subject the quiz was on."

Start with a portmanteau.,
Borrow from other languages.,
Turn an object into a verb.,
Take suggestions from a small child.",How to Create a Made Up Word1," If you’ve tried your hand at creating a word from scratch but haven’t had much luck, you may want to consider a portmanteau. A portmanteau is a word or morpheme whose form and meaning are derived from a blending of two or more distinct forms (as smog from smoke and fog) .


Write down some of your favorite words on a piece of paper. Spend some time mixing and matching the words together. You’ll be surprised by all of the fabonderful (fabulous + wonderful) words you come up with.;
, There are a plethora of words to choose from when you expand your search to those found in other languages. Loanwords, or borrowings, are words which are adopted into a native language from a different source language. Such borrowings have shaped the English language almost from its beginnings Buy or borrow a Spanish, French, German or Italian dictionary. Highlight some of your favorite words and then write them down on a sheet of paper. You’ll want to modify the words slightly, as the intention isn’t to use the same word, but to create your own.
Rent a movie in a different language. Don’t use the captions and listen as the actors speak. Have a pen and paper on hand and write down what you think the words are that are being spoken.

, ""Google (it)"" has quite literally been transformed from a company name, into a verb. There are no shortage of objects or nouns that can also be repurposed with a bit of imagination.


To start, try spotting objects around your house and use them in a sentence as a verb. Don't expect everything to catch on, but over time, you may find one that will be a hit.

, Inspiration for new words can be found in surprising places. One such place is in your own family. Young children, who are learning how to speak, often don’t get it right on the first try. They create their own language as they navigate the English language.


Ask your young child what their favorite word is. If they are able to write, have them write it down. Otherwise, do your best to spell out what they are saying.
Listen to the babbling of your baby. You’ll be surprised how many words you come up with in a short amount of time.

Understand this method.,
Find the three sets of longer lines.,
Identify the four widths of the bars.,
Write down the thickness of the left hand bars.,
Do the same for the right-hand side, but start with a black bar.,
Decode the bar widths into actual numbers.,
Check your result.",How to Read 12 Digit UPC Barcodes2," Although barcodes are designed to be ""read"" by scanners and interpreted by computers, it is possible with practice to look at a UPC barcode and translate it into a 12-digit number. This is rarely useful, especially since the 12 digits are usually printed beneath the bars, but you could learn it as a neat trick to show your friends or coworkers.


Barcodes using non-UPC systems or different numbers of digits cannot be read using this method. Most barcodes on products sold in the U.S. and Canada are UPC barcodes, but be wary of compressed 6-digit UPC barcodes, which have a different, more complex encoding system.

, The barcode should be divided into three sections by sets of slightly longer lines. Look at the bottom of the vertical bars: some of the lines should extend further down than the others. There should be two longer lines at the beginning, two in the middle, and two at the end. These are there to help a barcode scanning machine read the bar code, and do not get interpreted as numbers.However, they still have a purpose in this method: the bars to the left of the central longer lines get read slightly differently than the bars on the right. This is explained in detail below.

, Each vertical bar (black or white) can have one of four different widths. Going from thinnest to thickest, these will be described as widths 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the rest of this method. Using a magnifying glass if necessary, try to figure out the differences in the line widths. Telling the difference between two lines of similar widths can be the hardest part of reading a bar code.


Don't confuse this for the actual numbers you're trying to find, the numbers 1 through 4 only describe the width of the bars.

, Start with the bars on the left hand side, between the longer bars on the left and the longer bars in the center. Begin with the first white bar on the left hand side, and measure the thickness of each bar, black and white. Each digit in the 12-digit number you're trying to find is encoded using four bars. Write down the thickness of each bar, dividing them into four-bar groups. When you reach the extra-long center bars, you'll have six groups of four digits each.


For example, if the first white bar after the extra-long lines on the left hand side is the thinnest size, write down 1.
Next, if the black bar to the right is the thickest size, write down 4.
Once you've done this for four bars (black and white), leave a space before writing down the next bar. For example, once you've written down ""1422,"" move your pen to a new line before writing down the next bar width.

, Do not decode the extra-long bars in the center. Starting with the first normal-length black bar to the right of them, use the same technique. This time, each group of four bars (representing one digit) will have a black-white-black-white pattern. Stop when you have six additional groups of four digits each, and do not decode the extra-long bars on the right.

, Now that you have figured out which bars (of different widths) correspond to each number, all you need is to know the code that translates these into the actual digits in the 12-digit number. Use the following instructions to do so:3211 = 0

2221 = 1

2122 = 2

1411 = 3

1132 = 4

1231 = 5

1114 = 6

1312 = 7

1213 = 8

3112 = 9

, If the numbers are printed beneath the bar code, read them to see whether you made any mistakes. You can also look up the product in the GTIN database, typing in the 12-digit barcode you found into the ""GTIN"" field. This should find any product from a company that was officially assigned a barcode, although sometimes companies mistakenly print their own barcodes that aren't added to the system. Still, most of the time, this database should come up with a product name that matches the item you are looking at, if you read the barcode correctly.

Focus on one part of speech.,
Permit more than one part of speech if you run out of words.,
Make players apply each word.",How to Practice Parts of Speech Using Scrabble2," For each game played, choose one part of speech to concentrate on. Instruct all players that only words belonging to this one type will be accepted. Favor this style of play at first with beginners who are unfamiliar with grammar so they can start identifying words that belong to each group.

, Anyone who has played Scrabble knows that sometimes you end up with letters that don’t form any words. Expect the risk of this to potentially rise when you limit the number of acceptable words. To avoid this, establish one part of speech to focus on, but accept others when players are unable to spell out words that satisfy the game’s primary focus.


Avoid cluttering up the board with all nine parts of speech. Keep things concise by allowing only one or two to be used as a fallback. Favor those you have already covered so you can reinforce that area of study without straying off-topic with lessons on brand new material.
Mandate that each player must announce when they intend to play any part of speech other than the one they’re supposed to be focusing on. Avoid confusing other players, who may not realize when a fallback part of speech is played instead of the primary one.

, Keep in mind that some words satisfy more than one part of speech.For example, take “poor,” which can be used as both a noun (“the poor”) and an adjective (“the poor woman”). To ensure that players learn how to correctly apply and identify parts of speech, have them use each played word in a sentence. You can either:


Only accept a word if the person who played it correctly identifies its part of speech (if you’re allowing more than one) and/or uses it correctly in a sentence.
Supply all players with paper and writing utensils so that everyone can compose a sentence using that word.

"
"
Focus on “doubles.” Remember that many words can be used in two or more parts of speech.Consider the word “say” for instance, which can be used as either a noun (“We all have a say in this”), a verb (“What do you say?”), or an interjection (“Say, did you hear that?”) Address this by making such words the object of the game.,
Play all nine parts of speech.,
Pair appropriate parts of speech.,
Delve further into each part of speech.",How to Practice Parts of Speech Using Scrabble3,"


Instead of designating a single part of speech as the focus, instruct players to only spell words that can be used for more than one.
Have each player identify as many parts of speech as they can for each word they play.
Allow others to identify any parts of speech that the player might have missed.

, Allow everyone to play whatever words they are able to spell out. However, to keep this from devolving into a regular old game of Scrabble, make identification a key component of the game. Only accept words if the player is able to correctly identify the part of speech they belong to. Since some words satisfy more than one, decide whether to:


Accept each word as long as one part of speech is correctly identified.
Insist that all possible parts of speech for each word are named.
Allow others to identify parts of speech that the player left unmentioned.

, Establish one part of speech as the foundation of the game. In addition to this, also permit other parts of speech that describe or modify it. For example, say you select adjectives as the foundation. Once an adjective is on the board (let’s say it’s the word “written”), permit players to build on it with adverbs that modify or describe that adjective (like “well” or “hastily”).


Only accept additional parts of speech if they connect directly with the word they’re describing. For instance, if both “wide” and “written” are on the board, accept “well” only when it’s built off of the word “written,” since the phrase “well wide” doesn’t make any sense.
Have each player identify the part of speech for each word they play. Avoid confusing other players who may not realize when an adverb is played instead of an adjective.

, Designate a single part of speech to focus on, as you would with a game for beginners. However, instead of immediately accepting any word that satisfies that part of speech, only do so if the player can correctly identify its subtype. For example, say you pick conjunctions. These are broken into three main types:


Coordinating conjunctions join words, phrases, and clauses together (“The boy and girl ran up the hill;” “The boy ran up the hill and walked back down;” “The boy ran up the hill, and then he walked back down.”)Subordinating conjunctions link a dependent clause to an independent clause (“If it rains, I’ll stay inside;” “When it rains, I’ll go inside;” “Because it rained, I went inside.”)
Correlative conjunctions consist of a pair that only work with each other. For example, “whether” only works with “or” (“I don’t know whether we’ll go or stay”), never “and” or “but.” Depending on which word you play, it may satisfy more than one type (“or,” for instance, is also a coordinating conjunction).

"
"
Adjust the rules as you see fit.,
Decide how to score.,
Build words in new ways.,
Add extra tiles to the bag.",How to Practice Parts of Speech Using Scrabble4," Playing Scrabble is an excellent tool for learning, but be aware that the official rules may limit its usefulness. Consult the rules beforehand and change them however you wish in order to expand its potential. For instance:


Each player is only supposed to have seven letter tiles per turn.However, in the interest of increasing vocabulary, you may wish to increase the number of tiles per player.
Official rules forbid abbreviations, hyphenated words, and those that are always capitalized. But say you’re playing adjectives. The adjective “worn” can be built on to become the adjective “worn-out,” as in “a worn-out pair of sneakers.”
You’re only supposed to check the dictionary in the event that a word is challenged. But let’s say you’re asking players to identify all the parts of speech that one word satisfies. In this case, you may want to check it regardless, just in case there’s one that no one has thought of on their own.

, Traditionally, Scrabble scores are determined by adding up the points of each letter tile used to form one or more words per turn, with additional points given for using all seven tiles and/or placing tiles on colored squares that award more points.However, as with other official rules, expect this standard to potentially limit the educational benefits of the game. Consider instead:


Eliminating points altogether (especially for beginners) or only awarding a single point for each word formed per turn.
Awarding an extra point for identifying additional parts of speech that a given word may double as.
Allowing all players to compose a sentence using each played word according to its part of speech, and awarding an extra point for correct usage.

, Technically, there are only two ways to build words in Scrabble: either by adding letters to a word that’s already on the board (like turning “walk” into “walked”), or by using a letter in that word to build a new one alongside it, as long as the two are either parallel with each other or at right angles. If you’re playing with beginners, try adjusting these rules to allow more play. Consider:


Placing new tiles on top of existing ones, such as placing “T” on top of “W” to turn “walk” into “talk.”Allowing tiles to be placed on the board diagonally instead of just vertically and horizontally.

, Expect each Scrabble bag to contain 100 letter tiles, with a set number of tiles for each letter. For example, there are twelve E’s per bag, but only one Q.Depending on the part of speech you’re playing, the limited number of certain letters may further restrict the number of words that can be played. To get around this, purchase one or more replacement bags to beef up the total number of tiles available. Then either:


Add key letter groups from the replacement bag to the original bag before playing (for example, adjectives often use the suffix “-ive,” while adverbs often use “-ly”).
Grant each player an extra number of complete letter groups before the game begins so everyone has equal opportunity to use them.
Add extra blank tiles to the original bag. You can also allow these to stand in for hyphens and periods as well as letters if hyphenated words and abbreviations are allowed.

Understand how words are created.,
Hyphenate two word phrases (think of ""see you,"" which became, ""cya!"").,
Have fun brainstorming!",How to Create a Made Up Word2," This will give you a basis for making up your own word. English words are formed in several ways. Although one way is to create them from scratch, other words have been formed by imitating sounds. Similarly, there are many more words, often in quite common use, that have arisen over time because someone has not heard the word correctly. Next time you don't understand someone correctly, turn a potentially embarrassing situation, into a learning opportunity by creating a new word.
Find inspiration at home. Listen to sounds naturally found around your home. You may be surprised by how many words you can come up with just by turning off the TV and listening to the environment. Open up your window and let in the sounds from outside.

, You may need to do a bit of tweaking to the spelling, as was done with ""cya,"" but try to think of phrases you can combine in to one word.


Write down some of your favorite two or even three word phrases. See if you can create one word.

, More than anything, creating a made up word is supposed to be fun. Don’t worry about taking yourself too seriously. If you discover a great new word, share it with your friends and family and have fun using the word together.


To spread the word (pun intended), try using the word in a sentence, but be consistent.
Your new word will also need a definition, so have one on hand in case others ask you about it. This will help them understand how to use the word as it was intended.

Learn the meaning of the basic signals.,
Look over the Morse Code alphabet.,
Sound out each signal.,
Come up with clever word associations.,
Start forming basic words and letters.,
Listen to Morse Code recordings.,
Copy children’s books.,
Write to yourself in Morse Code.,
Get help from a friend.,
Download a Morse Code training app.,
Attend a Morse Code class.,
Invest in an audio learning course.",How to Learn Morse Code," Morse Code is comprised of two different signal units—dots and dashes. Your first objective will be learning to recognize these units as they appear in text. Dots look like simple periods, whereas dashes are long horizontal lines similar to hyphens. Every character in the English language can be represented using these two signals.In the official terminology of Morse Code, dots are called “dits,” pronounced with a short “i” sound and a silent “t.”
Dashes are formally known as “dahs,” with a short “a” sound.;
, Scan the Morse Code alphabet and refer to it when attempting to decipher single characters. As you go through the alphabet, make a note of each individual letter or numeral, then recite its corresponding dit-dah combination out loud. With time, you’ll be able to recall bits of code reflexively based on both their sound and appearance.Though the Morse Code alphabet is a helpful resource, most accomplished users recommend learning the system by its sounds rather than the way it's represented in text. This greatly simplifies the process by getting rid of the extra step of referencing the way the signals look when written out.A downloadable reproduction of the Morse Code alphabet can also be found at the bottom of this article.

, Practice saying dits and dahs aloud in the correct rhythm. Dits make a short, single-syllable sound. Dahs are more drawn out, and should last approximately three times as long as dits when pronounced. This fast and slow rhythm is how individual units are distinguished in Morse Code.Pay attention to the spacing between words and letters. Each letter should be separated by a space equal to one dash, while complete words should be separated by the space of seven dots. The more meticulous your spacing is, the more likely it is that your message will be understood.
It is generally faster to learn Morse Code by sound rather than sight, since it allows you to forego the process of counting up dits and dahs., Word association can be a valuable tool in helping you keep track of letters and numerals in Morse Code. For instance, you could link the letter “C” in your memory to the word “catastrophic,” which begins with a “C”, contains the same number of syllables and even has the same syllabic emphasis. Other examples include “mailman” for “M” and “gingerbread” for “G.”


Devise your own word associations that will help link sequences of signals with their related sounds naturally in your mind.
Jot down a few word associations in a notebook and study them while getting the hang of reciting each letter out loud.

, The simplest letters to begin with are the ones that are represented by a single dit or dah. One dit, for instance, makes the letter “E,” while one dah makes “T.” From there, you can move on to two dits (“I”) and two dahs (“M”) and so on. Solidify your knowledge of elementary characters before putting together more complex sequences.Two and three letter words (""me"" = - - . ) (""cat"" = -.-. .- - ) will be easiest to commit to memory when you’re first getting a feel for the format.
The sequence for the distress call “SOS” ( . . . - - - . . . ) should be one of the first things you learn, as it could potentially save your life in an emergency situation., Look up recordings of Morse Code messages that will give you a sense of how communication is carried out using the system. Pay attention to the pauses between each character as well as the characters themselves. If need be, slow the playback of the recording to make each signal easier to pick out.An extensive collection of Morse Code recordings are available for listening practice in the archives of the American Radio Relay League.If you own a ham radio, tune into HF frequencies to get a taste of the real thing.Purchase practice recordings to receive instruction that’s tailored to your comprehension level. ""Morse Code Teacher"" by Gordon West is a good place to start.

, Children’s storybooks are full of terse, simple language that are perfect for practicing Morse Code as a beginner. Go through the books page-by-page, translating the brief sentences into code. The system was designed to convey uncomplicated messages, so as a training exercise these types of books can come in handy.


When you’re just getting started, use books aimed at first time readers, such as “Fun with Dick and Jane.” These books are known for their famously simple sentences (""See Spot run. Run, Spot, run!"" = ... . . ... .--. --- - .-. ..- -. .-.-.- .-. ..- -. --..-- ... .--. --- - --..-- .-. ..- -. )
This is a useful strategy for helping you meet speed goals. For instance, if you’re attempting to copy five words per minute and there’s about ten words on each page, you should strive to complete each page in roughly two minutes., End a study session by copying out a few random words and phrases, then jumble them up and translate them at the beginning of the next session. This will help reinforce your knowledge by allowing you to see and interpret the same characters repeatedly. Keep your vocabulary simple to make writing and reading messages more efficient.After you become more competent, keep a journal exclusively in Morse Code.
For regular practice, get in the habit of copying out your grocery list, the names of your loved ones, haikus or other short messages.

, If you know someone else who is making an effort to learn Morse Code, the two of you can improve your skills together. Use code to greet one another, communicate ideas or tell dirty jokes in secret. You’re much more likely to learn if you have another person to keep you motivated and make things fun.Make a set of flashcards and have a friend or loved one quiz you.
Send text messages in dots and dashes instead of your ordinary language.

, Nowadays, there are apps like Morse-It and Dah Dit available that can give you the chance to study. These apps are part visual recognition and part audio recording, providing a more integrated learning experience. They also allow you to interact directly with the push of a button using your device’s haptic touch response, which is much more like the traditional way of tapping out Morse Code messages.Using an app will enable you to practice at your own leisure at home or on the go.
Combine app-based study with pen-and-paper practice to reinforce your code comprehension in all its different forms.

, Many amateur radio operator clubs hold courses on Morse Code. These courses are generally open to anyone, regardless of whether or not you’re ham radio enthusiast. In a traditional classroom setting, you’ll have the benefit of organized lesson plans and one-on-one instruction that can greatly enhance your ability to learn.Instructors are qualified to present various methods that are effective for teaching different types of learners.
Through classroom study, you may be granted access to helpful software and devices that would otherwise be hard to come by.

, If you can’t find any classes in your area, another option is to study a set of guided practice tapes. Follow along with the recordings at your own speed and complete the included exercises and activities. As you learn, you’ll graduate to more difficult content and your proficiency will grow.Keep a notepad and pencil handy to copy dits and dahs as you hear them tabbed out. Reviewing the visual component alongside the recordings that will make it easier to recognize Morse Code messages in different forms.One advantage of audio lessons is that they can be replayed over and over again to cement critical concepts and help you learn at a comfortable pace.

Decide who goes first.,
Ask the first person to say a noun.,
Have each person add words to the sentence.,
Save your favorites.",How to Make a Silly Sentence1," Get together in a group of two or more friends. Play Nose Goes or Rock Paper Scissors to decide who goes first. You can also just take turns starting each sentence.;
, This will start the sentence. A noun can be a person (like ""Fred"" or ""a doctor""), a place (""the zoo"" or ""England""), or a thing (""potatoes"" or ""the floor"").

, Each person who plays the game adds another word to the sentence. For example:


Amy says ""Fred""
Bob says ""Fred likes""
Camille says ""Fred likes green""
Amy says ""Fred likes green bacon""
Bob says ""Fred likes green bacon because""
Camille says ""Fred likes green bacon because ___"" (pick the next word yourself!)

, Keep playing until the sentence is too long to remember, or until you think it sounds good enough. Play more rounds, and write down your favorites to save and laugh at later.


You can also try writing a whole ""silly story"" with your friends, where each person writes one sentence.

"
Write sentence subjects on large pieces of paper.,
Make color-coded cards for other parts of speech.,
Laminate the cards (optional).,
Show your students how to make silly sentences.,
Check on your students' work.,
Help students out.,
Have the students draw pictures (optional).,
Ask your students for suggestions.",How to Make a Silly Sentence2," You can use markers to write these nouns yourself, or use a computer to type them in an extra-large font size, then print them. Choose a color to write the subjects in, such as blue. Cut the paper so each noun is on its own section. For example, write The clown; The dog; The president; The tiger; and Ms. Smith.


Make sure the nouns are either all singular or all plural, so they can all be used with the same verb forms.

, The most basic sentence structure lesson can just use subjects (nouns) and predicates (verb phrases). If your students are more advanced, you can add additional sentence components like adverbs or possessive pronouns. Color-code each category of cards differently, to make it easier for the students.For example:


For beginning grammar students, just write predicates in orange, like jumped on the table; laughed; drew a picture; and flew to the moon.
For intermediate classes, add adverbs (quickly; happily; loudly), and/or adjectives (silly; red; big).
For more advanced classes, break the predicate into verb phrases, and a second stack of noun cards.

, After you've printed and cut out the words, laminate them at your school office or a copy shop. This is optional, but will let you keep these cards sturdy and reusable for years, even when young kids are using them.

, Pile the cards up by color, in a stack on the floor or in the pockets of a wall organizer. Demonstrate to your class how to take one card from each stack, and put them next to each other to form a ""silly sentence."" The sentences don't have to be realistic, but they should have all the parts of the sentence in the right order.


For example, The clown jumped on the table. is a good silly sentence, since the subject and predicate are in the right order.

, This can be an activity students do in small groups of 3–5, or individually whenever they have play time or individual work time. Have them leave out their sentences for you to check on. Praise the students when they get a sentence right, and help them understand the right order if they make a mistake. If a student loves a sentence he wrote, or if he needs encouragement, you can save his silly sentence on a board for all the students to read and have fun with.

, If a student doesn't understand, explain that the sentence can be put together by answering two questions: ""Who?"" and ""did what?"".Here's an example:


Teacher: Let's make a sentence about someone doing something. Who did something? Pick a card.
Student: (picks ""the dog"")
Teacher: ""Great! Let's make a sentence about a dog. What did the dog do? Pick a card that makes sense in this sentence: the dog __.""
Student: Jumped?
Teacher: That's right. Now put these cards next to each other: the dog jumped."" Try making a new sentence.

, Students who are visual learners, or who enjoy drawing, might be more interested in this game if they get to draw a picture of the silly sentence they came up with.You can also put these pictures up on the wall, so your students can enjoy their silly drawings.

, If your students like the silly sentence game, ask them to think of more subjects and predicates (or ""nouns and verbs,"" or ""things and actions,"" depending on the terms the students know). Print these out and bring them to class, so the students can make more silly sentences using their favorite words.

Pick a letter the student is having trouble with.,
Write or find sentences that focus on this letter.,
Make a large image of the letter.,
Add texture to the letter.,
Add pictures for the words in the sentence.,
Have the student trace the letter as he reads the sentence.",How to Make a Silly Sentence3," This kind of silly sentence is great for students who are learning how to read, especially if they are having trouble understanding phonics, or teaching reading by connecting written letters to sounds. Pick one letter at a time, such as ""P.""

, Write a sentence that uses the letter many times, using clear handwriting or typing. Make sure the letter is pronounced the same each time it shows up, or the student could get confused. It can be especially helpful to use words that begin with the letter.


For example, write ""Pigs play in parks and pamper Penelope with nail polish.""
Search online for ""silly phonics sentences"" for examples, such as this free example.

, Draw the letter you've chosen (P in our example) on a large piece of paper, but keep it small enough that the student could sit next to it and trace over it without standing up., The student may learn better if there is a texture to associate with the letter. You can use dried-on white glue, glued-on sand, or any other material. Rough materials are best, since they will force the student to use more effort and movement when tracing, helping the student's memory.If you plan to make a silly sentence for several different letters, try using a material that begins with that letter.For example, glue pepper (black peppercorns) onto the P, and sand onto the S.

, Reinforce the meaning of the word by placing a picture above each word that begins with the chosen letter. For instance, place a picture of a pig above the word ""pig.""


You can draw these pictures yourself if you are able to make them clear to the student, or find and print them from free art online.

, Give the student a spoon, a stick, or another rough object, and have the student trace the outline of the letter slowly, moving his arm and shoulder. Repeat this as you help the student read each word of the sentence. Ask the student what each word is, then read it aloud. Say the letter you are focusing on with the student, as the student traces the letter. Repeat this for each word in the sentence.This practice is designed to give the student as much encouragement as possible to remember and learn the letter.

Learn how to form bacronyms.,
While away the hours making your own bacronyms.,
Hold bacronym parties with your friends.,
Switch it up by making quizzes where some of the words are missing.",How to Play Bacronyms," It is assumed that you are familiar with acronyms. In acronyms, you normally pick the initial letters of the name of an institution, enterprise etc., and form a word, which may have no meaning taken by itself. A bacronym, on the other hand, is a novel concept, not yet a dictionary word. Here is how to create a bacronym:


Form a phrase using only the letters of the word itself (no more, no less) in their sequential order, so that the phrase yields one of the dictionary meanings of the word or its common usage. For example:

Have you ever thought of Ear - as the Earliest Audio Receiver?
Or, Easy - as Effortless And Simple, Yes.
And New - as Not Ever Witnessed or Never Ever Witnessed.

;
, See how many you can make:


Open the dictionary to any page you like.
Select a section of words.
Work through them methodically to create amazing bacronyms.

, Play games with words you've already chosen in advance and set time limits. People can play individually or in teams. And award prizes for the best bacronyms, based on everyone's consensus.

, These can be given in quiz form, for example:


Stomach - Sensitive, Turbulent Organ, M........ Activity Conducted Here. (Metabolism)
Tableau - Theatrical And Beautiful Looking Exposition A......... U...... (Arranged Uncannily).

Practice by yourself.Workbooks are great tools, but once you get a basic understanding of Elvish, the next thing you need to do to really make the language stick is to start translating things on your own.,
Practice with other Elvish enthusiasts.",How to Speak Elvish," Quenya is one of two major languages spoken by the Elves. In particular, it is the language of the High Elves.


Quenya has gone through a few changes since its creation. Early Quenya, also called ""Classical Quenya"" or ""First Age Quenya,"" was the earliest form of the language.
Most Quenya you will learn online or in books will be ""Modern Quenya"" or ""Third Age Quenya."" This version is a blend of vocabulary and grammar original to Tolkien with a bit of reconstruction from contemporary fans.;
, Quenya vowels have distinct pronunciations that do not vary based upon position or placement within words. Long and short vowels differ in terms of length, not quality or formation, and long vowels are distinguished with an accent mark.


á = long “aaaah”
a = short “ah”
é = long “eeeh”
e = short “eh”
í = long “ee”
i = short “ih”
ó = long “oooh”
o = short “o” (almost like a short ""ah"")
ú = long “uuuh” (almost like a long ""ooo"")
u = short “uh”

, A diphthong refers to a set of two vowels that form a single sound. There are only six in Quenya, and other vowels, when combined side-by-side, should be pronounced separately. The diphthongs are:


ai (""aisle"")
au (""house"")
eu (British ""so"")
iu (""yule"")
oi (""oil"")
ui (""ruin"")

, Most consonants are pronounced in the same way as they are in English, but there are a few particular rules you should be aware of.


c = always pronounced as “k”
h = pronounced as “h” when placed at the beginning of a word and and as “ch” or ""k"" when placed between consonants; silent in the combinations: hw, hy, hl, hr
ng = both sounds are always heard, as in “finger”, not as in “singer”
r = most be rolled or trilled
s = always unvoiced
y = always a hard consonant, no matter where in a word it is placed
qu = “kw”; the “u” in this combination does not act as a vowel

, Knowing which syllables to stress will impact the way that Elvish sounds.


When there are two syllables, stress the first.
When there are three or more syllables, stress the one that falls third to last. This is true unless the second to last syllable contains a long vowel, diphthong, or short vowel followed by a consonant cluster (multiple consonants side by side), in which case, the second to last is stressed.

, There are multiple ways to greet someone using Quenya, and some are simpler than others.



Aiya (/'aj.ja/) means ""Hail!"" when calling for help or attention.

Alla (/'al.la/) means ""Hail!"" when issuing a blessing in greeting.

Alatulya (/a.ˈla.tu.lʲa/) means ""Welcome.""

Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo (/ˈɛ.lɛn ˈsi:.la lu:.ˈmɛn nɔ.mɛn.ti.ˈɛl.vɔ/) means ""A star shines on the hour of our meeting.""

, Just like there are many ways to say hello in Quenya Elvish, there are many ways to say goodbye or farewell.



Namárië (/na.ˈma:.ri.ɛ/) means ""be well!""

Márienna (/ma:.ri.ˈɛn.na/) means ""farewell"" or ""towards happiness.""

Alámenë (/a.ˈla:.mɛ.nɛ/) means ""Go with our blessings.""

Mauya nin avánië (/ˈmau.ja ˈnin a.ˈva:.ni.ɛ/) means ""I must go.""

, Whether you want to practice your Quenya or want to show off what you do know, you might need to ask someone if she or he speaks Elvish. Asking in Quenya will imply that you mean Quenya Elvish, specifically.


Ask Ma istal quet' Eldarin? (/ˈma ˈis.tal ˈkʷɛ ˈtɛl.da.rin/).
If someone asks you this question, you can tell him or her that you speak Elvish with Istan quet' Eldarin (/ˈis.tan ˈkʷɛ ˈtɛl.da.rin/).

, If you want to teasingly dish out a unique insult, try a creative Quenya option.


Wish someone bad luck with Aica umbar! (/ˈaj.ka ˈum.bar/).
Tell someone ""wind pours from your mouth"" with Súrë túla cendeletyallo (/ˈsu:.rɛ ˈtu:.la kɛn.dɛ.lɛ.ˈtʲal.lɔ/).
Say ""Go French kiss an orc"" with Eca, a mitta lambetya cendelessë orcova (/ˈɛ.ka ˌa ˈmit.ta ˈlam.bɛ.tʲa kɛn.dɛ.ˈlɛs.sɛ ˈɔr.kɔ.va/).

, Balance out your knowledge of Elvish insults with a stockpile of Elvish compliments to give to those you appreciate.



Melin tirië hendutya sílalë yá lalat (/ˈmɛ.lin ˈti.ri.ɛ ˈhɛn.du.tʲa ˈsi:.la.lɛ ˈja: ˈla.lat/) means ""I love to see your eyes shine when you laugh.""
To say ""I love you,"" say Melin (/ˈmɛ.lin/) followed by that listener's name.

, In keeping with the polite spirit of the Elves, you should know how to lend a well-deserved word of thanks.


Tell someone a simple ""thank you"" with Hantanyel (/ˈhan.ta.nʲɛl/).

, Sindarin is the other major language spoken by the Elves. In particular, it is the language of the Grey Elves.


As with Quenya, Sindarin went through a few changes of its own from the First Age of Middle Earth to the Third Age.
While you can find resources on First Age Sindarin, most of what you'll find online or in print is Third Age Sindarin, which is considered to be Sindarin in its modern form.

, All Sindarin vowels are short except for the ""í"" vowel. The duration of these short vowel sounds increases when an accent mark is used, however. Vowels are almost always pronounced the same way no matter where they appear in a word, even if they appear at the end.


a = pronounced like ""ay""
e = pronounced like ""eh""
i = pronounced like ""ih""; if placed at the beginning of a word and in front of another vowel, though, it has a hard ""y"" sound
í and î = pronounced like “ee”
o = pronounced like a short ""o,"" similar to the ""ah"" noise but more rounded
u = pronounced like ""uh""
y = always treated as a vowel, and pronounced ""ooo"" or ""uuu""

, When one of the six Sindarin diphthongs appears, it has a single sound. Otherwise, vowels appearing in clusters or side by side should be pronounced separately. For diphthongs, the stress is always on the first element.


ai = pronounced like ""aye"" (""rye"")
ei = pronounced like ""ay"" (“grey”)
ui = pronounced like the ""eeoo"" (“pursuing”)
au (sometimes aw) = pronounced like ""ouw"" (“loud”)
ae = also similar to ""aye"" (“rye”)
oe = pronounced like ""oy"" (""boy"")

, Most consonants are pronounced as they are in English, but there are a few specifics you should take note of. Some consonants are voiced, meaning they require you to vibrate your vocal cords, while others do not and are unvoiced. Additionally, al double consonants have a longer sound than single consonants.


c = always sounds like ""k""
ch = always sounds like ""k,"" never the English ""ch""; considered a single consonant
dh = represents the voiced ""th""; considered a single consonant.
f = at the end of words, it is used to represent the ""v"" sound
g = always a hard ""g,"" never the ""j"" sound
l = voice ""l"" sound
lh = voiceless ""l"" sound
""ng"" = not very pronounced at the end or start of a word, but more pronounced in the middle of words
ph = ""f"" sound
r = always rolled or trilled
rh = voiceless ""r"" sound
s = voiceless ""s""
th = voiceless ""th""; considered a single consonant.
v = silent when it appears at the end of a word
hw = voiceless W

, There are three basic rules to remember when learning how to place stress on the right part of a Sindarin word.


When a word has two syllables, the stress goes on the first.
When a word has three or more syllables, the stress goes on the second to last syllable if it contains a long vowel, diphthong, or vowel followed by a string of multiple consonants.
When a word has three or more syllables, and the second to last syllable has a short vowel followed by only one or no consonants, the stress falls on the syllable before it.

, There are a variety of Sindarin phrases you can use to say hello, ranging from simple to elaborate.



Ai! (/ˈaj/) means ""Hail!""

Êl síla erin lû e-govaned vîn (/ˈɛ:l̡ ˈsiˑ.la ˈɛ.rin ˈlu: ɛ ˈgɔ.va.nɛd ˈvi:n/) means ""A star shines on the hour of our meeting.""

Mae g'ovannen! (/ˈmaɛ gɔ.ˈvan.nɛn/) means ""You are well met"" in a familiar/casual sense.

Mae l'ovannen! (/ˈmaɛ lɔ.ˈvan.nɛn/) means ""You are well met"" in a formal sense.

Gi nathlam hí (/gi ˈnaθ.lam ˈhiˑ/) means ""You are welcome here"" in a familiar sense.

Le nathlam hí (/lɛ ˈnaθ.lam ˈhiˑ/) means ""You are welcome here"" in a formal sense.

, As with greetings, there are a number of different farewells you can issue in Sindarin Elvish, including simple and complex versions.



No veren (/nɔ ˈvɛ.rɛn/) means ""Be joyous.""

Novaer (/ˈnɔ.vaɛr/) means ""Farewell.""

Galu (/'ga.lu/) means ""Good luck.""

Boe i 'waen (/ˈbɔɛ i ˈwaɛn/) means ""I must go.""

Guren *níniatha n'i lû n'i a-govenitham (/ˈgu.rɛn niˑ.ˈni.a.θa ni ˈlu: ni a.gɔ.ˈvɛ.ni.θam/) means ""My heart shall weep until I see you again.""

Losto vae (/ˈlɔs.tɔ ˈvaɛ/) means ""Sleep well.""

, If you want to practice or show off your Elvish and want to know if the person in front of you is another student of the language, you can ask them in Sindarin Elvish.


Ask Pedig edhellen? (/ˈpɛ.dig ɛ.ˈðɛl̡.lɛn/) when speaking in familiar terms, or Pedil edhellen? (/ˈpɛ.dil̡ ɛ.ˈðɛl̡.lɛn/) when speaking formally.
If someone asks you this question, tell that person you speak Elvish by saying Pedin edhellen (/ˈpɛ.din ɛ.ˈðɛl̡.lɛn/).

, There are times when an insult in your native language just doesn't cut it. For these times, use a creative insult in Sindarin.


Say ""you smell like a monster"" with Sevig thû úan (/ˈsɛ.vig ˈθu: ˈuˑ.an/).
State ""your head is empty"" with Dôl gîn lost (/ˈdɔ:l ˈgi:n ˈlɔst/).
Tell someone ""go kiss an orc"" with Ego, mibo orch (/ˈɛ.gɔ ˈmi.bɔ ˈɔrx/).

, Just as there are various Sindarin insults, there are also a range of common Sindarin compliments to select from.


Tell someone, ""I love to see your eyes shine when you laugh"" by saying Gellon ned i galar i chent gîn ned i gladhog (/ˈgɛl̡.lɔn ˈnɛd i ˈga.lar i ˈxɛnt ˈgi:n ˈnɛd i ˈgla.ðɔg/).
Say ""I love you"" by saying Gi melin (/gi ˈmɛ.lin/).

, Elves are a polite race, so keeping in Elvish spirit, you should know how to thank someone after he or she does something kind.


Say a simple ""thank you"" with Ni 'lassui (/ˈni ˈlas.suj/).

, There are a surprising number of websites and books available that will help you learn either Quenya or Sindarin Elvish in even greater detail. Many online guides are free, and most of the books currently out in the market are pretty affordable, as well.


When shopping around for books on Elvish, invest in an English-Elvish dictionary to help you translate specific terms, as well as language guides that will help you learn the grammar.
If you want an English-Elvish dictionary but don't want to buy one, there are a few you can find for free online.You can find a free Quenya workbook online here: http://www.councilofelrond.com/readingcats/quenya-workbook/

,


You can translate anything you want: poems, short stories, names, articles, or text messages. Start small before working your way up to longer passages.

, Once you think that you have a pretty solid understanding of Elvish, you should find others who speak Elvish and practice with them.


The easiest, cheapest way to go about this is by searching for Elvish communities online. Most of these forums and boards are free.
You could also search for conventions or local fan groups that have something to do with Elves, since many hardcore fans will have learned a bit of Elvish here and there.

, For the purpose of this article, the example uses the sentence ""Hello World"". Start with Caesar's cipher.""Hello World"" would become Ifmmp xpsme if we switched it one to the right.

, It can be very frustrating to work hard on your message, only to find out that it's wrong. A simple typo or miscalculation can be disastrous. Ifmmp xpsme can easily become fmnp xpsme, which translates to elmo world. If you live in a town that has a theme park called ""Hello World"" and a children's playground called Elmo World, and your message is ""Meet at..."", the result would be a mess-up! Check, double check, and triple check if it's that important.

, For this example, use the substitution cipheron it. You can use any substitution you want, this example uses:


Applying this cipher, you will get: Wkhha qachv. The benefit of using stacked ciphers clearly shows up here. Anyone who tried to decode this would have a very hard time finding a pattern, with two ciphers applied.

, As stressed above, double checking is needed, especially when dealing with stacked ciphers.

, Three ciphers stacked will probably be enough. More than three will be too complicated for you, and especially your friend, to decode, even with the key laying beside you. While more than three is too many, less than three can be easy to decode. Don't use substitution code or Caesar's code more than once. Try another kind of code, such as a symbol code.


Use phone code now. Phone code relies on the keypad of a phone or cell phone to do its work. If you look at a phone, you'll notice that the letters in small print under the number start at 2. 2 = abc, 3 = def, 4 = ghi and so on. To write in phone code, jot down the number that corresponds to the correct letter, then add a dot either to the left, on top, or to the right of the number. For example, to write b, write a 2 with a dot on top. To write L, write a 5 with a dot to the right of it.
Go ahead and write the message, Wkhha qachv, in phone code. Note that some numbers have 4 letters under them; for these, carry on the same, but for the last letter on that number, put two dots to the right. Look at the seven in the following image, you'll see two dots for s.
Your phone code should look like this:
The stacked cipher can now be illustrated by the following image:

, The problem with all this so far is that a certain letter or number will still represent the same letter, even if you stack many ciphers on your message. But if you add rules, they'll allow for inconsistencies in your cipher, which makes it harder to decode. Rules are what throw off a ""spy"" or nosy person the most. With rules, you're not bound down by the normal ciphers that can easily be cracked; and you can't just ""guess"" what certain words are. An example rule would be: ""Every other word, the Caesar's cipher is applied by two."" This means that every other word, instead of A = B, it's A = C, B = D, and so on. If someone found out what wkhha means, they wouldn't be able to apply it to every wkhha in the code, because some would be different. The next steps explain how to make and apply rules.

, Come up with something creative. Think of grammar, and use rules such as ""after each a, the next letter is one up in the alphabet."" You could even go incrementally (each word goes up one in the alphabet.) So ""Hello World"" would be Ifmmp Yqtnf, instead of Ifmmp Xpsme. (The second word, ""world"", goes up two in the alphabet instead of one.) Although going up incrementally would be very hard in a code that is more than ten words long, it is useful in messages less than ten words long.

, Applying rules gets tricky, especially if you make them once you've finished writing the message in code. Once applied, though, a rule will stump any spy who tries to read your messages. Once you've applied your rule, double check your work.

, Write out a list of the rules you have, and give it to your friend. That way, you never have to send a message in the same code again. (At the top, you can just write Applied Rule 1, 5, and 7, then whoever you're communicating with can look at his/her chart and decode with those rules.)

, Unless you expect your friend to decode each and every message you send him or her without a key, create one. Never have more than one copy per person, otherwise you increase the likelihood that someone else will find the key. You can have preset codes with cryptic names, too. For example, you could name the stacked cipher just created above CSP. (Caesar's cipher, Substitution cipher, Phone cipher.) If you apply rule 5 out of all your rules to this code, then you can add 5 to the name, so it's CSP5. Most likely, a spy won't figure out the names. Just send the code in this format:

Start looking for single-letter words in the message.,

Enjoy the challenge and the mystery.",How to Decipher a Secret Code," Most codes using a relatively simple substitution method are most easily cracked by doing a simple plug-and-chug, figuring out the letters one by one and patiently figuring out the code based on guesses.


Single-letter words in English will be ""I"" or ""a,"" so you should try to plug one in, looking for patterns, and--essentially--playing hangman. If you've got ""a - -"" solved, you know it would most regularly be ""are"" or ""and."" Guess and check. If it doesn't work, go back and try the other options. Be patient and go slowly.
Don't worry as much about ""cracking"" the code as learning to read it. Looking for patterns and recognizing the rules in which English (or whatever language is being coded) is written will get you solving the code with some time and effort.;
, The most common letter used in English is the letter ""e,"" followed by ""t"" and ""a"". As you're working, use your familiarity with common words and sentence structure to start making logical guesses. You'll rarely feel sure, but the code-breaking game is played by making logical choices and going back and correcting your mistakes.


Watch for double symbols and short words and start solving those first. It's easier to try to make an educated guess at ""an"" or ""in"" or ""at"" than ""highway.""

, If the message includes punctuation, you're in luck. This offers a whole host of other hints that you can learn to recognize. Apostrophes will almost always be followed by S, T, D, M, LL, or RE,AR,BT. So, if you've got two identical symbols after an apostrophe, you've solved for ""L"" or ""D""., If, as you solve, you think you recognize one of the common code types from the above, you've cracked it and can stop your plugging-and-chugging and fill in the message based on your code. This probably won't happen often, but the more familiar you become with common codes the more likely it will be that you'll recognize the sort of code used and will be able to solve it.


Number-substitutions and keyboard codes are especially common among basic everyday secret messages. Keep an eye out for those in particular and apply as you see fit.

, Basically, a substitution cipher involves substituting one letter for another letter, according to some predetermined rule. This rule is the code, and learning and applying the rule is the way to ""break"" the code and read the message.


Even if the code contains numbers, the Cyrillic alphabet, nonsense symbols, or hieroglyphics, as long as the type of symbol used is consistent, you're probably working with a substitution cipher, which means you need to learn the alphabet used and the rule applied to decipher the code.

, The earliest sort of cipher was used by the Greeks, and involved creating a grid of letters that corresponded to numbers, then using the numbers to create messages. It's a simple code to use, making it one of the foundations of modern code-cracking. If you've got a message that includes a long string of numbers, it might have been coded with this method.


The most basic form of this code involved a row 1-5 and a column 1-5, and then filled the matrix in with each letter from left to right and down the grid (combining I and J into one space). Each letter in the code was represented by two numbers, the column on the left supplying the first digit, and the row on top supplying the second.
To code the word ""wikihow"" using this method, you would get: 52242524233452
A simpler version of this often used by children involves writing in numbers that correspond directly to the letter's position in the alphabet. A = 1, B=2, etc., Julius came up with a good one, simple to use and understand, but very difficult to crack, making it one of the other fundamental code systems that's still studied today as the basis for more complex codes.In this shift method, you shift the entire alphabet a certain number of places in one direction. In other words, a shift of three spaces left would replace the letter A with D, B with E, etc.This is also the basic principle behind a common children's code called ""ROT1"" (meaning, ""rotate one."" In this code, all the letters are just shifted forward one position, making A represented by B, B represented by C, etc.
Coding ""wikihow"" using a basic Cesar shift of three to the left would look like: zlnlkrz

, Keyboard substitutions use the pattern of a traditional American (QWERTY) keyboard pattern to use substitutions, generally by shifting the letters up, down, left or right by a certain number of places. By shifting letters in a particular direction on the keyboard, you can create simple codes. Knowing the directional shift allows you to crack the code.


By shifting the columns up one position, you could code the word ""wikihow"" like this: ""28i8y92""

, In basic substitution ciphers, the writer of the code creates one alternate alphabet to create the coded message. Starting at some point after the Middle Ages, these kinds of codes became too easy to crack and cipher-writers began using various methods to use multiple alphabets within a single code, making the codes much more difficult to crack without knowing the method.


Trimethius's tableau is a 26 x 26 gridof every permutation of Cesar's shifted alphabets, in alphabetical order, or sometimes presented as a rotating cylinder, or ""tabula recta."" There are various methods of using the grid as a code, including using the first row to code the first letter in the message, the second for the second, and so on.Coders will also use a code word to refer to specific columns for each letter of the enciphered message. In other words, if the code word was ""wikihow"" using this method, you would consult the ""W"" row and the column of the first letter in the enciphered code to determine the first letter of the message. These are tough to crack without knowing the code word.

, Breaking codes requires a tremendous amount of patience and perseverance. It's slow and tedious work, often frustrating because of the need to go back and guess again, trying different keys and words and methods. If you want to crack codes, learn to be calm and patient, embracing the mystery and the game.

, Doing the cryptogram in the paper is fun, but jumping headfirst into polyalphabetic codes without the aid of keywords is a whole other level entirely. Learning to write your own codes using complex coding systems is a great way of learning how code-writers think and learning to crack them. The best code-crackers are also good at writing their own and coming up with ever-more challenging ciphers. Challenge yourself to learn more complicated methods and how to crack them.


Analyzing criminal codes and ciphers can be a good way of picking up some tricks of the trade. Bookmakers, drug kingpins, and the Zodiac killer have all developed incredibly complex codes worth looking into., As part of a fun public outreach, the FBI regularly publishes codes for the public to try to crack.Try them out and submit your answers. Who knows--you might have a job soon.


Kryptos, a public statue outside the CIA headquarters, is perhaps the most famous unsolved code in the world. It was originally created as a test for agents, involving four separate panels with four distinct codes. It took ten years for the first analysts to crack three of the codes, but the final code remains unsolved., Cracking codes is like living in your own Dan Brown novel. Learn to embrace the mystery and the challenge of secret codes and the experience the thrill of unlocking the secret.

Store your rules in a dictionary or phrase book.",How to Create a Language2," You have full control over it! Make sure it sounds like a language name though!

, You can choose how to pronounce the language, giving it the overall sound and feel you're going for. However, to make it more thorough and professional, you'll have to do some background to take it beyond sounds.

, This is where you can get creative. It could be anything you want. You have some choices:


Use pictographs or symbols. Many languages, like Chinese, use pictographs or symbols to represent their spoken language. If you choose to do this, you'll also have to come up with a pronunciation for each symbol. Each symbol will have its own unique sound. Numbers are a good example. This is a beautiful but cumbersome route.
Make up an alphabet or syllabary. Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Hindi, Japanese, Arabic... Create a set of symbols which represent individual letters or entire syllables, or even diphthongs.
Use an alphabet already in existence. If you use our Latin alphabet, for example, you will simply have to create new words for things rather than coming up with an entirely new pronunciation system.
Combine different alphabets. Add accents to existing letters (ex: Spanish's ñ) to create new letters or sounds.

, These are the words for your language. You should start off by making common words first, and then move on to less common words.


Start with the foundation words, the words that will be used very often. These are words like ""I"", ""he"", ""his"", ""and"", ""a"", ""to"", and ""the"". Then move on to verbs such as ""to be"", ""to have"", ""to like"", ""to go"", and ""to make"". Don't forget about a e i o u y that makes a big part in accents.
Move on to common things. As your vocabulary grows, start naming everything you can think of. Remember countries, body parts, action words, etc. Don't forget numbers!
If you're stumped, remember you can borrow words from other languages. You can even alter the word. For example, the french word for man is homme. The Spanish word—hombre—is almost the same, with only a few letters/the pronunciation changed.

, Open the dictionary and begin copying words with their translations. Not only will this be helpful if you forget how to say something, but it will ensure you don't miss a word.


Try to make the words easily pronounceable—you don't want to be stuck with tongue twisters every time you open your mouth.

, One common pitfall for language makers is to use too many apostrophes in vocabulary words.

, These describe how sentences are formed. You can copy many from existing languages, but you should change some rules to stay original.

, You need to have a way to tell the difference between ""book"" and ""books"". Many languages add an -s as a suffix. You could choose to add a suffix or even a prefix to your words. You may even add a whole new word! (Examples: If book = Skaru, then books may equal Neskaru, Skarune, Skaneru, Skaru Ne, or Ne Skaru, etc.!))

, These will tell when something happened. The three main tenses are past, present, and future.


You may also want a way to tell the difference between words like ""swim"" and ""swimming"". But it's not necessary. For example in the French language, ""Je nage"" can mean ""I swim"" OR ""I am swimming"".

, These are things like -ly that turn English adjectives into adverbs, and -ness that turns words into nouns.

, Conjugation is how a verb is modified to show who is doing it. In English, we say ""I like"" and ""He likes"".

, Start off with a simple sentence like ""I have a cat."" You can then move on to more complex sentences, like ""I like to watch television, but I prefer to go to the movies.""

, Just like learning a foreign language, it will take practice before you can use your language with ease.

, You will love the confused look on their faces, you may look like a weirdo, or even a jerk, but don't let it discourage you!

, If you want to be able to use the language with your friends, you should teach them. You can even try to spread your language to as many people as you want.

, This way you will always have something to refer to if you need help remembering your language. You can even sell them to make a little extra money!


If you want to make your language well known, then write dictionaries of the language (including its alphabet) to learn your language, and give them out to everyone you want to use the language with.

"
"
Name your language.,
Start thinking about the grammar rules.,
Consider basing your language on an existing language.,
Consider basing some of your words from other words you have invented.,
Get inspiration from existing alphabets and words.,
Remember to keep track of all your creations, preferably in writing!

,
Use your language.",How to Create a Language3," This is the most fundamental property in all languages. You have many names to choose from. You can even use a made up word from your made up language like 'Victory' or 'Great Language'. The choice is all yours.


Start off with the highly frequently used words such as 'and' or 'I' or 'one' or 'the'. It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used. An example would be 'ant', 'es', or even 'loo' for the word 'and'.

, For example, if the word bird is 'Vogelaviatiolap', why not make the word birds 'Vogelaviatiolaps'? The ""s"" added at the end makes a word plural in many languages. If you want to add complication, you can add genders like most European languages, like French and German. For example, if you want the word 'horse' to be a boy, you may want 'the horse' to be 'Mat Fereder', but a 'cat' to be a girl, you may want, 'the cat' to be 'Fet Kamaow'.


Note that some languages don't have plural words at all. In Japanese, for instance, ""cat"" and ""cats"" are both ネコ (neko). Languages can work very differently, especially when they're from two very distant places. Experiment with potential grammar rules.

, For instance, in your language, 'Vogelaviatiolap' means Bird. It could come from the following:


'Vogel' comes from German, which means bird
'aviatio' comes from English. It's uncompleted though, because the word is part of the term 'aviation'
'lap' comes from Onomatopoeia. It's a completed term, but it is supposed to come from 'Flap!'

, For example, if you invented the word 'China' as 'Khinssa', 'Drink' as 'Bever', and the word 'Accident' as 'Casnondelibreaten', why not make the word 'tea' as 'Khincasnonbever' or 'Bevernondelibreatekin' or even 'Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever'!

,


Why not add some non Latin Characters such as ß? You can even make the whole language not based on the Latin Alphabet at all like Chinese!
You can even take some words of languages, altering them or not. You can make the word 'pen' as 'penn' or even 'pen'. Using the dictionary can ensure you not missing a single word.

,, Get used to using it yourself, and spread it to others. Once you feel confident about your language, experiment and expand:


Grab a book / novel and translate it to your own language.
Teach your friends this new language.
As soon as your friends understand your language, communicate to them with it.
Be fluent in your own made up language and start spreading this to your friends, family and strangers!
Write your own poem / novel / story with your own made up language.
If you're really ambitious, set a goal of helping others become fluent in the language. One day, maybe you can make it the official language of a country!

"
"
Understand the process.,
Break a word down into spoken syllables.,
Add ""-idig-"" before each vowel sound in a syllable.,
Resist the urge to repeat vowel sounds.",How to Speak Gibberish2," ""Gibberish"" is an umbrella term for any nonsensical language that is hard to understand, such as baby talk. However, all established variants use the same pattern: A nonsense sound is inserted into every syllable when speaking. The same nonsense sound is used over and over, so words get much longer and all sound quite similar.



Pig Latin is a pseudo-language that is another way of speaking in code. It's a little more common and a little easier to deduce.

, Generally, every syllable in a word contains one vowel sound. Here are some words and their syllables:



Tree: Tree

Bottle: Bot / tle (pronounced tul)

Symmetry: Sym (sim) / me (meh) / try (tree)

, If there are only vowels (e.g., ""I""), add it at the very beginning. Regardless of whether there are 1,2, or 3 consonants at the beginning, add it before the first vowel sound. The result will sound something like this:



tree: tridigee

bottle: bidigottle

symmetry: symm""idig""etry

For a word like ""street,"" remember to keep the consonants together (it's still one syllable). The word, in gibberish, would be pronounced, ""stridigeet.""



, If you were to say the word ""hi"" in gibberish, it may be tempting to pronounce it ""hi-tho-gi,"" instead of ""hI-di-gi."" which sounds like your saying ""hit a guy"" Don't do it! It's harder to decipher when you add in a different vowel sound.


""My name"" is not ""mi-thag-eye nay-tha-game,"" it's ""mI-dig-eye nI-dig-ame.""
""-idig-"" has the same initial sound as ""dig"" (not ""pig""), in case you were curious. In the IPA, it's a schwa, or /ə/. Think of a caveman grunt.

"
"
As you're just walking around, mutter different words to yourself.,
Teaching this to your friends or S.O.,
Repeat, repeat, repeat.,
Get quicker.,
Experiment with different variations.,
Practice!,
Use your powers wisely.",How to Speak Gibberish3," If you have trouble, slow down and say them syllable by syllable, and just repeat until you can say it quickly. Do the same thing with phrases. Start simple at first. Practice ""the cat sat on the mat (with a hat.)"" It's very helpful in practicing to start speaking really fast. Again, you probably shouldn't mutter words to yourself in public settings with other people around; they might think you are possessed by a demon. However, if this isn't a problem, go right ahead.

, is helpful especially in a situation with kids. You can talk about if you want to get ice cream, or go to a movie or buy a present with the kid nearby without them getting all hyper. You could also use this with friends to talk about things that are urgent but not really PG-13.

, Eventually, it'll seem like othagold hothagat. You'll grow more and more confident, shortly moving onto phrases and sentences. Take a look around your room. What objects do you see?


Is there a chothagair? Maybe a bothaged? Or a cothagompothagutothager? How quickly can you decipher the words in this secret language? What sounds are flubbing you up?

, After a bit of practice, the words will start rolling off your tongue. Try reading aloud the words on this page in gibberish. How quickly can you translate? Are you ready for sentences?


""My name is"": Mothagy nothagame othagis ""How are you today?"": Hothagow othagare yothagou tothagodothagay?

""Yes, I can speak gibberish, how could you tell?"": Yothages, othagi cothagan spothageak Gothagibbothagerothagish, hothagow cothagould yothagou tothagell?""


, There are many established variants, and you're completely welcome to come up with your own twist -- though no one else will understand you. When it comes to that inserted sound, here are some possible (already established) variants:""-idig-"": ""Go"" becomes ""gidigo.""
""-uddag-"": ""Go"" becomes ""guddago.""
""-uvug-"": ""Go"" becomes ""guvugo.""
""-othag-"": ""Go"" becomes gothago.""

""-Othag-"" is the hardest to say quickly of this list (""th"" and ""g"" are farther apart in the mouth than ""d"" and ""g"" or ""v"" and ""g"" and thus take a split-second longer to pronounce). Once you get fast at ""-othag-"", the rest will be cake (cothagake!).



, Get out a few old baby books and read them out loud in gibberish. Keeping the three syllable words to a minimum (how did you do with Gothagibbothagerothagish above?) is key. Once the baby books are easy, it's time to impress your friends!


Hopefully you can convince a buddy to do this with you. What's the point in speaking in code if you can't exchange classified information in front of people? Or, it's possible you have friends that can already do this and you just don't know. Sothago othagask!

, Now that you can say whatever you please in front of anyone, don't abuse your power. After a few phrases, you're going to be like that guy that has a French word for everything. People may get irritated, especially if you don't tell them what the heck is going on. If you'd like, you could teach them your ways, but it may be more fun to see if they can figure it out first.


Hold off until you're confident with it. Speaking gibberish can be quite impressive if you can do it decisively and with confidence. Just as with any language, you have to practice it often. Or else you'll find yourself tongue-tied and stuttering.

The idea is that you will quickly work through these questions, probably quicker than you had budgeted for, allowing you extra time to work on the more difficult sections.The issue with this strategy, versus working through every section as budgeted, is that you might skip a question thinking that it’s more difficult than it is. You also run the risk of not returning to questions that you’ve skipped.;
, After you’ve answered the easy questions, focus your time on the questions that are worth the most points. It makes more sense to spend 10 minutes on 1 question worth 20 points than to spend 10 minutes on 10 questions worth only 1 point each.

You won’t be able to bring a cell phone in the test with you, and there may not be a clock on the wall, so you’ll need to remember your own time piece., You’ve studied, you’ve practiced, you’ve read through the test, you’ve budgeted your time, and there is no reason to rush yourself. You might be feeling a little anxious or want to hurry up and get the test over with, but time management is about pacing yourself. So, pace yourself. Don’t rush, as you’ll run the risk of making a critical mistake, and stick to your game plan., After you complete a section, give yourself a few seconds to pause and breathe before you move on. This helps you pace yourself, allows you to make sure that you’re managing your time effectively, and helps you mentally move from one task to another., No matter how prepared you are for this test and how well you’ve planned to manage your time, something can go wrong. This isn’t the end of the world, though, and shouldn’t derail your schedule at all. Plan for some problems, and be ready for any issues.Bring at least two pens or pencils with you.
If you’re allowed to use a calculator, bring spare batteries.
Bring an extra blue book or paper.
You might even pack a little emergency kit with throat lozenges, gum, a bandage, and lip balm.

, Whether you’re taking a standardized test or a classroom examination, you will likely be able to find out the format of the test beforehand. Knowing the test’s format will help you study, as well as give you ideas about how to approach the materials.If you’re told that there will be three essay questions, for example, that will ask you to connect the larger theme of the course to specific texts that you’ve read in the class, you know to begin thinking about thesis statements.
Or if your instructor says that there will be 15 multiple choice questions and 15 true/false questions, you understand that your focus should be much more specific, probably focusing on facts and dates.

, If you’re taking a standardized test such as the GRE or the SAT, there are plenty of study guides available. Almost every current study guide will have practice tests, study materials, and approaches to taking the test. Typically these guides offer simulated exams as well, so that you can simulate the examination and your performance.Your school or local library may have study guides available for use within the library.
You might find used copies of these guides online for a dramatically reduced price.

, Practice answering essay questions well before your test if you have a good source of feedback available, such as a writing center or your professor has agreed to look over your essays for you. Doing so will show you what part of your essay writing you need to develop, as well as help you get comfortable answering a question in prose. The more you practice, the more efficient and quick you will become.Your instructor might give you example essay questions if you ask for them. These might include questions from previous exams or simply questions that they think would serve as good practice.
Do no assume that your institution’s writing center or your professor will look over practice essays for you. Instead, respectfully ask if they are willing to review your practice essays and offer feedback.

, Devote extra study time to working on your weakest areas. This will help you out in a few ways. You’ll be better prepared for material that isn’t your strong suit, and you’ll also spend much less time worrying about the information when you encounter it on the exam. Additionally, by studying your weakest areas, you’ll develop strategies for handling the material efficiently and quickly.A good example is the GRE’s verbal portion of the examination. Many people find this component especially challenging and devote extra time to studying flash cards, as well as developing strategies for word meanings, antonyms, and synonyms.

, Create a study schedule that is realistic and is one to which you will commit. This ensures that you’re devoting enough time to studying, and also establishes a pattern for you, which will help you manage your time when you get into the actual examination.There are free study calendar templates available for download from the internet.
Some printed student calendars also have a study schedule feature built in to the calendar itself.

, When you receive the test, carefully read through every question before you even pick up your pen. Reading through the test allows you to find important information that might be tucked away in the exam, as well as figure out which questions you want to answer if you’re given a choice (choose one of the following three questions, for example).Reading through the test also shows you the exact format of the exam, which allows you to solidify your game plan.

, You’ve read through the test and now know how the test is organized. Give yourself a minute to divide the test into its smaller parts, and decide how much time you’ll allow yourself on each section. Generally speaking, you want to allow more time for essay questions than anything else.True/false and multiple choice questions will take the least time to answer. At the most give yourself one minute per question, although 30 seconds is probably more realistic. Allow at least half of the allotted test time for any essay questions.
Budget a few minutes to review your answers before submitting the test. You’d hate to turn in the test only to find out that your were one slot off on your Scan-tron sheet.

, You’ve read every question and come up with a realistic budget on how you’ll spend your time. Now you need to decide how you’ll tackle the test. You might want to begin with any essay questions first, as writing answers out by hand tends to take longer than simply circling a correct answer. On the other hand, you might want to handle the fill-in-the blank portion first because they require the most recall skills.Because you have been practicing, you should generally have an idea of your strategy before you arrive to take the exam.
If you’re taking a standardized test, the study guides that you use will guide you through the exact strategy that you should use to maximize your time management.

Have your own quiz show.,
Use sports-based games.,
Play classic classroom games.,
Try board games.,
Let the students ask the questions.",How to Make Tests Fun1," Having your own version of a popular TV game shows or quiz shows can be great way to make testing fun for you and your class. You will have to think of your favourite shows, and which ones you could translate into your classroom. There are a number of templates that have been created and uploaded onto the internet as teaching aids. You can download and use these templates, and adapt them to suit your needs.Popular shows like “Jeopardy”, “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” and “The Weakest Link” are just a few of the options you could go for.
You can search online for a model for a specific game show, or visit a site that has a few different examples for you to try out.These games will typically run on PowerPoint, so they are easy to introduce to the classroom.
You could also use these games as a study aid when you are working at home.;
, If you are more into sports than game shows, you can use a variety of sports-based games to make your testing and studying more fun and engaging. There are games you can access online related to basketball, football, and baseball amongst others.Sports games generally work by quizzing each team, with points being scored for correct answers.


For example, one PowerPoint basketball game works by allowing a shot for each correct answer.
The game will keep track of the scores for each team., There are all sorts of new games to play in class that involve computers, but sometimes the traditional games can be the best. If you are trying to learn vocabulary for a foreign language, try playing Hangman or Pictionary. These are easy games that the whole class can participate in.You could introduce a rule in Hangman whereby you have a get a question right before you can guess a letter.
You could play these games as a whole class, or split up into smaller groups.
Working in smaller groups might make it easier to ensure that everyone gets involved and participates.

, You can use classic board games to make testing more fun. Pick straightforward games, such as snakes and ladders, rather than a more complicated game. To turn the game into a test or study aid, have a series of questions or tasks that must be completed in order to move forward.


For example, if you were playing snakes and ladders you would be asked a question by the teacher before you could roll the dice.
You could split the class into a few teams and have a prize for the team that gets to the end of the board first.
The smaller the groups, the more questions each person will have to answer.

, Sometimes a quiz or test can be more fun and engaging if the students themselves are coming up with and asking the questions. One way to do this is to split the class into two groups, and give them a short time to think of a certain number of questions on a set topic.


Each group then takes it in turns to ask the other group of a question.
For every incorrect answer, the team loses one of their members.
The team with the last remaining member wins."
"
Play one-on-one games.,
Do quick quizzes online.,
Try a PowerPoint game.,
Add a joke question.,
Use humour in a normal question.",How to Make Tests Fun2," You can play games just with one other person to make the test more focussed. These games will work in the same way as those involving the whole class, but will require each person to answer more questions. Some examples of games that can easily be turned into one-on-one tests are Battleships, and Connect 4.


For each turn a player must get a question correct before picking a square to hit in Battleships, or a place to add a chip in Connect 4.
If you are doing this in class, you could make a regular feature at the end of the lesson.
You could create a tournament or league table from ten minute games of Connect 4.
Remember that you will need a lot more questions with the answers prepared to keep it going.

, There are lots of online quizzes that you can take to help you with your studying. Short quizzes can be a good way to break up the monotony of studying. They can also help you assess your knowledge, identify any weak areas, and give you practice of working with a time limit. Set aside ten minutes at the end of each study session for a quick quiz.Research suggests that multiple choice tests that offer a gaming element are often more fun and engaging for students.Try to set goals and have rewards for good results.

, If you want something a little different from a normal quiz, you can try out some PowerPoint games. These are like the games you might play in class, but are designed to be played on your own when you are studying.Games will often give you a scenario and a path that you can progress down by getting multiple choice questions right.


In one example, you will have to manoeuvre a spaceship and complete a rescue mission., You make tests a bit more fun by adding in a jokey question at the end. Having a joke question at the end of a test can be a nice surprise that helps you relax when you reach the end of the exam.An example of a joke question could be:


Q. How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?


A. One, but the bulb has to want to change.
B. None, the bulb has to change itself., You can add a little humour to a test while still asking a serious question. For example, you could frame a maths question so that it is about a celebratory. You can alter a question that asks ""an object falls at 10m/s from a height of 250m. How long does it take to reach the ground?""


A funnier version could be ""I pushed Justin Bieber off a cliff 250m high, and he fell at a speed of 10m/s. How long did he take to hit the ground?"""
"
Debrief and evaluate the tests.,
Grade them as a group.,
Make grading part of the game.,
Ensure the students understand what credit is attached to the test.",How to Make Tests Fun3," Fun quizzes and tests can be great way to do something a little bit different in the classroom, while still learning and teaching. To make the whole exercise a success, it's important that you don't overlook the evaluation and debriefing at the end of the test. This helps the students to appreciate the purpose of game and what they learnt.You can start this by recapping some of the key points covered in test and writing them on the board.

, You might like to try grading the tests either in small groups, or as a class. If you have done the quiz in small groups in class you can swap answers with another group, so that each team marks another team's test. If different groups have different answers to a question, you can use this as an opportunity to discuss it as a class.


Discussing the question in detail with the different answer will enable you to help make sure that everyone understands which answer was correct and why.
Encourage the group that got the question wrong to talk together to explain where they went wrong.This can operate as a kind of simple peer assessment, where students mark each other's work. This can be very positive, but you should make sure everyone stays friendly and nobody is singled out., If you are doing a fast-paced quiz in class, you can make grading part of the game. If you have given your students buzzers or bells to answer questions, you can write up the scores on the board and update them after each question. This will make it more like quiz show.


You could have a simple tally chart on the board, or you could have something more creative.
Each correct score could reveal a letter or part of a picture that the teams have to uncover to win.

, It might be a fun test at the end of term to revise some key material while letting off a bit of steam, or it could be a more serious test that counts towards the overall grade. Whichever way you choose to do the test, make sure that you are clear about it.

Improve your visual vocabulary/phocabulary.,
Understand word roots.,
Learn the origins of words.,
Play word games.,
Take online word quizzes.,
Build your contextual vocabulary.,
Use word lists.",How to Improve Your Vocabulary for SSC Exams," It is often said that a picture conveys more than a thousand words. It presents an image which our brain can more easily relate with. Using a picture or mental imagery can help a student connect with a certain word and memorize it.


For example, one can relate the word ""veracity"", which means truthfulness, with the image of Mahatma Gandhi.
Similarly, the word ""intrepid"", which means fearless, can be associated with Shaheed Bhagat Singh.;
, Word roots are the simplest forms which can't be broken down any further. Understanding word roots definitely helps a student to develop a strong link with the word to be memorized. It also helps one to simultaneously link the same word root to other related words, thereby creating a web of words.


One such web of interlinked words can be woven using the word root ""bio"", which means ""living"" or ""alive"". Abiotic (non living), biology (study of living beings), biodiversity (presence variety in various living forms) etc. are a part of this web.

, Language has a definite sociocultural and historical context. Quite often it is from this context that words originate. Viewing words in the context which they originate from is indeed an interesting and potent method.


The word ""laconic"", which means brief and to the point, has its origin in a place earlier known as Laconia.
The word ""salary"" derives its origin from “salarium"", the quota of salt which was given to Roman soldiers as monthly wages.

, Scrabble, crossword puzzles, hangman, jumbled words etc. are some all time popular word games. These games make the task of vocabulary improvement, which at times seems a little tedious to some, joyful and entertaining. You need not shy away from such games, as often work made fun gets done.

, Playing word quizzes, which are available on many websites, can help a student zero in on the right word from the given options. The experience of attempting these quizzes is quite similar to what one finally experiences in the exam. The great benefit with such quizzes is that a lot of words can be learned in limited time.

, Reading is an activity which can do wonders to a student's vocabulary. While reading newspaper editorials, weekly magazines, fictional and non fictional works etc., a student is bound to come across new words. These words must be looked up in the dictionary and a database of such words should be prepared. For better comprehension and recall, one can also include, in this database, the sentences (context) where such words appear. This method is certainly the most appropriate one for developing usage skills.

, Quite often students rely on memorizing standard word lists containing high frequency words as a time saving and highly productive method of vocabulary improvement. The words starting with ""SPICE"" letters (S, P, I, C & E) are considered to be the most important ones from the exam perspective. Memorizing them does make a lot of sense. However, it is noteworthy that this method has but limited efficacy in terms of improving one's overall verbal ability skills, such as word usage.

Knowing what your child will have to do will help you prepare them. You can consult the testing website, their class notes, or the school for more information regarding the exam. Some questions you may want to answer include:


When is the exam?
What is being tested?
Is it multiple choice? Are there essays? Will the child have to show their work?
How long is the exam?
What supplies will they need (pencils, calculators, etc.)?
Does the test accommodate certain learning differences?;
, Your child’s teacher will be able to provide the most up-to-date information regarding the exam. They will also be able to help you identify your child’s weak points so that you can help them study more effectively. Email the teacher to set up a conference.You might ask:


How has my child been doing on their practice exams in class?
How can I, as a parent, help my child?
How long should my child be studying for this exam?
What happens if my child does not pass?

, If your child is taking a standardized test, you should be able to easily locate practice exams. These exams are often tests that were given in previous years. They can help your child learn not just what type of questions are on the exam but how the exam is structured and formatted. You can find these exams online on the examination’s website or through your child’s teacher.


If your child is not taking a standardized test, a practice exam may not be available. Instead, consult their notes and textbooks to see what type of information might be on the exam. You can test them from this material.

, If you are concerned about your ability to help your child study, you can hire a tutor. There are many tutors who specialize in different types of exam. You may also ask an older student who has already taken these exams. You can find a tutor by searching a childcare website or by contacting a local tutoring center., At least two weeks before the exam, you should start scheduling regular periods in the evening to study. You may decide to have your child study for an hour every weekday and give them the weekend off, or they could devote an hour every other day.Organize a timetable for the period running up to exams. Mark when your child will study on each day. By encouraging a consistent schedule, they will form a healthy studying habit.If you are having difficulty filling an hour with studying, you might organize your sessions by task. For example, you might ask them to finish twenty math problems or write one essay. These tasks may take different lengths of time, but they will still help your child prepare.

, Your child will need a quiet place where they can study undisturbed for their examination. There should be no distractions, such as TV, in the room. You should make it clear to other family members, such as younger siblings, that the child is not to be disturbed while they are studying. This will help your child’s concentration as they prepare.


Good places to study include the child's bedroom or the kitchen.
While the child is studying, minimize noise in your home. Keep the television volume low, and do not hold loud conversations.
If you do not have a quiet place for your child to study, you might take them to a public library where they can do their work in peace.

, It is important for your child to both memorize information and recall it on demand. To improve their memory, you can encourage certain studying practices. Using these aids on a daily basis will help them learn more efficiently than cramming the information from a book.


Create a sheet of math formulas that they need to know. Have them memorize the formulas. Encourage them to write these formulas down in the margins of the test as soon as they receive it.
Teach your child to go through reading passages and circle important details, such as the main character, purpose, and tone.
Flash cards work well for learning vocabulary, science facts, and historical dates., Ask your child questions that they might find on the exam. Develop questions based on their notes, flashcards, or textbooks. You can say these out loud or give them a written practice test. Note which problems your child is having the most difficulty with, and focus on those in your next study session.


If you have a practice exam, give it to them a few days before the examination. Time them for the same length of time that they will be given on the test. If they are given breaks between sessions, give them the same type of break.

, Concentration weakens after a certain amount of time. A short break is a good idea every 30 to 60 minutes. During a ten to fifteen minute rest, your child can stretch, have a snack, or take a walk. These brief breaks can reduce stress, improve memory, and increase concentration., Your child might be nervous, anxious, or scared about the exam. It is important to identify these feelings early so that you can support your child before the exam. Ask them, “How are you feeling about the upcoming exam?”If your child answers that they are worried about the exam, do not dismiss their feelings. Instead, ask them more questions, such as “What part of the exam are you most worried about?” or “Is there any particular reason why you’re so worried?”
Reassure your child that the result does not matter as long as they tried their hardest. You can say, ""It is natural to feel worried or anxious. What matters about the test is that you tried your best. If you don't pass, everything will still be ok.""
Your child might express some physical feelings of discomfort, such as nausea, butterflies in the stomach, sweating, or insomnia.During these episodes, support the child until they have calmed down. You might want to give them a break to let them think about something other than their exam.

, Your child may be worried that if they fail this exam they will have to repeat their grade or that they will be considered stupid. You should let your child know that one exam does not define who they are.


You can say, “While it’s true the exam is important, it’s not the most important thing. No matter how you do on it, you’re still a wonderful, talented person. Remember that it does not define how smart you are or what a good person you are.”

, While you may want to encourage your child to do their best, you should not overwhelm the child. Do not focus exclusively on the exam in the weeks leading up to it. Instead, allow your child plenty of breaks to focus on their friends, hobbies, and other activities. You may only want to focus on the exam during their scheduled study time.


When you do talk about the exam, be positive. Instead of warning your child about failing or what might happen if they don’t pass, assure them that they can pass. For example, instead of saying, “If you don’t study hard, you’ll fail this test and repeat the grade,” say, “It’s good to study so that you can do your best on the exam. You will feel so much better about taking the exam if you’re prepared.”

, Some children develop test anxiety. It is good to show your child how they can handle these periods of panic, especially if they happen in middle of exam. These practices can help calm your child down so that they can focus on the exam itself. You can show them how to:


Take deep breaths. They may even want to count five deep inhalations and exhalations.
Squeeze a stress ball. If they are allowed, send the ball into the exam with them.Smile. Smiling can help relax the body even when you aren’t feeling happy.Think positive thoughts. Give them a mantra, such as “You can do this” or “You’re awesome. You will ace this test,” that they can think as they take the test.
Stretch during breaks., Your child needs plenty of sleep before they take their exam. Make sure they get to bed on time the night before. They should have at least eight hours of sleep so that they are alert when taking their exam., A breakfast with complex carbs and proteins will give your child the energy they need to concentrate on their exam. Make sure that they eat their breakfast the morning of the exam.Avoid sugary foods as these can cause the child to crash. Instead, you can feed them:


Eggs
Whole grain cereals or oatmeal
Chia or flaxseed
Smoked salmon lox, Before they go out the door, look through their backpack. Make sure they have all of the necessary supplies for the examination. You may want to look for:Pencils
Erasers
Calculator
Ruler
Comfortable sweater

, Exams typically begin promptly at their scheduled time. Some examinations will not admit late arrivals while others will not let the child make up the missed time. Make sure your child arrives on time to school or the examination center. You may want to aim to arrive fifteen minutes early.

Plan ahead.,
Work out a timetable for each subject.,
Ensure that your child has all the necessary books, notes, and other materials.,
Administer practice tests.,
Use study tools.,
Watch for signs of frustration.",How to Help Children Study for Exams1," Look over your child’s schedule or syllabus at the beginning of the term, and make a note of important exam dates. At least 2-3 weeks prior to any major exam, talk to your child and make sure that they know what the test is going to be on. Have them communicate with their teacher and bring home any study guides or other study materials. Once you know what the test (or tests) will cover, you can formulate a plan together.Write important exam dates on your family calendar at home.
Teach your child to use a planner, and to keep track of important assignments, exams, and other dates.;
, Break down everything you need to know for the test (or tests) and create a timetable for your review. This is particularly crucial if you will be preparing for multiple exams at the same time (such as finals). For example, if you plan to dedicate one hour per school day to study over the course of two weeks (or ten days total), you can choose to cover one main idea each study day. In the event of multiple exams, you may choose to spend 2 days each on five subjects (e.g., Mondays = Math, Tuesdays = History, and so on)., For each day that you plan to study, be sure you’re your child brings home anything necessary for the study session to be successful. Examples may include review sheets, textbooks, class notes, or workbooks., Work with your child to formulate a practice test for each subject (or use one the teacher has provided). Once you feel that your child is ready, administer the test and grade it. This way, you will know which elements of the material your child has a firm grasp on, and which parts need work.If you have the test prepared early on (or the teacher has provided one), you may consider administering the test near the beginning of the study process, and then again near the end, to see how much your child has improved.

, Depending on the age of your child, you may want to explore different types of ""study tools."" This can include things like flashcards, games (like word-find or bingo), or even electronic resources (like computer programs or online games.) Try using a variety of methods until you find something that works for you and your child.

, Studying can be hard work for kids, and that’s OK, however you do not want to push them past their limits. If you child become visible agitated, very frustrated, or seems overwhelmed, it may be time to take a break. You child will learn better if they keep stress levels low.The better you are able to keep calm and communicate with your frustrated child, the better you can help them move through it.
Try asking them what they find so difficult about this task. If they are able to isolate a problem, you may be able to help them more effectively.

Set a regular time to study each day.,
Determine how long you will study for.,
Study in the same place.,
Encourage independent study.,
Take regular breaks.",How to Help Children Study for Exams2," Good habits form when you stick to a routine. Rather than waiting until an important exam is approaching, form good study habits early on. Begin by setting a regular time to study with your child each day. Even if you only work for twenty minutes at a time, this will be quality time spent with your kid, this will aid to their success in school, and this will set up a positive pattern so that when exam time rolls around, you are ready.You will need to discuss this with your child and explain to them what the plan will be.
You might say, ""We need to select a regular time to study each day. Would you like to get it out of the way as soon as you get home from school, or wait and accomplish this right after dinner?""
Remind them that whatever they choose, you will stick to, and that the two of you will study at the same time each day.

, While high school students should be able to study for an hour or more, first-graders can only focus for 15-20 minutes at a time. Consider your child’s level of development and attention span, and set a goal for how long you will study during each session.Once again, you will need to explain this to your child.
You might say, ""“Sally, it’s 5:00 p.m. right now. We’re going to study for 20 minutes. How does that sound?""

, Another element of solidifying good study habits involves studying in the same place each day. This should be location that is (relatively) free from distraction, and that is a comfortable place to stay for a while. Once you are used to this habit, simply moving into your ""study space,"" will get you in the mood to study and learn!, Studying with your child is an excellent way for you to understand what they are learning, spend quality time with your child, and help ensure their success in school. However, it is also important for you to encourage some independent study time. Encouraging your child to spend some time studying on their own (in addition to your study time together, not instead) will enable them to determine what study methods work best for them.

, Another important habit to get into is to study when it is time to study, and rest when it is time to rest. This can be easily achieved if you schedule regular breaks into your study session. For example (for an older child), you may consider working for 45 minutes and then taking a 15 minute break.During your break you can use the restroom, grab a snack, check your phone, or go for a walk around the block!
The idea is to do whatever you need to do to be happy and comfortable, so that you can return to work for another session.

Provide healthy snacks.,
Turn off the TV.,
Communicate with your family.,
Try to ensure a good night’s sleep.,
Avoid bribery.,
Be patient with your child.",How to Help Children Study for Exams3," An important aspect of academic success is good nutrition. Children cannot study effectively if they are hungry, or if they only eat unhealthy snacks. Set your child up for study success by making healthy snacks available.Good choices include hummus and carrots, peanut butter and apples, and popsicles made from 100% juice.
Be sure your child stays hydrated! Provide lots of water to drink.

, Kids will study much more effectively if they can focus on one thing at a time. As a result, it is crucial to avoid as many distractions as you can. Perhaps the number one distraction to avoid is television during your study time. Go ahead and turn it off. Even leaving the TV on in the background will limit both you and your child’s ability to focus., Whenever your child has a big exam coming up (or especially if it is multiple exams), it is a good idea to let all members of the family know. This way, everyone can be supportive, and try not to create additional stress for that child.For instance, you might say to your other children, ""Alex has his exams this week, so I really need your help making him feel supported. Let's cut him a little slack this week, OK?""

, Sleep is absolutely crucial for exam success. At least one week prior to the exam, be sure that your child gets at least 8 hours of rest each night. Of course, this is particularly important on the night preceding the exam.If your child does not have a regular bedtime, consider establishing one.
Likewise, it is important for healthy sleep cycles to wake up at the same time each day, too!

, You may be tempted to bribe your child into studying or doing well on a test. This method should be avoided, however, because it sets up a false system of external rewards. You want your child to study and do well in school for the intrinsic value of doing well, not for the candy or money you will give them. If the work for intrinsic value, this will ensure greater academic success over time., Of course, no matter which methods you choose, you should always practice patience when studying with your child. When you are calm and patient, it will help your child to cope when they become frustrated, and ultimately to study more effectively.


Instead of becoming angry when your child does not want to work, try offering solutions.
You might say, ""How about if we set the timer for 20 minutes and just do our best to study until the timer goes off?""
You might say, ""I noticed you're getting a lot of these wrong. Why don't we give the quiz a break for today and look at flashcards instead?""

Don't grade for usage errors, unless it's part of the lesson.,
Look for vocabulary and detail.,
Go slowly.",How to Grade Tests," After your students take a test, tell them a specific day that you'll have the grading finished. This will keep them from bugging you each day about when they can expect their grades, and it will give you a deadline so you won't be able to procrastinate.


Try to think some about how much work you've got to do in the next couple of days, and how much time you'll be able to devote to grading. Can you do half the tests tonight and half tomorrow? Or will you need more time?
Some tests will take a lot longer than other tests to grade, but even multiple choice tests will take a while if you've got a couple hundred of them.;
, Don't try to grade all of the tests at once, especially if you're teaching several classes and have dozens of students. Instead, put aside time each day when you're not busy for grading some of the tests.


Pick a 1-2 hour block the first day and grade as many as you can. Then, calculate how much longer you'll need to finish all the tests you've got to grade, and schedule the time accordingly.Alternatively, some teachers prefer to grade all the tests at once and get it over with, especially if the tests are multiple choice.

, All teachers have different routines, but it helps to establish one for grading. Are you a stay-late at school and grade at your desk grader? Or a grade on the couch with a glass of wine grader? Both good options. Whatever feels most comfortable and natural for you is fine. Settle in for a good grading session.


While some teachers require total silence and concentration to do work, others will prefer to have a show going in the background, or some music playing. Multiple choice tests are easy to grade with a game on in the background, but essay tests usually require more attention.
Make sure that you have everything that you need. Answer keys, your grade-book, and an organized pile of graded tests and need-to-be-graded tests are essential. Also, a stiff drink of your choice is sometimes a good idea.

, Lots of teachers favor the authority of the red pen, but many an innocent student has been traumatized by the visual shock of a bled-on paper. There's good reason to use ink, to make sure your marks will be tamper-proof, but unless there's a good reason, use a neutral color pen to grade with.

, Most teachers will use a small line or an ""X"" through the number corresponding to the incorrect answer. Make it small and never cross out something the student has written in an essay test. Circle or underline a part of a response that you want to highlight, right or wrong. Read the next section for more information about calculating grades.


Some teachers like to tally the cumulative score at the bottom of each page to make the addition easier at the end. Use tally marks at the top of each page for answers marked wrong, so you'll be able to check at a glance.Double-check your marks when you tabulate. If you make a mistake while you're grading, you can always change the grade later, but it tends to look a little bad if you make a silly little counting mistake while you're grading.

, While some teachers like to wait until the end of class to return tests, it's better to return them at the beginning so that students aren't antsy about their grade on the tests, and you can take the beginning of class to answer any questions they have about the test along with going over it.


Don't post grades publicly. A student's grade is a student's grade. There's little reason to position it against the other grades in the class.

, Make yourself available for questions, complaints, and general confusion after a test, especially if the test was an essay test or a short answer test, which might have more room for debate.


Some teachers like to take 10-15 minutes at the beginning of class to go over a test, discussing the grades and common mistakes. This can be a good way to cut down on one-on-one conversations, but you still need to be available for them, preferably after class.
Come up with a contingency plan for mistakes. If lots of students all made the same mistake, you need to ask yourself who was at fault. A test is just as much an evaluation of your ability to teach as it is their ability to learn.

, After you've graded the test, count up how many answers the student got wrong. Subtract this number from the number of questions on the test to find out how many answers the student got right.


If you're grading an essay or multiple-choice test, add up the number of missed points, or points marked off.

, To get the percentage, divide the number of answers the student got correct by the number of answers possible, which should result in a decimal answer. To get the percentage, move the decimal point two places to the right.


If you want to know more about different strategies for calculating grades, read this article.

, Some teachers like to use letter grades, while others prefer just letting the numbers and the percentages do the talking. The pros of a letter grade is that it gives the student a concrete measure of their ability on the test, but it can be unnecessarily rigid. 15/20 sounds pretty good, but a ""C"" is often thought of as being a bad grade.


Consider using words instead of letters, like, ""Outstanding,"" or ""Good"" or ""Poor"" to stand in for the letters.

, Tally up the score and mark it clearly on the last page of the test. It's good to make students flip through the test, to actually look at it and see what they did right and what they did wrong throughout, rather than just seeing a grade on the front and throwing it in the garbage.


Keep a record of the students' grades on the tests on an Excel spreadsheet or in a gradebook that you keep. This way, if you lose the tests at any point, you'll still have a record for the end of the semester.
Never return tests that you haven't recorded somewhere. If the only record of the grade that a student got is on the paper you handed back, calculating their grade at the end of the semester is going to be rough.

, If you're an English teacher who hates math, there are a variety of online grade calculators that will tabulate the grade for your quickly, without having to do any number-crunching yourself.

, A rubric is a description of the assumptions that you're making as the evaluator of the test. In other words, a rubric is like an agreement between the teacher and the student about what constitutes good work and a correct response. These are very important when you're grading essay tests and short-answer tests, which can seem more subjective than multiple-choice tests, which have clear right and wrong answers.


Often, rubrics are broken down into points. If you're grading an essay, how many points will be awarded for style? How many for thesis? Main points?
What will you be looking for in the essay that the students are to write? How will you choose to evaluate it? What must be there for the essay to be complete? What must be there for the essay to be A-quality work?
Write up the rubric and share it with your students before they take the essay test. Knowing what you'll be grading for will be an excellent way to study., If there's nothing to mark wrong on an essay test, what are you supposed to do? Respond to the student's ideas, encourage creative thinking, and comment on their writing in the margins. Comments give the student something more concrete to hold onto, and helps them know why they got the grade they got.


Be specific. If you find a confusing or unclear sentence, don't write, ""?"" Instead, write, ""This seems interesting, but it's unclear. What do you mean by 'society'?""
The worst thing to do with an essay test is to slap a grade on it and hand it back with nothing else written out. Writing comments takes time, but it's important.
Don't comment on too many different types of things. Comment on three major things the student could improve on, or remember for next time., Short-answer tests are tough to grade when it comes to tallying up the score. What if a student correctly identifies three of the four Beatles, but misses the fourth? Is the answer wrong?


Usually, short-answer questions should be worth more than on point each, to allow for partials. Still, it can be difficult when you're grading from test to test and will involve some judgment calls.
To make it as objective as possible, make your questions as concrete as possible.

, If you have students write in class without the opportunity to revise their writing, it's not good policy to take off too many points for misspellings, comma errors, or other smaller usage issues. Grade their ideas and their creativity, not how well they held up in writing under pressure.If you're an English teacher, essay or short-answer tests may be given over particular grammar or usage topics, in which case you should single those issues out for evaluation.
In some cases, handwriting and other usage things might inhibit your ability to grade the test at all. You need to consider ahead of time whether or not you'll accept a test you can't read. Will you have them re-write?

, Some students are masters of vagueness when it comes to essay tests. Don't get swept up in their long reams of nothing. Look for specific understanding and clear discussions of the topics or issues at hand in the essay test, and look for clear answers to the question that you presented.


Make it clear when you hand out the test and coach the students that digressions should be avoided on the test. It's better to turn in a short essay that answers the question clearly than one that's long enough, but half-done.

, Essay tests are a lot more difficult and subjective when it comes to grading than multiple choice tests, which go pretty quickly. Slow down and grade the tests in smaller chunks to avoid getting burned out and making mistakes that you might have to change later.


You should consider each essay alone, against the prompt and the rubric. Don't compare essays to each other, except to make sure that you're grading consistently. If one essay earned an ""A,"" and another very similar essay didn't, make sure you're not changing your criteria inadvertently.
Try to de-stress before you sit down to grade. If you're stressed out, frustrated, or angry, it may show on the comments and evaluations you make on the tests.

Have a healthy and nutritious breakfast.,
Study by methods by making flashcards before the exam.,
Relax!,
Ensure you have all necessary equipment prior to the exam, if you have a Mathematics exam, make sure your equipment is in functioning order, batteries in a calculator, pencils sharpened and new working pens.,
Start with a bang by writing down key points.,
Pace yourself, if you begin with a good start, finish with a good start.",How to Get Ready for Tests in School," This will allow your body to get the correct amount of rest needed to perform the following day. Eat a wholesome light dinner, fish is often excellent as it is high in Omega Fish Oil and is light enough that you won't be up all night as it digests. Eat a very good breakfast, such as a banana, which is a great way to start the day when taking a test.;
, You have to be really on time to do well on tests or exams. If you set your alarm to wake you so you have enough time to prepare and take your time during the morning of the exam, you will be more likely to start the exam with a clear head and stress free, (or as stress free as anyone can expect you to be!)

, Keep away from heavy saturated foods such as Margarine and foods with high sugar content. Try to eat a balanced meal of eggs, toast, or cereal and some fruit. Make sure you are refreshed by drinking a glass of milk, juice or water, (make sure you don't drink them together, or you will be sick for the exam!). You need to ensure you have had the correct foods that will keep your energy and body functioning until the exam is over. Don't overeat, being too full will mean your stomach will hurt and you may feel nervous. Dark chocolate helps for brain boosting as berries do.

, You can also read a review book or perhaps quickly read over some quotes that you have studied. Don't put your head in a book or memorize that thick textbook. Casually test yourself. Keep calm - that's the key.

, You need to calm down! Being all flustered will be a big hazard. You can't do anything now, can you? You've arrived at the classroom, and even if you jump around in anxiety, you probably won't know about dividing fractions if you didn't revise!

, Put all your items (things you need) on the table before the teacher hands out the papers. If you have an English exam usually you are not allowed to take anything in, however, some exams may allow pens and pencils.

, If it's a Maths or Science test. You may want to write down formulas on a spare piece of paper. This will mean you won't have to remember them later on when you are getting stressed. If it's an English exam or you are required to do a lot of writing make sure you write down on a piece of paper any valuable quotes or material references. In English, references and quotes count. Incorrect quotes or author names means a lower score.

, However, this doesn't mean if you start with a bad start finish with a bad ending. Make sure at both ends of the exam you read all questions before answering them. Often time is allocated for this. When you are allowed to start pen to paper go straight to any questions which you were confident with. Perhaps there was a question about the review you studied before the exam, or a formula was selected to be used in a question and you particularly like that formula. By tackling questions that are fresh in your mind you will be more likely to remember, the more difficult answers later on.

Practice reading skills as much as you can.

,
Get up your reading speed.,
Take a quick glance at the questions before you read the text when doing this look for specific words like when, where, why, how, whom, how many, which, and so on.

,

If you have a friend who has done IELTS, get that friend to practice few topics given for exam.,
Speak as normal as you can, as if you are talking to some body in your day to day life.,
Relax when you speak, don't fill the gaps with ellipses.",How to Get the Highest Score in IELTs4," If you are not able to clearly speak, the best thing is to listen to day-to-day English conversations .you may be able listen to radio, TV or may be to read dialogues written in English.

, For example, if the examiner asks you to talk about food in your country, just don't start to talk about the diet your people take. But you can talk about cuisine when talking about food.

, Ask the friend to be the examiner and you be the candidate, keep lot of practice sessions and speak on different topics, keeping to what is asked.

, Use lots of different words, and remember to use expressions.

, Just keeping a little gap between your words is ok, but practice to be fluent.

"

Pay attention in your classes and concentrate The best thing you can do to raise your test scores is to pay attention when you're supposed to be learning the material: in class!,
Take good notes.,
Do your homework.,
Use mnemonics and other tricks.,
Do practice tests.",How to Get Higher Marks in Exams1," Letting your mind wander or not showing up at all are both likely to make you miss out on key information that will later appear on tests.;
, This is important if you want to have an easier time studying later. Not only will writing the information down as you learn it help you in absorbing the information and paying attention, but you'll have a reference for when you go to study later.

, Homework, such as assignments and at-home reading are where you will find the rest of the information that will be on tests, so doing this homework is important. Schedule time and set aside a quiet place just for homework to help beat the procrastination blues.

, Various memory tricks really can be useful for remembering certain things like numbers, categories, and lists. Just make sure that you learn them correctly and don't mix them up!


Mnemonics are phrases which can help you remember the order of certain things. For example, ""Katy Perry Came Over For Great Songs"" is a great way to remember the biological classifications (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).
Another memory trick is if you have to remember a string of numbers. Instead of trying to remember 2537610925, for example, break it up like a phone number: 253-761-0925. You can break up dates this way too. 14 Oct 1066 (the Battle of Hastings) can become a locker combination: 14-10-66.

, Ask your teacher or go online and print a few practice tests. Taking a practice test will help you figure out how much information you actually know vs how much information you think you know. Knowing your weak spots before a test is crucial!

"
"
Study frequently.,
Study according to your learning style.,
Take advantage of sense memory.,
Listen to music .",How to Get Higher Marks in Exams2," Studying hard for only a few hours the night before the test isn't going to help ensure perfect scores. If you really want to ace those exams, study old and new material every day, or at least several times a week. This will make test-taking a breeze.



Take study breaks. When you study, make sure you take a 5-10 minute break after every 30 minutes of study. This will help keep your brain from getting overloaded and give it more time to absorb the information.
On study breaks, try not to fill your brain with more information, even if that information is more about your favourite celebrity's latest concert rather than Winston Churchill's foreign policy.

, You may know that different people have different learning styles. Some people are visual learners, some people prefer sound, some need physical motion, and so on. Know how you learn best and work that into how you study.


For example, if you learn better by physically doing things, try walking around while you study. If you learn better with sounds associated with the information, listen to music while you study. If you're a visual learner, make a chart of the information you have to know.

, Your brain is pretty good at associating smells or sounds with ideas or memories. You should take advantage of this! While you're studying, wear some unusual cologne or perfume (with a smell you don't usually encounter) and then expose yourself to that smell again right before or during a test.

, Your teacher probably won't let you have headphones during a test, but you should at least listen to music, specifically classical music, right before taking a test.Studies have proven that exposure to certain types of music right before rigorous mental activity can really help, by waking up your brain and increasing your awareness.

"
"
Eat right.,
Sleep well.,
Have all the necessary supplies.,
Drink lots of water.,
Don't do anything different.",How to Get Higher Marks in Exams3," The most important thing is to eat, full stop. Being hungry during a test will distract you and make you tired. Don't eat too soon before a test though, as some foods can make you tired. Instead, make sure you get a meal filled with lean protein before you have to take a test.


Eating healthy will generally boost brain performance too, so make sure you're always eating a healthy diet to help you learn all through school.

, If you don't sleep you won't be able to focus when the pressure's on! Make sure to go to bed early the night before a test, rather than staying up all night to study. Your brain won't be able to hold on to all that crammed information anyway.

, Go to your test with all of the calculators, pens, pencils, blank paper, and other supplies you might need. Not having these things could mean you'll have a much harder time!

, Getting dehydrated during a test can be distracting and reduce your ability to think clearly. Stay hydrated before your test and bring a bottle of water with you to the test as well.

, If you aren't used to drinking coffee, now is a bad time to start. Try not to do anything different in your basic routine the day of or the night before the test. This can really throw you off.

Write important things down first.,
Do the problems you know first.,
Cross out the wrong answers.,
Look for clues in the other questions.,
Never leave questions blank.,
Pace yourself.",How to Get Higher Marks in Exams4," As soon as the test starts, write down all formulas or other important information on some scratch paper before you start going through the questions. This will help keep you from blanking when you need that information later.

, Always do the fast, easy problems to which you know the answer first. This will help make sure that you get as much of the test done as possible. If you get stuck, just move on to the next problem that you can answer quickly.

, Once you've answered the questions you know, move on to the ones you're not sure about. When you're dealing with multiple choice questions, eliminating answers that you know are impossible or silly will help you better decide between the possible options.

, Sometimes the answer to a question can be contained within or hinted at in another question on the test. Look at other answers or questions to help jog your memory.

, Unless you're docked for incorrect answers, never just leave a question blank. Especially if it's multiple choice; you'll at least have a 25% chance of getting the right answer.


As mentioned above, this is where eliminating wrong answers will come in handy.

, This is important! Always keep track of how much time you have and try to use your time wisely. You can always go back to check or improve your answers later!

If you face any problems while solving a problem or reading a chapter, feel free to ask questions. You can take help from the elders, experts, or the pass out candidates of  previous years. You can take help from the online forums, books or even training institutes. Not everyone is born with a sharp mind. However, when you devote time to your study, make sure that you understand all that you are reading and at the same time, you are able to comprehend everything. This will surely enhance your confidence by leaps and bounds and boost your spirit as well.

, UMAT preparation is not a matter of a single day. You have to prepare  for the examination at your earliest, to make sure that you have ample time in your hand. An early preparation will take care of the fact that you have learned your lessons, practiced sample papers and at the same time, revised all that you have studied. When you will find that you have completed your project and still have some time in your hand, you will see that half of your anxiety is gone and you have become confident about your preparation.

, Owing to never ending pressure and tensions, we forget to give time to  ourselves. The tensions and frustrations in our lives make us blame ourselves and we end up getting distracted at the end of the day. Stop feeling guilty if you cannot handle any situation in life. Reward yourself when you perform well. At times, you need to stop worrying about everything else around you and start thinking about your own self. It is your duty to pamper yourself and take care of yourself. Once you start thinking about yourself, all your pressures and anxieties will be subsided a bit and you will feel better. At the same time, when you start celebrating your personal success and achievements, you will see that you are motivated to perform well in your UMAT exam.

, A friend in need is obviously a friend indeed. When you feel that you cannot handle the pressure of UMAT preparation, you can surely share your problems with your friends. Sorrow becomes half when shared. Tell your problem to your confidant and ask for solutions. You will see that you will be able to handle your problems and feel a bit confident as well.

, If you feel that you are too bogged down to concentrate in your study, then it is better that you take professional help. The professional experts will guide you to get rid of your anxiety and make sure that you can again concentrate on your UMAT preparation without any inhibitions.

, Studying at a long stretch of time will pressurize your brain. If you feel that you are tired and you need rest, do not hesitate to take breaks. Study breaks will give you a chance to break the monotony of exam preparation. If you feel that you are bogged down, you can relax for a while and then get back to your usual study. You can retain your enthusiasm and study with all your interest if you have a fresh mind, away from all anxiety and tension.

, Try to find out the brighter side of everything around you. Change the way you look at things by getting rid of your fears. Prioritize your goal and the work day in and out to achieve your goal. On the other hand, make sure that you remain focused and determined. No matter what comes in your way, you should try to handle things in the right spirit and not lose your hope. Learn to say ""no"" to people. Suppose you are studying something and your friend asks you to go out for a movie, decide your priority and deny.

But that's just not the case most of the time. Everyone can slip up from time to time. In fact, it's the mistakes we make in life that really teach us who we are and how to do even better the next time.


Don't panic because panicking will cause stress, and stress doesn't make for good grades. One recent study found that students who stressed over big exams actually did worse than those who stay calm.;
, Your academic career is made up of lots of different tests, not just the tests you take in class or the presentations that you give. Your academic career depends on the relationships you make with your teachers; the impact that you make on other friends; and most importantly, the stuff you learn. Judging the success of your academic career by only looking at a single grade is like judging the success of a party after only a single guest has arrived. It's not an accurate guess.

, Make sure the teacher didn't make a mistake in counting the points or arriving at a grade. Remember, even math teachers make counting mistakes!


If you do happen to find a mistake, double check that it's actually a mistake and then find a time when you can talk to your teacher. Instead of accusing them of making a mistake — ""You made a mistake on my test, I want my grade changed immediately!"" — try to be more understanding. Remember that you get more bees with honey than you do with vinegar. Try something like: ""I noticed that the numbers don't add up here. Am I missing something?""

, You probably won't feel bad about getting a C or a D if everyone else in the class got a C, because C was the benchmark. Still, be careful about finding out other people's grades — they may not want to share, or they may want to know yours in exchange.


If your teacher grades ""on the curve"", the grade that you get will take into account the grades everyone else got. So if the highest grade on a test was a C, then a C might become an A and a D might become a B-.

, Teachers love it when students who get a bad grade show a willingness to learn and get better. That makes the teacher feel successful, like they're doing a good job. So if you go up to a teacher after a bad grade and say something like ""Hi Ms. Kowalski, I'm not happy with my performance on the test. Could we go over the problems that I missed or talk about preparing better in the future,"" they just might faint with satisfaction.


Even though it's really hard to do, a lot of good can come from meeting with your teacher:

The teacher will explain problems you missed or ideas you struggle with
The teacher will see that you want to learn and may factor this into your final grade
The teacher may give you extra credit work



, It feels good to help other people, which is why many students who ace tests offer to help out students who didn't. Just be sure to actually spend time studying and working on improving instead of goofing off. And remember to try to choose someone you're not attracted to or have a secret crush on — we all know how much ""studying"" gets done when you're in the same room as a total man-hunk or she-angel.

, Although you may not have to tell your parents, it may very well be a good idea. Your parents care about you succeeding. That's why they show concern over a bad grade — not because they want you to feel bad. Remembering this will help you open up and hopefully make getting help a lot easier.


Your parents may sit down and explain to you what you got wrong; they may hire a private instructor or tutor to help you out; they may schedule a meeting with your teacher (even though this is unusual after just one bad grade) in order to learn how you could improve.

, A lot of people think that studying the right way means studying for a long period of time. That's not always the case. Studying with purpose and enthusiasm usually wins out over putting in longer hours.

, Studies have shown that writing with a pen and paper actually enhances your memory over simply typing the same out on a computer.That's because the act of writing out letters and numbers with a pen activates motor memory in your brain. Increased motor memory means increased overall memory of whatever it was that you put down in your notes.

, 10-minute study breaks every hour can be helpful in memorizing and learning your material. So take a walk, play with your dog, or call your best friend and commiserate for one-sixth of an hour before you get back to studying.

, Practice test are great if you can find them. They give you a good idea of how well you're doing and what areas or problems you need to improve on. Practice makes perfect!

, You probably don't want to cram for a test if you can afford it. Cramming leaves you tired, with a weaker understanding of the material, and sometimes with an outsized confidence in how well you'll do.

, Studies show that for each hour of sleep you lose during the night, your chance of psychological stress goes up 14%.That's not necessarily a problem until you realize that stress affects your academic performance. So be sure to grab a good night's sleep at least a couple night's before the big test in order to give your body the best shot at success.

, Your brain and body need fuel in order to do well on the test. So getting prepared with an excellent breakfast is a huge priority not to be overlooked. Try not-so-sugary cereals, whole-grain bagels, yogurts and granola, as well as oatmeal and fresh fruits to give your body all the energy it needs to do great."

Stick to your schedule.",How to Get Organised to Study," For each class you are studying for, it is best to keep a binder. All of your course notes, homework assignments, quizzes, and tests should go into the binder. You can sort them and keep them divided with tabs in the binder. Keep extra paper in the binder for taking notes during class.Place the syllabus in the front of the binder with important deadlines highlighted.
Color code your subjects to easily keep track of everything.;
, If you are studying for a test or exam, you are likely under a time limit. Look through the concepts you will need to know and prioritize based on what you know and how likely the concept will be on the test. If it’s something unlikely to show up and you already know it quite well, it is low priority.Focus most of your time on the material that you struggle with. You can always review the things you know well on the last day before the test.

, When it comes time for finals, a study checklist is essential. Look through the study guide and prioritize what you need to study and put it on the list. If you struggle with a specific problem or concept while studying, add it to the checklist and take that with you when you visit your teacher or professor to ask questions.As you go through concepts, check them off and move on to the next one.
Include important assignments and reading on your checklist as well., Flashcards are a great way to organize and study. Make flashcards throughout the year on important concepts that you come across. Flashcards are really nice because they are easily transportable and you can flip through them at any time.


If you’re waiting in a long line or commuting, take out your flashcards and review.

, The best level of background noise is different for everyone, but in general, a quiet place is the best for studying. An ideal study space is in your home, perhaps at a kitchen table or in an office specific for studying.If you need more background noise, try a coffee shop.


Avoid making your bedroom a study space as this can lead to associating your place of sleep with stressful studying.

, You want the space to be comfortable, but not overly comfortable. Set up a desk and a comfortable chair. The desk should be about waist-height and the chair height should allow you to place your feet flat on the floor and rest your elbows on the table without scrunching. If using a computer, position it 18-30 inches away from you.Make sure the temperature isn’t too hot or too cold.
Avoid reading in your bed or on a comfy couch so you won’t fall asleep.

, If possible, make your study space near a window to get lots of natural light. If you are studying at night or don’t have access to a window, make sure you have a good lighting. Simple overhead lighting is often not enough. Get a desk lamp or a floor lamp to brighten your study space.Position lights so that there are no distracting shadows.
Avoid placing lights in a way that cause them to shine directly into your eyes.

, Once you get in the study zone, you do not want to be distracted by having to grab scissors or a piece of paper. Make sure you have everything you will need readily available. Some good things to have close-at-hand include:Calculator
Paper (lined and plain)
A glass of water and/or snacks
All necessary notes and textbooks
Calendar and to-do list

, Social media websites, cell phones, and television are some of the most distracting things when trying to study. Turn off your computer (or just the internet), turn your phone on silent (or leave it in another room), and turn off the T.V. Limiting the number of distractions around will help you focus and get your studying done.Tell your family you’re going to study so they also know not to distract you.
If you want to listen to music, background music is better for memory and retention than using headphones or earbuds.

, Clutter can be very distracting so clean it up to stay focused. When you are done studying, put everything back where it belongs. If you had snacks, take your plate back to the kitchen and throw away any garbage.Remove all non-essential items from your study space at the end of every study session.

, The best time to prepare a study schedule is at the beginning of the school year when you receive the syllabus for each course. Start by writing down all major homework assignments, quizzes, tests, and exams on your calendar.Color code your study schedule for each subject.
You can start a study schedule at any point in the year, but it is best to start as early as possible. You can even make individual study schedules for final exam time.

, Once you have the important dates on your calendar, add in other important study deadlines before these hard deadlines to stay on task. Add in tasks like “review lecture notes,” “skim textbook chapters,” “rework homework problems,” etc. Give yourself at least a week to study for big tests., Write down everything that you are obligated to do each day (classes, meetings, extracurricular activities, exercise, etc.) on your calendar. Once you have everything on your calendar, you can figure out how much free time you have each day. Make a list of all of the time you have for each day and how large the blocks of time are. Your schedule might look something like this:Mon: two 2-hr blocks
Tues: three 1-hr blocks
Wed: 4 hrs
Thurs: two 2-hr blocks
Sun: 6 hrs

, The material that you need to cover each week will change, but take a look at your schedule at the beginning of each week or for the next two weeks and plan what you are going to work on. You may need to read for one class, do homework for another, or work on a project for a third.One-hour blocks of time between classes are a great time to review notes or flip through flashcards. Take advantage of these times and you could add 4-8 hours of study time to your schedule.

, If you have large blocks of study time on the weekends, make sure you schedule in breaks. If you have five hours of time to study, take a 30 minute break in the middle to give your brain time to process and decompress.If you find you are easily distracted, try setting a timer and working in 20-30 minutes chunks with a short 5-minute break between chunks.
You also want to make sure you have time for fun and social activities. Don’t schedule every second of free time for studying because you will be unlikely to stick to that.

, A schedule is only good if you actually follow it.The study schedule is not absolute. If you need to revise it as you go along, definitely do that. You may find that you work a lot better during the morning and have trouble working in the afternoon. Use this information to your advantage and try to maximize your morning study time.Schedule the more important and/or difficult material for your best study times. Work on easier material when you are not at your best.
Make sure your schedule is flexible and can accommodate emergencies or conflicts as they may arise."

Ask what the grade point average (GPA) requirements are as well as if there are any other necessary qualifications. Find out if there are any extracurricular requirements, like joining a club, participating in afterschool activities, or playing an instrument in the school band or orchestra.There may also be behavioral requirements related to being on the honor roll. So make sure you behave well and treat others with respect.
You can also try talking to your guidance counselor to find out more about what it takes to meet the honor roll requirements.;
, Some courses (such as honors or AP classes) are given extra weight in your GPA calculations. This is intended to make up for the difference in grades based on the amount of effort it takes to achieve them. You need to keep this in mind when choosing your classes.In most schools, you can still be on the honor roll without taking honors or AP classes. So it might be a smarter idea to take the regular classes where you have a better chance of making an A.
However, if you plan on attending college, taking AP classes is important. So it’s probably worth the extra effort to take the honors/AP classes.
For example, you might have to work really hard to make a B in an AP class whereas you could have made an A in the regular version of the same class., It is easy to think of the honor roll as a holistic performance evaluation, but you need to also consider the smaller parts that make up the whole. Making good grades in each individual assignment is just as important as thinking about the whole picture.Keep track of upcoming tests, quizzes and exams so that you can plan to study them. Generally, these assignments are worth a very large amount of your grade so getting good grades on them is important.
Never stay up late before such an assignment so you can be well-rested and awake.

, This is important so that you can keep track of what areas you need to focus on and how much. Generally, focus on lower grades but don't work so hard at them that you allow your other grades to drop.If you have excellent grades in one class, you’ll just need to work hard enough to maintain that grade. But if you have a lower grade in another class, you’ll have to work harder to make up the difference
Remember to always communicate with your teachers. If you have questions about class assignments or your performance in class, talk to your teachers about it. They are there to help you.
Similarly, if you are struggling with a subject or if you have a schedule conflict and have to miss a few classes, be sure to tell your teacher as soon as possible. The more advanced notice you give them, the more flexible they can be to help you.

, The first big step toward making the honor roll is making sure that you pay attention in class. This is crucial so that you can understand what is being taught and ask questions if need be.If you don’t pay attention, you’ll miss learning the material as well as comments about homework assignments, projects, and other graded assignments.

, Whether at school, in a study hall, or at home – always make time to do your homework. One missed assignment usually will not harm a class grade significantly, but many missed assignments in a row will.Remember – homework is intended to increase your understanding and help you find what you need to learn. Take advantage of that, and come to class with questions about it if you don't understand.
Never leave assignments and study time for the last minute. Procrastinating will not get you the grades you need to get on the honor roll.

, You want to turn in interesting, polished writing assignments. This means that they shouldn’t have spelling or grammatical errors. Be sure to make it interesting to read and never repeat yourself.If you can, choose a topic you’re excited about. This will make the assignment more interesting to read for your teacher.
Answer the assignment question thoroughly and don’t get off topic. Develop a clear thesis statement that helps you stay on topic throughout.
If your teacher gives a specific essay format, be sure to follow it in order to avoid losing points that could have been saved easily.
Make sure you proofread your writing assignments thoroughly before handing them in. You don’t want to turn in assignments with careless mistakes you could have easily fixed.

, Talk with teachers and get help with subjects you don't understand. Your teachers will be happy to help you if you come to them after class or during office hours and tell them that you are struggling. Show them that you care about your grades by going the extra mile to ask for help.If you don't get one concept, or have a question, be sure to ask the teacher. There's no such thing as a stupid question.
If you're studying or doing homework at home and don't get a problem, ask your parents or call a friend who has the same class. If they don't know the answer, make sure to come into school, ready to ask your teacher.

, This makes it easier to study for tests and keeps all your notes fresh in your mind in the event of a pop-quiz or even just for class participation. Reviewing topics daily will help you stay on top of your studies and prepare for whatever happens in the classroom on a daily basis.Reviewing for exams a little bit each night means you will absorb much more of the information than if you wait to cram it all in at the last minute the night before the test.
Always have time set aside to study and search for techniques that work for you.

, Always take thorough notes in class. Be sure that your notes are easily readable and contain everything you need. Trying to study notes that are incomplete or illegible is a waste of your valuable time and making the honor roll requires organized study routines.Try to organize your notes as you write them (with bullet points) so that they make sense later.

, Show that you are a well-rounded student by joining some extracurricular activities. Being on the honor roll is more than just about making good grades. It means that you are an exemplary student that your school is proud of. Participating in extra activities on campus will help your school administrators and teachers view you as an involved student.You could run for class president, become the treasurer of your school’s chapter of the Environmental Society, or start playing the violin in orchestra class.

, Being stressed out all the time will make you unhappy and, in the end, it could cause your grades to drop. Take some time to enjoy life, but remember to keep up with your work and your review.Go to a movie with your friends or go on a weekend trip with your family. Spend some time reading a book for pleasure or playing sports with your neighbors.
Avoid expecting too much from yourself or setting unrealistic expectations.
Don't focus on school so much that it consumes your life. While school is always the priority, be sure to get involved in other things as well.

Force yourself to be accountable.",How to Get Motivated to Do Well at School," If you are a student, it is your job to be a student. In general, students who succeed are most often those who accept the difficult aspects of that fact with a positive attitude.;
, If school is your job, then your job might have weird hours, especially if you are in college. Map out the projects you have and give yourself deadlines for certain segments of each project. Also, give yourself enough time to look over the final product. As you plan, be honest about which courses are more time consuming.

, Whether you are in high school or college, figure out what you want to do when you grow up. But don't stop there. Find someone who has what you want and ask for fifteen minutes of their time to find out how she or he did it, even if this someone is a CEO. Prepare questions that address the amount and types of work involved and how the person succeeded. Then, write a thank-you note to that person. This technique is far more beneficial than just trying to get good grades because that is what you are supposed to do. Talking with someone who has achieved your goals allows you to encounter the reality of what it takes to get what you want.

, If you are in high school, ask your teacher about your grade after class or after school. If you are in college, read your syllabus and find out how your grade is broken down, i.e., how much each test affects the final grade. If attendance is part of your grade, keep track of that too. If participation is part of your grade, ask your professor or TA what adequate participation is and then do more. If you have questions after reading your syllabus, then email your professor.

, In high school, this one is easy. In college, courses often have a professor and a handful of TAs. The professor lectures, the TA runs discussion sections and grades certain tests and papers. The professor may grade the final, or nothing at all. Professors sometimes communicate poorly with their TAs and often leave it up to them to figure out guidelines for whatever they are grading. Be sure to have clarity on this issue and follow up with each major assignment.

, Some states send the police after high school students who are always absent. In college, no one cares. Most college students do poorly when they do not attend class on a regular basis. Often, this does not become a problem until it is too late. Professors or TAs will purposely not review material in order to reward those who have attended regularly. Remember, this is a job. Also, do not get in the habit of having a friend tell you what you missed. Eventually you will be in a class where you do not know a soul, or you will get to grad school without the right level of discipline.

, If you are in high school or in a college seminar with a couple dozen students, then be cordial and polite. If you are in a college lecture hall with hundreds of other students, act the way you would if you were seeing a play. Drop by your professor's office hours and talk about points from class that interest you, even if these points only interest you somewhat. This same point applies to classes run by a TA, which are usually small. Interacting with your teachers is a form of networking.

, Go to class like you would go to a job. Don't browse social media, text, or talk. High school teachers are more likely to call you out on it with little actual punishment. In college, you might be asked to leave or drop the class. You get the respect you give.

, Again, this all depends on the class size. Large lectures discourage questions, which are meant for the TA in discussion sections. If the class is a seminar with a few dozen students, participation is absolutely necessary. Being vocal in class helps your professor or TA remember you, and even if you ask questions that seem ""dumb,"" it shows them that you are genuinely engaged in the material.

, Teachers have heard every single excuse for why an assignment is late, why you were late, or why some other catastrophe hindered your performance in class. If you miss a deadline, own up to it, admit your mistake, and ask how to fix it.

, Part of your job as a student is to learn. A lot of learning involves getting direction from people who know more about a topic than you. When you ask for help, you ask to know more about something a person has dedicated his or her life to understanding.

, Inquire about grades in a professional manner. If you are not satisfied with a grade, ask about it privately during an appointment you made in advance. Ask what you can do next time to avoid making the mistake, or ask if it is possible to redo the assignment. Many professors will give opportunities for extra credit if a student asks about it in a timely manner (not the last class day).

, Join a group or a club that requires a certain GPA. Sports often have minimum GPAs, as do fraternities, sororities, and many internships.

Don’t be over-eager to answer questions in class.,
Allow others to excel.,
Ask questions only when you need to.,
Pay attention in class, but don’t over-share.,
Be open to criticism.",How to Get Good Grades Without Being a Know It All1," Allow other students to have a chance to answer. Teachers ask questions to get students to participate; if you’re constantly answering first, you’re not helping! Resist the urge to show the class that you know the answer. Show your knowledge when it counts—on the test! If the teacher repeats the questions several times and no one else knows the answer, raise your hand quietly and wait to be called on.;
, If you're smart, everyone probably already knows. It doesn’t have to be a competition to be the smartest all the time. This doesn't mean pretending to be less smart in order to make others feel better; it means sometimes staying quiet to give others a chance to demonstrate what they know.


Don’t talk over other people. If someone starts to speak, let them say what they're trying to say.
Don’t assume your ideas are better than everyone else’s. There are many ways of doing things. Let others have a chance to lead.
When working in a group, let others do play their roles. Allow someone else to lead the group. Your group will likely choose to divide the work into parts; make sure you only do yours, and don’t tell others how to do theirs.
If the teacher praises a project you’ve worked on with a group or a partner, give credit to other group members. You might say, “Thank you! I typed up the information, and Billy created the slideshow!”
Compliment other students when they do good work, answer a tough question, or get a good grade on a test. Something as simple as, “Wow, that test was hard, and you got an A. That’s awesome!”

, Don’t ask questions that are not relevant to the topic at hand, or that branch off and distract the teacher or the class. For instance, if the teacher is discussing a specific method for solving a math problem, don’t ask about alternative ways to solve it. However, if you didn’t understand the method or had trouble solving a homework problem, ask for clarity. Make sure you listen to the full answer, even if you think you already understand. , Know-it-alls are known for constantly adding their two cents to any conversation. It isn’t necessary to add real-life examples to a teacher’s lecture unless the teacher asks students to share some. If you do contribute to a conversation, raise your hand quietly and wait until you are called on. Don’t do this more than once or twice in a lecture.

, You don’t need to be right all the time about everything. It is normal to make mistakes. When you do, accept responsibility and criticism gracefully. If someone points out something you’ve messed up on, simply say, “Oh wow, you’re right. I see what you mean.” Being wrong from time to time is no big deal.

"
Ask other people questions about themselves.,
Have a hobby or try a sport.,
Be friendly and warm.,
Laugh at yourself sometimes.,
Avoid beginning any sentence with the word “actually” or “obviously.” The first just sounds condescending and argumentative.",How to Get Good Grades Without Being a Know It All2," Be sure to discuss things other than schoolwork. Outside of the classroom or study sessions, relate to people about topics that interest everyone involved. If you don’t know how to start a conversation, it is always okay to ask others questions about themselves. For instance, you could ask them what they did over the weekend, or ask their opinion about a movie you haven’t seen yet. , Know-it-alls are often that way because they want to be defined as the smartest person in the room. A club, sport, or hobby will give you something more to focus on than just being the smartest. It will also give you something to talk to people about.

, Know-it-alls are often so fiercely competitive at trying to be the smartest that they can be selfish and even sometimes rude. Smile and make eye contact with people when you pass them in the hallway. Ask them how they are doing, and listen to the answer with your full attention.

, Like admitting mistakes, being able to laugh at yourself requires you to be able to gracefully accept a shortcoming or minor falter. Maybe you just found out you have been mispronouncing a word or song lyric for years—no one will think less of you for this, but they may find it funny. Learn to relax and laugh with them.

, “Obviously” makes it sound like everyone should already know the thing you’re saying, and can make people feel bad. Definitely pay attention to how you talk to people, and be careful with these two words. "

Develop good study habits.,
Practice good attendance and be on time.,
Follow directions.,
Don't brag when you get good test scores.",How to Get Good Grades Without Being a Know It All3," Most class grades are comprised of homework, participation, and test scores. In addition to better test scores, good study habits require good time management, organization, and attention to detail. These things will help you in all aspects of your classes. Have a goal. Studying for a test can be overwhelming if you don’t have a plan and a clear place to start. Decide ahead of time how long you plan to study, and how much information you want to cover in each study session. Read ahead. Before you come to class, read the material that will be covered. This will give you a chance to ask questions in class about anything you didn’t already understand.
Highlight important information as you read, so you can go back and focus on the highlighted material when you’re studying.
Make flash cards. These are especially good for studying foreign languages, science, or other subjects that focus on vocabulary words. Write the word on one side of the card, and the definition on the other. As you flip to a new word, give the definition. If you don’t know one, put it in a separate pile and go back to focus on that pile afterward.
Do practice problems. Math problems require repetition. Do as many as you can! You can find them in the back of your textbook, online, or you can ask your instructor to provide additional practice problems.

, Do not miss class unless it is an emergency, and do not disrupt the class by showing up late. Your instructor is paid to teach you—he can’t do that if you’re not there In addition, avoid bragging about your perfect attendance record!, Know-it-alls are often so busy talking that they don’t listen, and end up missing out on the most basic of instructions. Pay close attention to what the instructor is asking you to do, and follow those instructions closely. This will help you to score better on tests and other coursework, and reduce the amount of time you’ll need to spend fixing your errors. , You're working hard, and it is likely noticeable to others. You don't need to hide your test scores, but you also don't need to point out your success to others--especially anyone who might be struggling with their own grades.

Get organized!!,
Get a planner.,
Take notes and study with them!,

Know when you have a quiz or test.,
Ask questions.,
Find out if you can do any extra credit.,
If you have a substitute, ask the teacher or a friend to help.,
Develop a friendship with your teacher.",How to Get Good Grades in Middle School," A HUGE part of middle school is being organized. You need to have a binder. Try to get folders with inserts or dividers to put in the binder. This will help you to stay organized by color and by class. If you have all your papers together and not separated you'll get disorganized and you won't be able to succeed! Also get a folder for each class. A plastic one is best because they last the whole year. Use these for homework and for any loose handouts. Get a notebook for each class, too, so you can take notes, from which you can study for your tests. When you get homework, schoolwork, or anything else, always put the date, subject, and teacher name so when you do organize, it will be easier to find things. The more organized you are, the easier to keep track of school events and homework.;
, You should get a calendar, planner, or agenda. This way, you can write each of your assignments, tests, quizzes, projects, essays and notifications such as dances, field trips, or holidays. Make sure that you actually use it daily. There's really no point in purchasing equipment that you don't use.

, When you hear a test or a quiz is coming up, immediately write it in your homework book and start planning study time. If you have 3 days before a quiz then study for 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening until the test or quiz. It's very helpful to write the problems and answer them because they will stick in your head. Also, make sure your notes are readable. If your notes aren't readable, how can you use them as a study tool?


It helps to have a study group so you can all get prepared for the test. You can even study with one person if that's all you have!

, An important part of getting good grades is finishing and turning in homework on time. Take as much time as you can to finish your homework. Don't leave it until the last minute because that will stress you out and you won't be able to complete your homework effectively.

, If you put off too many things you will not get good grades. Remember to do homework first. Not track, choir, or anything else. School always comes first.

, If you can make it match the work you're doing it'll be a lot more entertaining. Just be sure not to get distracted.

, Study a lot for the ones you're bad at. The hardest subject is usually math because memorizing the answers won't work. Go over previous quizzes and tests. Realize your mistakes and don't do them again!

, Your teachers are there to help you. They sometimes love questions. If you are confused about something, drop in during lunch or free time, after school or before school!

, This will help during the end of the quarter or trimester or semester. If you have an 85% in the class and you really want an A, do the extra credit! Always ask early; you don't want to wait! Before depending whether you should ask for extra credit work, consult your teacher and make sure they accept extra credit, whereas many teachers will not.

, They can always help you if they get the problem.

, This will make your teacher more willing to answer questions, share information, etc. Make friends with your teacher by introducing yourself on the very first day of school, answering any questions they may have, and being polite. Show your teacher that you are a good student. Do this by asking questions, putting lots of effort into your schoolwork, using your free time to do extra research, doing your work without being distracted by talking to your friends, and always following your teacher's rules. Doing this will make your teacher think you deserve to get good grades. Now that you have developed a friendship with your teacher, and proven to them that you are a good student, it’s time to sit down with them and ask them what exactly you have to do to get a four in every subject. If your teacher is your friend, and thinks you are a good student, they will be happy to share. Write down everything that they tell you, and do it. Knowing exactly what your teacher expects of you, will make the chances of getting good grades, much better.

As well as following the instructions that your teacher gives you, do extra work that they didn't mention, such as reading the dictionary a lot to find the meanings of long words that most kids your age don’t know so your teacher will think you are smart.

Apply your economic knowledge to everyday situations.,
Tutor a younger student.",How to Get Good Grades in Economics," When starting to study economics, immerse yourself in existing academic literature on the topic. Browse your library’s economics section. Read newspapers like The Financial Times or magazines like The Economist. Renowned economics blogs like Economist’s Viewor Grasping Realityare good sources for up-to-date information.


Ask a librarian if you need assistance finding the economics section.
Podcasts are a great way to gain entrance into economics. For example, you could listen to NPR's Planet Money.
Economic books that are written for the masses and are easier to understand include Freakonomics, The Naked Economist, and The Armchair Economist.;
, The economy is tied to political decisions, the environment, weather, and social movements. Stay up-to-date on what is happening in the world. Try to gather a range of perspectives. Although you might favor CNN, check out Fox News occasionally. If you are based in the U.S., be sure to access non-American sources as well. The BBC or Al-Jazeera offer English-language programming. For econ-specific programs, check out the following:


CNN's Richard Quest offers the business oriented show ""Quest Means Business.""
CNBC offers the programs Kudlow's Corner and Mad Money with Jim Cramer.Fox Business provides EMac's Bottom Line., When prominent economists visit your campus, attend their talks. This will give you insight into new developments in the field. Although the knowledge you acquire might not be related directly to your next test, you might be able to use an example from a lecture in an essay question. It is likely that some concepts about which you’ve learned (e.g. supply and demand) will come out in the lecture. Hearing concepts applied to practical situations will help cement your knowledge.

, Read all assigned readings. Write down any new vocabulary, theories, models, graphs, or measures. Notate any questions you might have.Read an article's introduction and conclusion carefully.Authors often use the introduction to outline the lecture's material. The conclusion could serve as a summary and help you see if you missed anything.
Plan to spend two hours of studying for every one hour in class., When taking your economics classes, try to sit in the front of the classroom. Your teacher is more likely to see you, recognize you, and be willing to help you. Additionally, there will be fewer distractions (e.g. other people’s laptops) to keep you from the lecture.

, When your professor is giving a lecture, take thorough notes. While you don’t need to copy every word she says, try to craft an outline of her ideas. Create a wide lefthand margin for summarizing content. Fill in each segment with sub-points and facts. Write down any important definitions. Leave a smaller righthand margin for your own thoughts on the material.If your professor says, “this will be on the exam,” take note!


If your professor provides a PowerPoint, fill in the presentation with extra details. It is unlikely she will give you all the information upfront.
Taking notes by hand is actually better for memory retention than taking notes on a laptop. If you have time, take notes by hand and later type them.
Draw your own versions of graphs. When your professor draws a graph to illustrate a concept on the blackboard, draw your own version. Even if she gives you a print out, practice drawing and labeling the graph. You likely will need to reproduce this skill later.
Focus on the connection between ideas that your professor is explaining or has mentioned previously.Aim to understand the logic between numbers in a mathematical problem. If you don't understand the concept, draw a question mark in your notes and ask a classmate or your TA later., You are more likely to remember what happened in class if you participate. Ask questions when you have them. Answer questions that you know. Engage in debates. Offer to draw graphs. Many classes have a participation grade but even if they don’t, being an active learner will help you get better grades.


Use class time to clarify misunderstandings about the material being covered rather than to ask logistical questions.For example, rather than asking ""What's the reading for next week?,"" look at your syllabus. A good question would be, ""Could you please explain how you produced that figure? I did not quite understand.""

, When you get your exam, immediately write down any formulas, theories, or key terms that you think you might want to recall during the test. Read the entire test and pay attention to how many points are given to each section. Read all directions slowly and carefully. Then begin with questions about which you feel confident.Keep in mind requirements for your writing equipment. If you must use a pen, do so.Look to see if any questions are similar to questions you went over in class.When answering multiple choice or true or false questions, look out for words like ""never, sometimes, always, or none."" Be sure your answer fits an answer for whichever word is included.For essay questions, be sure to include a graph if one is asked for. Follow the directions carefully. If the prompt says to ""explain"" something, do so. If it asks you to draw a diagram and identify certain markers, do this as well.Write legibly and budget your time wisely., The day after your class, review your notes. If you wrote them by hand, make sure you can read your writing. If not, correct it. It is easier to correct poor penmanship earlier than after you have forgotten what you have written. Quiz yourself on any new key terms.Use highlighters, colored pens, pencils, and sticky notes to highlight important points.

, Look at the units of measurement for each axis. What is the relationship between the axes? What concept is the graph trying to explain (e.g. supply and demand curves)?Why do the lines slope in the directions they do?, Although you likely are busy, aim to get your homework done in advance. This way, if you have questions, you can ask your professor or teaching assistant (TA) before your homework is due. If you complete your homework at the last minute, do not expect your TA to email you back at 3 a.m.


When doing your assigned reading, create questions before you read based on the main concepts you are discussing in class or the theme the reading should address. Read while seeking answers to those questions., By reviewing your notes, you are inadvertently studying for future exams. Continue this process by reviewing graded homework assignments when receiving them. Ask your teachers about any confusion you have regarding answers that you did not get right.


If your teachers do not discuss the test format, ask. Request information on what types of questions will be ask and how many points will be allotted to each section., Bring together the main ideas from each homework assignment, quiz, or paper. Explain each concept in writing. Share your guide with a classmate to check whether your understandings of the material are the same.


Define the top five or six key terms per chapter. Write down the key ideas and draw the most essential graph of each chapter. Give examples of a numerical problem and an algebraic problem. Use different amounts and numbers than the examples given in class.Write your own exam questions and practice answering them.Make flashcards for vocabulary terms.
Hire a tutor. If you are having trouble understanding economics, consider hiring a tutor for extra individual help.

, Your professor and TAs have office hours: use them. If you have any questions, bring them to office hours. Attending office hours is a good way to build a professional relationship with your instructors as well. Perhaps you would like to develop your own economics research project. Your instructor is more likely to mentor you if he knows you.


Do not expect your professors to be available 24/7 via email or phone. Office hours exist for a reason and email does not supplant the function of office hours.

, When studying for a difficult exam or doing a tedious homework assignment, remember why you are studying economics. Perhaps you want to work for the National Economic Council at the White House. Maybe you want to be a college professor yourself some day. Having a list near your desk of what you want to achieve with your economic knowledge will help you stay motivated.

, One way to remember the information you learn is to communicate it to others. Gather a few classmates and form a study group. You can quiz each other before exams and practice applying theories to case studies.


Try to form a group of students with similar academic abilities. This will optimize your study time and ability to assist one another.
Aim for no more than six people in your group. Larger groups tend to lose focus more easily.

, The great thing about studying economics is that it is relevant to your everyday life. For example, you can apply the concept of scarcity to your budget. Resources are not unlimited and you need to plan for their use. Look for moments while shopping or planning your money when you can apply economic theories.


You could use the theory of marginal utility, or buying goods that give you the highest pleasure for the cost. For example, you could spend $10 on an economics handbook or $10 on a movie ticket. While you might enjoy the movie for two hours, the handbook could help you receive an A in economics, which could lead to graduate school, and a promising career. The lasting returns of the handbook are higher.Diminishing returns works when considering whether to get a second latte, for example. The first latte might have tasted wonderful. It cost $3.50 and was worth every cent to you. You would like a little more but probably would only drink ⅓ of the second drink, which also will cost $3.50. The utility (satisfaction) of the second latte is considerably lower so it is not a wise decision to purchase one.

, When studying economics, one way to solidify your knowledge of the basics is to review previous material by tutoring younger students. If you are a junior, for example, consider tutoring a first year college student. This will also be economically beneficial in the sense that you will earn money.

Leave envelopes unopened.,
Write “Return to Sender” on the envelopes.,
Drop it in the mail.",How to Stop Junk Mail by Sending it Back1," It’s frustrating enough to get junk mail, such as credit card offers and charity donation requests, everyday, but having to open them to send them back just makes the process more tedious. Instead, leave the mail alone, so it remains just as you received it., When a piece of a mail is marked in such a way, the post office will send the item back to its original source. If the company that’s sending you the junk mail receives the correspondence back, it will hopefully get message that you don’t wish to receive any more mail in the future. Make sure to write in clear, legible print, so the message is easy to read.When you’re marking the envelope, it’s a good idea to use a felt tip marker that won’t smear if it gets wet.
If your handwriting is difficult to read, you may want to use block letters to ensure that the “Return to Sender” message is clear.

, Once you write “Return to Sender” on your junk mail, there’s no need to add postage. Simply place it in the mail as you would with any other item that you wish to send through the postal service.You can place the junk mail that you wish to return in a mailbox, but it’s usually better to hand it to your mail carrier or take it directly to the post office. That’s because if it goes through the automated system without a worker doesn’t specifically seeing the “Return to Sender” message on the mail, it may wind up back in your mail a few days later.

"
"
Open the envelopes.,
Gather the pre-paid return envelopes.,
Write a note.,
Mail it back.",How to Stop Junk Mail by Sending it Back2," If you’ve tried sending your junk mail back via a “Return to Sender” message, and it still keeps turning up in your mailbox, you may need to take a more direct approach to get it to stop. That means you’ll need to open the junk mail, so you can sort through the items in each envelope.If you get a lot of junk mail, opening up the envelopes can be an annoying process. You may want to collect it on a weekly basis and open it all in one sitting instead of doing it each day.

, When it comes to junk mail such as credit card offers and charity donation requests, the companies usually include a return envelope with pre-paid postage, so you can return the credit application, charity donation, or other requested item. After you’ve opened the mail, set aside all of the return envelopes, so you can correspond with the company without paying for postage., Even if you’ve sent previous correspondence back “Return to Sender,” your name still might not come off the company’s mailing list. Making a written request that you stop receiving the mail may be necessary to put an end to the correspondence.Be polite but firm in the note. Don’t resort to foul or abusive language.
If you’re not sure what to write, try something simple like “Please remove me from your mailing list. I do not wish to receive any future offers/solicitations, etc.”
Make sure to include your name and mailing address on the note because your contact information will not be on the pre-paid return envelope.

, Because you’re using the pre-paid envelope, there’s no need to add any postage to the note. You can drop it in any mailbox or leave it for your mail carrier to pick up when he makes the next delivery."
"
Gather pre-paid return envelopes.,
Collect some junk to stuff in the envelopes.,
Send the envelopes back.",How to Stop Junk Mail by Sending it Back3," Just as when you’re writing a note to ask a company to stop sending correspondence, you want to take advantage of the envelopes that they include for you to send items back, so you don’t have to pay for postage.You may want to save multiple return envelopes from the same company or organization. The more that you send back to them, the more likely they are to notice.

, If a note asking a company to stop sending junk mail doesn’t get your name off their mailing list, you may want to make more of a statement. Stuffing the pre-paid envelope with items from around the house makes it weigh more, so the company has to pay more when you send it back to them, which will hopefully make them think twice about sending you junk mail. Stuffing the envelopes with paper items, such as napkins, newspaper or magazine clippings, a deck of cards, or confetti, is usually the easiest way to go.
Stuff the envelopes until they can’t hold any more material. If you’re worried that they won’t stay shut, you may want to reinforce the closure with tape.

, It’s best to drop them in a mailbox because they’ll be sorted by an automated system. A mail carrier or post office clerk might notice an extra thick envelope, and throw it away, so it may not actually get back to the company."

Acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses.,
Revise everyday.,
Minimize your time to procrastinate.,
Time Management.,
Relax once in a while.,
Focus on all subjects.",How to Get Good Grades in International Baccalaureate Diploma (IB)," What makes IB unique from other high school programs is the breadth of knowledge offered. IB forces you to focus on all 6 subjects. Therefore, the first step is to acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses in every subject.;
, This cannot be stressed enough. Without revising, all those lectures that your teacher gave to you today will just be another waste of time. You don't have to take 5 hours to revise. As soon as you get home, get a blank notebook and write about what you've learnt today in school. If you feel like you're forgetting something, open up your notes and read the parts you forgot. Then, go back to your notebook and write what you remembered from skimming those notes. For example, If you were introduced a new mathematics formula, immediately memorize that formula the same day. And follow through with that some more by going into your textbook and practising some questions that go along with the formula you just memorized. This is all part of good work ethic.

, Every time you find yourself starting to procrastinate, just remember that you won't achieve anything at all.

, Learn to manage your time from the littlest things (like how much time you take to shower, etc) to the bigger ones. This will aid you in coping with IB. For example, take shorter showers, study one hour for each subject etc.

, Release yourself from the death-air of IB and inhale the fresh air. You never want to have all the stress from the year's work build up, this can cause it many health issues. When you find that you have a little spare time on your hands, take this opportunity to have fun and do what you love! Even if it's only for a few hours, just let yourself go and release the stress and tension. Go for a walk or a jog, sit on your front porch and watch the rain fall! Read your favourite magazine while sipping an ice vanilla latte. etc.

, Don't turn a blind eye to subjects that you're already good at. Focus on all your subjects in school. When you get home it is important that you take at least 30 minutes-1 hour for each subject, review that days lesson and you'll feel ready for tomorrows lesson!

Go for First Three Months.,
Start post-JC plans.,
Get serious.,
Be consistent.,
Understand your work.,
Be realistic.",How to Get Good Grades in a Singaporean Junior College," The Provisional Admission Exercise (PAE) aka 'first three months' that lasts for 2 to 3 months before you receive your General Certificate of Examinations Ordinary Level (GCE 'O' Levels) result slips in March is a time where you could take a taste of life in a JC, gauging your L1R5 grades(L1R4 for Millennia Institute) for your school-based preliminary examinations prior to your 'O' Levels. Although optional, go for it! You would have fun in your allocated JC by making loads of new friends from different schools scattered all across the island, going for daily class outings, come to school late, et cetera, et cetera. However, do note not have too much fun and do take your tutorials and lectures seriously. During 'first three months', the classes would be taken at a significantly slower pace compared to the real thing, which gives you a head-start compared to others who chose not to attend 'first three months'.;
, Which university and what course do you wish to take? It is better to have the answers for these questions in mind before choosing your subject combination, so you can consider taking subjects you can excel in or taking relevant subjects to a university course you aspire to take.

, JC is the polar opposite of 'first three months'. Do not fool around once you enter the real JC world. The pace would now be insanely fast due to time constraints. Take your tutorials and lectures dead serious and do not miss any classes. Take all your minor tests seriously and study hard for them, as they constitute your Continual Assessment (CA) marks, which could save you from being retained at the end of the year.

, A great number of JC students have overlooked this aspect, preventing them from attaining good grades. Unlike studying in a secondary school, you cannot leave things up to the last minute before start revising your work before any major exam. You have to keep revising your work from day one so your knowledge is at your fingertips at any time, which can greatly reduce the amount of time you can spend studying for your major exams which you can shift more time to practicing.

, Studying hard but remembering your facts wrongly will not help you. Some hardworking people have succumbed to this aspect and retained their first year in JC. Make sure you know that you have studied the right facts by consulting your tutors or academically strong friends.

, Do not set goals that you can't reach. You will only disappoint yourself if you try to be something you're not. If you were always weak in your studies, don't immediately aim to be the academic leader for your next major exam, but keep that ultimate goal in view, so you can tackle one exam at a time, jumping one grade at a time to achieve it eventually.

Figure out your school’s or teacher’s grading policies.,
Pick easy classes.,
Plan out your time wisely.,
Start studying early on.",How to Get Great Grades With No Effort1," The best way to set a solid foundation is to thoroughly understand the rules of the grading game. Does your teacher give more points for one assignment over another? If so, it might behoove you to pay more attention to one assignment over another. If you are in high school, are some classes worth more — e.g. AP courses? If so, you’ll want to concentrate your efforts there. In most states, AP classes are actually worth more towards your overall GPA, but the classes are more demanding. This is not to mention that AP courses replace college courses. So if you'd like to skip core or introductory college classes, then focus on your AP studies.;
, Look at previous syllabi and talk to other students. Figure out what each class looks like ahead of time and pick the one that seems the easiest.


In any educational program, you’ll have a set of mandatory classes and electives. Sometimes, the elective courses can be filled by a variety of subjects. If your goal is to “get good grades with no effort”, choose a subject you feel comfortable with, you think is easy, or you’ve already mastered. Keep in mind that there is no universal “easy A” class. It all depends on the teacher. A “shop” class can be very easy or really difficult. So too can a trigonometry class be a piece of cake or a terrible experience.

, Use a day planner to schedule your class time, study time, and time for all of the other activities you have to complete over the course of the semester. At the beginning of the year, map out when your assignments are due and even include reminders to get started on assignments. Time management is the key to getting good grades efficiently., Many of us have a tendency to put school work off. Time with family and friends seem to take greater preference especially as the deadline for a particular assignment seems so far away. In order to do well in school, you need to start at the beginning of term. Get a solid foundation at the beginning of the school year so you aren’t stressing at the end. Get good grades from the beginning. It takes much less effort to maintain good grades than it does to build up to them.Take advantage of all extra credit opportunities. Oftentimes, teachers give out extra credit work that is of the same difficulty or easier than your “normal” work. Because you can’t lose points for completing the extra credit, you can only gain from trying.

Make a great first impression.,
Pay attention in class.,
Participate in class.,
Be open about your weaknesses and ask for help.,
Sit in the front row in class.,
Take amazing notes.",How to Get Great Grades With No Effort2," We all form first impressions. And we all continue to judge others based on first impressions we’ve taken of them. When you first meet your teacher, make sure that you are polite, hard-working, respectful, and ready to learn. It is possible that when your teacher goes to grade your assignment, they’ll be guided by the kind feelings they have towards you. They might be more likely to let an error slide and an inconsistency pass. The result of this may only be a couple of points, but those points add up., Do you tend to stare out of the window? Do you doodle nonstop while the teacher is talking? Do you pass notes constantly? All of these activities are common faux-pas. In the classroom, your goal should be to absorb as much information as possible. Doing so will reduce the time needed to comprehend the material later. Homework will become infinitely easier and take a fraction of the time used when you’re having to teach yourself the material.Take all the necessary steps before class to reduce distractions. Feed yourself. Get some sleep. Make phone calls ahead of time or take the time to text before entering the class., Ask questions. Answer your teacher’s questions. Participate in class dialogues. This step is essential for two reasons. First, it manages your teacher’s expectations further. It makes you seem like a motivated student. More importantly, if you take time to ask questions in class, you’ll probably understand the material better later on and will require less time to study or complete homework., Maybe this seems counterintuitive, but teachers need to know what their students don’t get. If you are open about not understanding the significance of asymptotes, the function of the mitochondria, or how to use a semicolon, your teacher will spend more time on the subject, which will help you in the long run to reduce the amount of work you have to complete. Furthermore, your teacher might cut you some slack if he sees you struggling with a subject.

, This will help you to focus and give the impression that you are willing to pay attention. Teachers know that serious students sit up front because it is difficult to hide things up front. You won’t be able to text or fall asleep without the teacher noticing.

, Many teachers test on their lectures exclusively or at least in addition to the materials found in the book. More importantly, your teacher will take the time to cover the most essential and perhaps the most difficult materials in class. Take excellent notes. Adopt a shorthand and be sure to note what your teacher spends more time on. More time spent covering it in class equals more likely it will be on the test.According to the Cornell note taking system, be sure to highlight key words and write questions you have in the margins of your notes. Then ask your teacher them when you next see them. Similarly, write out key questions that your teacher focuses on in the class. Most likely, you'll see those questions on a test later.

Identify and tackle busy work effectively.,
Tackle your assignments one at a time.,
Prioritize the bulk of your work based on difficulty and importance.,
Write papers efficiently.",How to Get Great Grades With No Effort3," Every teacher assigns some work that is either redundant or simply not necessary and in some cases, you may not need to complete it to understand the materials. Chances are other students do need the extra practice though. If the assignment is a worksheet or closely resembles something else you’ve done in the class, it is probably busy work. If this is the case, work through the busy work quickly. Don’t give it more time than is absolutely necessary. Just show your teacher you can do it and move on to more pressing assignments.

, Too often we try to complete several assignments in one sitting. Rather than inundating your brain with information, compartmentalize your school work. Finish your math homework, take a break, and come back to study for your science test 15 minutes later. This method will help you process the information.

, Start with the hardest or most important stuff first and then move to the easiest and least significant work. This way if you run out of time or steam, you’ll have the most important assignments done first.For example, complete your physics study guide assignment that is worth a significant portion of your grade before you do your English journal entry that is barely worth anything.

, There are three steps to writing a great paper — research, writing, and editing. Compartmentalize these steps. Compile all the info needed to complete the essay. Write the essay. Then edit it. Don’t blend these steps. It will take you longer to complete the essay as a whole and you’ll inevitably backtrack needlessly.


Don’t stress about each sentence while you’re writing. Get your basic ideas out on the page. And then go back and edit.When you go back to edit, you can use a thesaurus to help dress up your language.

Use your homework to study for tests.,
Take time to study.,
Study with others.,
Remember to relax.,
Don’t cheat.",How to Get Great Grades With No Effort4," Since you’ve put in time to complete homework for a grade or not, you might as well use it as a study guide. Most of the time, the key points that’ll be on the test will also be in the homework. You’ve likely completed several problems that’ll be on the test. You’ve likely completed diagrams that you’ll have to do on the test again. Don’t just throw away your homework. Use it to your advantage., Don’t put it off to the last minute. Your brain will learn and retain information better if it is constantly exposed to it. Cramming helps in the short-term, but you won’t remember the information very well for later assignments., One of the greatest pieces of advice concerning tests is that if you can teach someone else the material, then you know it well enough. So join a study group. Or ask friends and family members to study with you. They’ll be able to ask questions that you might not think about. Then when you are forced to answer them, you’ll either explain them in a way that makes you understand the material better or you’ll look up the answer. Either way, it makes for more efficient studying., When you are studying and when you are actually taking the test, be sure to relax. Even if you haven’t studied at all or enough, you won’t be able to concentrate if you freak out. If you have studied, chances are you’ll do much better if you can think with a clear head., This may seem like the easiest way to get good grades, but most likely the risks associated with getting the materials ahead of time or looking off of another’s paper will far outweigh the rewards, if you get caught."

SIZE MATTERS.,
HEFTY IS PRICEY.,
DESTINATION.,
TOGETHER OR APART?,
TAKING YOU FOR A FOOL.,
POSTAL SERVICES COST MORE.,
PADDED ENVELOPES.,
CUSTOM BOXES.,
DON'T ACCEPT A HIGH PRICE.",How to Ship With Private Parcel Services," It's true. The pricing of a package depends on several things; size, weight, and destination. If you pack an item yourself, select the smallest possible box (including any room for padding). Also remember that most stores round UP in sizing boxes! 12.3 inches (31.2 cm) will be rounded up to 13 inches (33.0 cm). Often this makes no difference, sometimes it does.;
, This should be fairly common sense. Items which weigh more also cost more to ship. When shipping through UPS Ground, the weight is often negligible (up to a certain weight.) If shipping through Air (next day or second day), weight is much more important on price. Always try to pack the box as light as possible.

, The destination usually can't be changed. The further away it is, the more expensive it is to ship. You really can't do much about this; however, a Rural Surcharge will be given if a house is not on the regular UPS route. In this case, try to find somewhere on route to ship to (such as a PO Box). When shipping a $5 package to a rural area, a charge of ~$4 is added!

, If you're shipping packages to the same place, it'll often be cheaper to consolidate all the packages into one box--the price of the box would be less than the fuel surcharge of each individual package. This is not always the case. Try using common sense--if you have only three packages, it's probably cheaper to ship them individually. If they're pre-boxed, you may be able to have the boxes taped together. This negates redundant fuel surcharges and the price of an additional box! Just watch out for being charged for over-sized packages.

, That's right. What you don't know can't hurt, right? When shipping Air or Second Day, multiple times are given. If you really don't care what time it gets there, always ask for the latest time ('End of Day delivery.') This will save you just a few dollars, but it's better than losing a few!

, Want a letter stamped and mailed? It'll cost more than it will at the post office. Want to buy some stamps? It'll still cost more. If it's a service of the USPS, go to the USPS office. It'll save you money.

, The average cheapest price of a UPS package is about $5. If you put, for example, a CD in a padded envelope, it'll cost at least $5 to ship it. The post office will ship it for $2 or less.

, Sometimes your item to be shipped is irregularly shaped. Sometimes they just don't have the box you need. Either way, paying for two or more boxes isn't usually fun. If you can, buy another box elsewhere or even make your own out of scrap boxes.

, Sometimes employees at the UPS Store will try to knock a few dollars off for you. If you say, ""Go ahead and try, but if you can't, that's OK"" then you have given them permission to ship your package as is, despite the employee having offered to try to lower the price.

Understand what you're studying.,
Create doubts.,
Do a quiz.,
Use videos to enhance your learning and understanding.,
Sit the quiz.,
Repeat the quiz at least four times doing 20/100 of the questions each time.,
Study well.,
Practice.,
Do something specific while you study that you can copy during the exam.,
Study with a friend.,
Use mnemonics to help you remember key concepts.,
Stay positive!",How to Get Good Percentage in Semester Exams," Rote learning will not get you to score a good percentage; it isn't helpful in most cases because it fails to cause you to think and analyze. The latter two skills are important for being able to apply your knowledge to new problems.


Write short notes or a summary of what you've studied.
Read out loud. This can help to sharpen your understanding, as you are listening as well.

, Ask yourself questions about the content of the chapter. Did you agree or disagree with it? What would you explain differently and why? What about the work you're studying is confusing or seems at odds with other information you know?


Ask your teachers, lecturers, professors about your doubts. Do some exploration to dig deeper. Such discussions can help cement the concepts deeply in your mind.

, Quiz yourself on your subject matter as a way of working out what you haven't grasped properly yet. There are websites that allow you to make a quiz, such as quizlet.com. One approach to using a quiz could be:


Make the quiz either online or on paper.
Title it. For example, History Midterm (or Final) Exam.
Add the date of the test. This helps to visually remind yourself of the approaching test date.
Add the vocabulary from the subject or chapters you're studying.
Add key information. For example: Who was in office during the Civil war? President Lincoln. Then make another row: What was this president's term in office? 1861-1865. Question yourself deeper in the question so it's easier to understand/remember.
If the test book has practice tests, add them to the set too.
Add information from your notes and question yourself on these.

, Watch videos on YouTube based on the same topic that you're learning. While watching videos, aim to picture the concepts and elements in your head.


CrashCourse is one good source of videos useful for learning.
Take notes of anything you don't understand or didn't remember, so that you can go back over these things after.
Add notes from the video to your quiz set.

, Start small, with about 20 questions from 60-100 of the terms and concepts you've added. Use any medium, such as multiple choice, matching, etc.


If using Quizlet, start with flashcards with audio, then scatter the questions and move to testing.

, Then move onto doing all 100 questions in a single sitting. Redo until you get 100 percent on the test.


The quiz learning should begin 3 to 4 weeks before the real exam or test. Cramming the night before will not work.

, Make sure you don't study a day before or on the day of exams. Start studying at least one month before the due date. Choose a location which is quiet, well lit enough lights and where you're not going to be interrupted or distracted.


Prepare a timetable for that particular month and study regularly. Take a break every 15 minutes, it refreshes the mind.

, Ask for or download copies of the previous year's question papers. Take these tests to see if you can solve them. Ask your guardian/parent/professors to evaluate it. This will give you more confidence and is a great way to remove any kind of exam fear. You know your stuff now!

, If you can replicate what you were doing when you were studying you will help your brain to remember what it was you were studying. For example, if you were chewing a particular flavor of gum while you were studying, you should chew that same flavor during the exam. One of the best things you can do is actually study in the room, in the desk, where you will take the exam.;
, Studying with friends makes the job seem easier and not so tedious. Just make sure that the friend you study with will actually help you, not just play around and waste your time. If you can, take a little time to explain certain things that you are studying to your friend, or have them quiz you on the things you need to learn. You'll be more likely to cement the facts in your head and recall them for the exam.

, Mnemonics are simply memorization techniques that can help you while you're studying. You can use acronyms to help you, chaining ideas together, or keywords (especially helpful for languages).


Acronyms: this is basically a combination of letters, each of which stands for an idea that you will need to remember. For example, the FOIL method in algebra stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, designating how you're supposed to do an algebraic problem.
Chaining creates a story where each word or idea you have to remember cues the next idea that you have to remember.
Keywords: for each foreign word you have to remember, pick an English word that sounds like it. Then you'd visualize an image that has both the English word and the foreign word in it. For example: ""cabina"" is the Spanish word for phone booth. Imagine a cab trying to fit inside a phone booth. You'll be able to recall the image, which will lead you to ""cabina.""

, If you visualize a successful outcome, you'll be more likely to actually have a successful outcome, than if you're neutral or negative in what you say about how well you're going to do on the exam. Tell yourself that you will do great. Be confident and don't lose hope.

Think about the material before you come to class.,
Go to class.,
Sit in the front row.,
Ask questions.,
Be interested.,
Always look for the main points.,
Take good notes.,
Don't get distracted.,
Type or review your notes after class.",How to Get Good Grades in Tests with Little Studying1," You usually know what your class is going to be about because your teacher assigned you some kind of material ahead of time. As you are getting to class, think about what you will be covering that day, mentally preparing yourself for the time ahead. This process will get you in the right frame of mind and help you absorb information better., If you're in high school, you really don't have the option not to show up, but in college, you're in charge of your own time. One of the easiest ways to earn good grades without studying much is to show up to your classes and listen to what your teacher has to say. That means not just showing up but being attentive as well.In addition, many professors will make attendance and participation a part of your grade. Therefore, just attending will contribute to you making better grades. If you don't show up enough, you lose those points., It may be tempting to sit in the back row, out of sight and mind of your professor. However, you'll be better able to see what your professor is writing on the board at the front, and you'll be able to hear her better. You'll also be less tempted to let your mind wander.

, If you're confused about something, don't be afraid to ask a question. Your teacher will be happy to shed some light on what's confusing you, and other students will likely have the same question.

, It may sound difficult to do, especially if the subject is something you don't like, such as math. However, start out by feigning interest, if you have to. Psych yourself up, saying how much you love math. Try to find parts of it that do interest you, even if it's a small part. Being interested in what you're learning helps you to take in information more effectively., Your teacher will likely clue you in to what's important by writing main ideas on the board or emphasizing it with her voice. She may even repeat the main ideas to make sure the class is understanding what's important. Constantly be asking yourself what the main ideas and main points are, so that you are using your time in class to think about and absorb the ideas., Taking good notes does not mean writing down every word your teacher says. In fact, that often means you aren't absorbing the information, just re-writing it on the page. You also won't be able to keep up, unless you are taking notes on a computer and can type very fast. Therefore, it's best to write down notes with a few words or short sentences that capture the main points.For instance, if your teacher says, ""We're talking about verbs today. Verbs are the action of the sentence. There are two main types of verbs, being and action verbs."" You could write: ""Verbs: action of sentence. 2 types: being, action.""
It's a good idea to use shorthand or abbreviations to make your writing faster, but be sure to be consistent so that you always know what you wrote.Though you can capture more with a computer, studies have shown that taking notes by hand actually helps you learn more than taking notes on a computer., It's tempting to stop being interested if the room is too hot or people are talking. Maybe the day is really nice outside, or you just don't feel like being there. Commit yourself to paying attention. Block out what's distracting you, and focus only on what the teacher is saying and the class discussion.Everybody's mind wanders sometime. When you find yourself drifting away, bring your focus back to what your teacher is saying.
If you absolutely cannot focus or you find yourself going to sleep, try going to the bathroom for a short break to splash water on your face, if your teacher will let you.

, If you hand-wrote your notes, try typing your notes when you get back home. Typing them will reinforce the information in your brain, helping it to stick for longer. If you typed your notes in class, try re-reading them when you get back home."
"
Make a schedule.,
Do your homework.,
Read critically.,
Organize your notes, homework, and tests.",How to Get Good Grades in Tests with Little Studying2," When you get homework assignments, schedule in time for each of them. Stick to your schedule, so that you always get your homework done on time., Your homework counts for part of your grade, so turning in your homework is important. However, don't just do enough of the work to pass. Actually take the time to work through the assignment. Your homework and reading is a way to reinforce what you're learning in class, and if you take the time to learn it effectively now, you won't have as much studying to do later.

, Don't just skim through your textbook. Read each sentence thoroughly, taking in the information. If you have a hard time paying attention, try reading it aloud to yourself or a friend. Take some time to look at what the main ideas are. It may help you to take notes on the main ideas, just so you have a general overview. Plus, writing down will help reinforce the information., Have a folder or binder for each class, and keep your notes, homework, and tests organized by section and date. That way, you know where all the materials on one topic are, and you can pull them out to review later."
"
Get the hard subjects out of the way first.,
Take breaks.,
Don't procrastinate.,
Skip around subjects.",How to Get Good Grades in Tests with Little Studying3," You'll be working on it when your brain is fresher, which will make it easier than if you tried to do it when your brain is tired. Also, once you get it out of the way, you'll feel like you've done something big. In addition, your other work will seem easier after the hard stuff., Studying for too long without breaks can wear you down. In addition, you'll stop absorbing information as well. Be sure to take regular breaks at least once an hour. Get up and walk around. Get a cup of tea. Do jumping jacks, or go talk to a friend for a few minutes. Just take a mental break, and you'll be more prepared to jump back in., Though you need to take breaks, when it's time to study, you need to study. Don't doodle, or write random notes in the margins. Actually get down to work when you're supposed to, and you'll cut down significantly on your study time., Instead of trying to study one subject for hours, skip from subject to subject, especially if you have several tests ahead. For instance, try moving subjects when you take a break. This type of studying keeps you more interested in what you're learning, helping you to learn what you need to know faster."
"
Use a study guide or the syllabus to make a plan.,
Review your notes.,
Have discussion groups.,
Connect ideas.,
Try flashcards.,
Focus your study on the type of test you're taking.",How to Get Good Grades in Tests with Little Studying4," If you don't have either one, you'll have to use your class notes or textbook to determine your plan. Basically, you need an overview of what you need to cover for the test. You can make an outline by using the main headings in your textbook or using the main concepts you covered before this exam.Once you have all of the concepts you need to cover, set aside a certain amount of time to cover each one, based on the amount of time you want to spend in total covering the exam.
You don't need to give equal time to each concept. If you know one concept better than another, focus more time on the one you don't know. If one concept is more complex, it might need more time than other concepts.

, One of the best ways to study for a test is to review your class material. Read over the notes you've taken in class. Skim through the headings of the chapters you read in the time before this exam to ensure you're covering everything you need to do. However, don't try to re-read chapters, as that will take more time than you have to study for the test., Work with your friends to study more effectively. It's more fun to work in a group, and as long as you stay on topic, it can be very effective. Discussing ideas engages you in the material, making it easier for your to absorb information.For instance, if you're trying to study a book for a test, try using an online study guide to spark discussion with your friends. You can find discussion questions for most classic works of literature.
For something like math, try having mini competitions. Take one problem, and see who can solve it the fastest. If someone is having trouble, walk through the problem with him or her to help her understand it. Whether you're doing the explaining or need the explanation, you'll be solidifying the information more quickly.

, Most people try to learn by using rote memorization; that is, they read something over and over until it sticks. A more effective way to learn is to connect what you're learning now to something you already know. By pulling it in to your web of ideas, you make it stick more quickly.


For instance, say you're trying to learn the circulatory system of an animal. You can compare the parts of the body to a train system, where the main train station is the heart, while the big train routes moving away from the station are the arteries and the ones moving to the station are the veins.

, If you find networking ideas isn't working for you, try flashcards to help your rote memorization. Flash cards help you learn because they force you to repeat the concept over and over. Plus, they allow you to quiz yourself on the topic.Just write a word or something you need to learn on one side, and then write the definition or what's connected to that concept on the other side. Flashcards work best with study concepts that have two parts, such as words and definitions, events and dates, or the name of an equation and the equation.Another way flashcards can help is they allow you to study just what you don't know. Once you've definitely learned a concept or word, you can take it out of the set of cards, focusing your time on learning what you don't know., For instance, if you need to remember dates, flashcards will be more effective. If you're trying to learn how to do problems, working through practice problems is likely the most effective way to study. If you're trying to learn concepts or study literature for an essay exam, working in a group discussion might be the most effective way to study."

Write down the facts.,
Always read the directions.,

Know how to answer multiple choice questions.,
Jot down a quick outline for longer questions.,
Check your answers at the end.",How to Get Good Grades in Tests with Little Studying5," If you need to remember a set of facts for the test, write them on the top of the test as soon as you get them. That way, you know you won't forget them while taking the test., The directions may tell you how long your answers need to be or even how many questions you need to answer. It's important to read the directions carefully, or you may lose easy points.

, Make sure you have enough time for all parts of the test. Take a moment at the beginning to look through the test and see what you have ahead. If you have essay questions, make sure you don't spend so much time on other parts of the test that you don't have time for the essay question. Keep an eye on your time throughout the test., If you know you're best at short answer, start with those questions first. That way, you know you will have answered the questions that you are best at, giving you the most points., Sometimes your teacher will word questions in a particularly confusing way. Make sure you know exactly what the question is asking before answering. In other words, you don't want to jump to an answer after having only read a few words of the question., On some tests, you just don't get the points if you answer incorrectly. On other tests, you don't get the points if you skip the question, but if you answer incorrectly, you get extra points taken off. In the first case, guessing on multiple choice does you no harm and may help you. In the second case, you may lose more points than you gain by guessing., Multiple choice questions can make it easier for you to answer the question. You don't actually need to supply the answer, as the answer is already there as one of the choices. However, sometimes they can be difficult because two answers seem too similar.Once you've read through the question, decide on what you would answer before looking at the answer choices. That way, you won't be swayed by other answers before coming to a conclusion. If your answer is there, pick it, and move on. If isn't, reread the question to see if you read it wrong.If you're having trouble deciding, eliminate the silly or ridiculous choices. Often, one or two of the answers will be obviously wrong. Put a line through those so you don't have to consider them anymore.If you still can't decide between the other answers, pick one and move on, as long as you're not penalized for guessing., If you need to answer an essay question, make a quick outline first. Just make sure you know what main ideas are going into your essay and how you're going to organize them. It will make your writing go more smoothly., If you have time at the end, go back through, and check your work. If you're taking a math exam, look over your work to make sure you didn't make a silly mistake. Also, check to make sure you didn't miss any questions, as that's an easy way to lose points."
"
Keep up with what you're learning.,
Set up a schedule for reviewing your learning.,
Revise on time.,
Use your notes and review methods to help you to revise for the test.,
Go over any area of knowledge where you feel weak or inadequate.,
Ensure that you've had sufficient rest.,
Be punctual.,
Read or listen to the test instructions carefully.,
Focus.,
Do the test.,
Complete the test.,
Await those good test results.",How to Get Good Marks in a Test," Whether it's schoolwork, martial arts moves or regulatory procedures at work, stay on top of the learning. If there are things that you don't understand at the time, either ask the tutor/teacher/supervisor or do research to find the answer. The longer that you leave things without understanding them, the harder it gets to prepare yourself and to move onto the next stage of learning, and the harder test preparation becomes.


Ask questions to solidify your understanding.
Have others help you where needed.;
, Once you've grasped what you're learning to the full extent possible for your level, work on it. Practice whatever can be practiced, whether it be through homework, active participation, setting up experiments, exercising, etc.


Where possible, review the work regularly, even daily. A regular practice of what you're learning helps it to sink in and become a part of your deeper understanding.
Use a diary or schedule to help you to remember to review your learning.

, Do not leave revision until the last minute. This is known as cramming and the end result is a head filled with the knowledge without depth of comprehension and usually a lot of stress added in. Set up a revision schedule that gives you sufficient time ahead of the test to go over the materials, to practice any practical elements of the learning and to have self-testing included. There is no magic formula of how much time is sufficient time, as that depends on the type of test you're undertaking, the way in which you learn and the amount of warning you've had that the test is happening. The key thing is to not do it in the hours or night before the test is due to occur!


Place the revision times onto a calendar, in a diary or schedule or using digital reminder notes. Stick to these once you determine them.

, There are many possible revision methods available, including flashcards, color coding, doing old tests, having others test you, physical practice, etc. You'll need to decide on what works best for you; in many cases, it's a combination of approaches. Put these into place, and use the notes you've taken during learning and reviewing to help guide you to key points or aspects of the learning that the tutor or teacher has clarified are vital to a thorough understanding. These indications from the tutor or teacher are guidance for you to heed.

, These are the areas that will produce the most stress for you when taking the test, so spend more time on improving these areas, to increase your confidence.

, Get plenty of sleep the night before and eat healthily on the day of the test. There are other things to consider, such as avoiding last minute stress chats with friends or scaring each other with the things you've forgotten to learn. That sort of talk is pointless and simply fuels feeling nervous.

, Turn up at least five minutes before the test, if possible. Settle in at your desk, workbench, exercise mat, or whatever it is, so that you feel comfortable and ready. If tools are needed, set them out in front of you or wherever they are supposed to be. By being punctual, you give yourself the time to set up, stay calm and deal with any last-minute hitches, such as room changes or deliberately changed situations to force you to think harder.

, It can be easy to assume you already know what is expected of you or to feel so nervous that you fail to digest what it expected. However, this part of a test is very important, as the assessors may have made changes, they may have purposefully shaken things up to really test you or they may have made some corrections that weren't known about earlier. So be alert.

, Once it is time for testing, focus on what is expected of you. If it's words or numbers on a page, go into the zone of those things. If it's a particular pose or action, place yourself in position readiness. Clear your mind, and remind yourself that you know what to do, what to write, what to calculate. You have prepared and you are ready.

, This is the moment you prepared for. Don't let yourself down––you are as ready as you'll ever be now that you're at this point in time. Do your best and some. Keep your thinking faculties fully switched on; if you forget something, use lateral thinking to gather meaning from around you, from what the test has given you and draw together something that will meet the requirements sufficiently. There is no need to panic at all, you know more than you are allowing yourself to think.

, It's now out of your hands. Avoid dissecting the test with others who undertook the same test; it's okay to talk about your relief and hopes for it but pulling the test apart will only leave you feeling anxious and every person goes about answering, solving and doing things in their own way. Congratulate yourself on having been so prepared, calm and composed.

, If you've put in the work, stay focused and approached the test methodically and calmly, the results will reflect your input."

, If you take your box to the post office, they'll calculate the cost for you. To do this at home, use a tape measure to find the length, width, and height of the box. Then weigh it on a scale. After that:


Navigate to the USPS homepage in your web browser. Click on the ""Calculate Postage"" link and input your package information to determine its cost.
Select the services you want from the pages following the postage calculator. Some examples of services include next day shipping or package insurance, which cost extra., After you've input your package information and selected services, you should reach a screen asking you to confirm the information. Double check the recipient's address and the return address. Then pay for the postage with a credit or debit card.

, Once you've paid for shipping, you'll be able to print out your shipping label.Tape this firmly in place on a clearly visible part of the package. When taping, be sure to avoid the bar codes on the label. Tape could affect the bar code reader and delay your package.

, Packing tape is preferred for sealing your box, but other durable tape, like duct tape, will work in a pinch. Tape the flaps of your box closed so it is firmly fastened shut. If the tape feels loose, use another layer (or a few layers) to reinforce it.


For recycled boxes being used again, you might want some additional stability. Tape all edges and seams of the box with tape to prevent it from falling apart or spilling open in transit.

, Go to the post office home page. You should find a link that says something similar to, ""Schedule a Pickup."" Select this, and follow the directions to choose a time for your package to be picked up.Although the USPS offers free pickup, many private shipping providers do not. Be wary of these additional expenses, as they can significantly increase the shipping cost.
Generally, you will choose a location for pickup when scheduling. Some examples of locations include in/at your mailbox, or at your front/back door. You can also typically leave instructions to knock on the door/ring the bell, and so on."

Get enough sleep.,
Eat the right foods.,
Drink your water.,
Get regular exercise.",How to Get Good Grades in Tests with Little Studying6," When you are rested, you retain more information than when you are tired. Therefore, by just getting enough sleep every night, you will retain more information, lessening your need for study time., Your body is better able to function when you feed it the best foods. Skip sugary junk food, and stick with square meals that include lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Your brain will work better when you feed it better., Just like the rest of your body, your brain needs water to function properly. Staying hydrated will keep your brain functioning at its best, so be sure to get enough water everyday.You can count tea, coffee, and juice in your water intake. Just remember, juices are sugary, so don't drink too many ounces of juice. Try adding fruit to water to infuse it with flavor, and make it more enticing.
Though the standard rule is to drink eight glasses of water a day, you may need more. Women generally need about 9 cups of water a day, and men need about 13 cups., Just like exercise energizes your body, it also energizes your mind. It gets your blood flowing, increasing blood to your brain. Try getting in at least a little bit of exercise everyday. For instance, try taking a short walk or jog when you're taking study breaks. You'll come back energized and ready to get back to work."

Prepare your box to ship.,
Input your information and schedule a pickup.,
Ship the package.",How to Ship Packages from Home2," Do this in the same way you would normally ship a box from home with the post office. Insert your item(s) in a suitable box and pad the items well with things like newspaper, packing peanuts, and bubble wrap. Then take the measurements of your box.


Depending on the company, the information you have to provide for your package may vary. Generally, length, width, height, and weight are necessary to ship a package.

, Go to the homepage of the company you are planning to use to ship your package. Select the ""Schedule a Pickup"" option and input the necessary information to calculate postage and shipping details. Then:


Double check the shipping and return addresses.
Verify the label policy. You may need to use a special label provided by the company, which you may have to order by mail or pick up from a brick and mortar location, or you may be able to pay with a card and print one.Choose a time for pickup., Seal your package with tape. Then tape or stick the label in place where it's clearly visible. Do not cover the bar codes of the label with tape. If the company you are using requires a special label, you may have to fill out shipping documents before the driver can take the package.

Economize on shipping materials.,
Shop around with shipping providers.,
Inquire about special rates.,
Ship your package media mail, if possible.",How to Ship Packages from Home3," Packing peanuts, bubble wrap, and even boxes can be quite expensive. To save money on these expenses, you can use or reuse items around your house to safely pack your parcel. For example, you might:


Use crumpled newspaper, old blankets, clean rags, or fabric stuffing to keep your packaged items from getting damaged en route.
Salvage boxes from your place of employment, from local businesses (like grocery stores and big box stores), and so on. Black out previous addresses on these with a permanent marker.

, Your home country's national postal service is most likely the least expensive option. However, for regular shipping or high volume shipping, you can often negotiate a better rate than the ones offered by competitors.


If one company has given you a better quote for the cost, mention this to competitors. They might offer to beat that cost.

, Private shipping companies might have special rates for those who are shipping from home for the first time. There might also be special rates offered during the slow season to encourage more shipping. When shopping around, be sure to ask something like:


""I'm planning on shipping a medium sized, 20 pound (9 kg) package from my home. Are there any special rates being offered right now for that kind of shipping?""

, Media mail is a more affordable way of shipping packages under 70 lbs (32 kg). The downside to media mail is that it usually takes much longer than regular shipping, so it isn't preferred for time sensitive packages. Items that qualify for media mail include:Print material at least 8 pages in length (including sheet music, play scripts, manuscripts, guides, periodicals, and so on).
Sound and video recordings (like CDs and DVDs).
Computer material that is readable.
Film (16 mm or narrower)
Educational materials (like test materials and accessories, reference charts, etc.)"

Do the questions you know first.,
Answer essay questions first.,
Reduce anxiety.",How to Get a Good Grade on a Hard Test," If you want to do well on a difficult exam, the first step is paying attention in class. Listen closely to whatever your teacher or professor says in the weeks leading up to the test.Listen actively. Pay attention not only to words but the meaning behind them. During lectures and discussions, try to understand the meaning behind whatever's being said. Pay attention first to the central idea and then look for illustrating examples, evidence, and facts surrounding that idea.
Pay attention to anything that seems emphasized. If your teacher writes something on the board or points it out in a slideshow, pay extra attention -- it's probably something that will end up on the test.
If your professor starts discussing something complex or confusing, your first impulse may be to tune out due to boredom or stress. However, work against this instinct. Take this as an opportunity to better understand tough topics. Focus more as the material becomes more difficult.
Ignore personal worries, thoughts of friends and family members, or plans for after class or school. Concentrate on the present moment and try to absorb what's being said.;
, You'll have a harder time listening and concentrating if the material is unfamiliar to you. Do the reading and homework ahead of time. Write down any questions you have and, when the teacher gives you the opportunity, ask these questions., Taking good notes can be the difference between a C and an A. During class, make sure you always come equipped with a notebook and pencil. Write down whatever's being said and practice good note taking strategies.Organize your notes by subject and date. Write the date in the upper righthand corner of a notebook page and list the title of the lecture or the general subject material at the top of the page. Use subheadings when necessary. For example, if your professor is lecturing on Ronald Reagan's presidency you can write ""The Reagan Years"" at the top of your page. As she transitions into more specific topics, use subheadings like ""The Early Years,"" ""The Iran Contra Scandal,"" and so on. This will make reviewing your notes much easier later on.
Use abbreviations and symbols. As you'll need to take notes as your teacher is talking, symbols and abbreviations can help. For example, write ""w/o"" instead of ""without"" or ""&"" instead of ""and."" You can also use abbreviations relevant to the lecture when needed. Like, write ""RR"" instead of ""Ronald Reagan.""
Write clearly. You do not want to review your notes to find you cannot read them. Make sure to use neat penmanship.
Review your notes shortly after class. Immediately reviewing information discussed can improve your memory. This will make it easier to review material before an exam as you'll have better recall.
Compare notes. Find other students in your class who are diligent note takers. Compare notes after class to see what areas you may have missed.
Try the question/answer/evidence method.This note-taking technique encourages you to pose a question regarding what you're hearing in class, then take down notes about the evidence you would use to put together your answer. For example, if you are in a class on Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, a question might be ""What is the central theme of Romeo and Juliet?"" There are many possible answers for this, but focus on what you know from your own reading and class discussion. You might jot down answers such as ""consequence of holding grudges"" or ""ignorance of hot-headed youth."" Then you'd note down evidence from the text and your class lectures to support it.

, As the test gets closer, ask your teacher what specific materials you'll be tested on. Your teacher might be able to provide an overview on the most important areas of focus. You can use this to help guide your studies. Also, watch for hints in class as to what information is the most important. Does your teacher seem to emphasize a particular concept when she talks? Are there certain subject areas you spend more time talking about than others? If so, this material will probably be on the test., Read any material that's assigned for class carefully. Active reading can help you better retain information for a test.


Pay attention to chapter titles and sub-tittles. This will give you a clue as to what the information is about. If your textbook contains questions at the beginning of each chapter, read these questions ahead of time. Read the text searching for their answers, as these questions reveal the key points of the text.Look for bolded subheadings and the beginning sentences of paragraphs. These usually help summarize the main points of any given material. This will also help you know where to pay the most attention when reading.If you're allowed to do so, write notes in the margins of textbooks. Underline and highlight important passages so you can more easily find them later., Before you sit down to study, make sure you make a good study space for yourself. Choose a comfortable area with minimal distractions.


Eliminate distractions. Things like computers, television sets, phones, and other distracting materials should be kept out of your study space. You should also make sure you choose a space that's quiet. Use the desk in your bedroom, for example, or go to a quiet coffee shop or the local library.Try to study in the same space each day. This way, your brain will associate this space with work. It will be easier to get back in the swing of studying when you begin a new session., Creating a solid study schedule can help you focus. In the weeks leading up to an exam, start planning when and where to study.


Start slow. Plan to study 10 to 15 minutes at a time and then work up to bigger intervals.Start studying at least a week before a big test. Cramming material in last minute is a bad idea.Allow yourself to take short, timed breaks. Studying for hours on end is overwhelming. Incorporate breaks for snacks and relaxing throughout your study sessions., You should not study without direction. This is ineffective. Each study session should have its own specific goal. Set a variety of study session goals for each planned session in your schedule. Break material down into reasonable chunks so you're not overwhelmed.For example, say you're studying for a French exam and need to know 50 vocabulary words. Try to learn 10 words per study session, eventually working your way up to the full 50.As another example, if you're studying for a math test, set a goal to work on one type of problem or one chapter at a time. Once you've mastered that, move on to the next.

, Consistency is important to a good study session. Procrastination puts constraints on your time, for one, and can easily become a habit. Study every day at the same time in the same place. Even if it's a struggle at first, it will be worth it as you're far more likely to get a good grade this way.You can help yourself avoid procrastination by using the tips in this section. Setting clear goals, aiming for manageable ""study chunks"" rather than huge blocks of study time, and rewarding yourself after achieving your goals are all good ways to stop procrastination in its tracks.
For example, if there's a show you really like to watch on Sunday night, tell yourself you can watch it if you get your studying done in the afternoon. Then, put the books away and fully enjoy your show as a reward for getting your work done.

, Study groups can be a helpful tool when used effectively. Make sure you study with people who are also serious, hardworking students. Prepare beforehand and plan to quiz each other on a variety of topics. Choose people you can trust to stay on task. Avoid people who will encourage procrastination., Repetition is key to memorization. Test yourself over and over again on relevant material if you want to get a good grade. Review material you studies in a previous session before a new study session. Re-read important passages in text books. If practice tests and quizzes are provided, take them. Use flashcards, which you can create by hand or with online programs, to test yourself on things like dates, vocabulary, and more., Something as simple as running on too little sleep can sabotage your memory and concentration. Strive to get at least 8 hours of high quality sleep in the night before an exam.You might be tempted to stay up late cramming the night before an exam, but this is usually counter-productive. Giving your brain time to recover by going to bed is a better option.

, If you're feeling hungry during a test, this can be distracting. You also might have trouble concentrating due to lack of food. Eat something with complex carbohydrates and protein to keep you feeling powered up all morning long.A bowl of oatmeal with Greek yogurt and fruit is a great breakfast. Scrambled eggs and whole-wheat toast is another good option.

, Show up early so you don't stress yourself out about being late. Stress can be a distraction when taking a test. Also, if you arrive early you'll have time to do some quick, last minute review of the more difficult materials before your exam starts., Strategy can make a big difference when it come to taking an exam. Know some tips and tricks beforehand when going into a test.


For multiple choice questions, read questions completely before looking at the answer options. Eliminate any options you're 100% sure are wrong and read all options before selecting an answer.For questions with the options ""none of the above"" and ""all of the above"" for answers, there are some tricks you can use. If you're certain one answer is false, for example, you can rule out ""all of the above."" Conversely, if you're certain one answer is true, you can rule out ""none of the above."" If you know two answers are true or two are false, the answer is more likely to be none or all of the above.For ""true or false"" questions, keep in mind the majority of answers are usually true. If you don't know, guess true. Keep in mind answers containing partially correct information are usually ""false."" Words like ""every,"" ""always,"" and ""never,"" usually provide insight to a question's answer. Generalizations, such as ""never"" and ""always,"" are often false. Qualifiers, such as ""frequently"" or ""seldom,"" may make a statement more likely to be true., If you get stuck on a question, don't let it suck up the rest of your time. Mark it so that you can find it again, and move on to the next one. Just make sure that if you're using a separate answer sheet, such as a scantron, you skip the proper row before you fill in the next answers.


Once you've done all the questions you know, go back to the tricky ones. You'll feel more confident having finished the ones you're sure of, and you'll be less likely to second-guess yourself.

, This way, you'll know you have enough time to give a full answer before moving onto shorter questions.


Take the time to quickly plan your answer to an essay question. This doesn't have to be a huge, detailed outline: just a short list of bullet points is fine. Going into an essay question with an idea of the points you want to make, and how you want to order them, will be a big advantage.If questions have different points assigned to them (e.g., some questions are worth 5 points and others are worth 10), do the questions worth the highest number of points first., Many people feel anxious before a big test. There are a variety of things you can do to reduce anxiety when taking an exam.


Do not pay attention to how quickly other people are finishing the test. This will only serve to stress you out more.Focus on one question at a time. Do not let your mind wander to other parts of the test.Read directions carefully. Do not hesitate to talk to your teacher if you're unsure of anything.If gum is allowed, chewing gum can help some people relieve anxiety. Also, take big, deep breaths when taking an exam as this can also help alleviate anxiety.If you feel stuck, get up and stretch. Take a few deep breaths. Shake your arms and legs, but quietly. Then go back to the test."

These will prevent you from checking social media while you’re supposed to be studying., If you know what kinds of questions will be on the test, try making some up on your own and answering them. Most textbooks also have questions at the back of the book or at the end of each chapter. If you can answer those questions, you are on the right track for the exam!, You may be tempted to set aside hours to do nothing but study, but don’t do it! It’s best to study for half an hour or so, then give yourself a short break of five to ten minutes. Taking a break helps your mind refocus and prevents you from worrying about the same thing repeatedly., Exercising helps your mind to concentrate and relaxes your body. It may seem counterproductive, but taking a break from studying to move around a little will actually help you feel better. When you get back to studying, you’ll feel refreshed, calm, and ready to take on the test!

Do a set of ten jumping jacks.
Jog around the block. You can also jog in place inside!
Learn to do some basic stretching exercises. , Step away from studying and listen to your favorite song, watch an episode of your favorite show, or spend half an hour playing your favorite video game. Be careful not to get too distracted--watching one episode of a show will help you clear your mind, but watching an entire season will prevent you from studying!, It might be tempting to drink lots of coffee to keep you awake and eat quick processed snacks to save time, but overloading on caffeine or sugar can increase anxiety and leave you feeling groggy while you study--or even worse, during the test. Healthy snacks like fruit, vegetables, and whole grains will keep you energized and increase your ability to concentrate on the exam., When you return to preparing for your exam, take a few minutes to breathe in and out deeply. This helps your body feel more relaxed and allows your mind to concentrate on doing well on the exam rather than feeling anxious about it.


Exhale as deeply as you can, until you feel your insides compress.
Inhale slowly, filling every available space in your lungs with air. Lift your head up as you inhale.
Hold your breath for a few seconds. This helps calm your nerves!
Exhale slowly and deeply. Repeat as many times as you need., Sitting in an uncomfortable position can increase anxiety and distraction--if your body isn’t comfortable, it’s very hard for your mind to relax! Spend a few minutes finding a comfortable position to sit in. If possible, try to find a position that you can also use during the actual exam.


Try sitting with one foot tucked under you--many people find this relaxing.
Lean back in the chair until your spine rests against the chair’s back--this prevents back strain that can hurt your concentration.
Use pillows or cushions to sit on or lean against in your chair. During the actual test, try using a folded-up jacket in the same position., Take a few moments to think about something fun you have planned for the days and weeks after the test--a vacation, a night out with friends, a new movie that you want to see. Reflect that regardless of how you do on the test, you will still be able to enjoy events in the future. If you are able to look beyond the exam, you will feel less anxious about it--remember, it’s just one test and your life will go on! "

Give 110% of your effort when taking the test.",How to Get a 100% on a Test," Participate so you know that you understood the lesson okay. During class take notes or something that you could refer back to when you are studying. Copy all the notes your teacher has on the board or from the information provided. If your textbook has extra labs, activities, or foldables that you can do, do them. Make sure to review these notes twice a day, morning and night.;
, This will let you master the skill before the test. Do all of the homework to the best of your ability. Try to answer every question right. If you missed a question, do it again. If you don't understand why you got it wrong, ask the teacher or assign yourself extra problems.

,


Get a small snack and a glass of water before you start studying.
Review the notes you took in class. This will give you the opportunity to remember what is being asked on the test. Reread all of the chapters, stories, notes, and homework you did. Make sure you read them until they are almost completely memorized. Once you've read your notes, rewrite them in your own words as you remember them.
Write a summary of the book, story, chapter, etc. that you read.
Complete each homework problem like you never did it before.
You can make up some practice problems to see if you understand the concepts. If you do this, have someone else check your answer.
Call a friend and work out some problems together or do your homework over the phone. This will give you some new ways to look at a problem!

, This will help you be refreshed and ready to take the test the next day. You should rest every night, even if there isn't a test anytime soon, in case there are pop quizzes or any other special work.

, Study during part of lunch and in your free time. Don't cram!


Go to the toilet before the test so you don't have to go during the test.

Never give up during the test."
"
Ask your teacher.,
Pay attention to details written on the board.,
Identify topics your teacher spends extra time on.,
Think about recent class discussions and lectures.,
Consider the format of the test you’re taking.",How to Figure Out What Information to Study for Tests1," Unless your teacher said otherwise, he or she will be your best resource to finding out what’s on the test. Always ask teachers if they can provide you with tips or hints regarding test and study material.Ideally, you should ask your teachers about information you’ll need to know for the test in the weeks prior, rather than waiting until the day before. If something your teacher says during a lesson seems particularly important or difficult to remember, for instance, you might want to ask your teacher if that material will be covered on the test so you’ll know if you need to devote significant time to memorizing it.
It’s okay to ask your teacher for help shortly before the test, too, but know that you’ll likely get summarized information instead of detailed information. For example, your chemistry teacher may tell you to review the equations covered within the last two units--you won’t know exactly what those equations are unless you’re also able to consult your notes and textbook after that.;
, As a general rule, if your teacher takes the time to write something on the board, he or she does so to emphasize that information. Emphasized information is very likely to appear on the test, so make sure you include it in your notes and study it.The same principle applies to information included on a projector or computer slide.
Consider starring, underlining, or highlighting this information in your notes so you'll remember to return to it later on.

, In addition to information written on the board or on slides, you should also pay close attention to any information your teacher repeats, states slowly, or explains loudly, as these are all signs that your instructor is telling you to pay close attention to these details--probably for exam purposes.Similarly, if your teacher directly says something like ""you need to know this"" or ""this will be on the test,"" the information attached to that phrase is almost guaranteed to appear on your exam.
Listen for language that connects ideas, too. For instance, if your teacher starts preceding details in a ""first...,"" ""second...,"" ""finally..."" arrangement, it's possible that these same points will appear on your test.

, If you’re trying to figure out what to study shortly before the test and well after the material has been covered, mentally review the class discussions or lectures that have taken place since your last test. Ask yourself what immediately jumps out in your memory.


While it’s possible that you’ll only remember information you found important rather than information your teacher finds important, if you regularly pay attention in class, there’s a decent chance that you’ll end up remembering the key points your teacher spent the most time emphasizing. You probably won’t remember all of the necessary details, but knowing which areas your teacher emphasized could give you a starting point in your studies.

, The test format can reveal a lot about the type of information you’re going to be tested on. Multiple-choice tests often require you to know facts and details, while essay questions often require you to know enough about a topic to share facts and your personal opinion. Try to find out the format of the test so you’ll know from which perspective to review your notes.


For example, if studying for a multiple-choice test on American history from 1860 through 1865, memorize important dates and the names of prominent historical figures from that time period, such as the start-and-end dates of the Civil War. If studying for an essay test on the same material, worry less about the dates and focus more on the causes, culture, and influential figures involved in the same set of important events."
"
Review your course syllabus.,
Review your notes.,
Look over your recently graded assignments.,
Review previous tests.",How to Figure Out What Information to Study for Tests2," In most cases, everything you learn for that class throughout the semester such as special projects, tests, and exams are outlined clearly on the syllabus to help you with studying. Look over your course syllabus to determine which subjects you need to study for the upcoming test.More precisely, look at the headings and bulletpoints that appear within outlined units or in between scheduled exams. If you know the test covers material from Units 5, 6, and 7, you can glance through the topics covered in those units, as well as the homework/projects done within those units. Use that information to figure out which of your materials will help you review.

, If you’re a note-taker, your notes could be a great source of information that might be featured on the next test. Look over your notes to see if there’re any topics you need to spend more time studying.Identify the date of your last test, and study all notes you took after that date. In most cases, you’ll be tested on information you learned following your last test.
If you’re not a note-taker, now’s the time to become one. Regularly attend class, pay attention to key information your teacher discusses, and write down enough information to help you remember the facts or ideas covered. By learning to take effective notes, you’ll make it much easier to study for tests while also demonstrating to your teacher that you’re a serious student.

, Keep all homework, essays, and projects you get back from your teacher after he or she finishes grading them. Oftentimes, the material that you spent time practicing or reviewing on your homework will appear on the exam in some form.As with other study tactics, consult the homework you completed after the previous test, since it’s more likely to contain information you haven’t been tested on yet.
Pay special attention to ideas or principles practiced over multiple assignments. For example, if you completed three separate worksheets on a particular formula, but only one worksheet on another formula, there’s a good chance that first formula will appear on your test in greater detail than the second.

, This helps you identify whether your teacher generally sticks to using the same test format, and can give you a better idea of the type of information you’ll be tested on. For example, if your last three tests featured two essay questions you might have struggled with, be prepared to face two more essay questions on the next test, then study accordingly.It’s also a good idea to keep any quizzes or tests that are graded and returned to you. Information from past quizzes may appear on a larger test covering more material. Similarly, information from past tests might appear on a mid-term or final exam.

"
"
Read chapters in your textbook.,
Review the material with your classmates.,
Ask current students who took the test during an earlier period.",How to Figure Out What Information to Study for Tests3," Some teachers and instructors issue one test for each chapter in your textbook, while others may issue one test that covers three chapters. Browse through your textbook to identify chapters you went over in class, then study all information in those chapters for your test.When reviewing your textbook, pay special attention to boldface headings/subheadings, figures/illustrations, charts, and highlighted vocabulary terms or summarized concepts.
Note that some textbooks will also have study questions or other study aids at the end of each chapter. While your teacher may not follow these completely, much of the information your textbook finds important will typically line up with the detail your instructor finds important.

, Depending on your needs and study habits, you can either study with a small group of your classmates or ask a few classmates for guidance on specific points.


Talk to classmates about material you missed. If you missed a lecture, ask a student who you know takes good notes if you can borrow theirs to copy. Depending on your reputation or familiarity with that classmate, you might get a “no”--in which case, either ask someone else for their notes or ask that same peer if they could quickly summarize what textbook or homework ideas your teacher discussed.
Create your own study guide with other classmates. Form a group with a handful of other classmates and compare notes with one another. Mark down or highlight any ideas that appear in more than one person’s notes.

, If you attend a school in which the teacher has several classes, try asking someone else who takes your teacher’s class about the test questions. While your classmates may not share exact test questions due to personal or school-enforced ethics, they can still give you a general idea about what to study for.


The downside, of course, is that you’ll be very limited on how much time you have to study since you’ll probably only have a day or a few hours to review the material after hearing about the test.
On a similar note, you could try asking students who had the same class with the same instructor during a previous semester/year for guidance on major exams. While these students probably won’t remember every detail about every little quiz, they may recall information that appeared on mid-terms, finals, or particularly hard tests.

, If your friend is texting you about hanging out, tell them you'll talk to them about it later.

, Only study during that time. If you play games on your computer, listen to distracting music, or watch TV, you'll be constantly distracted. You'll be much happier later on when you have free time instead of sneaking it in while studying.

Let it go when you're finished.",How to Excel in Your Final Exams," It may sound obvious, but the first place you should begin when preparing for a final exam is to know what material will be covered. Is it a comprehensive exam that covers the whole course? Or does it just cover material since midterm? Knowing what material you'll be tested on can help you study more efficiently and cover everything you'll need to know.Your class syllabus should at least specify whether the final exam will be comprehensive.
Use your syllabus, along with your class notes, to deduce what material is most likely to be covered.
If you're unsure or could use clarification, talk to your instructor and ask what material you'll be tested on.;
, Having a schedule might make studying feel more strict, but that schedule will help you in the long run. You'll budget your time more efficiently and ensure that you cover all the material that will be on the exam.


Set aside enough time each day to prepare for your exams. You may wish to break up your schedule, like studying for one class on Tuesdays/Thursdays and another on Monday/Wednesdays, for example.
Plan ahead if you have multiple exams on the same day. You'll need to manage your study time even more carefully.
Factor in time for sleep, exercise, meal time, and perhaps some healthy down time to relax after you study.
However you put together your schedule, make sure you stick to it.

, After a semester (or an academic year, depending on the class), you should have a pretty solid understanding of what your teacher expects of you. You should also have a clear idea of what she thinks is most important for you to know in that class. Putting yourself in your teacher's place can help you study more efficiently, which in turn can improve the chances of your success.Consider what material from the course your instructor expects you to know.
Think about what sorts of questions your instructor might ask.
Review the course in your mind and think about what the most important, representative concepts are from that class.

, One way to ensure that you study the most important concepts is to make a master outline from your notes. You can do this by reading through your notes to pull out the things talked about most often or with the greatest relevance to other lessons in the class.Read through your notes once without making any marks.
Re-read them again, only this time use a pen or highlighter to mark which concepts, terms, dates, and names are most important.
Compile all of the marked/highlighted information from your notes onto a new sheet or paper or into a new notebook.
Don't just copy your old notes word for word. Try to rephrase them in your own words so that you have to think critically about each concept and understand how to talk about it on your own terms.
Use the final master outline as your main study guide for reviewing your in-class notes.

, If your final exam is comprehensive, a good supplement to your notes would be to review all of your old tests and quizzes from throughout the semester/year. Often times those tests are structured to help you prepare for the final exam, with some instructors even taking questions word for word from the older tests/quizzes.


Review everything that was asked on each test and quiz.
Take note of the questions you got wrong. Was it an issue of the material, or the type of question (short answer vs multiple choice vs essay)?
Make sure you study everything that was on the exam, as you may have forgotten the things you got right. But it may be helpful to spend some extra time reviewing the questions you got wrong.

, If you're trying to memorize a lot of terms, names, and dates, it might be difficult to simply read off a page and try to commit it to memory. That's where memorization aids come in. There are many different types of memorization aids, so try a few and see which ones work best for you.


Try changing the lyrics to a song. Associating names or terms with music might help you recall that information when you're stumped during the exam.
Use mnemonic devices. This is similar to using music, but uses any other type of association that will help you recall information, such as rhymes or acronyms.Make and use flash cards. Write a term, name, or date on the blank side and the corresponding definition or description on the back., You may feel more comfortable studying at home, or with the TV on in the background, but these situations could detract from your ability to retain information. Where you study is a big part of how efficiently you are able to study, so it's important to figure out what locations/environments work best for you.Try studying someplace quiet, like a library or an uncrowded coffee shop.
Unless you're part of a study group, try to work alone. Having others there, even if they're also planning to study, could easily become a distraction.
If you do find that studying in your room works best for you, try to at least minimize distractions. Study when your roommates aren't there, and avoid potential distractions like the TV, music, or video games., If you try to sit down and cover an entire semester's worth of material at once, you're probably going to overload your brain. You probably won't retain very much information, either. A good way to study more efficiently (and remember more information) is to study in chunks, with breaks in between.


Study in blocks of 20 to 50 minutes at a time, but make sure those 20 to 50 minutes are uninterrupted and free of distractions.
Take a 5 to 10 minute break between study blocks. This will help you unwind and allow your mind to rest before attempting to memorize the next block of information.

, Time management is essential if you want to do well on your exams. That means figuring out how often and how long to study for each subject, and avoiding having to cram all your studying into one short, compact timeframe.Skip nonessential commitments if they threaten to take over study time. Nothing other than class or work should interfere with your designated study times.Portion out your study time according to which subjects need the most time and effort. You don't necessarily have to study history as much or as often as calculus if one subject comes easier to you and you're more informed about the material.
Study for either your hardest final or your first sequential final before the others. Decide whether it will be easier to rank your study sessions by difficulty or by time permitted.Whatever you do, don't procrastinate. Cramming at the last possible minute is a surefire way to feel stressed out, exhausted, and ultimately unprepared.

, Studying in small groups with other people in your class can help you figure out what other people are studying and which course elements people are struggling with. You may even learn some new study techniques from your classmates, or pick up some information that you didn't realize would be on the exam.Try to keep groups relatively small. Three to five people is a good size that will minimize the risk of distractions or diversions.
Make yourself be responsible to your study group. Remember that if you procrastinate or shrug off your studying duties, your classmates will suffer as well.

, It can be easy to forget to workout in the midst of finals preparation, but that's when it may be most important. Even if you're not a regular workout enthusiast, now is the perfect time to start.


Studies show that even just 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise can improve your memory.Try jogging, bicycling, dancing, or even brisk walking to get your daily exercise in.
Decide when to exercise. Some people prefer to exercise in the morning, while others may find it stimulating to workout right before a study session.
Figure out what works best for you, and stick with it.

, When you're stressed out from studying, it may be tempting to reach for comfort foods like french fries, potato chips, or desserts. However, studies show that eating an unhealthy diet can cause your test performance to decline.A balanced diet that includes fruit and vegetables can help stabilize your performance.
Diets rich in meat, eggs, cheese, and cream result in poorer attention and thought-capacity performance.
Incorporate healthy snacks throughout your day, especially while you're studying. Grab a piece of fruit or some fresh vegetables to power you through your study sessions.

, Sleep is important if you want to feel your best and perform well. Pulling all-nighters has been shown to reduce your retention abilities, resulting in lower grades.A well-rested student is more relaxed, alert, and able to focus and retain information.
Most students need at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.Many students need even more sleep than that, depending on age and level of physical activity.

, How you begin your day could shape how well or how poorly you perform on an exam. It's important to feel your best if you want to perform well at school or any other activity you apply yourself to.


Make sure you're well rested.
Set your alarm, and consider setting a second alarm for the morning just to ensure that you get up if you sleep through the first. Use two different alarms, like a clock and your cellphone, in case the power goes out at night.Have a small but nutritious breakfast. A breakfast high in fiber and carbohydrates, like oatmeal, is ideal for test days because it is digested more slowly to power you through the day.Wear comfortable clothes. You don't need to show up wearing pajamas, but you also don't need to dress your best - wear whatever will let you remain comfortable and focused for long periods of time.
Use the bathroom before you get to the exam. This will reduce the need to get up and leave during the exam (which may not be permitted)., Running late to an exam is an easy way to stress yourself out, and depending on the test you may not be allowed to enter the exam after it begins. Set yourself up for a smooth and stress-free exam by leaving your house early and getting to the exam at least 20 minutes before it begins.


Know the time and location where your exam will be administered. Some exams are not taken in your usual classroom, so know where you'll need to be in advance.Get there early enough to be settled in before the exam starts. If you have time, you may even want to review your notes one last time right before the exam (but make sure you studied in advance).

, If you're stressed out about an exam, you may not be thinking about what you'll need to actually take the exam. Plan everything out ahead, and consider packing your bags the night before the exam.


Bring any materials you'll need if it is an open-book or open-notes exam.
Make sure you have more than one pen or pencil, and make sure they all work.
Think of anything else you might need during the exam: a bottle of water, a cup of coffee, tissues, cough drops, etc., Don't focus on how long everyone else is taking to complete the exam. Focus on your own paper, and manage your time as necessary.Always read the instructions all the way through before you begin taking the exam. Glancing through the entire exam can help you determine how many questions there are, what format they're in, and which questions you'll need to spend the most time on.Try doing an information dump: write out some basic notes for yourself (like formulas, important dates, etc) in the margins or on scrap paper. That way you won't have to worry about remembering them for the whole test, and you'll have the information there for when you need it.
Develop all of your answers fully, and make sure you address all aspects of every question.

, It may be difficult to disengage with the material after you finish your exam, but dwelling on the questions and test material will only make you more anxious. It's best to just let go of the exam once you've turned it in and try to walk away from the material as best you can.Prepare to move on to the next exam, if you have more coming up. Dwelling on the exam you just took won't help you with any of your tests.
If you have a serious and legitimate concern about how you performed, talk to your instructor about making an appointment to talk about it when it's convenient for both of you.
Once you're all finished with your final exams, it's time to relax. Enjoy your break, spend time with friends, try to travel (if possible), and simply take the time to unwind and do things you enjoy.

At the beginning of the term, when you get your planner, note down every test, quiz, and assignment due date. Do this for each class.


Every day when you get home from school, check your calendar and see what needs to be done before tomorrow, as well as what's on the horizon for the next few days. Check off what you have already done.;
, Organizing whatever you use every day helps your mind feel clutter-free. It may sound silly, but when your visual environment is simple and orderly, your mind can concentrate on the more important stuff. Once a week, clean out your locker or backpack and organize your desk. It only takes a couple minutes.

You won't lose things when you automatically put them where they belong. Having a backpack, desk, or locker that's full of loose papers just gets confusing and frustrating.

, You have a calendar for the week or month, but you need a weekly study schedule, too. Map out your week to see when your studying can and should get done. That way you know just how much time you can devote to each class and when it makes the most sense to study for each one.Make sure that you abide by the plans that you make.


Use your common sense when it comes to allotting time to specific classes. For example, Badminton needs a lot less time than Principals of Celestial Mechanics.
Make sure you have an agenda so that you can write down all of your tests, when you have to study, and when you have homework due.Be sure that you complete all your homework. It boosts your learning.

, The matter of fact is that certain techniques don't work for certain people. Some of us learn with our hands, some of us with our eyes, and some of us with our ears (and others a combination). If you can't remember a thing your professor said, maybe you're just going about it the wrong way.

Once you find out your learning style, you can zone in on what's best for you. Do you remember best the things you've seen? Then study those notes and make graphs! The things you've heard? Go to class and record those lectures. Things you do with your hands? Turn the concepts into something you can build.

, As much as it is boring and monotonous, it's incredibly useful -- sometimes professors don't even mention the info in class! After reading a paragraph, revise it in your head without looking. Then read it again. It will stay in your mind for a longer time. It is particularly effective when you have less time for studying.

Often the things mentioned in class that are also mentioned in the book are the most important . If you run across some of this while reading, highlight it. You'll want to know where it is to find it later.
Don't write off the benefits of scanning. Concentrating on the main ideas (the highlighted text, italics, etc.) will get your mind going.If you can fill in the blanks, great! If you can't, read deeper.

, For most courses in middle school, high school, and junior/community college, most of what is on the tests and homework will be discussed in the class. If your teacher draws a diagram on the board, copy that down - it can help you remember the information.

Write good, legible notes. Use highlighters if there's something you need to find easily flipping through your notes, but don't highlight too much text or it defeats the purpose. Colored pens are fun to write with if you want to get more creative with your notes, but use them only for sections of your notes that you feel will be on a test or are important.

, Wasting nights pouring over books and emerging feeling like you've gotten nothing out of it is just about the worst. Instead of falling asleep over your textbook, try the following:

Make a study guide and review it. Look in the textbook and put all important ideas and details in your notes. Go over it until you feel like you know the material well. If you've written it, you'll probably remember more of it.
Make someone test you on the study guide. Talking about the information out loud is a lot easier to retain than going over the same stuff in your brain over and over. When you have to explain it to someone else, it forces you to understand it, not just know it.
Invent fun ways to study. Make flash cards, have a friend over, or join an after-school homework club if you can for help from a teacher or friend from the same class. You can make a board game to make studying fun and easy, or you can just type up your notes if it makes it easier to read. Do as much as possible to make sure you know the material.

, You've done your homework, so you're totally prepared to participate in class. Show that you know your stuff! There are a few reasons this is a good idea. The most important one is that participating in class will cement in your head the stuff you learned from doing your homework (before it was more like Jell-O).


The second good reason is that it will cement the information in your brain. Seriously. Talking about it out loud (especially in class, where it's a bit more stressful than when with a friend) uses a different part of your brain than just writing about it. This way, you're covering all your bases.
The third good reason is that your professor will totally appreciate it. No teacher likes a room full of crickets. Get on their good side, and you'll get treated better when grade time comes around or when you ask for extra credit.

, If you're not sure what's required for a good grade or are struggling with the coursework, ask your teacher for help. It doesn't have to be a complex question; your teacher is always happy to help you. Ask after class, during office hours, or in an e-mail for assistance.Often things we're told one-on-one stick with us more than things we're just being lectured about. In addition to the personalized learning session, your teacher will appreciate your efforts and straight up probably like you more. Having a teacher that likes you can come in very, very, very handy.

, If in the end the subject is super hard and you just can't understand it, get a tutor to help you. sometimes a tutor is even more helpful than getting a one-on-one with a teacher because they are closer to your age and can explain things to you in a manner that you can understand better.

, Time management is essential. If you're given an assignment that's due next week, don't procrastinate; get started within a few days of receiving the assignment. The more time you have, the less you'll stress.

If possible, try to get assignments finished at least two or three days before the due date. This is to avoid last minute emergencies, like ""the dog eating your paper,"" a party invitation, the printer running out of ink, illness, family emergency, etc. Most teachers will deduct points for each day your work is late. Some do not accept late papers at all. If it helps you, try handing in your homework a couple days before it's due.
Homework counts for a large portion of your grade. If your teacher has any extra credit assignments, do them! It won't hurt if you try it out. Even if you get some wrong, your teachers will still notice your effort to try to learn more.

, Make sure that if you do your homework when your teacher or friend checks it that after school you go through it. If you do not understand it it will be better if you write down any questions that you need to know and ask your teacher after politely. Join extra classes too it will help you get better grades fast. Get tutor lesson if you can not afford your teacher will help you for free if she or he wants to.

, Set yourself goals and make sure you reach them before you go out and party. Having a social life is important, but your grades can affect a lot of your choices for the future. Schedule time each day to study, just as you would schedule dates or parties.


You can reward yourself for getting your homework done! Once you've completed it, it's TV, food, or party time. If that's not enough, ask if mom or dad can help you get incentivized. They want you to get good grades, too!

, Studying for tests with friends is super beneficial, so why not do homework with friends, too?! Not only will you stay motivated (and possibly stay interested in the class), but you'll be able to combine your levels of awesome and get things done more quickly, effectively, and possibly creatively.


The key here is to choose a friend that will pull his/her weight. You don't want to work with a friend that expects you to do all the work. Nor do you want a friend that wants neither of you to work! Choose a friend that's as goal-oriented as you are.

, The quickest way to get a zero on an assignment is to plagiarize it. Technology is amazing nowadays and your teacher will know if you're plagiarizing. Whether it's Google Translate or a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr., they'll know. So don't risk it.

, There is strength in numbers, even when it comes to studying. Bouncing ideas off each other and combining knowledge is a resource that is invaluable. Just make sure you don't distract each other or spend you whole time chatting with each other about the day!


This takes the information off the page and makes it fun and memorable. When you have to explain something to a friend, your brain has to wrap around it, instead of just taking it in and hoping that it stays. Make flashcards and study guides for each other to cover all the material.

, Things like mnemonic devices can really trigger information that doesn't otherwise want to stick. Odds are you probably know Roy G. Biv for the order of the colors of the rainbow or ""My very exhausted mother just slept until noon."" for the order of the planets. Why is that? They're effective mnemonic devices that stick in your mind! Associations work, too. If you're trying to remember that India used to be a British colony, picture the queen jogging laps around the Taj Mahal. When the test comes, you may not remember what you actually should remember, but you'll remember enough to jog your memory!

, You need a good, calm place to study. Make sure you have a sweater in case it gets cold, a good, comfy chair, some dark chocolate (brain power!), a bottle of water, and whatever else you may need. That way, you'll have few interruptions.


Research also shows that you should study in more than one place. It sounds a little funny, but your brain makes associations with your environment. So the more associations it has, the more likely you are to retain the information. Locate all the comfy chairs and study in them all!

, Although it's inevitable sometimes, cramming isn't the way to go. In fact, taking breaks is good for your brain and will help you retain more. Try to study in 20-50 minute intervals, taking five or ten minutes in between.And if you're on top of things, it's best to study over a full week. Several sessions will cement the knowledge in your head and by the end you'll be able to notice how much better you know the content, allowing you to relax and be confident.

, Easier said than done? Remember - you have all of the answers in your head already! The only challenge is getting them out! Your first instinct is nearly always correct. Don't go back and change answers. If you are really not sure, skip it and come back later.


Always read the questions given on a test. Skimming over them might tell you the opposite of what you need to do.
If you're uncertain about the wording of a test question, go and ask the teacher what it means. As long as you don't flat out ask for the answer to a question, just what they meant by the question; they will usually answer.

, You need sleep in order to stay focused, and without it, you will have a hard time staying on task and may forget what you just learned. That's part of the reason why cramming is so evil!

Sleep is wonderful. Sleep deprivation can lead to accidents, dumbs you down, and can actually cause health problems.If you have to choose between one last cramming session and sleep, choose sleep.

, In college, though sometimes in high school too, it's tempting to choose classes that look super impressive or are just plain out of your reach. While taking difficult classes is great and you'll learn a lot, limit it to one or two. If all you have is rocket science, you're bound to get overwhelmed. Take Rocket Science 101 and Sand Volleyball. Your brain deserves the break!


Choose the right amount of classes, too. Being absolutely time-swamped won't do you any favors. When will you study? Stick to the normal amount (4 or 5 classes per semester for college) and do well in those. It's better to do well in a few than to do mediocre in many.

, The simplest way to get good grades is just to show up to class in the first place. Not only will you get the credit for attendance (hopefully), but you won't miss any imperative announcements, concepts the professor stresses, or bonus questions the teacher includes in class (sneaky buggers, aren't they?).


If you're ever on the borderline between grades, going to class will help you. Professors often look at attendance to see if the student's grade should be rounded up or down in questionable circumstances. Give yourself the benefit of the doubt and go!

, It is known that if students eat a good and healthy breakfast every morning, they generally get good grades and are able to focus better in school.Even if you're not hungry early in the morning, bring something with you for later.

You want to be not hungry -- not stuffed to the brim and sick. Instead of a six-egg omelette, go for a bowl of cereal and an orange. You'll feel more able to focus on your studies instead of that rock in your stomach.

, Give your brain a workout - try some fun puzzle exercises every day such as crosswords, Sudoku, and other games which are easy enough for anyone to do. This will boost your brainpower and you will be able to memorize more information at school.

Websites like Lumosityand Memriseare great resources! Memrise even lets you input your own information to learn!

, If you are given an hour to complete a 120 question test, that's 30 seconds per question. 30 seconds can be made into a lot of time. Many of the questions will take far less than 30 seconds, so apply the balance to a tougher question. Don't think too deeply on the time, and don't let yourself get distracted by the ticking of the clock.


Time limits are sometimes arbitrary. If you really need an extra 5 minutes, ask. A diligent student that needs a bit more time is a concession most teachers will be willing to make.

, Don't worry if people think you are a perfectionist or an overachiever. Be persistent with your work while everyone else is fooling around in class. In a few years you will more than likely never see these people again, but you will see the A's and B's on your transcript that could have been C's and D's if you hadn't practiced!
, Put your papers in the file so that you always have the correct things at the correct times. If you have a desk put the file in your desk. If you have a locker you can put the file in your book bag for the day but at lunch you can put it your locker or on your free period.

, Even do your homework in the car.

, Don't watch too much TV, and never get too caught up in your phone to the point of leaving the task at hand. A good way to make sure that this doesn't happen, is to turn your phone all the way off when you are studying or doing homework.

, Do the same each morning.

, Don't ever starve yourself, Don't take drugs or drink alcohol so you will be able to keep yourself focused.

, If you do not feel comfortable with tutors, then go to the book store and purchase some SAT preparation booklets.

, Take notes on any videos you watch.

, Just memorizing isn't going to help. Use flashcards, foldables, type up worksheets, type up new study guides, and look at what you are learning in a big picture. This might sound strange but read the textbook slower out loud.

, Don't talk to your friends when you are supposed to be paying attention.

, When you get a worksheet, don't just place it on top of your folder. Slide it in the pocket and don't forget it.

, You might have gotten a 100 on it but points would be taken off.

, After you have finished your regular assignments, complete all available extra credit.

, If you like the material, it is a cinch to engage and is ever-so-easy to learn.

Stay organized!,
Manage your time wisely.,
Don't procrastinate!,
Keep it neat!,
Be successful in the classroom.,
Adapt to all kinds of teachers.,
Be aware of your body language.,
Take good notes.",How to Get Good Grades and Overall Enjoy School," These are probably one of the most important ways to help succeed. If your school provides an agenda book of some kind, use it! Keep it interesting, perhaps by color coding subjects, or writing down interesting song titles, or decorating it with pictures of things you enjoy or think are funny.


Good looking actors and actresses are a good choice, also humorous or inspirational quotes work as well. If your school does not give you some kind of planner, buy one! They are not very expensive. You can buy a nice planner at your neighborhood dollar or department store.
Make sure you write down homework assignments, test dates, extracurricular commitments, project due dates, etc. Being aware of your schedule can really help you manage your time.;
, Prioritize your work for the day. For example, if you have a test coming up in two weeks, but you have some homework due tomorrow, work on the homework due tomorrow first, studying for that test following. Make sure you finish the work that needs to get done finished, leaving it till 10:30 at night or the next morning can leave things chaotic.

, Leaving studying for a big test to the night before is not very smart, and cramming never works, either. Instead, have 10-15 minute study sessions every day leading up to the test. That way, you will reduce stress, and remain prepared. Studies show that sometimes reviewing for a test before bed helps you remember the material better.

, This means keeping your locker(s), desk area, binders, make everything you can neat and tidy. Make sure you have tabs for different subjects or sections, just cramming papers without any obvious order is a recipe for disaster.


For note taking have some kind of 3-ring notebook for each core class. If taking notes on loose-leaf paper is easier, that's fine - but make sure you keep track of your notes. If this means having a folder for them, or a section in your binder just for those notes, do it! Notes can help you study for a test, review for the heck of it, or even help you understand the homework.

, This means many things. Coming to class 'every day will help you be prepared, which is probably the most important aspect of success. Being prepared means having your homework completed, having the necessary supplies, etc.

, Some are strict, and to gain their trust you must follow and respect their guidelines, failing to do some could get you in trouble. Another example, a teacher who is more prone to joke around a little in class-- remember never take advantage of their humor. Know when to be serious and to laugh a little.


Learning through laughter can sometime help you remember the material better, but if you find yourself laughing more than you are learning, try asking more questions, or requesting after-school time with the teacher when distracting classmates can't turn the conversation from educational to giggly.

, Usually teachers can tell when you are bored, or tired, or uninterested. If you completely understand the material, and are feeling bored, try to contribute the conversation - if there is one. If not, perhaps ask a question that will further your understanding of the material. Ask ""Why?"" something is the way it is. Doing so will eliminate the boredom, and give you reason to learn and understand.

, Learn to recognize important information. For example, usually if the teacher has taken the time to repeat something, or write it on the board, chances are it will be important later, perhaps on a test of some kind. However, do not write down everything the teacher says. It is a common misconception that doing so is the best strategy.


Trying to write as fast as your teacher speaks would be very difficult, and causes your hand to be sore from writing.
Not everything your teacher says is that important. For example, if they are telling you are story that applies to whatever you are learning, UNLESS they tell you to write it down, don't. If you're not really sure, try making a little arrow and putting the essential name/place or the core of the story behind it. When you are reviewing your notes later this will help jolt your memory. And if your still not sure if it's important or not, simply write it down at home.
Copying down everything they say is time consuming and pointless.
Another trick to know of is doodling. Studies show that doodling helps while taking notes. This is because of two good reasons. It keeps you awake, and it gives your mind an image to easily remember and associate with the notes you took.
Of course, don't doodle random things (that will keep you from paying attention), but doodle relevant images that resemble the notes you took. Sometimes all you need is a page full of creative-looking arrows to tie all of the notes together.
If you were absent, make sure to get notes from a fellow classmate, or have the teacher explain the material to you some time after or before school or class.

Throw all of your excuses out the window and stop procrastinating.,

Try to do at least 5 assignments for each class a day, starting with where you are behind at.,
Do not rush yourself.,

Get tutoring if you're not understanding the lessons in a particular class.",How to Get Caught up on Late Assignments (Homeschool)," This is one of the most important steps. Saying that you'll do it later will get you nowhere. Just look where it's gotten you now with all those late assignments. Nowhere.;
, What's stopping you from doing your work? Chores? Job? Maybe you're a parent and don't have a lot of time for your schoolwork? Laziness? Are you overly stressed from home related issues? Whatever the reason, you can work around those obstacles.


If you have chores to do, start by waking up early in the morning and getting those done and out of the way. This will leave you plenty of time during the day to knock out some late assignments.
You have a job? You come home tired and exhausted from dealing with rude customers all day and don't have the patience to deal with spinning your brain gears to get your work done? Ask your boss for a shift change. Ask if you can work nights instead of during the day. That way, you can come home at night, wash up, sleep and wake up for school.
You have a child? Tackle some assignments when they're asleep. Pop in a movie or give them some toys to play with beside you while you do some assignments. Opt for a laptop so you can easily access schooling wherever your child is. Thus, taking away the excuse that you can't keep them out of your sight.
Stressed? Try meditation techniques, early morning exercise or yoga, switch to a more balanced and healthier diet, talk to mom and dad about it, listen to soothing music, drink some herbal tea. All are stress busting techniques.
If laziness is what you have, tell yourself the rewards you would get for the work you do. Make sure you get those rewards only after you do your work!

, Usually you can do this by asking/calling your teachers, or looking at your grade book. Write down or type on a word document a list of missing assignments for each class. Be sure separate the classes into different sections not to mix everything up.

, If you have a couple big assignments like projects or essays, do one project a day. Never skip ahead, especially in classes like math, languages, or other complicated classes. You will be even more confused since you will probably need to know things about previous lessons to complete future assignments.

, This can take time but it's worth the effort if you want to get good grades. Take the time to learn the lesson just like you would if you were caught up with this week's work. Except, you're just doing more assignments each day. As long as you're doing your assignments and correctly, you'll get better grades and be caught up in no time.

, Skipping the most important meal of the day can really make you tired faster and you won't have energy to do any homework. Try to avoid greasy foods or fast food breakfast. Try a granola bar, yogurt, fruit juice, oatmeal, cereal, or make some eggs.

, Set a positive mindset and eliminate all the negative thinking. Instead of ""I'll never get this done."" repeat to yourself in your mind ""I'm going to do this!"". It may sound cheesy, but positive thinking gives you more mental willpower and motivation to do your work. Think of it this way, imagine yourself in a few weeks when all those assignments are done and you're caught up. You'll be proud of yourself, have better grades, and not be stressed about school all the time. The pros outweigh the cons by a long shot.



Treat yourself to a little sweet reward when you complete your assignments on your list for the day. This will motivate you to do more the next day and so on, because you'll be able to get that delicious Starbucks you've been craving or an ice cream. Who doesn't like ice cream?!

, Give them a call and ask if they can help you get caught up. Teachers want you to do your best, so why would they yell at you if they see that you want to get caught up. They will respect you being responsible in reaching out and accepting that you are behind.

, Even if you have been looking over the lesson material 60 times in a row and still don't get it, a tutor will help you. Call your teachers to see about getting one.

Knowing your mistakes will make it much easier to focus on ways to correct these in the future, as well as informing you of the likely errors you make often.;
, What were you good at? What weren't you good at? What can be improved? If you're stuck, or don't know why you got a bad mark, ask your teacher for help.

, If you have access to grading criteria, namely those lists that say ""An A grade answer will have done X, Y and Z"", look them up. Look at the difference between the grade you got and the grade that is above yours. This can help you determine what needs to be done to help you achieve the criteria in the next grade.


Focus on what you're missing out, gliding over or not learning enough for.

, This is particularly important if you are studying a topic you have never studied before. By doing this, you will get some background knowledge on the subject, which will make lessons easier for you during term time. You can just read the books or take notes as you go along- it's up to you.

, Also, make sure your study area at home is tidy and organized.

, They can offer you extra help. If you don't understand something, just ask. It doesn't matter how long you spend on something if you don't understand it.

, If the teacher knows that you want to learn by getting extra help, he or she will give you a point maybe if you are on a border line grade.

, Many schools give these for free. Write down not only what day you have a big test or assignment due, but also days on which you will devote a block of study time to preparation for the test or the the assignment.

, Once you know what your mistakes are, it's time to correct them. You might need some help for this so it's a good idea to get a tutor, teacher or anybody else whom you think might be able to help you. Remember, they are the people helping you so don't be afraid to tell them your problems in answering a question.

, Feeling secure about asking questions is important for ensuring that you know what is needed.

, That's the only way to absorb all the knowledge into your brain.

, How good is it already? It is probable that it needs improving. Consider how you could improve it. You could practice taking notes on the lyrics of a song or some script from part of a film if you need some practice at home. This step is particularly important if your course has lectures. Part of taking good notes involves writing down whatever the teacher writes on the board unless they say 'otherwise'. Also, if the teacher emphasizes any point, write that down as well. Another way that might help is if you type up your notes when you have a chance. This method makes them neater and easier to read and study from.

, If you have the opportunity to pick topics, pick them wisely. Think about what you are good at and, most importantly, what kind of subjects you enjoy. If you have never studied an optional subject before but you think it looks interesting, ask the teacher who teaches it what kind of skills are required and what kind of subjects it is similar to.

, Start your assignments at a routine time every day (when you get home, or right after dinner, for example). Don't leave things until tomorrow. Don't be afraid to take your time. Studying is not a race, and you will understand and retain better if you move at an even pace, rather than hurrying to get through things.

, This stimulates nerves that increase concentration. Taking natural products such as ginseng and omega-3 fish oils will increase neuron tissue growth.

, If you are still going at the same pace, it's time to try something different.

Ask early.,
Be exceptionally polite.,
Have a compelling reason.,
Go in person.,
Ask about a specific grade.,
Try making a case for the whole class.,
Understand why your teacher may not want to give you extra credit.",How to Get Extra Credit1," If you are asking for extra credit after the final exam, your professor or teacher is less likely to think about your request. If you see you are doing poorly in the class halfway through the semester, don't wait until the final week to ask. See what you can do right away, and your professor or teacher might be more willing to help you., You are asking the professor to do extra work. Therefore, you need to approach your professor with respect and deference, as it is up to her whether or not to grant your request.For instance, you could begin by saying, ""I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I know you have a busy schedule. I have a request to make that I realize may make more work for you, but I do have a legitimate reason for my request.""

, Most professors and teachers will be more lenient if you have a legitimate reason for missing a class or an assignment. For instance, if you were sick and had to miss several class periods, your instructor might be willing to give you extra credit or let you make up work. Similarly, if you have a close family member who is seriously ill, some teachers will take that under consideration.Work may be a legitimate excuse for some but not others.Have paperwork to back up your excuse if possible. For instance, you could take in a doctor's note or your work schedule.
You can make your case by saying something to this effect: ""I realize I've missed some classes, and I would really like to make that up with some extra credit so that I can learn the material properly. I know that typically you do not give extra credit. However, I did have some extenuating circumstances. My grandmother had a heart attack and was in the hospital. I drove down to see her and to provide support for my mom.""

, Many students make pleas for extra credit by email. It's easy for a professor or teacher to delete your email.It's not as easy to dismiss you in person. Make an appointment, or drop by during the professor's or teacher's office hours.

, If you really want to just make up a bad grade or test, ask specifically about that. Maybe you can retake the test or redo the work to make up some of the points. Often, you won't be able to get full credit back, but your teacher may be willing to give you partial credit.This request works well early in the semester, especially if you are a freshman in college or taking a difficult course in high school. You're trying to learn a new style of writing, testing, and grading that is more difficult, so your professor or teacher may be more lenient as you learn.You can approach your teacher by saying something to the effect of ""I was surprised that I did so poorly on this essay. I usually do well. I want to learn what it takes to do better in this class. I would love to hear your feedback and have the opportunity to rewrite this paper.""

, If you notice that most everyone did bad on a recent exam, try asking your teacher about extra credit for the whole class. She may be more willing to grant it if the opportunity is offered to everyone. Have something in mind before approaching her. Maybe you could go to a campus lecture related to the class and write a short paragraph about attending. Another option is to do a community service project related to the class.


For instance, you could say, ""I know we all did pretty bad on the last exam. Is there anyway we could get some extra credit as a class? I found a great opportunity where we could volunteer, and it's related to our class material. I'd be willing to sign in people for the opportunity.""

, Asking for extra credit implies you haven't done earlier work or you did poorly. Your teacher may just think you're after the grade and you don't really care about learning. In addition, your teacher likely will not want to offer you an extra credit opportunity that she doesn't offer to the rest of the class.Other teachers may feel that extra credit takes away from your regular work."
"
Check your syllabus.,
Pay attention in class.,
Look for bonus questions on tests.",How to Get Extra Credit2," If you're in a college course, your professor will hand you a syllabus at the beginning of the semester. Often, if the professor is going to offer extra credit, she will put it on the syllabus somewhere. She may go over it at the beginning of the semester, but she may not. Take the time to read your syllabus.In a high school class, your teacher may tell you about projects you can do for extra credit at the beginning of the school year.
Make notes about those projects, and ask your teacher for more information if you feel like she didn't provide enough details.

, Your teacher or professor may offer opportunities throughout the semester or school year. These opportunities could be anything from an extra project to attending a concert related to class material.Try to take advantage of these opportunities even if you don't think you'll need them.

, Study hard for tests, and pay attention to extra material in the class. Teachers and professors will often offer bonus questions on tests. These questions are sometimes harder than the regular questions or may make use of some miniscule detail. Other times, they may be something silly and have an obvious, easy answer. Take advantage of them."

Go over it to look for mistakes, and make sure you've mastered the material. If you mastered the material for your homework assignments and essays, you'll have an easier time when it comes to studying for tests., If throughout the semester you've been showing up to class, you've shown your professor you're committed. However, don't just show up--participate. Engage in the discussions that your professor is facilitating. Ask questions when you have them. Show your professor that you care about learning, not just about your grade.In addition, you'll learn more by being engaged, and your grades will go up. Plus, some professors make attendance part of your grade, so you can literally improve your grade just by being there.Also, by paying attention, you'll get a sense of your professor's personality and expectations. Knowing those two things can help you when you go to ask for extra credit, and they'll also help you write better for that professor when given essays., Try to jot down the main ideas while your professor is lecturing. Your professor will cover what she thinks is most important, so those notes will help you when get around to taking a test or writing an essay., You can't participate well without doing the work and without studying hard. Your education is your job. Like a job, you should expect to put in 40 hours a week. In high school, that may mean you're studying 4 to 5 hours a night, but in college, that definitely means you need to put in 5 hours of studying a night on weeknights.Take notes on the chapter. Try to capture important themes. The headings in the chapter should give you an idea of what is most important.Jot down questions. If the teacher doesn't cover what you don't understand, ask her about it during class., Turning in your homework with ample time takes some planning. If you have trouble with that kind of planning, get a student planner and record all your assignments in it. Add in reminders for when you need to start working on an assignment. Turning in your homework improves your grade, helps you learn the material, and shows you are committed., Whether your a visual learner, an auditory learner, a tactile learner, or something in between, use it to your advantage. If you're a tactile learner, make sure to incorporate it into your studying. Maybe you need to write notes when you're first learning material or even re-write them when you are studying for a test. If you're auditory, maybe your best bet is to read aloud or be read to. Many ebooks have a read aloud option, so you can use that to help you learn., Tests are often a large part of your grade. However, not everyone knows how to study for tests, and not everyone takes tests well. You can, however, teach yourself to do better on tests.Plan what you need to study. Often, your professor or teacher will give you a study guide for your test. If she doesn't, you can still make an outline by using the syllabus or textbook. Look at the major ideas, and decide how much detail you need to go into for your test. Remember, it's always best to study what you know the least about. If you know something really well, don't spend as much time reviewing it.Have a plan for the test. If you think you'll forget something, write it down when you first get the test. Skip questions you don't know. You can always come back to them later if you have time. For multiple choice, come up with an answer before looking at the answer choices, while for essay questions or short answers, make a small plan for the points you want to include. Finally, always be sure to read all questions carefully. You don't want to miss a question you know just because you were rushing through the test."

Come prepared for your test.",How to Get Better Grades when You're Almost Failing," You will save a lot of time and potentially wasted effort by speaking to your teacher directly about what he or she thinks you can do to improve your grade. This will also allow you to identify potential ""easy fixes,"" or minor things you have been doing wrong. Every teacher has different expectations, so this is a critical first step toward getting better marks!Speak to your teacher in person. Unless your teacher has previously stated a preference for email communication, it is best to approach her before or after class or during office hours. Your teacher is busy and has lots of students, so having a discussion face to face will help her remember who you are and the nature of your situation.
Express genuine concern when discussing your grade with your teacher. Any teacher is more likely to want to help if she believes you actually care about her class.
Avoid making excuses or placing blame for your poor performance. Telling your teacher all the reasons why you haven't done your homework only conveys to her that the class is not a priority for you. If you accept responsibility for the situation, your teacher might be more understanding and flexible.
If your teacher has not explicitly stated that no extra credit is allowed, ask her whether you can do additional work to bring up your grade. Do not make this request if she has already stated that extra credit is not available. If your teacher agrees to allow extra credit work, make sure you complete it and turn it in by the due date.;
, Your teacher likely holds office hours multiple times per week, and may even be available via email at other times. This is the best resource you will find to improve your understanding of the material, and it is very often under-utilized by students. Teachers often have only a handful of students show up to office hours in an entire semester, and they definitely take notice if you make the effort to attend. During office hours, ask specific questions about material with which you are struggling. Your teacher is not going to want to repeat an entire lesson she has already given in class.
You will get the most out of your teacher if you contact her in advance of your meeting to let her know on which general topics you are seeking help.
If you make an appointment with your teacher to attend office hours, don't miss it! Teachers (like most people) get very annoyed when they are stood up. If for some reason you can't make it to your appointment, be sure to inform your teacher with plenty of advance notice.

, If you feel that your teacher cannot explain the material to you in a way you can understand and if studying on your own doesn't seem to be working, then consider professional tutoring services. A tutor can only assist you with the material; it is still your responsibility to do the necessary work in order to improve. You can find tutors online, through services at your school, or by asking your teacher for recommendations.


Get individual assistance. Some tutors prefer to tutor groups of students all at once, but you are more likely to get the attention you need by meeting with a tutor one-on-one. This also ensures that you get the most for your time and money (if you are using paid services).
If you intend to use your school's free tutoring services, request someone with expertise in your particular area of need. Some college tutoring services, for example, might pair you with a general science tutor when you actually need help with microbiology, which requires specialized knowledge.

, If you have friends in your class who are doing well and grasp the material more easily than you do, ask them to help you study. If they are doing well, they are probably putting in study time already, and likely won't mind helping you out. Teaching or explaining complex topics can also help people learn the subject better themselves, so this kind of arrangement is mutually beneficial.


Form class workgroups with good students. If your class requires group work for things such as laboratory exercises or projects, join a group with students who are hard-working and who understand the material. You will have a hard time making progress on your work if you are in a group with others who are struggling, easily distracted, or who don't take the class seriously. If you are placed in a group that you think will be counterproductive to your goals, politely ask your teacher to switch groups and tell her why.
If you don't know anyone in your class, use a class email list serve or social media group (such as Facebook) to reach out to classmates who might be willing to help you with the material. Simply explain in your correspondence that you are struggling with certain topics but you are willing to do whatever you can to learn the material and improve in the class.
Be careful not to rely solely upon classmates to teach you the course topics. After all, they are just learning this stuff, too! If a classmate tells you something about the material that doesn't seem right to you, double-check with other sources (such as the textbook and your teacher). The more sources you can find to confirm the details of the topics of concern, the more certain you can be that the information is reliable.

, If your textbook is unclear and your teacher's explanations go over your head, it might be a good idea to look for supplemental learning resources online. The internet is full of valuable (but also extremely unreliable) information, and chances are good that you can find information online that is easier to understand than the often dense, complex writing found in textbooks.


Check to see if your textbook has any supplemental online learning materials associated to it. Some publishers have started creating online toolkits to accompany the print version of their textbooks, and many offer free access to these resources if you purchased the book. These online tools are often interactive and present alternative explanations of the topics contained in the book, which might be easier to make sense of. Information about such resources can usually be found inside the cover of the textbook or on the publisher's website. Alternatively, you can ask your teacher.
Find external online resources. Use an online search engine (such as Google) to seek information about the topics you are studying. Online wikis, discussion forums, and professional journals devoted to your subject of interest are good places to look for additional information. Be careful to avoid reading false or poorly-sourced information. If a website provides no sources for its information, seems full of advertisements or spam, or just doesn't seem legitimate, it is probably best not to trust it. Look for resources written by professionals (for example, articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals) and with lots of cited sources; these are likely to provide accurate and reliable information.

, Even if your teacher does not take attendance, chances are she does notice who does and doesn't regularly show up. You will learn the material more easily and remain in your teacher's good graces if you go to class every day.


Arrive to class on time. Many teachers find late arrivals distracting and disrespectful. If you come to class early and are prepared to learn when class begins, you are showing your teacher that you care about learning the material and improving your grade.
If you have to miss a class meeting for a valid reason (such as a scheduled medical procedure, jury duty, or other unavoidable commitment), notify your teacher beforehand. Don't forget to provide your teacher official documentation of the reason for your absence as soon as you return to class. Even if your planned absence is for an ""unexcused"" reason, your teacher is likely to appreciate being notified ahead of time.

, Make a conscious effort to focus on your teacher and/or the relevant activities while in class; doing so will help you retain more information and shows your teacher that you are interested. Diligent note-taking is a good way to keep yourself on task and will help you study more effectively later on.


When taking lecture notes, don't try to copy down every word on your instructor's slides. Rather, focus on listening to what the instructor says and take shorthand notes on that information. Be sure to write legibly and in a style that you can understand later.
Sit toward the front of the classroom so you can easily see the board/screen. You will be less likely to daydream or become distracted by those around you if you are sitting in plain view of your teacher and have the class out of your field of view. This also helps convey that you are focused on learning, and your teacher is likely to take notice of who regularly sits in the front of the room during lectures.

, Don't wait too long after lecture to review your notes. You are more likely to absorb the material if you review it frequently and without long interruptions. If you don't have time right after class, be sure to go through your notes at least once before you go to bed that night.


Try to recall what was being shown and said during class when reviewing your notes. This will help stimulate your brain to recall the information more easily. If you have access to lecture slides, go through them at the same time as your notes to help recreate the classroom context. It may help to go through the relevant chapters of your textbook at the same time.
Don't rush through your notes. In order to reap the benefits of reviewing your notes after class, you'll need to read through them carefully and think about the context of the material. Simply skimming the words in your notebook is less effective in helping you absorb the material (though this is certainly better than not reviewing your notes at all).

, Teachers often design lectures with the assumption that students have already been exposed to the material through assigned readings. You will get the most out of lectures if you read about the subjects prior to attending class. This will also allow you to come to class with any clarifying questions you may have.


Devote enough time to completing assigned readings that you are sure to at least absorb the main points of the discussion. If you wait until you are already tired on the night before class to begin the reading, you will struggle to get through it and probably won't remember it very well.
Take notes on the main points of the reading and review them before lecture. This will prepare you to grasp the lecture material more easily and will reinforce the important points of the topic(s).
While you are reading, think of questions you can ask your teacher in class about the material in the textbook. This can help you link important concepts together and will help you absorb what you read. This also shows your teacher that you are doing the assigned reading before class and taking an active role in your learning.

, Don't be a passive student. This means asking questions when you have them, answering questions when they are asked, volunteering for demonstrations or activities, and taking an active role in discussions or projects. By doing this, you will learn the material more easily and show your teacher that you are invested in the class. Ask open-ended questions (those that cannot be answered by a simple ""yes"" or ""no"") that will prompt your teacher to clarify or explain the topic in another way. Examples of questions you can ask are, ""How does this relate to the topic we discussed yesterday?"" or ""What do you mean by that?"" or ""Can you give an example of how this works?""
If your teacher does not allow questions to be asked during lecture, write your questions down as they come to you and go to her with them immediately after class or during office hours. If you ask your questions right when (or soon after) they come to you, you will be more likely to boost your understanding when you get an answer.

, Chances are you have certain preferences for the way you learn about things. For example, this might mean that you are a ""visual learner"" (someone who benefits from seeing images that demonstrate the concepts of interest) or that you are not easily able to absorb concepts from reading textbooks. Knowing how you are best able to learn new subjects can be a major benefit and is something you should consider when deciding how to study.


Tell your teacher early on in the term about your learning preferences. If the class is designed in a way that does not work for your learning style, ask your teacher for recommendations on how you might be able to modify your study approach to improve your chances of success.
If you feel you may have a learning issue that you cannot cope with yourself, contact your school's academic counseling or disability services office. If you are designated with a learning disability that requires special accommodations, your teacher will be required to comply.

, Your brain will function much more effectively if you are physically active and well rested. This will help you absorb and retain the material and more easily recall it during quizzes and exams. Set up exercise and sleep schedules for yourself and do your best not to deviate from them. Don't stay up studying or reading past your bedtime unless absolutely necessary, as this will make you less likely to benefit from your work and will limit your ability to learn effectively the next day.
Experiment with different schedules and physical activities to determine what works best for you. For example, if you benefit from waking up early, schedule your sleep time so that this is possible. If you feel best after taking a short midday nap, build this into your schedule. If you are energized by an evening bike ride, make sure you take a break from studying or reading to do so.

, Your poor performance in class could be a result of stretching yourself too thin. If you have lots of extracurricular commitments or spend lots of time on leisurely activities, consider dropping one or more of them and allocate that time to studying.Some commitments are more easily dropped than others. If you have a job and need to work to pay your rent, then obviously this is a priority you can't easily drop. With some thinking, you should be able to figure out which of your extracurricular activities are unimportant, at which point you can decide whether to let some of them go in the interest of focusing more on your schoolwork.
Keep a log of your daily time allocation for a few days to a week and look through it to identify blocks of time you could use more efficiently. You might be surprised to find how much time in a given day is spent doing nothing or doing things more slowly or inefficiently than you could. Finding time during the day to study or fit in a workout will be easier once you've eliminated unnecessary downtime or organized your schedule more efficiently.

, Much like scheduling your sleep and exercise, scheduling your study time will make you more likely to adhere to it. This can also help you divide your time appropriately between various academic commitments. A study schedule can help you avoid wasting time or delaying getting started.You can look ahead on your course syllabus to find out what is required of you for the upcoming week. Design your study schedule with this information in mind so you know which classes have heavy versus light homework or reading loads on a given day. If you notice that two different classes have large projects due on the same day, do your best to finish one early so you aren't stuck working on two things at once.
Depending on your other commitments (such as work or sports practice), your study schedule might vary from day to day or week to week. This could make it hard to remember your schedule on a given day, so you might need to carry a copy with you (for example, printed out on paper or in a calendar app on your smart phone) for easy reference.

, Don't rush through assignments or readings. If you put significant time into your studies, you're much more likely to understand the material and improve your scores. However, you should be careful to avoid spending too much time on any one task. Striking a good balance between your various coursework requirements might mean you cut yourself off a bit early from one task and move on to another.


If you have trouble figuring out how much time is appropriate for a given assignment or project, ask your teacher for a general guideline. However, keep in mind that only you can know how much time you can realistically spend on homework because this will depend in part on your other commitments.
As a last resort, you can consider asking a teacher in one class to reschedule a due date if you have a major conflict in another class, such as an exam on the same day. Do not get in the habit of doing this, however, because teachers likely have their own scheduling issues to deal with.

, It is important to make your happiness a priority! Some activities may be unrelated to your academic goals but play a larger role in your overall well-being. School can be tough, but it is important to try to enjoy life as much as possible. Maintaining an activity you enjoy, even if it feels like you should be studying instead, can have a positive impact on your overall attitude toward school and even on your academic performance.Use fun activities as a reward for your hard work. If you complete an assignment ahead of schedule or ace a quiz, take some time to do something you enjoy. This could be anything from watching a movie to going out with friends to taking a day hike - whatever you like!
While having fun, refrain from dwelling on the things you're not doing. If you spend your hobby time thinking about all the things you have to do, you won't get much out of your 'fun' activity. Focus on being present in the moment while doing things you enjoy and you'll feel much better when you get back to work.

, In order to improve your ability to recall information during a quiz, test, or exam, you will need to have reviewed it long before the test date. Waiting until the week of the test to study half a semester's worth of material (an approach called ""cramming"") is a recipe for disaster. It is not possible to effectively absorb that much material in such a short amount of time, so you are better off pacing yourself and spacing your studies out.Form a study group early in the term and hold each other to a schedule. This will create accountability for you and your group mates so that you are more likely to follow through. Just make sure you ditch the group if it isn't working for you.
Ask your teacher several weeks before a test or exam whether it is possible to obtain a study guide. If your teacher obliges, begin working on it immediately and continue with it gradually throughout the term. This will help you identify problem areas or topics you find confusing. The earlier you tackle this, the better your chances of succeeding on the test!

, Sometimes reading through your notes or the textbook can create a false sense of understanding. To truly gauge your comprehension of the material, quiz yourself on a range of topics in the days following their introduction in class. This will help you identify those areas you may not understand as well as you thought.


Create flash cards with key terms and definitions. Look at the terms and try to recall from memory what the definitions are without looking at them. Speak your answers out loud or write them down before checking to see if you are correct. Do this often and you will eventually have those terms committed to memory.
Ask a friend or classmate to quiz you. This is another way to ensure that possess sufficient comprehension of the material. Having another person assist you with your self-assessment is another way of holding yourself accountable for studying and increases your exposure to important course concepts. Be sure to return the favor!

, In order to adequately prepare for a test or exam, you should know whether the test will be in multiple choice, essay, matching, true/false, or some other format. You don't want to study for an essay test by relying solely on term-definition flash cards, because this study method will not be a good indication of your preparedness for writing an essay.


For essay format tests, practice writing essay-length descriptions of major topics presented in class. You can do this by selecting bold-faced terms or chapter section headings from your textbook and writing out complete explanations (in your own words) of those topics.
For multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank format tests, have a classmate create sample test questions from the important concepts presented in lecture and in the textbook and quiz you on them. You can also check the end of each chapter in your textbook for potential sample study/quiz questions, which they often contain, and do those.

, The last thing you want is to be distracted while taking a test because of some simple factor that could have been prevented. Ensuring that you are physically comfortable will allow you to devote all your attention and mental capacity to the task at hand.


Get a full night's sleep before your test. If you show up exhausted and sleep-deprived to your test, you will have trouble focusing and recalling the material. Definitely do not sacrifice sleep to cram for a test you haven't adequately prepared for. You are far better off coming to the test well-rested.
Eat a balanced meal before your test. If you are hungry or thirsty during your test, you will be distracted by your discomfort and your focus will suffer. Just make sure that you don't eat something that will upset your stomach or make you need to use the restroom in the middle of your test (which some teachers will not allow!).
Bring clothing appropriate to the classroom environment and season. You don't want to be too cold, too hot, too itchy, etc. during your exam. It might be a good idea to bring an extra sweater if your test is being held in a room different from your normal classroom, just in case it is much cooler than you expected.

, Take note of the materials you will need for your test. Your teacher will not be happy if you forget to bring a pencil to the exam when she brought it up multiple times in the weeks leading up to the exam. She also might not have any extra materials for you to use during the test.


Double check that you have all the required test materials the day before the test, and make sure to acquire anything you don't already have. Put them in your backpack or bag the night before your test so you are sure not to forget them when you leave the house.
Bring extras of anything that could break or run out during your test. Pens, pencils, erasers, and calculator batteries are examples of these kinds of items.
Arrive early. Coming prepared also means being in your seat and ready to begin the test at the start of class. If you are running late, you will likely be panicky and flustered when you sit down to take the test and this will impact your focus and performance. Your teacher might not even let you take the test if you show up late!

Don’t quit if you have a learning disability.",How to Get Better Grades in Elementary School," One of the most important things you can learn at the start of the school year is where your grade comes from. This means asking what assignments get a grade, and how much each one is worth. This will let you know the really important assignments, as well as the things you need to do to help improve them. Your teacher probably gave you some of this information at the beginning of the school year, but it can always help to ask., Remember that your teacher is the person who gives you grades, so if you want to make sure your grades get better, she is the first person you should ask. If your grades aren’t as high as you want them to be, talk to your teacher so she can explain why you got what you have, and specific things you can do to improve.When you talk to your teacher, you want to be polite and ask questions that will help you get better. Ask things like “What should I do to get a better grade?” or “Why did I get that question wrong?” This will let your teacher give specific answers of things you can work on.

, If you want to get better grades, talk to your parents about it. This doesn’t just mean talking about your problems. It is important to talk about school with your parents as much as you can. Make sure you tell them about the subjects you are learning, and any problems you are having. If you don’t tell them, they may not know there are any problems., They should already be talking through conferences and things like that, so you can ask them to talk about specific things when they are there. Of course, if they haven’t had a conference in a while, go ahead and ask your parents to talk to your teacher. Of course, you should tell them why, and it’s okay to want to get better grades. Just remember that if your parents give you information from your teacher, you should follow it., If you, your parents, and your teacher are working hard, but just can’t get your grades up, maybe someone else can help. This can be a tough thing to ask for, but depending on your issues, it might be the right thing to do.


One thing to do is get a tutor, someone who knows the subject really well and can work with you directly to help you get it. Because they know the subject very well, and are meant to work closely with you, they can give you more one-on-one attention. Tutors can cost money, though, so talk to your parents about it, This can be tough in some parts of elementary school because you have assigned seating. However, if you have the chance, try to get a seat close to the front. You’ll be closer to the teacher, more engaged in what she is talking about, and you’ll remember more information.If your class is doing some activity out of your chair, that would be a great chance to make sure you get up in the front.

, If your teacher asks a question, try to give an answer. You won’t get in trouble for giving a wrong answer as long as you are trying to be serious. Even if you are wrong, it will give the teacher an opportunity to give you the right information. That way, when the question comes up on the test, you’ll be ready.This means asking questions too. If your teacher says something and you don’t understand it, ask for her to explain it again. This will show the teacher that you really want to know the information, and do well in class. You can ask during class, or write down your questions and ask the teacher after class is over.

, Writing down information that your teacher gives you is important. You might already be doing this, but you can always improve. Make sure you have enough paper and pens/pencils when school begins so you are always prepared to be writing when your teacher starts talking.You shouldn’t write down everything your teacher says, as you’ll never be able to keep up. Instead, listen to the teacher when they tell you something is important. Write down information that gets put on the board. These pieces of information are definitely worth remembering, and knowing them will help you do well on graded assignments. You can also talk to your teacher about better ways to tell what information is really important for you to know.
There are many different ways to take notes, and you should look for the one that helps you understand information the best. Try outlining your information, where you divide the paper into main ideas and secondary ideas. You can also use visual aids, that is finding ways for different information to look different, such as pictures, graphs, or diagrams. You can use different colors or different-sized elements to enhance these changes.For older students, you can consider the Cornell Method, which is another way to help you organize and review your notes.

, You may already be doing all of the reading, and still struggling to get it right. This means you need to improve the way you are reading. You should be able to understand and explain what you just read. If you forget things shortly after reading them, try some of these ideas to help you retain more information and figure out the important parts of your reading.


Try reading out loud. In elementary school, your assignments will probably be pretty short, so it won’t take too long to get through them. Saying the words out loud will help you understand things more clearly, and make you a better reader.When reading, highlight key words and phrases, and make sure to review them afterwards with your parents to help understand why they are important to the main idea. Start by highlighting key words or phrases. You can also use highlighting to identify words and phrases that you don’t understand, so you can ask your parents and teacher about them later. , One big thing you can do to help yourself is to get organized. If you aren’t organized, you’ll lose things, forget to do them, or forget to turn them in. This will help you be prepared, and keep track of what you need to do every night. You can get separate notebooks and folders for different subjects, and a pencil box so you always have something to write with.If you are a little older, you might get a planner, where you write down all of your homework assignments and when they are due. It may take some practice to get used to following your planner, but if you write down all the things you have to do that night, you will more likely remember them and get them done.
Another good thing to do when preparing is to make sure all of your stuff is ready to go the night before. Once you finish your homework, pack up your school bag and leave it some place ready for the next day. That way, you don’t have to spend time looking for things in the morning. That’s when you’ll forget things, which is never good.

, This means following your teacher’s instructions, treating your classmates with respect, and not distracting yourself with cell phones or other books. When you misbehave, you will get in trouble and need to serve some punishment. It is much harder to learn and keep up with work if you are in a time-out, having to visit the principal, or just not paying attention.


Getting in trouble for misbehaving at school can also hurt your grades. Even if you get all the answers right on your homework and tests, your grade will still not be an A if your teacher lowers your grade because you didn’t pay attention or follow the rules.
Your parents will probably know the school’s policies for appropriate behavior, including the dress code and appropriate language for reference. If you are unsure about something, talk to them to make sure you are following the rules., Having a regular schedule for doing your homework can be a great help when trying to improve your grades. Do your best to make sure this homework time happens at the same time every day. This will help you get into a rhythm of doing your work at the same time, so you’ll always know when you should be doing homework.Don’t forget to think about other activities when you plan your homework time. It’s okay to do other things like soccer practice, dance lessons, or even playdates. Just remember that you need to make sure you have time to do school work in addition to those things.

, During your homework time, make sure you don’t have any distractions. Turn off the TV, video game, cell phone, anything that will take your attention away from your homework. This can also mean your parents, siblings, or pets, really anything that might distract you from working. If you aren’t paying attention, that makes it more likely you’ll do something wrong., When you finish doing an assignment, or reading something, ask your parents to check what you did. They can help you see things that you can improve and check your answers so you know what needs to be fixed. They can also quiz you on reading to see how well you remembered and understood it.Just remember, if your parents find something wrong in your homework, you’ll need to do it again to get it right. Otherwise, you’ll turn in something to the teacher you know is wrong, and that won’t help you improve your grades.

, When you think about getting higher grades, consider what kind of grades you want. You may want to get straight A’s, but depending on where you are in the school year, it might be too late. That’s okay, and you should still work to get better grades, but if you set your goals too high like that, you will only get frustrated if you can’t reach them.Talk to your parents and teachers about setting realistic expectations. They know your skills, and can help you from getting too frustrated. They can also help make sure your goals are high enough. Even if you can’t get straight A’s, maybe you can A’s in one or two subjects along with improving all of your scores.
You can also talk to your parents about getting rewards for good grades, maybe a small raise on your allowance, or a new toy. That way, you’ll have something to work towards. Of course, your parents can always say no to this idea, that’s up to them.

, Breakfast is an important meal that will fuel you up each morning, making you ready for school before it starts. Make sure you get a healthy breakfast with whole grains, fiber, and protein. Talk to your parents about the best kinds of foods, and ask them to make sure those foods are in your house for breakfast.Good foods include fresh fruit, whole grain, low-sugar cereal, yogurt, or trail mix. The nice things about some of these foods are that they are also easy to eat and make. Also, they benefit if you and your parents are in a rush early in the morning (which will probably happen a lot!).
If you don’t feel hungry when you wake up, make sure to take some breakfast food with you so you can have something a little later in the morning when you are.

, You want to make sure you get plenty of sleep every night, as many as 10 to 12 hours, so you are awake and alert at school the next day. If you don’t get sleep, you’ll be tired or irritable during the day, meaning you won’t pay enough attention during school. If your parents set a bedtime for you, follow it.Getting a lot of sleep can be tough with so many electronic distractions available. It might be a good idea to shut off phones, TVs, and computers an hour before your bedtime, and make sure there aren’t any such devices in your bedroom.

, Once you have finished with your assigned work, find other things to read. Reading more can help you become a better reader and writer, which will help improve your grades. You can also learn more about subjects in school that you think are interesting.Remember that learning is a skill, so when you do more of it, you’ll get better at it. This will help you do better in school, even with the stuff you don’t necessarily like.
This doesn’t just mean finding things online or reading comics. Talk to your teacher about books that are good for your reading level and interests so you can find good things to read.
You can also look for interesting events and activities. Maybe you really like studying science. Along with finding good books on science, you can find experiments to perform at home, or take a trip to a museum with your parents.
Remember, your goal is to improve your grades, so make sure this extra reading comes after you do your homework.

, Sometimes your bad grades happen not because you are a bad student, but because you have trouble paying attention or reading properly. Learning disabilities are common, and you shouldn’t get discouraged if you have one. Talking to your teacher, parents, and doctor, you can learn to deal with these challenges so you can do well in school.


If you find that you are having trouble taking these other steps to improve your school work, have your parents talk to your doctor. He will be able to test you (or send you to someone who can) to see how well you learn. If there is a problem, like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Dyslexia, a doctor will be able to suggest ways to treat you so you can focus and do well in school."

If there is a movie adaptation of the book, watch it.,
If the book has a Wikipedia page, read it.

,
Go to the Sparknotes and/or CliffsNotes websites.,
If your book is not on these websites, do a Google search on the book title.,
Your search will yield thousands of results.,
Take notes.,
Your teacher will likely expect you to do one of two things: turn in a paper or pass a test taken in class.

,
The key to getting a satisfactory result on a paper is to sound like you know what you're talking about.,
For tests, the key is to remember the context of the book.",How to Get an A Without Reading the Book," If there is more than one movie, watch as many versions as you can. Read the first and last chapter of the book, as well as the summary on the back or inside flap.;
,, If your book is considered literature, especially classic literature (i.e. written before 1950), it is probably featured on one or both of these sites. These websites summarize, analyze, and give context for various books. They also give detailed character and quotation analyses. Take note of the major themes and symbols as well.

, If the book you did not read pertains to math, science, or social studies, a topic search might also be helpful.

, Don't waste time sifting! Choose sites that end in .edu, .org, or .gov; these are more reliable for trustworthy information. If you come across any online book reviews from magazines and/or newspapers, read those too. If you learn plenty of information about the book, you'll be more likely to get a better grade.

, It may seem painful, but do it anyway. Learn everything you can about major conflicts and plot points, setting, characters and key themes, symbols and motifs.

,, Make yourself a solid outline so you remember to stay on topic. Make sure every point relates back to the book and to your thesis statement. If you can find quotations, structure your paper around them (one paragraph for every quote). Literature is highly subjective and open to interpretation, so as long as you don't go crazy-Freudian you should be safe. Bolster your paper with things your teacher says in class, but re-word it so it doesn't seem like you're just parroting it back. Use plenty of literary terms (metaphor, symbolism, imagery), but be absolutely positive you are using them correctly. You can also ask to borrow a friend's notes--or casually ask what their favorite part was--if you need to glean more information.

, If it's set in the Victorian era and there's a multiple choice or True/False question that references modern technology, you know that answer is wrong. While watching the movie or reading online articles, pay close attention to key plot points, causes of conflict, and characters' personalities. Memorize as many details as you can, including when and where the book was written, and any information you can find on the author. Carefully analyze each question and eliminate as many possibly incorrect answers as possible.

Ace tests easily.,
Put in extra time.,
Use your resources.,
Do your homework efficiently.,
Use a mind map.,
Be motivated.,
Learn the system.,
Take extra classes.",How to Get Ahead at School," Getting A's on tests is much easier than you think. One simple way to do this is to create study guides. Create an extensive, very simple study guide. Look up definition/solutions on Wikipedia, Yahoo Answers, and Ask Jeeves, even if you already know what the word means. Many of these websites give clear, simple definitions that are designed so that ordinary people can understand them. Get a clear, correct and simple definition for everything you will need to know. Then, go back into the textbook or review your notes. It will be much easier to understand them now that you actually know what everything means. Then you can continue work on your study guide. Add on to your simple definitions until they are up to the level of your class. Just writing them down will help you remember them, and you can look back at them later. A 3 page study guide can help a lot and can be done in under an hour. If you share them with your friends, they might share their next study guide with you. Working as a team like this can really help you out.;
, If you have some free time and you are bored, read the next chapter in your textbook. Do some problems and by the time your class catches up with you, everything in that chapter will be easy. If you don't have a textbook for a class, be curious. Look up definitions online, and look for lessons that you think will be coming up.

, SparkNotes usually isn't as good as reading a book, but it can help a lot if you have already read the chapter and then read the summary on SparkNotes. They will summarize it and emphasise the most important details. If you have read the chapter, everything SparkNotes says will increase your knowledge of the chapter. SparkNotes usually lists imagery and themes, and you can impress your teacher if you ""find"" another meaning to a chapter.

, A lot of homework can actually be done in school: on the bus, during a long speech, or while you are waiting for class to start. Do as much as you can in school so that you have time at home to get ahead or just hang out. You can't get ahead if you're stressed out all the time, so try to leave room for just doing nothing.

, Take 10 minutes to draw a mind map of each chapter you have finished. One of the best way to master a subject is to have a global and synthetic vision about it. A mind map will also be a quick and invaluable resource to revise before exams.

, Wanting to learn or being excited about a subject can be very hard, especially with math. But lots of books and movies can make you more interested in all sorts of subjects. For example, the movie Live Free or Die Hard featured a computer hacker who shut down the entire world. This might get you slightly more interested in your computer courses. The book Bringing Down the House is about 6 MIT students who use their math knowledge to count cards and win enormous amounts of money at Casinos. This book could get you more interested in math. It sounds strange but movies and books can interest you in even the most boring classes.

, Like all organizations, school works through set processes and systems. To do well in school you need to familiarize yourself with the systems in use in your school. To put it simply you need to find out exactly what it is that your teachers expect of you and then do it. It doesn't matter whether you are writing absolute nonsense as long as it is what the teacher wants to hear. The teacher will drop hints throughout lessons about what they expect of you but there are some simple things that you can do to help push your grades higher; always spell check and punctuate your work correctly, use a thesaurus to replace commonly used words with more sophisticated terms (this can backfire however, you need to make sure that the word you are using fits the context in which you are using it perfectly or else you will look foolish). Use color and humor in presentations, work that looks as though it has had some effort put into it will usually get teachers salivating. You can also ask your teachers for extra help, most of them will jump at the chance to help someone who looks as though they want to learn. And last but not least, always go above the call of duty, find out what the teacher wants and then do more. Without fail you will achieve good grades. It's all about working the system.

, If you want to get ahead, a good thing to do is to take extra classes to get prerequisites out of the way, or to just get more electives in before you graduate. Most schools only have 5 or 6 classes in a day although some schools have as many as 7 or 8, if you're in a school that offers more classes than the number of credits you need for graduation, take advantage of it instead of just taking study hall. Another way is summer school; if you are planning on taking a class in another district make sure you talk to your councillor to make sure your district will accept the credit. While summer school is great for those in districts which allow anyone to take summer courses, some districts only allow credit recovery students to take summer school courses. If your district will not allow you to take summer school courses or you have too much planned in the summer, try online courses; these are often costly although they will get you the credit you need/want. When looking for online high school courses make sure you check the accreditation, if they aren't accredited the class doesn't mean anything and you won't get credit for it. Always check with your councillor before signing up for extra classes.

, If a single paper is worth 50 percent of your grade, you should have your thesis in the back of your mind. Spend lots of time on projects that will significantly affect your grades.

, The syllabus should tell you how many hours of reading are generally expected in a week, so write it out on your calendar at the beginning of the term which days you are going to study for this subject.


Buy a term planner and organize your study time.Schedule a different subject every 3 to 4 hours so that your mind stays sharp.

, If you are an auditory person, then you should tape all the lectures and listen to them later. If you are a visual person, you should take notes or video tape the class for easier revision.

, Don’t let friends tell you that you are a “geek” or “nerdy.” In most classes, you can’t get an A unless you are willing to study hard.

, Your brain needs to breathe, rest and refocus., You should be able to hear, see and get noticed by the professor if you have a question.

, Retention rises dramatically if you reread it one or two times.

, Make bullet points as you go through the reading or homework, or review your annotations. Even if you are sleepy, your brain continues to process information as you fall asleep and doze., Ask questions if you don’t understand it. Think about it critically before you jump into the assignment., You will get the best results when the topic is fresh in your brain.

, Make notes in the margins, highlight terms and doodle illustrations or maps of the concepts. You can review the annotations more easily than an entire text, and you will think about the information more carefully as you read it.


Photocopy textbooks or write in pencil to avoid fines.

, Math skills, science concepts and writing may require outside study time to master. The extra time you take now will benefit you in all future classes.

, Always revise your first draft. Proofread and ask someone to review your final draft before turning it in.

, Changing your study room can actually improve your retention of the material., Studies have shown that the brain can make patterns between the things you already know and new data., The more you are asked to recall the information before the test, the more likely you are to recall it during the test.

, Search for the topic and then “quiz” or “test” and time a test exam. If you can’t find any, use your textbook or team up with a friend and come up with 10 questions for each other to answer., Try to look forward to a challenge, like a test, rather than shying away from it. Give yourself a treat, like a favorite snack or YouTube video before you take the test.

, You will get satisfaction from narrowing your choices down.

, Your grades will be compared to others’ grades, so you must always be well above average on your test. Plan to study harder in any class with a curve, since earning a near-perfect score is the only way to guarantee an A on a test.If your course is advanced, getting an A will be more challenging, since the majority of the students are interested in the material.

, Ask about the material and look for insights on how to understand the material.

, If you score low on a test or homework assignment, ask if you can redo a portion of it to earn a higher grade. Some teachers may not allow this, but others will appreciate your commitment to learning the information.

, Start at the beginning of the term and always turn in extra assignments. You can’t get an A+ without doing extra credit.

, Attendance is a good way to convince a teacher that you are interested. Listen and act engaged in the material and the teacher is more likely to give you extra chances.

Many companies offer package tracking, though the tracking options may be limited to the country of origin or the country where you'll be receiving your package.
Most services will forward letters and correspondences. However, some services will also forward packages, magazines, and bulk mail, while others will not.;
, Cost may be the most prohibitive factor for some people setting up a forwarding service. If you plan on receiving a high volume of mail/packages, you may want to opt for an annual delivery plan, which could save you money over paying per shipment.


Look at the service plans, base rates, cubic/dimensional weight rates, and extra cover charges.For high-frequency deliveries and other perks, you can expect to pay a high fee. Some service plans cost hundreds of dollars per year, while others may be somewhat cheaper, depending on your delivery needs.
If you only get mail on an infrequent or irregular basis, paying for an international mail forwarding service may not be worth the cost.
If you're unsure about potential hidden costs, it's best to contact a representative from the forwarding service and ask for a line-by-line breakdown of your anticipated costs.

, The frequency with which you receive your packages and the turn-around time on deliveries may be a determining factor for some users. Depending on your chosen service, you may have the option of receiving forwarded mail weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, on request, or on a customizable schedule.In addition to the options on how often to have your mail sent, some services also allow you to have your mail held for a period (usually up to 30 days) so that you can have it sent in one bulk delivery., One good way to determine a service's effectiveness is to compare user reviews online. Try searching for the service's name and ""reviews"" in a web search, or look for online compendiums that compare and contrast multiple services., Depending on the service you enroll with, you may have to sign a rental agreement, a forwarding agreement, or both.This is usually done at the time of enrollment, but you may need to sign a follow-up agreement if you make any changes to your account.


Part of your user agreement may involve selecting the delivery method you'd like. For example, you may have the option of choosing USPS First Class Mail, USPS Priority Mail, or FedEx., U.S. Postal Service Form 1583, the Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent, is required to set up most international mail forwarding services. This form authorizes the US Post Office to transfer your deliveries to the address you provide them with.In order to submit Form 1583, you will need to provide a Postal Service employee with two valid forms of ID.
One form of ID must display your photograph, like a driver's license or passport. Social Security cards, credit/debit cards, and birth certificates are all considered unacceptable forms of ID.
You may need to provide a notarized copy of your completed USPS Form 1583 to the service you choose to enroll with., When you enroll with a mail forwarding service, you will be given a street address based in the U.S. However, you'll need to let the forwarding service know what address you can actually receive your mail at in the country you inhabit. This is typically done as part of the enrollment process, but if you travel frequently you may need to update the address so that you won't miss your packages.Some services let you update your delivery address as often as you need to, while others may impose restrictions or additional fees.
Contact a representative from your chosen forwarding service to find out what your options are.

, There are typically recurring fees associated with mail forwarding services. How much those fees charge will vary depending on your chosen service and forwarding plan. However, there may also be one-time fees associated with setting up your account or receiving your mail.


Most forwarding services charge a fee, which may be charged on a monthly or an annual basis.There may also be a per-package fee in addition to the monthly or annual charges.This may be a flat rate or a calculated cost, depending on the service you use.
If you have to pay by cubic/dimensional weight, you'll need to calculate what you owe. To determine the cubic weight of a package, multiply the package's height times its length times its width, then divide by 5,000., Depending on where you are receiving your mail and what types of packages you receive, you may be required to make a Customs declaration. This may be required by U.S. Customs or by the Customs agency in your country of occupancy.Remember that different countries have different Customs laws. Some are more lax, while others may be more restrictive.
If shipping from the U.S. to Australia, for example, you won't need to file a Customs declaration if the order is below $2,500 US Dollars (USD).
Each country you forward mail to has its own customs requirements. You can find out your country's requirements by consulting the U.S. Postal Service's online guide to international mail., How frequently you receive mail will depend on the service you enroll with and the specific plan you enroll in. Some services will bundle and ship mail the day it is received. Others will ship your mail the next day. Still others bundle your mail for a week and then send you the package at the end of each week."

Use a sturdy box (or envelope) with packing or strapping tape on all the seams.,
Print your return address and the recipient's address.

,
Use the 9-digit ZIP Code.,
Cover the address with clear packing tape.,
Determine shipping speed.,
Get a Post Office mailing label.,
What's the drop-off deadline?",How to Mail Packages Faster," If the envelope or box opens in transit, the Post Office will need to reassemble it, and it will take a lot longer.;
,, Go to USPS.com (http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp) and look up the recipient's address. The 9-digit ZIP specifies the exact address to which you are shipping, and can speed up the delivery time even if you use the less expensive mailing methods, such as Media Mail.

, That way, the address won't smear if it gets wet.

, Find out how fast the various methods are estimated to arrive. Talk to a post office clerk about the shipping speeds and choose the option that meets your time and budget needs. Depending on what you are mailing, you could have the choice of Media Mail (for books and media, but don't add any personal notes or cards); Parcel Post (generally not enough of a savings to make it worth the long delivery time); First Class; Priority Mail; or Express Mail.

,


Don't use stamps alone. Ask the Post Office clerk to print a postage label. If you want to put colorful postage stamps on the package, don't put the full amount of postage needed. If you did use enough stamps, the clerk can still print a label with no value; the bar-coded label will help route the package quicker.
If you go to a larger Post Office, they may have an automated kiosk where you enter the information into the computer and then use your credit or debit card to pay. Follow the instructions on the screen to purchase a postage label; then put the addressed and postage-paid package into the bin.


, Find out when the mail is picked up from your Post Office and keep that time in mind when you need to mail a package; in larger towns, other Post Office outlets may have later pick-up times. If your little neighborhood post office collects the mail at 5 pm, the big Post Office downtown may pick it up as at 6 pm, and it may be worth a drive downtown depending on how soon you need the package to arrive.

Buy a stamp.,
Attach the stamp.,
Address the card.,
Write your postcard.,
Mail the postcard.",How to Mail a Postcard," You can find postcards at most local supermarkets, souvenir shops, and gas stations. Choose one that sums up the locale – something that gives the recipient a taste of your experience. If you have time, consider making your own postcard: you can use an online photo store, or you can do it yourself if you have access to a computer with photo editing and internet.;
, A stamp is a proof of payment for your postcard: without a stamp, no letter or postcard will be handled by the post office. Depending on the destination, the price of the stamp will vary. Domestic stamps are usually cheaper than international ones. Some postal services will have one flat rate for all international destinations, but some others will have a range of prices depending on the distance to the country. Always check with the post office or the postal service website.


Depending on where you are sending the postcard, you may need two, three, or even more stamps. Look up the postage requirements for, say, ""mailing from Tanzania to the U.S.""
You can usually buy stamps directly at the post office. In the U.S., you can buy stamps at most supermarkets, and some mini-marts or gas stations; you may even find stamps in vending machines and souvenir shops.
Make sure you have the most recent stamp. The price of stamps changes over time. Unless you send them often, one postcard stamp bought a while ago, may not be enough postage.

, Stick the stamp to the postcard in the upper right-hand corner. There is often a mark on the stamp or a symbol telling you where to put the stamp. Some stamps are self-adhesive, but others must be moistened.


If the stamp is self-adhesive, just pull it off the backing and attach it to the postcard in the proper place. Make sure it's not upside-down! If so, however, don't worry – the US postal service usually mails postcards with an upside-down stamps.
If your stamp is not the self-adhesive kind, you will need to moisten the back of the stamp to activate the adhesive. Some people lick the stamp to do this. If you don't want to lick the stamp, then you can use a sponge, or even just dip a couple of fingers in some water. Moisten the back of the stamp until it's a little wet, but not dripping. If it's too wet, the stamp might rip or slide off the postcard.

, Postcards usually have dedicated spaces for the message as well as the sender's and receiver's address. If it is a homemade or non-standard postcard with no dedicated spaces: draw a vertical line down the middle of the card while it is in a horizontal position, then draw a horizontal line splitting the right half in two. Use the left hand side for the message, the upper-right corner for the stamp and receiver's address, and the bottom-right corner for your own address.


It is not essential that you include your own address. As long as you write the receiver's address, they will receive your card. If you're traveling, you may not expect a reply – or you can give your correspondent the address of the next place you'll be staying.

, See How to Write a Postcard. If you're mailing it to yourself, write a memory on the back of the card; if you're mailing it to a friend, add a short message to let them know how you're doing. Try to give the recipient a brief snapshot of your experience. You don't need to write a novel – the very act of sending a postcard, however short, is usually enough to show a person that you're thinking of them.


Again, make sure to put the stamp on first. This way, you won't end up writing where the stamp covers.
It's important not to write too low on the postcard. Most of the time, the post office will attach a sticker across the bottom of the card in order to send it where it needs to go. Try to keep at least a finger's width between the edge of the postcard and the bottom of your message.

, Find a post office or a public mail drop box in your area. Make sure that you've added the correct amount of stamps and properly addressed the card. Once you're certain, mail the postcard as you would a normal letter. If you're abroad, allow at least a week or two for the letter to reach its destination.


Some office buildings, government offices, or community centers may have a mailbox. If you are at a hotel, the front desk will often mail your postcard with its outgoing mail. If you can't find a place to mail your postcard, ask the locals and other travelers.

Consider the ownership and responsibility of the package.,
Correct the address on the package.,
Remail the package.,
Verify the package has been received.",How to Forward Mail1," In the majority of cases, forwarding a single piece of mail is a very simple procedure. Postal services are used to rerouting mail as a way to accommodate changes of address and other changes of location.If the package belongs to someone else, it is considered courteous to ship it along to the intended recipient. If the package is addressed to you and you still wish to forward it however, you may be required to pay for a new set of stamps before it's valid for shipment.You may change the address on the package if required, but it is illegal to change the name of the addressee. In most cases, forwarding is only encouraged by the postal service if it needs to happen to get the message to whom it was intended.If you are trying to reroute mail from somewhere else to your now-current address, you'll have to get in touch with someone that lives nearby to do the legwork for you.;
, In a black marker, cross out the current address and write the new address directly below it. Make sure the address is correct, and write in block letters for clarity. Take care not to tamper with the package as much as possible, as the postal service may not handle it if they think it's been misused.Don't suffice for anything less than a permanent marker. Anything lighter may be difficult for the mailman to read. Even worse, it increases the risk of potential tampering.

, When you have the new address clearly written on the package, you're ready to mail it off. Postal services are generally fixated on efficiency, so the process of dropping it off should be relatively quick. Take it to a post office or a mailbox and drop it in. Before doing so however, you should check to see if the stamps are still valid.


Payment options vary depending on which postal service you're using. The USPS accommodates forwarding prices into their lump fee, so service users are technically paying for the chance of forwarding whether they use it or not. Canada Post on the other hand will charge a fee to anyone changing addresses to cover the costs of forwarding mail., If you are in contact with the recipient of the mail, it is good form to verify that the mail has been successfully received within two weeks of mailing it out. If it hasn't been received within that time, it's a good idea to contact the postal service regarding the mail's status.

Canada Post will charge $75.00 for a year of mail forwarding for a change of residence., If you've had mail sent to your original address prior to getting the new forwarding plan set up, you should get the mail over to your new address.

Otherwise, it's a good idea to get in touch with someone that lives near your old address and have them remark and resend the mail for you., If you want to be cautious, or if the email has particular weight or importance, it's a good idea to confer with the other person to make sure the mail has been received. First, let the recipient know you have forwarded the mail along, and wait to hear back. If you've forwarded the mail to a new address of yours, wait to ensure it the forwarded mail makes it on time.

For standard email services, this should bring you to a new tab where you can add something new to the email if you'd like. If you do add anything to the email, just give some context to the forwarded email. Whatever you do, don't change any part of the original written message, as this is unethical and will cause an issue in communication.
For example, if you're trying to figure out how to write an introduction for the message you're forwarding, consider letting the recipient know why you're sending the message (""I thought you might be interested in checking this out..."") or what you think of it (""I think this is an interesting message because..."").

, For Gmail, you can get to your settings tab via the Gear icon., Once again, the specifics will vary depending on the sort of email messaging service you are using. However, all function services should have a tab or section in their settings that relates to forwarding messages. Find the forwarding options, and input the email you would like to have your messages forwarded to. Press Save or Enter (whichever applies to your email service) and the operation should be complete.If you're having any difficulty finding the Forwarding tab, you might try Ctrl+F and doing a word search. With any luck, it should pinpoint the applicable area for you immediately.

, Many email services, like Gmail, offer inbox filters that will help sort through your mail automatically. You can quickly access the filters tab via your inbox. If you're forwarding your mail to a new secondary account, it is recommended you add a filter to this new account to highlight these forwarded messages. That way, you'll know which mail is meant for which account in particular.


For example, you can add your original email address in the filter to come up as highlighted in your new inbox so you'll be able to clearly distinguish the ones sent to your old account.

, Much as you would with regular mail, it's a good idea to make sure the message has been read and received by the other person, particularly if the forwarded message in question has any importance to either party. In the case of automatically forwarding messages to another account of your own, you should send yourself a test email and check the forwarded address to see if anything comes through. If not, you'll have to redo the steps and identify what it is you did wrong.

Contact the company that you placed the order with.,
Request a refund from the company.,
Know your rights as a consumer.",How to Get a Refund for Late Packages1," Even if a shipping company—for example, the USPS—is responsible for the delayed arrival, you’ll need to contact the retail company first. The retail company will be able to tell you which company the order was shipped with, and will be responsible for issuing you a refund as well.


If your package has not yet been delivered, even though the guaranteed delivery date has passed, you may need to contact the delivery company to find out the location of your package.While the delivery company is not responsible for issuing your refund, their Customer Service representatives can at least inform you where your package is and when it should be delivered.;
, While different retail companies may have different specific refund policies, all companies should be willing to refund your shipping fees in the case of a late delivery.You’ll likely need to request the refund through the company’s Customer Service web page, or call the listed Customer Service phone number. In this interaction, be ready to provide all relevant information regarding the order:


Your order number,
A shipping number (if provided),
The date on which you placed the order, and
An emailed receipt.

, Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations, you’re entitled to a full refund for any products that have been ordered online or over the phone and arrived later than promised. If you prefer not to receive the late package at all and would rather cancel your order altogether, you can receive a full refund for the cost of the item and its shipping, as long as you cancel the order within 14 days.If the package did not have a guaranteed date of delivery, you’re still entitled to a refund if it arrived more than 30 days after the date when you placed your order.

"
"
Take action within 30 days.,
Gather relevant materials.,
Request the refund at your local post office.,
Wait for your refund.",How to Get a Refund for Late Packages2," It’s important to request the refund within a timely manner. For packages that have been shipped by Priority Mail (or Priority Mail International), Global Express, or Click-N-Ship labels, the USPS will offer a full refund if the package is delivered late. However, you must make the request within 30 days from the date of purchase for a domestic purchase (or domestically shipped package) or 90 days from the date of purchase for an international purchase (or internationally shipped item).If you procrastinate your request and 30 (or 90) days pass, the postal service will no longer honor your request for a refund., Before you make your case for a refund to the Post Office, you need to have material (typically emails) indicating when you placed your order, when the retail company (or individual) shipped the package, and when the package was supposed to have arrived by.Without these materials, the USPS will be unwilling to provide a refund. You’ll need:


The package tracking number.
A “proof of purchase,” such as your receipt from an online retailer.

, USPS refund requests cannot be made online or over the phone; you must request a refund in person at a USPS office.Bring the previously mentioned materials, and ask to speak to the Post-Office supervisor to help you file your claim. At the Post Office, you’ll be asked to fill out and turn in a PS Form 3533, to process the refund request.Do not use any versions of the PS Form 3533 that are available online (as a PDF, for example). Each copy of the form has a unique barcode, so you must obtain a new paper-copy form from the USPS office.

, It may take some time for the USPS to look into the delay on your package and issue a refund. When the refund does come, it will be as a cash payment or via money order.If the amount refunded is different than what you expected (or what you paid for shipping initially), contact the USPS office and ask for the oversight to be fixed.

"
"
Find out which shipping company has your package.,
Contact the shipping company.,
Contact the retail company directly about a refund.",How to Get a Refund for Late Packages3," If you’ve ordered a package through an online retailer and the package hasn’t arrived (or arrived late), you should contact the company and ask them for a status update on the package. It’s possible that the responsibility for your package’s late arrival does not lie with the retail company itself, but with the shipping company.For example, if you ordered a package through Amazon, this shipping information will likely be available on your “My Orders” page. If not, send an email to Amazon (or the retail company you ordered from) through their Customer Service portal. Specify your order number, and ask which carrier has the package.
If you placed your order using an Amazon Prime account, or specified 2-day or overnight shipping, Amazon holds themselves responsible for making sure your package arrives within the 2-day deadline. Most other online retailers hold themselves to a similar standard when you order 2-day (or overnight) shipping.

, Online retail companies often ship through USPS, but will sometimes use a private shipping organization.Get in touch with the shipping company directly; there should be a Customer Service phone number or email address on the company’s website. Explain the situation and provide your order number and tracking number, if both have been provided by the retailer.


If your package has already arrived, explain that it arrived a certain number of days late past the point of guaranteed delivery. If the package is still missing, inquire as to the package’s location and estimated delivery date.

, Reach out in an email or over the phone, and be polite but clear with a Customer Service representative. Explain that you would like a refund for the late (or missing) package. Even if the shipping company is at fault, your order was with the retailer, and the company should be responsible for the shipment arriving on time.


If your late order was with Amazon through Amazon prime, in many cases, Amazon will extend your membership by one month for free. If your order is exceptionally late, Amazon may refund the full price of the item as well.If your order was not through Amazon Prime but you still requested 2-day shipping, Amazon should still be willing to refund the cost of your shipping.

Prevent meningitis transmission.",How to Do the Glass Test," Rashes caused by meningococcal septicemia start as a scattering of small ""pin prick"" marks. These marks may appear reddish or brown and gradually develop into large patches of purple or red blotches and/or blood blisters.Unlike most rashes, a rash caused by meningococcal septicemia will not fade or blanch when pressure is applied to it. The glass test makes use of this characteristic to help prove or disprove the source of such a rash.;
, Use an ordinary clear glass or heavy plastic tumbler style cup for this test. If using plastic, the glass should be strong enough that sufficient pressure may be applied without the risk of cracking or breaking.The glass must be clear. Solid or translucent tints can make it harder to examine the rash during the test.
A tumbler or similar cup is usually the easiest tool to use, but another clear glass or plastic object, like a clear glass bowl, would also work if necessary.

, To perform the test, you will need to find a patch of skin that is relatively pale and marked with pin pricks/rash spots.Meningitis rashes may be difficult to see on darker skin tones. To check for rashes, try looking at lighter patches of skin, such as the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet., Gently press the side of the glass onto the skin, directly over the rash. Make sure that you can see the rash through the side of the glass, and experiment with pressing directly and rolling the glass slowly over the rash to get a comprehensive viewing of the blotches and pin pricks.


Apply enough pressure to cause the skin around the rash to become pale. The pressure must push blood away from the tiny blood vessels at the surface of the skin. If the skin around the rash isn't pale, you aren't applying enough pressure to judge the test accurately.
The rash may appear to diminish at first. This may be an illusion, as the skin itself around the rash is fading in color while while you press the glass against the skin. Do not end the test here, regardless of how the results appear.
If the rash fades, continue to press the glass over the rash and try pressing it on other parts of the rash to ensure that the rash does, in fact, consistently diminish under the glass., As you roll the glass over the rash, watch the color of the rash itself. Pay close attention to whether or not the rash fades, and look for consistency in your results.


If the rash consistently fades, it probably isn't caused by meningitis or septicemia.
If the rash does not fade, however, this is a dangerous sign and is indicative of meningococcal septicemia.

, A rash that does not fade under pressure could be caused by meningococcal septicemia and is cause for concern. This condition can be fatal, and it requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor, or go straight to an emergency room to seek treatment.


If the rash does fade but other signs of meningitis are present, or if there are other major medical concerns, you should still seek immediate medical care. The rash itself is not the definitive test for meningitis, and may fade or be absent altogether, even in confirmed cases of meningitis.
You should not wait for a rash to appear before seeking medical treatment. As soon as you suspect that you or someone you know has meningitis, go to the emergency room at your nearest hospital.

, Meningitis frequently mimics the symptoms of influenza, but unlike the flu, meningitis is often life threatening. Symptoms may come on quickly over the course of several hours, or may take one to two days to develop.Common symptoms in children and adults include:


the sudden onset of high feverssevere headache unlike most day-to-day migrainesstiff neck or difficulty moving the headnausea and/or vomitingconfusion and difficulty focusing or concentratingexcessive tiredness or a marked difficulty waking upsensitivity to lightreduced appetite and thirstskin rash in some cases, but not allseizures or loss of consciousness, Newborns and infants are unable to communicate where they feel pain or stiffness, and may not show other signs, like nausea or confusion. When diagnosing meningitis in a newborn or infant, look for symptoms including:


high feverincessant crying that cannot be soothedexcessive tiredness, sluggishness, or irritabilitypoor feeding and lack of appetitea stiff body with erratic movements, or floppy and ""lifeless""a tense and/or bulging soft spot on the top of the baby's head, Having abnormally cold extremities is a common sign of meningitis, especially when they are accompanied by a high fever.Shivering is another related symptom. If the patient is kept warm yet still shivers uncontrollably, it could indicate that septicemia has already set in., Stiffness caused by meningitis is usually concentrated in the neck, but abnormal and otherwise unexplained pain or stiffness anywhere in the body can be another sign of meningitis.Pain is often experienced in joints and/or muscles., Stomach cramps are also common in cases of meningitis, and may be accompanied by diarrhea.If these symptoms are present alongside other meningitis symptoms, they could be another indicator.


Many people with meningitis also suffer from a loss of appetite, nausea, and repeated vomiting., Rashes are one of the late symptoms of meningitis and may not appear at all.For that reason, it is crucial that you know the other signs and symptoms of the disease.


Note that cases of viral meningitis are not accompanied by a rash. When rashes do appear, they're the result of bacterial meningitis.As meningitis bacteria multiply and build up in the blood stream, they release endotoxins from their outer coatings. The body is typically unable to fight these toxins, and the poison causes damage to the blood vessels. This process is known as septicemia.As septicemia worsens, it can damage the body's organs. Its characteristic rash occurs when the poisoned blood leaks into the tissues beneath the skin., Meningitis is very serious. Symptoms can develop over the course of a few hours or over several days, but once you suspect that meningitis is the cause of these symptoms, you should seek emergency medical care at a hospital or clinic.Full recovery often depends on prompt treatment, so you should never hesitate to seek medical care if meningitis is suspected.
Since many of the symptoms associated with meningitis can also be caused by more common yet less serious illnesses, you may not catch the illness at its earliest stages. Once these symptoms worsen or are accompanied by meningitis-specific symptoms (stiff neck, rashes that won't fade), you should seek professional medical help.

, Only a doctor can confirm a case of meningitis. Your doctor or an emergency medical professional will most likely need to draw samples of blood or cerebrospinal fluid to test for meningitis.In order to acquire cerebrospinal fluid, your doctor will need to puncture your spinal cord with a syringe equipped with a special spinal needle. She will then draw out a small vial of fluid, which will then be tested to confirm meningitis.Complete blood counts, blood cultures, urine tests, and chest x-rays may also be used to check for signs of infection.
If bacterial meningitis is confirmed, your blood or cerebrospinal fluid may be used to grow a culture of the bacteria in the lab so that doctors can identify the specific strain of bacteria present. The strain of bacteria will determine the course of treatment and the type of antibiotics used.Depending on the circumstances, doctors may also order a CT scan or MRI to look for swelling of brain tissue or brain damage., When bacterial meningitis or severe cases of viral meningitis are diagnosed, the patient will almost always be hospitalized. However, the need for hospitalization and the duration of a patient's stay will generally be determined by the type of meningitis and the severity of symptoms.During hospitalization, antibiotics, antiviral medications, corticosteroids, and fever-reducing medicines will be administered to the patient. Patients who are also struggling to breathe may receive oxygen therapy. Additional care, like IV fluids, will be administered on an as-needed basis., Most cases of meningitis are transmitted by a contagious carrier. The disease may spread through emission, like coughing or sneezing, or through contact, like kissing or sharing an eating utensil.Transmission and acquisition of meningitis can be prevented by taking standard precautions, including:


thorough and frequent hand-washingnot sharing utensils, straws, food/drinks, lip balms, cigarettes, or toothbrushescovering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing"

In year 9; you may do early entry GCSE's - and then it's GCSE years... so the attitude must be focused and motivated. The biggest incentive is success. If you work your hardest in these years you will have success, so be optimistic.

, To excel is not just to do well, it is to do even better, to do your best. Your work must be your best. So the basics are to make sure that all work is well presented and on time.

, Don't do it in the living room, do it in your room on a desk, try to take short breaks every now and then, it'll help your concentration.

, You can spend some time doing these things but not until you have got everything else done.

, If you get given your own textbook then make good use of your textbook and study that until you know all the material, this way it is much easier when you have an assessment. If you don't have a textbook then just either buy your own revision guides, they are usually around £5 and can come in handy for assessments or just your own work, or you can see if an older sibling/friend has anything that could be helpful to you.

, You and a friend could get together when you know you have a test and revise together, that way if either of you are unsure then you can help each other out, just make sure you don't end up gossiping the whole time though!

, Teachers hate it when you say 'I couldn't print it' or 'it's at home' so even if you don't have a printer at home or it is broken, put your work onto a memory stick or just E-mail it to your school account and print it off in the school library.

Get a good night's sleep.,
Eat a healthy breakfast.,
Sit at the front of the class.,
Avoid sitting with friends.,
Rid yourself of any other distractions.,
Look at the teacher, and make eye contact.,
Know your objective.,
Take notes.,
Get involved in class discussions.,
Ask a question.,
Do your best.,
Listen to music during your break.,
Visualize your future.",How to Focus More in Class," Students should get at least nine hours of sleep each night. However, it's hard to maintain those good sleep habits. Set a bedtime routine, and go to bed at the same hour each night. Your mind will not be able to concentrate if it's not rested...it needs a break!;
, Although this may seem irrelevant to focusing during class, eating a nutritious meal in the morning gives you fresh energy for the day. Remember: a healthy breakfast does not just mean a big breakfast. Two simple slices of toast, fresh orange juice (with pulp, if possible) and a nice serving of hard boiled egg(s) is an example of a good breakfast. If you consume a meal such as this, you'll feel more energized and less groggy throughout the day- paying attention will be efficiently easier.

, This helps you focus because it's easier to look ahead than back.

, Although the urge to sit with your buddies may be awfully appealing, try your best to avoid the temptation. Chatting with friends is not going to give you the focus you need to stay on top of the class. This will not only get you trouble, but lower your concentration rate for the class altogether. If you feel the urge to speak with a fellow classmate, yet are seated in an assigned location, talk to your teacher about getting your seat moved (some will just say that you should control yourself). However, let the friend know (outside of class!) that this is not meant to insult them; you just need to focus.


If you do sit with friends, they might help wake you up if you find yourself looking somewhere else but don't let them distract you! If they talk, reply quickly to what they're saying and then remember to look back at the teacher and continue with your notes. Keep your ears open for things like ""this is important"" or ""listen up"" or phrases that might indicate that you need to know something.

, Some of us get distracted very easily- and that's perfectly OK. The problem evolves when distractions keep us from learning. Is that water bottle catching all your attention? Immediately remove it from your desk. How about that gum you're chewing? Throw it out and start taking notes. Eliminate these distractions (even if you don't want to) and you'll soon find your attention immediately going to the teacher each class.

, Your teacher is not just standing up there babbling- they're obviously trying to give you an acceptable education. Show them that they have your full attention, by looking them in the eye, and observing their movements. Try your best to look alert. If you feel your eyes averting to something else in the room, catch yourself and focus back on your teacher. This person should have your full attention at all times during class. Your eyes should not be drifting elsewhere.

, Most teachers tell you the subject of the class, in the beginning. If possible, write down this objective the minute you hear it. What is it that needs to be done today? What will you be learning about? How can you remain alert and focused during this time? Set goals for yourself, and remind yourself of the objective throughout class. This way, you know exactly what you have to do.

, By taking accurate notes, you'll be able to ""get into"" the lesson. Recognize key points as your teacher speaks, and listen for key phrases such as, ""This is important,"" ""This is the main idea,"" ""This will be on the test,"" etc. This can help you listen more intently; you'll have something to do and focus on.


Objectives: If your teacher normally writes down the lesson's objective at the beginning of the class, keep it in your head and make sure you've achieved it by the end of the lesson.
Don't try to finish your old notes or homework in class. Do that later when you have free time or else you might miss key points.

, This is a wonderful way to become a more focused, successful student. When a teacher asks a question, offer to answer it. If she/he asks for an opinion, share your own. This shows that the teacher that you're listening intently during the class and that you know your stuff. This can also help you avoid those embarrassing moments, when you get called on and you happen to not be paying attention. Also, teachers will note to college officers that you are actively contributing in class.

, If you don't understand something, never be afraid to ask. This really shows your teacher that you want to be better, and can recognize the things you're having difficulty with. Chances are, someone else in the class has the same question (and was too afraid to ask!). They'll be relieved- and so will you. 

, When you walk into that classroom, put a smile on your face and some confidence in your pocket. Be the best that you can be at all times, and show your true potential!

, It is very refreshing and it can clear your mind between subjects, which could improve your productivity. But don't get too carried away with the music.

, Before you go to bed at night, be sure to use your childhood gift of imagination and think about where you see yourself in the future, and about how likely you will be able to achieve that dream without having sufficient focusing skills, if your dream isn't academic based like sports and music etc. You still need good focus skills to be a football player so don’t put it off your list! Don't get distracted at school. Be a smart person and do the right things.

Stay focused.,
Make a list of short-term and long-term goals.,
Develop a good work ethic.,
Stay challenged and be proactive about your education.,
Manage your perfectionism.,
Try not to become obsessed with grades.,
Be modest, supportive, and helpful.,
Avoid seeing everything as a competition or as a chance to prove yourself.,
Surround yourself with peers who share your ambitions and your interests.,
Work with and communicate with your teacher or professor about your education.,
Try to be a balanced individual.,
Understand what being gifted really means.,
Be proud of all your assets, including (but not limited to) your intelligence.,
Realize that you don’t know everything.,
Avoid unrealistic expectations for yourself.",How to Deal With Being a Gifted Student," No matter how many talents, interests, or obligations you have, do not allow yourself to lose focus of your goals.


Prioritize your goals and decide which are most important and might need the most time considering your long-term objectives.
Plan ahead and manage your time so that you can balance all of your obligations. Remember, you can’t do everything!
Identify clearly what you want to achieve and then find people, such as teachers, guidance counselors, and college professors, who can help you develop a step-by-step plan.;
, This will help you stay focused on your priorities. Do this by making a list and then ranking what goals are most important to you and how you think you might achieve them. Consider the following questions when making your list:


What do you want to achieve this year in terms of your studies and intellectual growth?
If you’re in middle school, where do you want to go to high school?
If you’re in high school, what do you want to do after graduation? If you want to start a business or go right to work, start thinking about that now and line up a mentor. If you plan to go to college or technical school, consider what school would be best for your chosen career path and your long-term plans. Consider college rankings as a way to evaluate specific programs.

, Remember, just because you are gifted does not mean you have to work less. You should do your best to channel your gifts and your energies so you can succeed and achieve your short-term and long-term goals. Do this by committing yourself to excellence in everything you do.

, Talk to your parents and teachers about what you can do to stay challenged or get ahead. In most cases, they will be happy to help you find work that is engaging and challenging. In addition, there are other things you can do:


Cultivate your gift. If you are interested in or excel at one subject or another, make sure that you do everything you can to hone your abilities in that subject.
Talk to teachers about Honors, Advance Placement (AP), or International Baccalaureate (IB) classes in a specific subject field that you like. Visit the IB website at http://www.ibo.org for more information. Visit the AP College Board website at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse for more information about courses that might be offered at your school.
Don’t ignore your work in other subjects. All of your classes are important in cultivating a well-developed intellect.
Ask questions in class if you are confused or want to know more.

, Avoid the temptation to achieve perfection in everything you do. Perfection will get in your way and undermine your ability to balance the different goals you have.


Know when to quit a specific assignment or task.
Match the time commitment to the value of assignments. Don’t spend five hours perfectly outlining a history textbook chapter instead of studying for your chemistry test that you’ll take the next day.
Enjoy the process, not the perfect product. The goal of education is to learn and to develop your intellect, not to achieve perfection on every assignment or in every class., Just because you are gifted does not mean you have to make an A in every subject every day. Remember, some people are gifted in certain activities or subjects, and no one is perfect. Your goal should be intellectual growth and understanding, not perfect grades.

, Try to always be humble when it comes to your abilities and help others. Be a model for other gifted students in how they should treat others.


Help or tutor friends and peers who are struggling or need assistance.
Be supportive of others in their academic work or in their effort to overcome their own limitations.
Refrain from teasing others or making jokes about others’ abilities.
Don’t brag or be arrogant about your abilities when dealing with other students.

, Approach intellectual activities as an opportunity to learn, grow, and foster cooperation. While competition is good, if taken too far, it can create conflict and alienate you from other people. It is best to see academic activities – homework, tests, writing papers – as an opportunity to cultivate your own gifts, rather than to beat or out compete other people.

, Try to find friends who share your commitment to knowledge and to cultivating your gifts. Avoid social connections that make you feel poorly about yourself, make others feel badly about themselves, or lead you toward activities that are counterproductive to your goals in life and as a student., The best way to cultivate a healthy relationship with your teacher is to talk to them about issues concerning your education. Do this in a polite way so that the teacher can see that you are engaged in your education and want to take a proactive role in it.

, When socializing with others, don’t always try to steer the conversation to what interests you and what you are good at. Move outside of your comfort zone, and engage others on topics or subjects that they are interested in as well. Remember, part of being a successful gifted student is interacting with other students and teachers in a healthy and well-balanced way.

, Gifted does not mean mere intelligence or book smarts. Gifted people excel at a variety of activities and in a number of different ways. Extraordinary talents can be expressed through art, athletics, communication, mechanics, and more. This means that a gifted student will not always be at the top of the class in every subject, but might just excel in one particular subject.

, Being a well-adjusted and successful gifted student means that you should be proud of all aspects of who you are. Pride in self should transcend mere intelligence, but you should be confident in who you are as a family member, an athlete, and a friend. At the same time, don’t let this go to your head. And remember, you are not the center of the universe!

, Embrace the fact that you are a student. Being a student is a privileged position. You have the benefit of learning from teachers and professors who have substantial education and life experience. Approach your knowledge and experience limitations as an opportunity to grow and learn from others.

, Expect that you may not be good at everything just because you are gifted. Being gifted does not mean that you have to succeed or can succeed at everything. Recognize where your talents lie, and set your expectations accordingly."

Write the report.",How to Get a Good Grade in College Science Classes," This will help you see what you have to do and when it needs to be finished. You'll be able to see what overlaps and when you'll need to keep track of multiple assignments., Information in textbooks is usually grouped into headings and subheadings, which explain specific ideas. Rather than push through the entire assignment at once, read a section, then consider how well you understood the concepts it explained before going to the next one. Of course, make sure you read all of the assigned portions.Many textbooks have reading goals and key ideas listed at the beginning or end of each chapter. Review those, and make sure that you understand those big ideas after reading the required sections and subsections.
The textbook isn't just the text. Make sure you study and review any charts, graphs, tables, pictures, or equations as well. Sciences are very visual and data-driven, and those visual elements have been carefully chosen to explain important concepts.

, Professors assign homework and other projects because they are important to learning the course material. Doing everything will help you keep up in the class, and your professor will probably provide feedback that can improve your grade. Even if you don't do well, a partial grade is better than no credit at all., The point of homework from science classes is to help learn processes. It's not about getting the right answer, but understanding the right way to get that answer. Make sure you show all the work you did to find the solution. This can help you (or your professor) find errors if you got the incorrect answer. This is especially important in math-heavy sciences like physics or engineering., Working together with a group of your classmates to review material can help enhance your grade. Groups are helpful for answering one another's questions and explaining difficult concepts. Try to find serious students from your class (who may not always been your friends) and make sure your study group time is spent on the subject., Your science professor is the best resource you will have for doing well in the class. If you have questions or concerns about your grades or comprehension, visit during his office hours.Make sure you have specific questions. Vague complaints like ""I don't get this class"" or ""This material is hard"" are hard to follow, and it will be difficult for your professor to help you. Instead, make sure you identify specific concepts or textbook passages that you are struggling with.
If you begin struggling, see the professor as soon as you can. If you wait until the end of the semester, there will be very little that either of you can do to change your grade.

, Make sure you attend every class. There isn't much space in a week given to classroom time, so your professor will likely use it to cover as much important material as possible. Much of that material probably won't be in the textbook (that's for you to read)., Before you even get to class, make sure you have done the assigned readings and are familiar with the concepts on the schedule. College science lectures will not regurgitate the textbook, so if you haven't read it first, you probably won't understand what is going on.This is also helpful so that you already know the words and ideas that you struggle with. You can make sure to pay extra attention when the professor covers that in class, or ask about them if they don't come up.

, Don't wander in right when the class starts. Instead, get there early to pick the best seat, and review your notes one last time before class begins. This time is also a good opportunity to ask questions of your professor. This can be helpful if you are shy about asking questions in class., Numerous studies show that sitting in the front of the classroom helps students pay attention and get higher grades, especially in a large lecture class. Plus, sitting up front can help the professor remember you. Getting to know your professor can help with asking questions and improving your grade., Your professor is going to cover a lot of information, and you'll want to write it down to help remember it for labs, exams, and other assignments.Pay attention if your instructor highlights really important information. He'll probably do this by writing something on the board or saying something like ""This is important."" Make sure you highlight this information in your notes.
If you miss something the professor said, don't be afraid to ask him to repeat it.
Review your notes as soon as you can after getting out of class. This will to help your remember what was covered and what was important.

, If your professor asks the class a question, don't be afraid to answer it. If you don't understand an idea or concept, ask. Taking part in the classroom experience will help keep you engaged and awake., In many college science labs, you will be expected to know the process before showing up, so make sure you do before starting. The professor may provide a manual for the semester, individual worksheets for particular labs, or explain the procedure as part of the lecture. If you don't know what you are supposed to be doing, there is a good chance you will not do the experiment correctly or on time.Make sure that, in addition to the lab's instructions, you also review your textbook for the principles the lab is supposed to cover. The lab should demonstrate those principles, and give you concrete proof of what the textbook and lectures explain. If your professor suggests an outside reading, look at that too.
If you were supposed to prepare in advance, the instructor may not be able to give you detailed instructions once you have started.

, This is a notebook specifically for your lab work, separate from your class notes. This notebook should be a full record of all the data you get during labs. You will collect much more data than you need to write the report, but that's okay. Part of the report will be figuring out what data is necessary or important, and deciding what it proves about your experiment.You should only write in pen in your lab notebook. Don't write in pencil, as you should not be trying to erase data, even errors. The notebook should contain everything, including your mistakes. If you make a mistake, draw a line through it and go on to the next line. Add a note explaining why you crossed that out also, to help you remember what happened in the lab.

, College laboratories can be dangerous places, especially for subjects like chemistry or biology that use hazardous materials. Before going into the lab, make sure you know, understand, and are prepared to follow all safety rules.There are certain protective items you should expect to wear, such as gloves, aprons, and goggles, depending on the experiment. Check with your instructor and the lab to see what the lab will provide, and if you will need to acquire any of these materials yourself.When you are in the lab, make sure you know where the key safety features are. These include the MSDS folder (for getting safety information about chemicals), safety shower, eye wash, fire extinguisher, and emergency exits., While every lab's dress code is slightly different, there are some basic principles you can follow to keep safe, and be able to do the experiment properly. Some labs will not even let you inside if you are not dressed properly for the setting. If you miss the lab, that will definitely hurt your grade.


Wear long pants and long sleeved shirts to cover skin. This will help you to avoid splashing and spills.You will probably be standing a lot during the experiment, so you'll want something comfortable on your feet. Make sure your shoes are closed, so no sandals or open-toed shoes.
Avoid wearing loose or flowing items, like ties, scarves, necklaces, or bracelets. At the very least, make sure they are securely tied down, and not dangling, before starting the experiment., The point of labs is to illustrate concepts you read about in the book, or that the professor explained in class. Understand the steps you are taking, and what they accomplish for the purpose of the lab. It doesn't matter if you got ""the right answer"" if you do not understand how you got there and why that is the right answer., Most labs will end with a lab report that you will need to turn in to the instructor. Know the proper format for your class, including your hypothesis, data, and conclusions, and fill in as completely as possible. Make sure you have demonstrated whether or not the experiment has proved or disproved your hypothesis.


Don't forget to include outlier or unusual data, as well as possible reasons why those may have happened.
If you have a study group for the class, they can be good reviewers of your lab reports to make sure you have explained the material well. Make sure you return the favor.

Remember that a “C” is usually considered average, a “B” above average, and an “A” exemplary.Putting it into perspective, maybe your grade isn’t as bad as you thought.;
, You may feel anxious, frustrated, or even confused. It’s okay to be upset. Let it out. Suppressing your emotions will only make you feel worse down the line., Dwelling on it further while in a heightened emotional state will just make the problem seem worse than it is.Try to do something that takes your mind off of it.


Exercising, talking with friends, listening to music, or doing fun things you enjoy are all healthy ways to relieve anxiety., Finding a pattern in your mistakes is a good way to isolate and overcome your problem areas on your own.Was there a subject, like math or English, that you didn't do well on? If so, study more frequently in those areas.
Was there a group of related test questions you missed? If so, try categorize them and figure out what subject you could study harder in.
Did you continually show up late? If so, try to be more punctual.

, They know your strengths and weaknesses, so don't be afraid to ask for help.Instead of asking, “why did I get a bad grade,” ask, “how can I restructure my answers in a way that would earn me a better grade?”, Ask others if they’re willing to share the grade they received. If they all received similar grades, maybe the problem is with the material and not you. If they did better than you, ask them what kind of strategies they think led to higher grades.


Sometimes teachers curve the grades in a class in which many students are struggling. If a lot of students did poorly, a low grade won’t be as detrimental as you thought, and you can rest easier knowing that., Once you've recognized areas where you need to improve, you can take the steps to do so. Make positive changes in your life where necessary:


Write out a study schedule and follow it routinely. A regular schedule can significantly reduce anxiety and improve performance.Get more sleep. The amount of sleep you get heavily affects your mood and ability to absorb and retain information. Don't procrastinate.
Eliminate distractions. Prioritize the things that matter most.

, Often times, teachers just want to see that you’re willing to put effort into your work. Ask if they’d be willing to let you improve your grade by completing extra assignments.If you can’t change your grade, maybe you can supplement it.

, Tutoring centers, teacher office hours, and study groups all exist to help you succeed.Consider restructuring your future study habits by incorporating some of these resources into your routine.

, While you may not be able to change the grade you’ve received, you can take the necessary steps to improve. Try to consider it a learning experience. Forgive yourself for your mistakes. One bad grade isn’t going to determine your future, and it isn’t going to define your aptitude as a student either.

Find a spot that you can call your own, away from noise or interruptions, that no one else uses and that you don't have to clear off if someone wants to set the table or needs a place to do homework.,

, If Thursday and Friday evening and Saturday afternoon are filled, write in Sunday morning and Monday and Wednesday evening as your writing times. Treat scheduled writing time the same as an important business conference call or doctor's appointment, and don't skip it.

, If you have family or roommates who object, then move to another room to write. While the rest of the household is in front of the TV, it's prime time for writing without interruptions.

, Some writers find that a production goal works better than a time goal. Give yourself a deadline, whether it's an article a week or 3 pages a day, and stick to it.

, It's easy to get distracted and find yourself at the end of your writing time with little or nothing to show for it. Set the timer for 15 minutes (or 10 or 20 if that works better) and focus on nothing but getting words down.

, Carry your laptop wherever you go or keep a notebook and pen with you. If you're sitting in a doctor's waiting room or in your car waiting for the kids' soccer practice to let out, take that time to jot down notes and ideas. Even small entries add up, such as an outline for an article, a single paragraph or a character description.

, Instead of thinking about writing an entire book, think about writing a chapter or even a single scene. Outline your article first and focus on writing each part before putting it all together.

, Work on more than one project at a time. Once you reach a stopping point on one project, or if your creative energy is flagging, start working on another. When you go back to the first project, it'll be with fresh eyes.

, Being organized helps you work better, relax and be ready to find and hand in stuff on time. There are plenty of ways to self-organize and it is best that you find the method that works best for you. The key is to be able to find what you need with ease, including the retrieval of information and your notes. Set up a system as soon as possible, including things like a good computer filing system, a good paper filing system, a desk-clearing policy (at least weekly) and a neat arrangement for your textbooks, writing books and associated reference manuals and books.


Make use of highlighters, bright Post-It tags, and other items to label and highlight your organized items. Color coding works extremely well for lots of people, especially busy people and those who can't abide reading labels!

, Choose one that can fit in your folder or binder so that you can easily turn to it and find it when you need to use it. In this calendar, write down all your tests and assessments, and if your school has different academic classes on different days, write those down too. Also, make notes of study sessions or time you plan to spend doing homework. This keeps you aware of upcoming tests and other events, so you can study and prepare for them properly.

, Even if you don't know what you want to do when you grow up or what college you want to go to, your goal can be just to give yourself as many opportunities as possible.

, Your attendance is important at school. If you don't go to school, your grades will obviously drop fast because you will have gaps in your learning that are difficult to back fill. If you have a genuine illness or other issue preventing you from attending school, have a parent, guardian or friend talk to your teachers about doing catch-up work from home.

, Notes will help solidify material in your head and will also serve as important study tools before a test. Be sure to write down everything important that the teacher goes over. If it helps, ask for a printout of the material beforehand so you can focus on taking notes on what the teacher is saying, not just copying down what is on the board. If the teachers write something on the board and they underline it chances are it's important or it will be on future tests.

, This will show your teacher that you're actively participating in class. But more than that, it also forces you to pay enough attention to be able to ask/answer questions. As a result, you'll do much better on tests and quizzes. The ability to ask questions is a skill that you'll need throughout life, and ensures that you can keep a check on the motivations and ideas that you come across in various walks of life.


When you pick a question to answer, make sure you know the answer and the questions are not too easy. Don't worry about asking too many questions; it's the teacher's job to help you.
Participation in class is often an important factor of your grade. Raising your hand once or twice in class doesn't do any harm, especially if you remember that ""there is no such thing as a stupid question"" when it comes to learning in class. Many times people will be wondering the same thing but lacked the courage to ask it!

, Don't just ask questions or talk. Learn to listen too. Eighty percent of the questions you find on any test were explained in class. The key to many understandings of the materials presented is often through listening to the teacher's explanations.

, Do this in a quiet place with no distractions. If the computer is in your room, take it out or go to another room. Don't study with the radio on! It might help you write more but on the day of the exam, the only thing you'll remember will be the lyrics.


Make a schedule. Making a self-schedule could help you save time for self-study/revision as well as keeping you on track on what you're doing and what to do next.
Rewrite your notes. Yes, this may sound boring and time-consuming, but it's been proven to help you remember more of what you wrote down. It also helps you to figure out problems you might have had in the class.

, Though it seems like a torture device, homework is a way of controlling and making progress outside of the classroom. This isn't very comforting the night you have two essays and algebra to do, though, so remember to do the actual homework and keep up with the workload. If you're having serious difficulties, talk to your teachers and parents to come up with a schedule for your homework.

, Instead of multitasking, set aside a certain amount of time to do homework. When that set amount of time is over, take a 20-30 minute break to keep your mind from getting tired. When that time is up, go back to doing 100% homework.

, If you have two weeks to do a project, rather than putting it off till the last three days before it's due, start working early. This way you can spend enough time planning, researching, and asking any questions you have about the project. The whole experience will be much less stressful since you won't have to rush through it. You'll also have plenty of time to make the project as good as it can be, which means that you'll get a better grade.

, Be careful, though, taking dozens of practice tests is a much less effective way to study than combining one or two with other forms of study.

, If after the holidays you have a test and have not reviewed over the holiday period, your mind will have switched off and you will have forgotten a lot of things that you have learned before the holidays. Therefore you are likely to fail the test or do badly in it.


Get a book at your grade level for any new class subject you will be taking next term such as chemistry, and read or scan it closely. Look at all the illustrations, charts, definitions, and learn things like the chemical symbols (C is carbon, H is Hydrogen, Zn is zinc, Au is gold, Ag is silver.). Read chapter summaries.
Treat the holidays like any weekends: Yes, you can relax and have fun, but study at least 3 times a week so you don't forget everything you have learned.
Ask your parents or friends to sit with you and review over what you have difficulty with, or that you need to memorize and recite.

, Reviewing with your friends during free time can help keep you focused.


Make sure that you work with people who you can focus around. Any time you spend chatting instead of studying is wasted time as far as the study group is concerned.
For some people, working in a group may be hard to do because friends can distract you from your studies. Or, you may be someone who actually works better without other people around; do not view this as anything wrong, it is simply about your personal makeup––for example, you may be a deep thinker who needs time and space to digest issues fully. Be aware that this does not mean you're not capable of working in teams; quite the opposite, you are more likely to be a good team player if you understand the issues properly.

, Asking for help if you don't ""get"" what the question is asking is the only way you're going to find out what to do. Pretending you know and making it up as you go will only prolong the agony and can reduce your marks.

, Don't see mistakes as personal flaws; failures are a guidance in how to do better. Pay attention in class when something is being corrected. Mark your work clearly and carefully so that it is useful in preventing other errors in the future. You will learn a lot more if you use your mistakes and failures to guide you to the correct approaches and results.

, If you do not understand a concept during class time, meeting with your teacher outside of class will help you understand it better and will also build a strong relationship with you and your teacher.

, Looking over guidebooks may help you in classes with which you are struggling. Alternatively, you could go to the teacher for extra help, have a friend coach you, or ask your parents to hire a tutor.


Never be afraid to ask your tutor for help. They can help you with any subject, and there is no need to feel dumb or ashamed that you need help.

, Don't only start well and let it fall apart. Keep your study plans active and working for your success. Reward yourself when you do well.

, Don't freak out over tests. Start studying more than one day before the exam so that you have plenty of time to ask questions when you don't understand.

, Sleep will improve your memory and concentration skills, which in turn will lead to you doing better in school.

, Food is energy for your brain and having food in you before school starts can help you concentrate and focus. If you can't get breakfast for some reason, speak to your teacher about school programs or assistance for breakfast.

, This will allow you to make more friends, do something fun, and have something to add on a college or even job resume to show people that you are a well rounded-individual.


Find something that you enjoy doing to balance out the work. But don't spend too much time on it that you don't get to your homework.

, There is no need for hours on end of studying, but see how much time you have until the exam and divide the amount into equal amounts of studying each day. Remember to balance it out. Go out with friends at the weekend and maybe on one weekday, but make sure you don't forget about the work.

Focus on what you are doing right.,
Re-frame negative thinking.,
Keep up your motivation.,
Be aware of perfectionism.,
Understand that college courses are more difficult than high school classes.If you have recently transitioned from high school courses to college courses, it's not unusual to get slightly lower grades.,
Talk to a counselor.",How to Deal With a B as a Straight A Student1," Part of keeping a positive attitude is focusing on what you are doing well and doing right. Thinking about these positive aspects can help you to stay focused and happy, as well as allow you to learn what already works best for you. By thinking positively and discovering what you are doing right you can stay optimistic and enjoy your achievements.Focus on your strengths, knowing that you can use them to improve your grades.
Knowing what works for you can give you a good idea of what to do going forward.
Think about how well you have already done. Getting a B is not an indication of failure and is still a great grade.;
, Negative thinking might be tempting to indulge in if you are unhappy with your grades. However, having a negative inner dialogue about your situation may actually be doing harm and can make it more difficult to work towards improving your grades. Try to re-frame negative thinking to make it easier when working to improve your grades.Instead of being hard on yourself by saying something like ""I'm worthless,"" try to think something like ""The course was difficult and I did my best.""
You wouldn't speak to another person in a cruel or uncaring way. Treat yourself with the same kindness, respect and courtesy you would with another person or someone you love.
Monitor your thoughts for negative thinking. If you notice yourself beginning to think poorly about yourself or your grades, stop and replace it with a positive thought about yourself and your achievements.

, Getting a B when you are a used to getting A's might feel discouraging. Not meeting a personal goal can cause you to question the entire effort, making it tough to recover your motivation. Stay focused on how well you are doing, setting healthy goals, and work towards meeting them.Getting organized can make your path to higher grades more clear, making it feel more obtainable and increasing motivation.
Remind yourself that although you want an A, getting a B is not a bad grade. Focus on how well you are already doing instead of thinking how much better you should have done.
Use your B grade as a sign that you can do well even in a highly challenging course.
Engage in healthy goal setting. Work to do your best without being overly hard on yourself.

, Striving to be and do our best in life is a great way to live. However, people can strive and reach too hard, causing themselves unneeded stress and pain. Examine your thoughts and attitudes about your academic work and try to avoid any instances of perfectionism.Perfectionists will set unrealistic goals, will never be satisfied with anything less than perfect results, will feel crushed by failure, will be preoccupied by fear of failure, will view failure as evidence of worthlessness, and will be extremely defensive in the face of criticism.
Those setting healthy goals will have reachable but challenging goals, will enjoy both the results and working towards them, will easily recover from failure, won't be overwhelmed by fear of failure, will view mistakes as learning opportunities, and will take criticism well.

, College level courses are often much more challenging than high school classes. This increase in difficulty can result in a lower grade and it is nothing unusual or something to feel ashamed about.


Remind yourself that getting a B in a highly demanding course is still a great achievement.
It may take time to adjust to the difficulty of your new courses. Don't expect an immediate and perfect response to the challenge. Allow yourself time to adjust.

, If you are experiencing a lot of anxiety over getting a B or having a hard time not thinking about your grade, it may be time to seek professional help. Talk to a counselor at your high school or college. Grade anxiety is very common, and a counselor can help you improve your coping skills and work on your academic performance."

Improve your scheduling practices.,
Don't be afraid to talk with your teachers.,
Give class time and homework your full attention.",How to Deal With a B as a Straight A Student2," If your grades have slipped or you are not meeting your academic goals, then you will need to discover the reasons why. Although each person will have their own unique reasons as to why their grades are lower than they would like, reviewing the following common examples can help you discover your own:You may have difficulty in one specific area of study.
Scheduling problems can lead to you handing assignments in late, resulting in lost points and lower averages.
Your notes might not be as detailed as they could be.
Paying attention during a class may be difficult for you and cause you to miss important information.

, Studying alone can be an effective way to understand and retain the information presented in your classes. However, working with others can help you achieve an even deeper understanding of the information by engaging in a dialogue, allowing you to encounter new ways of viewing the topic being studied.Ask your friends or classmates if they want to create a study group.
Set up times when you can meet and discuss the material you are studying.
Study groups expose you to new approaches and viewpoints regarding the topic.

, Working to create and follow a schedule for your class work and study sessions can help you to avoid submitting work late as well as allow you plenty of time to fully absorb information. By creating a schedule you will be able to ensure enough time is available for you to get the most out of your studies and improve your grade.Try setting aside time each day for study, projects, and assignments.
Make sure your goals are definite and clear.
Stick to your schedule after you have created it.

, If you are unsure of what you can or need to do to improve your grades, you can try speaking with your teachers. Your teacher will have a good idea of what you can do to work towards improving your grade. Working together with your teacher can be an effective method to get the A's that you want.Your teacher will likely be able identify issues you may be having with the material and give you advice on how to overcome them.
Your teacher may be able to explain information in a more detailed way for you.
Special assignments or extra work may be allowed in order to increase your grade.

,How to Convert a Percentage into a 4.0 Grade Point Average1,
"
Know the formula for converting a percentage into a 4.0 GPA.,
Plug the percentage into the formula and solve.,
Use the same formula if the percentage is higher than 100%.,
Consider using a scale instead.",How to Convert a Percentage into a 4.0 Grade Point Average2," Let's use x to represent the percentage. The formula to use when converting a percentage into a GPA (with a scale of 4.0) is (x/20) - 1 = GPA.

, Let's say you have an 89% in Geology. Just plug it into the formula to get the following:


89/20 - 1 =
4.45 - 1 = 3.45.
The GPA equivalent of 89% is 3.45.

, The process will be the same even if your percentage is higher than 100%. Let's say you got a whopping 108% in Algebra. Here's what happens when you plug it in:


108/20 - 1 =
5.4 - 1 = 4.4
The GPA equivalent of 108% is 4.4.

, This may be useful depending on what you are calculating your GPA for. If you are calculating one grade at a time to see how they will add up for your high school GPA, then you may not have to follow this exact formula because all grades will fall within a range anyway. For example, if your grade falls within the range of 83-86, then depending on your high school, then you will have a B, or a 3.0, whether it falls on the higher or lower part of the range or not.Check out your school's GPA system to figure out how to do this; some high schools have a slightly different range for what makes an A- vs. an A, a B vs. a B+, and so on.

Assign a numerical score to your each of your grades.,
Add up all of your numerical scores.,
Divide your number by the number of classes you took.",How to Convert a Percentage into a 4.0 Grade Point Average3," Each grade that you get at the end of a class has a number equivalent on the 4.0 scale. Find a number equivalent for each grade that you get. Each school's numeral scores may vary slightly, so look into the GPA system at your school. Here is what the typical scoring system looks like:


A = 4
A- = 3.7
B+ = 3.3
B = 3
B- = 2.7
C+ = 2.3
C = 2.0
C- = 1.7
D+ = 1.3
D = 1
D- = .7
F = 0

, Add up the numerical scores assigned to each of your grades. For the sake of example, say you took English (C+), History (B), Math (B+), Chemistry (C+), Physical Education (A-), and Art (A-). That would mean you'd have: 2.3 + 3 + 3.3 + 2.3 + 3.7 + 3.7 = 18.3.

, This is another way of saying that you will have to find the average numerical score. This will give you your final GPA score on a 4.0 scale.


In our example, we added up our numbers to get 18.3. Since we took six classes, we have to divide 18.3 by six. 18.3 ÷ 6 = 3.05 (or 3.1).

Understand weighted GPA.,
Assign a numerical score to each of your grades.,
Add up all your numerical scores.,
Divide your number by the number of classes you took.",How to Convert a Percentage into a 4.0 Grade Point Average4," Weighted GPA is the idea that some harder classes, like honors or AP, should be weighted to reflect an extra degree of difficulty. So, instead of the traditional 4.0 grade scale, a weighted scale can go as high as 5.0, reflecting a harder course load. The idea is that getting a ""C"" in AP Algebra is just as hard as getting a ""B"" in regular Algebra.

, This time, use the same table as above, except add 1 point to each grade that you got in an honors or AP class. Here is what the scaling system usually looks like:


A = 5
A- = 4.7
B+ = 4.3
B = 4
B- = 3.7
C+ = 3.3
C = 3.0
C- = 2.7
D+ = 2.3
D = 2
D- = 1.7
F = 1

, Add up the numerical scores assigned to each of your grades. For the sake of example, say you took AP English (C), Honors History (B), Math (B), AP Chemistry (C+), Music Theory (B-), and Honors Art (A-). That would mean you'd have: 3 + 4 + 3 + 3.3 + 2.7 + 4.7 = 20.7.

, Again, you're just finding the average score. This will give you your final GPA score on a 5.0 scale. Note that you can only receive a 5.0 GPA if all of your classes are honors or AP and you receive an ""A"" in each class. Many students are required to take classes without extra degrees of difficulty, such as gym.


In our example, we added up our numbers to get 20.7. Since we took six classes, we have to divide 20.7 by six. 20.7 ÷ 6 = 3.45 (or 3.5).

Determine why you are repeating the grade.,
Get involved in your educational plan.,
Apply Yourself.,
Work on your behavior.,
Don't wait to speak up.,
Ask you teacher for help.,
Consider getting a tutor.",How to Cope With Repeating a Grade," You may be crushed when you hear that you have to repeat a grade, but it's not the end of the world! Try your best not to feel bad about yourself because of it. If you have a good attitude about it and use it as motivation to do better in school, being held back may actually do you a lot of good.


Being held back does not mean that you are stupid or a bad student. It simply means that you need some more time to reach the benchmarks of that specific grade.Remember that your parents and teachers decided to hold you back because they want what's best for you, not because they want to punish you.
If you become withdrawn in school because you feel bad about repeating a grade, you're likely to do worse.This is why it's so important to stay positive and motivated.;
, Eventually you will have to tell your friends that you are being held back. Think about whether you want to tell them in person or by phone or social media. The right decision for you will depend on the relationship you have with your friends.Your classmates may pick on you for having to repeat a grade, but try not to let it bother you. Decide what you will say to negative people ahead of time so it will be easier to keep your composure. Think about saying something like, ""I just need some extra time to work on math. It's really no big deal.""
It may help to approach the subject casually. The less upset you are about it, the less likely people are to give you a hard time about it.

, Just because you're not in class with your old friends anymore does not mean you have to lose touch with them. Make an effort to spend time with close friends outside of school.If you believe your old friends caused you to be held back a grade, it's best to distance yourself from them and spend more time with friends who encourage you to do well in school.

, Making friends with your new classmates is very important to your overall well-being. It might be tough at first to make new friends, but keep at it! You're more likely to be successful in school and enjoy being there.If you were held back because you were immature for your age, you might actually find that you have more in common with your new classmates.
Try joining sports or clubs to spend more time with your classmates outside of the classroom.

, The first step to doing better the second time around is to understand the factors that caused you to be held back in the first place. If you simply did not understand the material, you may just need some more time. If, however, you skipped class, didn't pay attention, or didn't do any of your homework, you will need to make some changes in order to do well this time.

, Your parents and teachers may have an idea about what you need to succeed, but it's important for you to be involved in this conversation as well. Work with your parents and teachers to decide how you will prevent a repeat of the mistakes that caused you to be held back. Your input might encourage your school to make changes to your IEP that will really benefit you.If you feel you would benefit from some accommodations at school, like more time with tests or a little more personal attention, be sure to speak up.
Don't blame your teacher, but let your parents know if her teaching style didn't work for you. You shouldn't have to deal with the same approach a second time if you would benefit from something different., If you want to do well in school, you need to work hard at it! Be sure to listen to your teacher and understand what is expected of you.Always show up for class and pay attention.

Take notes in class.

Do your homework on time. It helps to have a designated space for homework and a regular routine for doing it.
Develop good study habits.
If you don't understand something you read, read it again.

, If the reason you got held back has more to do with behavioral issues than it does with your academic abilities, it's important to work really hard on behaving better at school. Have a discussion with your parents and teachers about the problems you are having and the expectations they have of you.If you can't control your behavior on your own, let your parents and your teachers know how you are feeling. They may be able to offer additional support. You may also benefit from talking to your school counselor.

, If you find yourself struggling in this grade again, be sure to get help before it's too late. The sooner you do something about it, the easier it will be for you to get caught up and improve your grade., If you don't understand something in class, the first thing you should do is talk to your teacher about it. If you can, ask questions during class so they will be answered right away.If you feel uncomfortable asking questions during class or if there isn't time to do so, talk to your teacher after class. Make sure she knows that you are trying hard to do your best but you do not understand the material.

, If your teacher can't provide you with as much extra help as you need, you might really benefit from one-on-one tutoring. Many school offer tutoring programs after school, so be sure to talk to your teacher or counselor about what is available for you.If your school does not have a tutoring program, your teacher may suggest that you work with another student in the class.
Private tutoring is another option, although it can be expensive. Depending on your tutoring needs and your family's budget, you may be able to go to a tutoring center after school or you may be able to have a private tutor come to your house to help you with your work.

Write out your scores.,
Write out the total possible points.,
Add up both columns.,
Calculate your average grade.,
Multiply the decimal number by 100.,
Determine your letter grade or grade point equivalent (GPA).",How to Calculate Your Final Grade1," Find your scores from each assignment, quiz, homework, etc. throughout the term. Sometimes this will be collected for you online, such as in a system like Blackboard. Sometimes, you'll have to go through your graded work. Write them all in one column on a piece of paper to refer back to.


If things like participation or discussion are included as percentages of your final grade, you may have to ask your teacher or professor what your grade on this part is.;
, Refer to the syllabus for the grading system. Teachers employ various systems to determine final grades, but two common systems are points and percentages. Either way, write out the total possible points in the second column next to the score you received.In a points-based system, there is a maximum number of points you can earn in the class. Each assignment has a certain number of points assigned. For example, there may be 200 total points available in a course, split up into four assignments each worth a maximum of 50 points (4x50=200).
In a percentage-based system, each assignment will be worth a certain percentage of your grade. These percentages add up to 100%. For example, you might have four assignments due, each worth 25% of the grade (4x25=100).
Note that in these examples, each assignment is worth the same weight overall in your course, even though the numbers are different.

, Do this whether your assignments are graded on a percentage scale or some other total. Add up all the numbers for the first column and write the total at the bottom. Add up the numbers in the second column and write the total below.


For example, say you have 5 graded course activities total. 2 of these activities were exams worth 20 points each. 2 of these activities were quizzes worth 10 points each. The final activity was an assignment worth 5 points.
20+20+10+10+5= 65. This is total number of points available in the class.
Now add up your scores. Let us say you scored an 18/20 on your first exam, a 15/20 on your second exam, a 7/10 on your first quiz, a 9/10 on your second quiz, and 3/5 on the single assignment.
18+15+7+9+3= 52. This is the total number of points you earned in the class.

, Now divide your total points earned by the total number of points available to get a percentage grade. In other words, divide the number you wrote below the first column by the number you wrote below the second column.

, To get a grade that may look more recognizable to you, you need to convert the decimal to a percentage. Multiply the decimal times 100. Another way to do this is to shift the decimal point 2 spots to the right.


52/65= 0.8 or 80%
To move the decimal point 2 places to the right, add some more zeroes, like this: 0.800. Now shift the decimal 2 spots. This gives you: 080.0. take away the leftover zeros, and you get 80. That means you scored an 80 in the class.

, You'll need to understand your class grading scale to calculate your final grade. Some schools employ letter grades (ex. A, B, B-, etc...) while others use a point system (ex. 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, etc...). These scales all correspond with assigned percentages that work in relation to the total number of points that can be achieved in a class.


These scales may also vary, depending on your school. For example, some schools may assign plus/minus grades, and some may not. Some may use a ten-point scale (e.g., anything between 90-100 is an A, anything between 80-89 is a B, etc.). Others may use a seven-point scale (e.g, 97-100=A, 93-96=A-, 91-92=B+, etc.). This may also vary depending on your professor's preferences."

Identify how grades are weighted.,
Multiply the weight percentage times your scores.,
Add up your new numbers.,
Compare the percentage score to the grading scale.",How to Calculate Your Final Grade2," This means that some grades make up a bigger percentage of your final grade. For example, your grade may be made up of 30% participation, 4 quizzes at 10% each, and a final exam at 30%. Figuring out how your participation grades and final exam affect your grade, when they are 3 times as important as each quiz grade, is the tricky part.


Check your syllabus or ask your teacher how the grades are weighted.
In high school, it's common for advanced classes, such as Advanced Placement classes, to be assigned more ""quality points"" than average classes. If you are trying to calculate your GPA, make sure you know how each course is weighted., To make it easier to organize, you might want to first write out your grades and the total points possible in separate columns. Then multiply each number times the amount it is weighted. Keep track of these numbers in a new column.Example: If a final exam is worth 30% of your total grade and you received and 18/20, multiply 30 by 18/20. (30 x (18/20) = 540/600)

, Once you have multiplied each score by its weighted percentage, add the total number of points you received and total points possible. Divide the sum of all your weighted points by the sum of all the by the total weighted number of points.Example: Weight per assignment: Assignment 1= 10%, Assignment 2= 10%, Test 1= 30%, Test 2= 30%, Participation= 20%. Your Scores: Assignment 1= 18/20, Assignment 2= 19/20, Test 1= 15/20, Test 2= 17/20, Participation= 18/20.
Assignment 1: 10 x (18/20)= 180/200
Assignment 2: 10 x (19/20)= 190/200
Test 1: 30 x (15/20)= 450/600
Test 2: 30 x (17/20)= 510/600
Participation: 20 x (18/20)= 360/400
Total Score: (180+190+450+510+360) ÷ (200+200+600+600+400), or1690/2000 = 84.5%

, Now that you have identified your final percentage grade, accounting for the weighted assignments, compare that percentage to your class grading scale. This will be, for example, A=93-100, B=85-92, etc.It is common for teachers and professors to round scores up to the nearest percentage point. For example, your 84.5% will become 85% for the purposes of assigning a final grade.

Divide your total points by the class total points.,
Convert the decimal point to a percentage.,
Compare your “Final Percentage Grade” to your class grading scale.",How to Calculate Your Final Grade3," Open a new file in the spreadsheet application on your operating system. Type in a title over each column to stay organized. Use the first column to write the name of the activity. The second column should become the points you earned for the assignment. The third column will be the total points possible.


For example, your columns might be: Activity name, Points earned, Points possible.

, Write out each activity name in the first column. Then write each score in the second column. Write the total points possible in the third. If the grade is calculated on a basic percentage, that means the total possible points was 100.

, Write “TOTALS” below each activity name in the first column. Then tab over in that row one space to the right so that you are directly below the last grade you recorded. Write sum, then equals, then open parenthesis. It will look like this: “ sum=( “ then select the first score in the column above, and drag your cursor to cover every grade in the column. Release the mouse button, and close the parenthesis. It will look something like this: “ sum=(B2:B6) “Repeat the sum=( method with the third column, the total points possible.
You can alternately manually type out the range of cells you want to add up. For example, seeing that the values you want to add up are B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6, write out “ sum=(B2:B6) “

, Stay in this row and tab over to the fourth column. Write equals, open parenthesis: “ =( “ Then select the total points you earned over the semester, put in a forward slash, then select the total points possible over the term, and close the parenthesis: “ =(B7/C7) “


Hit enter when you are done. The total should automatically show up.

, This is also easily done in a spread sheet. Tab over to the next column. Type in equals, open parenthesis, select decimal grade average you just calculated, then type in an asterisk, type 100, and then close parenthesis. It will look something like this: “ =(D7*100) “


Hit enter for the score to show up.

, Now that you know your total percentage for all the weighted activities, compare that percentage to your course grading scale to identify the letter (ex. A, B-, D+, etc…). If it is a number scale (3.75, 2.5, 1.0, etc…) you should multiply the decimal total by the perfect score.


For example, if your decimal average was .82, and you are graded on a 4 point scale (as GPAs are), multiply the decimal by 4. This will give you your grade on a 4 point scale.

For example, if the grade of your midterm exam that was 30% of your final score was an 87, you would enter open parenthesis, select the cell with the midterm score, asterisk, and 30%. Written out, this looks like “ =(B2*30%) “, Pick a cell you want to display your final weighted score. Do the same sum function as we have before. Type equals, sum, open parenthesis, pick the range of cells with your scores, close parenthesis, and press enter. Written out, it will look somewhat like “ =sum(B2:B6) “

, Now that you know your total percentage for all the weighted activities, compare that percentage to your course grading scale to identify the letter (ex. A, B-, D+, etc…) or number grade (3.75, 2.5, 1.0, etc…) you will receive for the class.

Concentrate your efforts for learning--but if your friends don't want to learn, casually leave them behind without creating a scene as you don't want to make enemies of them.,
Start hanging around with people that want to learn (who are sometimes referred to as ""nerds"") as they may influence you to form better study habits and perform well in class.,
*""Nerds"", as you call them are just students who know where their priorities are.,
Focus in school.,
*Maybe you have a dream.,
Continue the process.,
*In the end of the year, compare your test results an see how they improved!,
Read and watch shows about current affairs to have a wide knowledge of events, and study several specific topics to develop a mastery of particular subjects.

,
Discovery Channel (if you have access to it) is not just for ""nerds"".,
You have to make notes and revise for exams.",How to Change Yourself at School and Get Good Grades,"

Find a balance. Although you have to learn more (because you probably missed something the years before) don't forget your friends. Maybe you can a agree on one day a week where you meet together and do whatever you like.
, Many preps and jocks are known to have high grades too. Be careful though. Most so-called ""nerds"" are stereotypically helpful and easily persuaded. Not all though, so be careful not to assume that a person is nice because they are a ""nerd"". Don't just leave your old friends behind, though. Just make new ones, and balance between the two. You don't want to work too hard, and you don't want to play too hard as well.

, So do not make fun of them!, It is one of your top priorities. If you get distracted, say to yourself ""I have to work smarter, not just harder to learn so I can earn good grades, to get a good job, and go to college."" This is important -- don't tell yourself maybe you'll go to college -- tell yourself it's going to happen, and that is that.

, You want to be doctor a an author. Then you probably know that your grades have to be good to go to college. Focus on that dream!, Don't start and then quit two weeks or two months later. You have to be determined; make this a habit.

, It's satisfying - isn't it?,, Some of the programs are, but others you might find really helpful and interesting.

, Don't study months before a really important exam, study just a month before or you might become demotivated. Make notes as your revise but you have to remember to have time to read and learn your notes as well.

Give yourself permission to move on.Academics is mental, so the proper mentality plays a big part in reaching academic goals.,
Adopt the proper mindset.,
Cultivate a successful identity.,
Consider the impact of chaotic personal relationships.,
Analyze extracurricular commitments.,
Make a list of upcoming assignments for the next week.,
Imagine how you feel when you are about to take a test.,
Test your knowledge.,
Look at the history of your grades and determine the overall trend.,
Develop a plan of action.,
Create a peaceful space.,
Establish a routine.,
Stay calm.,
Use outside resources.,
Celebrate and build on improvements.",How to Cope with Academic Failure," Instead of judging yourself for past shortcomings, focus instead on how you will feel when you have mastered the areas that give you trouble.;
, People tend to look at themselves as being academic “successes” or “failures,” and not people with discrete problems in a particular area. Failure and success are both conditions, which means that they are thought of as encompassing long periods of time.


Instead of thinking of it as failure, think of it as a problem. Problems are there to be solved; a problem can be fixed. Most importantly, everyone has problems, even the most successful people.

, Failure and success become part of people's identities.Many who have struggled in school have adopted an identity of themselves as a failure. If a person identifies as a failure, then success becomes contrary to their nature.


If you think you might have adopted a failure identity, then the first step is to practice self-compassion. Stop thinking of yourself as a failure, and think about yourself as a person with a fixable problem.The existence of the problem itself is neutral with respect to success and failure. The problem is an opportunity, because how a person responds to a problem is what creates success or failure

, Troubles at home or in personal relationships are the most common external factor making students’ academic performance suffer. Think about what’s going on at home and in your personal relationships. If you and your loved ones are fighting a lot, a parent has started a divorce, or you have just broken up with a significant other, this may contribute to your academic struggles.This kind of analysis can be difficult. Because people in close personal relationships mean a great deal, it is difficult to admit that those relationships may cause problems in other areas. But just because you have relationship problems doesn't mean that the relation is a bad person. The point is to separate relationship problems from academic problems so that they can both be solved.

, Social distractions are a common source of academic problems. If you participate in a number of extracurricular activities, including sports, partying, performing, visual, or written arts, or even just hanging out with friends, these can contribute to academic struggle.


There are only 24 hours in a day. A person sleeps for eight hours and a full-time student goes to school for another eight. How you spend the remainder can determine the outcome of an academic problem., Disorganization and improper time management is a huge factor in academic struggle.Making an inventory of upcoming assignments, due dates, and guidelines is a way for you to measure your organizational skills.


Everyone won't remember everything off the top of their head. That doesn't necessarily mean that they are disorganized. But if you can't remember due dates, guidelines, and assignments, and you can't find the notes or handouts that describe them, you probably have organizational issues. Especially if you understand the subject matter, but have trouble keeping up with assignments, dates, and procedures, disorganization is probably at the root of your trouble.

, If you find yourself forgetting things you know before a test, feel anxious, agitated, or nervous before you are called upon to demonstrate what you know on an exam or in a presentation, lack of confidence and anxiety might be your problem.Everybody gets nervous from time to time. The question is whether you are getting so nervous that it makes you unable to do things that you otherwise could.

, If you find yourself struggling with a particular subject, and not school in general, lack of understanding might be your problem.


Try some problems in a textbook, ask your teacher for a sample test, or go online to find some problems that you aren't already familiar with.
Although it seems counter-intuitive, this is the easiest academic problem to fix, because it doesn't require a major change in behavior to fix. Almost anyone can understand almost anything if they are given the proper explanation and sufficient practice., This can be tricky, so be very methodical about it (if you don’t have these records, your teacher will.) Were your grades good and then suddenly plummeted, slowly decline, or are they erratic?


If they slowly declined, this probably indicates an ongoing but worsening external problem or a lack of proficiency in a foundational skill set. Foundational skills often start out as small portions of your grades but increase in importance as time goes on.
If your grades suddenly plummeted, then that can be indicative of the sudden presence of a very troublesome external factor. If your family was evicted or homeless, a parent went to prison, or you moved to a new school or a new class, these would all qualify. Alternatively, the subject matter in that class may have abruptly changed, and you might struggle with the new material.

, Once you have identified the factors contributing to your problems and determined when they began, you need to develop a game plan. What your game plan is will depend on the nature of the problem.

, If you’ve been having trouble with parents, significant others, roommates or siblings, see what you can do to take yourself out of the situation as much as possible.


Study at a library, a coffee shop, or even at a friend’s house. Even if you have to face those same problems when you get home, find a space where you can learn in peace., If you have organizational problems, then you need to establish a routine that works for you.Try to study at the same times and same places each day, so it becomes habit. At the end of class, double check with your teacher to make sure you know about upcoming assignments.


Set phone and email alerts so you don’t forget about them, and set them at the times you need to start working on them.

, If you find yourself having trouble with anxiety, ask your teacher if you can take your exam in a quiet or more comfortable setting. Read directions carefully. Don’t take the test on an empty stomach. Make sure you are prepared.Avoid cramming in new material right before the test, and above all, remember that anxiety is also a habit. Break yourself of it., If you have problems with the academic material, now that you know what parts of the material are giving you trouble, take extra time to study them. Most schools offer programs to provide additional after school tutoring for students. Utilize these to the best of your ability. Use whatever resources you can, like tutors, online tutorials, friends, parents, and teachers.


There is a wealth of additional help available online. Youtube.com, http://www.khanacademy.org, http://www.tutorchatlive.org, and http://www.eduwizards.com all offer free services to help students on nearly any type of subject matter.

, Your problems weren’t created overnight, and you probably won’t solve them overnight. You need to make sure that you celebrate even modest improvements in your performance. Only by recognizing progress will you be able to encourage yourself to keep going."

Understand how the weighted GPA works.,
Learn how your classes are weighted.,
Figure out the score for each class.,
Add the GPA for each class together.,
Count the number of individual GPAs.,
Divide the total you added by the number of items.,
Scale the average up or down.",How to Calculate Your Weighted GPA," In some high school systems and college admission offices, classes that are considered to be of college level, such as Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate, receive more points than other classes. They receive more points because they require more work and make you perform at a higher level., Different school districts and even different universities weight your GPA differently. For instance, some places add an extra half a point to grades for these classes, while other places add a full point.Check your school's handbook to find out more. You may also find the information on your school or district website.
If you're trying to figure out your GPA for college admissions, look on the admissions sections of the universities you're applying to. Each one may weight your GPA differently.
Also, some schools do not add the extra points if you go below a C.

, For your advanced classes, add the extra number. For your regular classes, keep the number as it normally is.


The normal GPA scale for grades is a 4.0 for an A, a 3.0 for a B, a 2.0 for a C, 1.0 for a D, and 0.0 for an F.
In some weighted GPAs, the scale for honors or advanced classes is 4.5 for an A, 3.5 for a B, 2.5 for a C, 1.5 for a D, and 0.0 for an F, while your grades in other classes still use the normal scale. So if your grades for a semester were A, B, and C in honors classes and an A and B in regular classes, your GPA for each class would be 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, and 3.0, respectively.
In other weighted GPAs, the scale for honors and advanced classes is 5.0 for an A, 4.0 for a B, 3.0 for a C, 2.0 for a D, and 0.0 for an F, with some of them leaving off the extra for the D. Your regular classes still use the normal scale.Therefore, if your grades for a semester were A, B, and C in honors classes and an A and B in regular classes, your GPA for each class would be 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 3.0, respectively.

, To figure out your GPA, you basically need to do an average of all your classes. The first step of averaging your GPA is adding all of them together.So if your individual GPAs for classes are 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 4.0, and 3.0, the total for those is 17.5.
If your individual GPAs are 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 3.0, then your total is 19.

, The next step in figuring out an average is counting the number of items you added together. In this case, you're averaging 5 items in both sets., The next step is to divide the number of items, 5, into each total you added together. So if your total is 17.5, you divide 17.5 by 5 to get 3.5. So in the system that ups your honors classes by half a point, your GPA would be a 3.5 If your total was 19, you divide by 5 to get 3.8. Therefore, in the system that ups your honors classes by a whole point, your weighted GPA is 3.8., If you need to, you can add more or fewer numbers to the equation. For instance, if you have 10 classes, you just add all 10 of your GPAs together, and then divide by 10. If you have 15, you add all 15 together and divide by 15."

Use an online map service.,
Verify the address using public records.,
Visit the postal service website.,
Look up the address using a verification demo.",How to Check a Residential Address1," You can find basic information about a residential address by searching online maps such as Google Maps. This can be helpful if you know part of an address but aren't sure about the whole thing.Even if you find the address on an online map, you still should use other verification methods to make sure it's correct. Just because an address is mappable doesn't mean it's deliverable.
Additionally, some addresses my have P.O. boxes, or have a shipping address that differs from the street address.
However, finding the address on an online map can be helpful if you're just trying to figure out how to get to a location, but don't necessarily need to mail something there.;
, Residential property ownership is recorded publicly, so you may be able to verify the address by looking up the deed or property tax records for the property.As with online maps, the information you get this way won't necessarily tell you if you can deliver mail to that address. However, it will give you the correct street address for that location in most instances.
Keep in mind that if a residence may be identified using a metes and bounds or parcel number rather than a street address.
To find public records about a particular residential property, look for the local government records office. In the United States, this typically is the county recorder's or county clerk's office.

, In many countries, you can verify a single residential address by typing in a portion of the address on the postal service website for that country. This service typically is limited to private individuals and cannot be used for business purposes.For example, if you want to check a residential address in the United Kingdom, you can type the part of the address you know into the Postcode finder at royalmail.com.
The system will auto-suggest completion of the address as you type. If you see the correct location, simply click on it and you will see the full, standard address used to deliver mail to that location.
The UK online system is limited to 50 searches per day, and is only available for individuals who occasionally need to verify an address. If you have a business that has more extensive address verification needs, you can contact the Royal Mail regarding other address management products they have available.

, There are a number of address verification services that allow you to demo their product for free online without having to register or pay money for their services.This can be helpful if you need to check a residential address before you mail something there. For example, if you sold an item on an online auction site and want to verify the address of the buyer before you ship it, you could use one of these demos.
There are several data companies who have certified systems that will verify US mailing addresses. Some of these, such as Experian Data Quality, will verify international addresses as well.

, They usually have a book where all of the postcodes are listed, which are separated by street and town.

, Fill in the postcode on the letter or items you are mailing.

"
"
Use approved abbreviations.,
Make sure all words are spelled correctly.,
Confirm the default city name.,
Look up the ZIP code with USPS.,
Complete the address.",How to Check a Residential Address2," The postal service of each country has standardized abbreviations for words commonly included in street addresses. These abbreviations may vary depending on the country.For example, in the US the word ""street"" is commonly abbreviated ""St,"" while the word ""suite"" (as in an office suite) is abbreviated ""ste."" If you use just the letter ""S,"" it will be interpreted as the direction ""south.""
Some words may have more than one common abbreviation, but they would only have one standard abbreviation for postal purposes. For example, the word ""avenue"" may be abbreviated ""avn,"" but the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) standardized abbreviation is ""AVE.""
Even if you know the abbreviations for your own country, you may want to double-check before you send mail to an address in another country.

, Misspelled words in an address can result in your package being undeliverable, or may even result in the package being sent to a different address than the one you intended.Pay close attention to words with more than one spelling, or words that are homophones. For example, you may have heard an address and believe the street name is ""Pike's Peak Road,"" but it could be ""Pike Speak Road"" or ""Pike's Peek Road.""
You also want to verify whether compound road names are one word or two separate words. For example, a residence could be located on ""Creek Side Drive"" or on ""Creekside Drive.""

, Default and acceptable city names depend on the postal service regulations for the country where the address is located. For some locations, there may be more than one city name you can use.For example, if you're mailing a letter to New York City, you should use the default city and state if at all possible, which is ""New York NY."" If you address your envelope to ""New York City NY"" or ""Manhattan NY,"" your letter will likely still reach its intended destination, but it may be delayed.If you're mailing a letter to another country, you may be able to address the letter in English or in the language of that country. In some instances, this may result in a different city name.

, If you're trying to verify or complete an address in the United States, you can enter the address on the USPS website to get the complete ZIP code for that address.From the USPS website at usps.com, click on the ""quick tools"" menu bar to find the ""Look Up a ZIP Code"" page.
You can find a ZIP Code by entering all or part of the residential address you have, or you can type in a ZIP Code to find the default city name you should use to mail letters or packages there.

, Your mail will not be delivered if the address you provide is incomplete. Each country has its own standards of completion, and if you're mailing the package internationally, you also must include the name or approved abbreviation of the country.The US postal service guidelines require the person's name to be on the top line of the address block. Below that is any information required to direct the mail internally, such as a suite number or a job title.
The next portion of the address block in a US address (and the address block of most countries) is the street address. From this point on, the address moves from the smallest point to the largest point that you need to identify.
For example, if you're mailing a package internationally from Australia to the United States, you would start with the person's name, then provide their street address on the next line. The third line of the address would provide the city, state, and ZIP code, and then you would include the country's name (""U.S.A."" or ""United States of America"") on the last line.
If you were mailing an item domestically within the United States, you would not need to include the country's name. However, you would still need to include the city, state, and ZIP code, regardless of where you're mailing the item from.

Register with the National Change of Address (NCOA) system.,
Find a certified vendor.,
Use an address verification service.,
Integrate address verification into your website.",How to Check a Residential Address3," In the United States, you can register with NCOA to quickly and easily verify customer addresses and correct errors before packages or materials are mailed.The NCOA system is designed for business owners, not private individuals. You must complete a registration form if you want to use the NCOA system. However, the system is free to use.
This system can help you find the addresses of customers who may have moved, provided they registered the change of address with the USPS.

, In countries with national postal services, venders offering residential address verification services typically will be certified or approved by the national postal service if they adhere to the standardized practices and guidelines of the postal service.You typically can contact the country's postal service to find out if they certify or register these services.
Be wary of a company that claims to verify residential addresses, but is not certified by the national postal authority. It may be a front for a scam that's just trying to harvest addresses.
Especially if you plan to subscribe to a service, which can involve a significant investment, make sure you investigate the company thoroughly and are sure that they'll provide the services you want and are legitimate and respected in the industry.

, There are a number of address verification services online that you can use to verify larger spreadsheets of residential addresses, such as if you communicate to customers or members of an organization using the mail on a regular basis.Most of these services charge a monthly or annual subscription fee, so you should compare the fees along with the services provided to decide which service will best meet the needs of your business or organization. Be sure to account for growth.
Some services, such as SmartyStreets, offer the ability to check a limited number of addresses for free each month. Additional domestic addresses or international addresses will cost you a monthly fee.

, If you have an online store front, you can purchase code from shipping services or other suppliers that will allow you to verify addresses as your customers type them when placing an order.The cost for these services varies depending on the volume of sales or address you need to have checked each month, as well as whether you want the service to check international addresses or domestic addresses only.
An integrated verification service can save you time and money if you anticipate a larger volume of business, but may not be cost-effective if you have a small online shop that only processes a small number of orders.
Outsourcing your payment services to another company also may include address verification services.

Domestic first class and media mail shipments do not automatically include tracking. You must request tracking be added, for which there is an additional charge.Most other forms of shipping (that are more expensive than first class), such as Priority Mail, do include tracking.
Not all forms of tracking are equal. As a general rule, the more expensive the form of shipping, the more detailed the tracking information will be.;
, The receipt should include a tracking number (titled a ""Label number"" on some receipts) at the bottom of the form.


The number of digits and the precise format of the tracking number may differ depending on the form of shipment you selected. For a list of the differing formats, see here.

, The USPS website--USPS.com--has links on nearly every page that will take you to the pages for tracking packages. The general search box on the site's homepage will also track packages if you enter the information here.

,, The USPS uses a particular terminology to describe the status of each package, and while most are straightforward enough others are less comprehensible.


You will see ""Arrived at USPS Origin Facility"" indicating the moment the package was first entered in the USPS sorting system. This is not necessarily the same as the first Post Office that the package was in, but the first place in which it was prepared for transshipment to the next point.
""Arrived at Post Office"" will be seen when the package has arrived in the vicinity of its final delivery but still remains within a USPS facility.
The description ""Out for Delivery"" is perhaps the most straightforward. The package is currently with a postal service agent for delivery.

Find a nice quiet spot to study.,

Prioritize.,
Write out important info or recite small bits out loud.,

Take breaks.,
Go to bed.,
Eat breakfast.,
Take a deep breath.,
Grab a friend to quiz in class.",How to Cram the Night Before a Test," Make sure it's not too comfortable (like on your bed or sprawling out on the couch) because you will risk falling asleep.


Find or create a well-lit area. When it's too dark around you, your body thinks, ""Hey! It's time to hit the hay!"" Fool it by turning on plenty of lights, simulating daytime.






Remove yourself from all distractions. That means putting your phone away. You may have spent the entire semester texting during lectures, and this may be your punishment. Turn it off. While you're at it, stay away from the iPad and laptop, too (unless you have study material on your computer) -- Facebook, fantasy baseball, and Pinterest do not exist in your book right now.





;
, You may think 16 cans of cold Red Bull and five Snickers bars are the best way to go, but, sadly, they're not. Hyping yourself up on caffeine may keep you awake initially, but you'll just end up crashing harder later -- when it's actually test time.


Go for fruits. An apple does a better job at keeping you focused and awake than caffeine.It's higher in natural sugars and it is nutritious. Nutrition should be thought of as energy in this circumstance.






If you're full, you won't be thinking about food, another reason you'll be able to stay focused.

, Alright, so, worse comes to worst: You wake up in a pile of apple cores with ink emblazoned onto your cheek because you fell asleep on your chemistry notes. But you remembered to set your alarm, so you're not going to miss the test!


So do it now, before you accidentally fall asleep. You may be grateful that you did.

, This part may be hard but just take a deep breath and try to gather your thoughts! Remember where you left all those textbooks and gather together some spare pieces of paper and pens. Highlighters and flashcards are also a good idea.


If you still have your syllabus, great. Use it as an outline. The topics that pop up more than once are likely to be on the test.

, Concentrate on the bigger picture -- highlight the important facts that you think could be on the test. Also remember to look closely at the vocabulary! It will obviously help your understanding if you know what a word means.


Read the chapter summaries (they usually do a good job at summarizing the important points). If there are no chapter summaries, then skim through the text and write down key ideas.

, This is the most important part of cramming. You have a very limited amount of time -- you must use it as efficiently as possible. Get down to the nitty-gritty and only study what you think is worthy of being on the test.


Focus on the main ideas and learn key formulas. Skip the details for now and only come back to them if you see that you have time after you have learned the key points.
Don't attempt to learn everything; focus on things that will get you the most points on the exam. If your professor said the essay will be 75% of your grade, you're best off preparing for that and skipping the multiple choice.

, This will help your brain process the material better. If you just skim your textbooks or notes you probably won't remember anything!


If you're lucky enough to have an insomniac for a roommate, grab them. Ask them to listen to you spout off about certain concepts. Relaying information to another individual is a surefire way to guarantee you understand the ins and outs of the ideas., This is a good way to quiz yourself and it also helps you process the information when you write out the flashcards and read them out loud! Use different colors for different topics or chapters.


Look for parallels, metaphors, and other memory-triggers to help you wrap your brain around complicated concepts.Write the keywords of your metaphor down to jog your memory while studying.
Write the information down in mnemonic devices. Dumb Kids Playing Catch On Freeway Get Squashed --Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (for a happy example).

, It may seem counter-intuitive, but your brain will be able to process more information if you're not so hard on it. Study in bursts -- cramming like the Energizer bunny is inefficient and saturates your mind, preventing it from taking in more. Though you're studying a bit less, you'll be retaining more.After 45 minutes or so, get up. Stretch your body and walk around. Grab a drink, get a snack, and hop back to it in 5 to 10 minutes. You should feel a bit more refreshed and ready for action.

, If you stay up all night you will be so tired in the morning chances are you won't remember anything! Get up in the morning about 30-45 minutes earlier and familiarize yourself with the highlighted parts of your notes and textbooks. If you made flashcards, go through them again.


Try to get in at least 3 hours; that's one full sleep cycle.Waking up in the middle of one less than well-rested will be detrimental to your test score.

, You've heard from everybody that a nutritious meal before an exam will help you use your brain better. Stick to a fairly normal breakfast (you don't want to get sick) and don't load up on anything too heavy if you have anxiety.


Think about this: The more food you eat before your exam, the less you will be thinking about how hungry you are, so help yourself by just eating something before your exam so you can stay at least somewhat focused.

, Go through the information a couple of times on your way to school. Chances are if you paid attention in class and got in some good studying the night before you should be fine.

, There's 5 minutes before the teacher walks in, so utilize them! Take turns asking each other questions. Start with the points you are foggiest on -- that way they'll be fresh in your memory.


Don't do this while you're taking the test -- getting caught cheating will result in a much worse score than you were going to get if you hadn't.

,, As you study a topic, mark it in a way that is meaningful to you, to remind you which topics have already been studied.

, If you are going to study for a long time, remember to take a break in between, preferably every 20 minutes or so.

, All you have to do is redo one of your past tests or quizzes within a time limit. Get into the exam mode by clearing your work desk of everything except your paper, pen and any other items you need for the test.

, Provided that you are healthy you should execute your plans whether you are feeling strong or weak, tired or energized, lazy or motivated, focused or distracted, discouraged or encouraged. Realize that it is up to you to make the moments in your hand count for something and don’t let your feelings trick you into being less than empowered.

, It's harder to concentrate when you got less than six hours of sleep the night before. Aim for eight to ten hours of deep sleep to feel truly refreshed and ready for anything in the morning.

, Master it, and you'll end up loving it. At the very least, you won't have to worry about putting it off until it's too late because you don't like it.

, It is a matter of conditioning yourself to a sustained work ethic that will facilitate peak performance in the sometimes intense academic arena.

Make a schedule.,
Sleep well.,
Eat healthy.,
Cook a dinner with friends.,
Take advantage of your school's or university's events.",How to De Stress During Exam Time1," This will go a long way in avoiding stress by making sure you don’t miss a deadline or forget an exam. Use a simple calendar app such as Google Calendar to lay out your schedule for the entire exam time. You can schedule and color code specific times to study for each exam. Be sure to give yourself enough time for other activities like chores and sleeping. A better organized schedule will make you feel in control of your time and decrease stress from having to remember everything in your head.


When creating your calendar, schedule your most important tasks first - for example, things that cannot be moved or rescheduled, like the your exam times.
Schedule your study time as well, and specify which exam you are going to be studying for.
Give yourself plenty of break time, as well as time for de-stressing activities.;
, A good night’s rest is important for your mental and physical stamina. Sleeping well will give your a solid start to a new day and go a long way towards decreasing your stress levels. Take a few steps to ensure you get all your zzz’s.


Stay consistent in your sleep schedule. Go to sleep and rise at roughly the same time everyday.
Do not go to bed hungry or stuffed. The discomfort may keep you up.
Do not use electronic devices before bed. The artificial light can mess with your body’s internal clock., It’s important to eat a well balanced diet to maintain a good energy level. Be sure to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables and have a good balance between starchy foods such as rice and pasta and protein rich foods such as meat, beans, and fish.Moderate your caffeine intake. Overdoing it on caffeine can lead to a loss of focus, jitteriness, and an upset stomach.
Drink lots of water to stay hydrated.
Skip the high fat, high sugar content foods. While these options may give you a short energy boost, they don’t contain the necessary nutrients to keep you going for longer.

, If you are living in a college dorm, and your building doesn’t have much in the way of kitchen accommodations, see if you can arrange to use an off campus friend’s kitchen. Even if you’re not great at cooking, this can be a fun way to relax and socialize, and at the end you’ll have food either way.


You can also host a bake-a-thon. Get your closest friends together and bake away - the delicious treats will help you and your friends de-stress before your next exam.

, Colleges will often organize events meant to de stress students during finals time. They can vary from handing out free coffee and donuts before early morning exams, to providing counseling, to setting up petting zoos or bringing dogs to campus for students to pet and play with. Inquire with your student services department to find out what options your university offers.If you are in high school, try reaching out to your guidance counselor. They are there to listen to students' problems and offer advice. Alternatively, you might want to volunteer somewhere that makes you feel relaxed, like an animal shelter.

Fill out the application forms.,
Prepare two forms of ID.,
Pay your fees in advance.,
Collect your post office box keys.,
Aim to collect your mail in a timely manner.,
Update your information promptly.,
Be aware of how refunds work.",How to Rent a Post Office Box1," You can apply online at usps.com, or print out a form and take it into your local post office. Before you start, consider these questions:


Where do you want your post office box to be? Are there two branches near your house? Would you prefer one over the other? Or is there only one post office where it's feasible for you to rent a box?
What size do you want? Post office boxes come in five sizes. The smallest is 3 inches (7.6 cm) by 5.5 inches (14.0 cm); the largest is 22.5 inches (57.2 cm) by 12 inches (30.5 cm). Fees are based on size, so try to get the smallest one for your needs.
Note who is authorized to receive mail at your post office box. You'll be able to list names on the application.;
, Whether you apply online or in-person, you'll need to provide the U.S. Postal Service with two forms of identification. Here's what you need:Photo ID. For your first form of ID, you could use a driver's license, state identification card, passport, alien registration card, or any form of photo ID issued by a government, the armed forces, a recognized educational entity, or a corporate ID card.
Non-photo ID. Your second form of ID must be somehow tied to your physical address. Acceptable forms include your current lease or mortgage, your voter or vehicle registration card, or your home or vehicle insurance policy.
Be aware that your birth certificate, Social Security card, and credit cards are not valid forms of ID.

, You can reserve it for 3, 6 or 12 months.


Note that the fees for a post office box will vary by location. Not every branch will price them equally.

, You should receive two keys for every box. Expect to pay a security deposit for each key, which is refundable when you return them and close your post office box.


Some post office boxes can be opened with access codes, much like a public school locker. Write down your combination in a secure place, or memorize it.

, Given that there's limited space in your post office box, accumulation is a potential problem. If you let it get out of hand, the Postal Service could suspend your lease.


If you're going to be out of town or unable to pick up your mail for a significant period of time, make special arrangements with the postmaster. As long as you do this in advance, you shouldn't encounter any problems.
Make sure your post office box size can accommodate your mail volume. If you end up receiving large packages or a lot of mail, consider renting a larger box.

, If any of the information on the form you used to get a post office box is outdated (for example, you moved), be sure to update it as soon as possible. You can update it online, or visit your local post office.

, In some cases, you can get a refund for your post office box if you decide that you do not want to rent it anymore. Here's the general schedule:


3-month lease:

No refunds


6-month lease:

Within the first 3 months – half the fee paid
After 3 months – no refunds


12-month lease:

Within the first 3 months – three quarters of the fee paid
Within the first 6 months – half the fee paid
Within the first 9 months – a quarter of the fee paid
After 9 months – no refunds."

Make good notes.,
Note the important concepts.,
Study effectively.,
Do a light run-through.,
If facts aren't sticking, and studying isn't going well, try some memorization strategies.,
Pack up and get some sleep.,
Get a light, balanced breakfast at least an hour before the test.,
Plan a study session.,
Review all your cramming notes or flashcards one more time.,
Identify a particular piece of info which is most important for the test and which you really need to remember.,
Get to the exam room early and visit the bathroom.",How to Cram for a Test," If you have minimal time to study for an exam, having good notes and note-taking skills will be essential for getting the most out of the night before.


Find out what you really need to study. If your teacher holds a review session before the exam, take advantage of the opportunity. You'll find out what topics the teacher thinks are important and you'll have an opportunity to ask questions (although if you're having to cram, you probably have a few too many questions at this point). Many teachers hand out study guides, so be sure to use them. While they probably won't cover everything that will be on the test, you'll at least be able to focus on the key topics.
Get out your lecture notes. Assuming you attended class regularly, you should have some notes to look over. If you don't have any notes, try to get copies from a classmate. Your class notes are a treasure trove of important knowledge because your teacher covers what he or she thinks is most important.;
, As you go through your notes, find important definitions, concepts and equations. If you don't know them by heart, write them down on a separate piece of paper--your cramming notes--or on 3x5 note cards. This will help you identify what you need to know, and you'll have a handy set of flash cards.


The act of rewriting may also help you memorize the content. If you're a good visual learner, then this will definitely help. If you're a good auditory learner, meaning you learn by hearing, recite the words as you write them down on the note cards.
If you have enough time, consider rewriting your note cards several times. It may seem like overkill, but if you're trying to learn facts and information, it's very helpful. If you're trying to learn equations or more practical applications, this repetition is not as useful.

, You obviously won't have time to cover everything that might be on the test, but you can narrow down what will likely be covered and find ways to best focus on these concepts.


Identify key topics. Go through your study guide and your cramming notes and look up the important or most repeated topics in your textbook. Scan the key sections of your text and write down any new information you find that seems important. The idea here is not to write down everything, but rather to identify the specific ideas, facts or equations that are likely to be on the test and focus on those topics as much as possible.
Look at the beginnings and ends of textbook chapters. The first page of a chapter often identifies key points that will aid your understanding of the material. The last couple pages will often summarize the chapter, define or highlight key terms, and, in the case of math texts, list important equations.
Contemplate possible essay questions (if applicable) and how you would answer them. By now you should have at least a light grasp on the material. Think about the overarching concepts involved and outline (preferably on paper) your approach to essay questions.

, This is where the rubber starts meeting the road. Soak up all the information you've furiously assembled, test yourself, and evaluate quickly how you might have done. This should tell you what areas of study you still need to focus on.


Review your flashcards or cramming notes first. Go through the key topics quickly. If you feel you understand and can remember a certain topic or equation, cross it off the list or set that flashcard aside. If you come up with additional questions, look them up in your notes or online (just make sure to use a reliable website).
Test yourself. If your teacher handed out a practice test, do it now. If not, do the practice tests or review questions at the ends of your textbook chapters. Only do the questions that are directly relevant to the concepts you've identified as important. Don't spend a lot of time on each question. If you get stuck on a question, note it and come back to it after you grade your test.
Grade your self-tests. Be honest with your grading. If you're not, you will only hurt yourself when it comes to the actual test. Look at the questions you got wrong and compare those to your cramming notes or flashcards. You may need to make some new flashcards or revisit some of the concepts you thought you knew.

, The brain never forgets. Forgetting a piece of information is either the failure to properly store it, the failure to recall it, or the failure to store it in a way that it can be found.Practice some simple memorization techniques to help you supercharge your last-minute cram session.


Try using a mnemonic device. That's just a fancy word for ""memory device,"" meaning a quick and simple way to remember something. Remember when your teacher taught you ROYGBIV to help remember the sequence of colors in the rainbow? Making something into an acronym, like ""ROYGBIV,"" is a mnemonic device.
Try using ""pegs"" to hang the information on. It could be making the information into a rhyme, relating it to an image you're familiar with, or telling yourself a story about it you know you'll remember. Try to take information that's digested with one sense (words are digested through sight) and try to digest it in another.
Try chunking. This just means organizing something under a category. For example, if you're studying Finance, try to group stocks, bonds, funds, etc. under one big category, securities, and understand what that category means. Organize key ideas under concepts.

, Sometimes, you just don't have enough time for sleep, but do try to get as much sleep as possible before your test. It's a good idea to get the bulk of your cramming in before going to bed and then get up with enough time to review a bit more. If you pull an all nighter, you will be tired and more prone to making careless mistakes on the test.


Studies indicate that loss of sleep erodes memory performance.Not only this, lack of sleep will make last-minute bits of information more difficult to recall. So focus on cramming as much as possible before getting sleepy and go to bed at an early hour.

, Avoid eating only carbohydrates, and instead grab a meal that is high in protein (eggs), omega-3 fatty acids (salmon), fiber (black beans), or fruits and vegetables.


Some ""super foods"" that help increase brain function and longevity include: blueberries, salmon, nuts and seeds, avocados, pomegranate juice, green tea, and dark chocolate.You may consider chomping down on one or two of these as part of your breakfast.

, Study in the car or on the bus with a friend. Get a few friends together the hour before the exam and quiz each other on key concepts. You want the information to be as fresh as possible in your mind. Be sure not to let the study session devolve into social hour.

, Right before the test, go through every one of your flashcards or notes, even if you think you have memorized them. You want everything to be fresh in your mind when you take the test. If you are having some trouble remembering a certain definition or equation, write it down six or seven times in a row. That should firmly imprint it on your brain.

, Make sure you do not take an info longer than three to four words/one formula at a time. Stare at your most important piece of information for at least 1-2 minutes. Concentrate well. Rewrite as the exam approaches to maximize memorization.

, Get to the exam room at least 5 minutes before the test, and make sure to hit the little girls' or boys' room before you settle down into your seat. You don't want to worry about nature's call while you're taking a test. After that, settle down, relax, and be confident. Visualize success.

Exercise.,
Do yoga.,
Play team sports.",How to De Stress During Exam Time2," This is a great way to clear your head and feel refreshed. Getting some fresh air will leave you energized and help you take your mind off your studies and tests. Remember that you’re not necessarily looking to break speed records or build major muscle, but do a light or medium exertion.


Go for a jog.
Do some laps in the pool.
Walk outside. Hardly exercise, but sometimes you just need a break from tedious work.
Dance around your room. It sounds silly, but it’s a great way to use that pent up physical energy while listening to your favorite tunes.

, Yoga is the Indian practice of stretches and poses, as well as controlled breathing and meditation. Traditionally, yoga used for spiritual enlightenment and exercise. Yoga can come off as somewhat intimidating at first, but don’t be afraid to try it. Basic yoga positions are easy to learn and are more or less variations of different types of stretches you might do anyway.


Find a comfortable space to practice. The space should have enough room for you to move around and will ideally be quiet and free of distractions.
Begin by doing some basic arm and leg stretches, followed by a sun salutation.
Follow it up with some basic yoga poses like the down dog, cobra, forward bend, and star pose.
Hold each position for 3-5 deep, mindful breaths.

, Get a handful of friends together and play a game like frisbee, soccer, or pick-up basketball. Besides getting exercise, this is a great way to socialize and meet new friends. The games don't have to be competitive, just an opportunity to get the heart rate up and de-stress.

Meditate.,
Get a massage.,
Take a hot shower or bath.,
Talk with a friend or relative.,
Practice mindful breathing.,
Draw.",How to De Stress During Exam Time3," The practice of meditation focuses on emptying your mind of thought. It’s a great tool for stress relief and isn’t hard to lean. It can be as simple as finding a quiet spot to sit quietly and collect one's thoughts.


Pick a comfortable and relatively quiet, but not necessarily silent, spot to meditate. It can be outside as well.
Do some light stretching and get in a comfortable sitting position.
Close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Don't try to make each breath equal, just be aware of it.
Repeat a mantra, or focus on a mental image like a flower opening and closing in time with your breath.
You can set a timer to know when to finish, or follow an online, timed meditation guide.

, For some people, this is the ultimate way to relieve stress. A professional massage in a peaceful setting can soothe your physical aches, as well as calm your thoughts. Check out local massage places to see if they offer exam time discounts, or general discounts to college students. Alternatively, get together with a few friends and trade massages with each other to save money as well get some human bonding.

, There’s few things more relaxing than having a good soak in the bathtub. Mental stress can be internalized into the body, leading to stiff and sore muscles. Getting squeaky clean will not only give you a break from stressing over finals, but will relax your muscles that may have been stiffened by sitting at a desk all day.

, Sometimes you just need a human connection and some empathy. Meet a friend in person, or call them over the phone or Skype. Tell and listen to stories, laugh, and enjoy some conversation. This should put you in a better mood and energize you.

, Similar to meditation, do a simple breathing exercise in a moment of high stress. One way is to spend ten seconds breathing in, ten seconds holding the breath, and then ten seconds breathing out. Do this cycle several times and you should find yourself a little less stressed than before.

, It doesn't have to be masterful. Doodle some geometric shapes or figures. Make a sketch of the scene directly in front of you. Do a still-life by arranging a few objects and then drawing them. This will help take the focus off your stress, and you'll end up with a piece that you might love!

When you're done the test look it over.,
Do what you love most, any artistic or physical activity.",How to Cope With Test Anxiety," You can always ask your teacher when the test will happen. Knowing this will give you time to prepare and study your notes. You should also ask your teacher what subjects the test will be covering so you know what to study. Though, this step is optional when having a pop quiz.;
, The best thing that you can do is to arrive at the test/exam prepared. Bring everything that you will need (i.e pencils, extra paper, pens, erasers, white out, etc.)

, Something that always causes test anxiety is not studying. Once you arrive at the test, you will realize that you don't remember anything that you have done. Study at least 3 days before the test, but keep in mind that you will likely need to start studying months in advance if you are preparing to take a very large test.

, Remember, look over your notes carefully. You might have missed something that could be on the test. Another fun way is to study with a friend. A friend can always help you memorize your notes. You can also use a highlighter to help you memorize the important facts.

, Having a lot of stress can make you distracted. Every time that you have a test, find something that you like to do before the test to keep you calm. This could be singing, yoga, deep breathing, praying (if you follow a religion), and so on. It will keep you calm and focused.

, Close your eyes and inhale for 4 seconds, hold it for 6 seconds, and then exhale for another 4 seconds. Repeat three times. It will give you more focus and calm you down.

, Don't go into the test thinking that you will fail. Be optimistic.

, When you rush you won't be able to look at the questions carefully, you might even read some questions wrong! Be careful. Put all your effort into it and try your best. For word problems try to show your work. The end result might be wrong but if you show your process you might still get points. It's not always about the right answer.

, You shouldn't rush but remember to watch the clock so you finish it!

, Have you missed something? Made a mistake? Make sure to fix those when you're done.

, Singing or playing an instrument, or even going for a jog! This helps keep your calm and allows you to have some fun while studying."

, The right books are important for this examination.  Make sure that you have opted for the correct study material. Join a coaching institute and ask the faculty about the relevance of the books to the current syllabus and what other resources you can use.

, The GATE syllabus covers all the engineering concepts that you would have covered in three or four years of graduation. Analyse the focus area of the subject as per your specialization.

, Always make short notes at the end of each chapter, which will allow you to revise the information quickly and often. Underline the important details, highlight the key points and maintain a separate notebook or flash cards for key information and formulae.

, Once you cover a topic, check your level to know where you stand using question papers from the previous years and other sample papers. Try to solve these without the guidance of the answer bank

, Enrolling for test series will help you to have a regular check on where you stand. You will be able to discover the areas that you need to focus on more. Register with an institute or purchase online tests, books or practice CDs for best results.

,  Ensure that you complete your syllabus on time. Do this by planning your short term goals and schedule in advance. Stick this schedule on your wall or cupboard to ensure that you stay on track.


Keep reviewing yourself and take notes of any trick that you applied to improve your course and how much did it affect your score.
Even if you have joined coaching classes, make your own plan and discuss with your friends to check if you are on the same track. Never avoid and omit chapters or subjects completely. Make a timetable to accommodate all lessons and studies.

, Give less time to recreational activities like watching TV, surfing the net or weekend partying. Skip these activities until you achieve your goal or at least achieve a major chunk of your short term goals.


Hit the pause button on weekend movies, social networking and chatting. Talk to people to keep yourself updated, rather than to while away your time. Sleeping is important to rejuvenate your body. Both over and under sleeping will have their consequences. Set an alarm and get up on time, start your day early and endeavour to excel every day.

Know the purpose of the 250-word essay.,
Explore something you care about.,
Know that The 250 is “rarely a deal maker or breaker.”The 250-word essay allows the admissions committee at YLS “a window into some small snippet of who you are, carefully and thoughtfully condensed into a few short, but meaningful, paragraphs.”Whatever your topic, never forget the purpose of the essay, which is to showcase your ability to reason and write like a lawyer.

,
Stay under the word limit.,
Proofread your essay.,
Avoid writing about writing a 250-word essay.,
Avoid writing in stream-of-consciousness prose.,
Avoid using The 250 as an Addendum or an essay on why you wish to attend YLS.,
Start strong.,
Omit needless words.,
Use arcs of coherence.",How to Choose a Topic for a Yale Law School Admissions Essay," The YLS admissions committee uses The 250 to evaluate the very important lawyerly skills of writing, editing, and reasoning.Look at this essay as your first exercise as a lawyer. Your task for this essay is to use the very limited word limit you are provided to say something meaningful.The essay is designed to test your ability to say something meaningful as concisely as possible and to prepare you for the real world in which judges (when you are in practice) and law professors (when you are in law school) take word limits very seriously.The purpose of the 250, then, is to test the quintessential legal skills that a lawyer should have, namely being persuasive and concise at the same time., The 250-word essay allows you to write about something that you were not able to in your personal statement. Look at it as an opportunity to explore something important or meaningful to you that you weren't able to address in your personal statement.One potential topic is to write about a policy argument. A policy argument is an argument that advocates adopting a legal rule because of the benefit that it will bestow upon society or rejecting a legal rule because of the harm that it will cause to society.Writing about a particular policy argument that you care about is a great way to showcase your lawyerly writing skills.
An example of a policy argument essay would be to take one side in the two sides of the debate as to whether a psychiatrist has a duty to warn potential victims of a mentally-disabled patient of hers.Policy arguments can come into play from both sides in this case. Potential victims of such patients can argue that public safety requires that the law impose such a duty on the psychiatrist, while the psychiatrist could make the policy argument that imposing such a duty would undermine the psychiatrist-client relationship and would prevent the psychiatrist from providing proper medical care to her patient or client.If you choose this topic for your 250-word essay, choose one side of this or a similar policy debate and persuasively make your case as to why you support the particular side of the debate that you do.
You can also write about something more personal, like a hobby or passion or anecdote. The field from which you can choose your topic for The 250 is wide, and there is no reason not to write about personal anecdotes or hobbies, so long as your essay still demonstrates your ability to write persuasively and reason logically.,, Know that your essay should be 250 words or less. Never go above the word limit but do not write too little either because 250 words is not a significant length for an essay, and by writing too little, you will be missing an opportunity to showcase your writing ability. Stay marginally under the word limit or exactly at 250 but never go over the limit.


Members of the admissions committee will not look kindly upon applicants whose essays exceed the word limit. Ignoring the word limit suggests to them that you did not read the instructions, you do not know how to use the word counter on your computer, or, worse, you are trying to “mock” the faculty who came up with this application requirement.Know that prepositions, definite articles, and indefinite articles all count as words for the purposes of the word limit., Grammatical and typographical errors are common mistakes that YLS applicants make on their 250-word essay. One explanation for this may be that applicants put off writing The 250 until closer to the deadline, thereby leaving themselves little time to edit or proofread the document. Give yourself sufficient time to proofread your essay because avoiding grammatical mistakes and typos is extremely important. The 250 is meant to be a lawyerly exercise and such mistakes make you look like a potential “sloppy lawyer.”Ask a friend or family member to read your essay.Others can often catch mistakes that you might yourself miss.
Note that the spell-checker in your word-processor will not catch such mistakes as writing “untied” instead of “united” and writing “affect” instead of “effect.”, Avoid writing such trivial information as “So I have to write a 250-word essay.  Actually, now I have written 20 words so it's actually a 230-word essay!  Wait, make that a 224-word essay!”A couple of hundred applicants each year are reported to have done this, leaving the admissions committee feeling like the applicant has really not written anything meaningful at all for their 250-word essay., Remember that the essay is testing your writing, editing, and reasoning skills, and that your essay should, therefore, be organized in a coherent fashion. Avoid writing “random facts about yourself” or information that is written in incoherent prose. Make sure to package all that you write in The 250 into a coherent essay in a way that tells the admissions committee that you are adept at writing, editing, and reasoning., Know that the YLS application lets you submit an Addendum,which is meant to be a short statement in which you can explain any aspect of your application that may require explanation (such as a leave of absence or a low grade that was the result of difficult circumstances). Do not write in The 250 what you can cover in an Addendum.


By writing information in your 250-word essay that really belongs in an Addendum (which you are allowed to submit), you are missing the opportunity to showcase your ability to reason, write, and edit, which are skills that the admissions committee is really looking for in The 250.Writing in the 250-word essay about why you wish to attend YLS is also a mistake because the admissions committee members already know a great deal about YLS. Writing about why you want to attend YLS will not give them the chance to assess your writing, reading, and editing ability, all lawyerly skills that The 250 is designed to test., Like any essay, your topic sentence should be engaging and your introduction to the essay should make the reader want to read on. Avoid clichéd opening sentences. As one well-known book on academic legal writing puts it, your opening should make those reading your essay think, “wow, I need to read the rest of this.”Of course, those reading your Yale 250 will probably read your essay regardless of your introduction because they read every single application,but having an introduction that makes them want to read on will make your application stand out from thousands of others.

, This is the advice that a well-respected style manualgives to authors, and it is particularly good advice in the context of the Yale 250. You have only 250 words to work with, which is roughly the equivalent of half a page of single-spaced text using standard font and margin settings. That means that you should try to be as concise as possible. Being concise is also one of the skills that The 250 is testing, so when you are editing your essay, keep this advice in mind: omit needless words.

, One of your goals for the Yale 250 is to write, in a limited space, prose that appears coherent.One way to make your text appear coherent is by using what are known as ‘arcs of coherence’. When one sentence comes after another in a passage, the strings of sentences will appear more coherent and less choppy and disjointed to the reader if she can see a connection between the sentences. Arcs of coherence provide this connection that the reader needs for your prose to make sense to her.E.g. if you see two back to back sentences such as, “Herons live in the northern United States. Herons live in most of Canada,” your reader will need to know what the connection is between these two sentences.You can attempt to make a connection by using words like “and,” “similarly,” and “likewise” to indicate a connection between those two sentences.Making connections in this way will help you meet the all important goal of presenting your Yale 250 as a piece of coherent prose.

In general any new building -- commercial or residential -- is eligible to be certified if it is a permanent structure, meets local building codes, and fits the LEED size requirements.


New Neighborhoods, building upgrades, and complete remodeling projects can all be LEED certified., There are different processes for all types buildings, including neighborhoods, renovations, and homes. Each certification is done by a different set of professionals:



BD+C: Building Design and Construction. This certifies any newly constructed building that meets LEED requirements.

O+M: Operations and Management. Certifies improvements to existing buildings that makes them more efficient or green.

ID+C: Interior Design and Construction. Certifies interior designs as healthy and efficient work spaces.

ND: Neighborhood Development. Certifies neighborhood construction, design, and planning.

Homes: Certifies individual homes as efficient in energy consumption and wast management.

, LEED credits add up to form your building's ""LEED Score,"" and includes everything from solar panels to light pollution reduction. A complete list of potential credits can be found in the LEED Credit Library. As you plan your building, discuss potential LEED credits with your architect and designers to maximize your project's green efficiency. To become certified, you need a minimum of 40 credits.


Several credits, like ""building water metering"" are required to become LEED certified.
Buildings can also reach for higher certifications, such as Silver (50-59 points), Gold, (60-79 points) or Platinum (80+ points) certifications., LEED certified Associate Professionals (APs) are trained to help you plan, design, and build LEED specific projects. They are required to pass rigorous exams and continue their education even after their test. When starting a project, look for the title ""LEED AP"" next to any builder or designer you hire.


Each AP specializes in a specific field related to your project (ie. AP O+Ms are trained to work on improvement projects).

, This process will take several months and requires you to build up LEED credits -- specific projects that contribute to your building's overall efficiency score. To apply:


Create a U.S. Green Business Council account.
Register your building project. If you are certifying multiple buildings at once (for a campus or large project) be sure to apply for ""group"" certification.Provide documentation of LEED credits you apply for.

, While this changes every year, the Green Building Council publishes the deadlines online as well.

, Within 20-25 days you will get a review of you application detailing the credits you will receive and any issues with your project. You will be asked to either accept the review or make any changes to your proposal. If you do not resubmit the proposal will be reviewed again before it is accepted or denied.


If you are denied, you may appeal by adding new credits, documentation, or testimony to your application."

, Exercise often gives you a boost not only in health and energy, but also in confidence and happiness. It is a great way to work through your anxiety and calm yourself after the stress of the test., Tell your friends how you feel. Their understanding and support will go a long way to making you feel better., Ask if there are other ways of improving your grade or resources available to you that you may not know about. Demonstrate that you care about the material and take the time to discuss difficult concepts with your teacher during their office hours. Even if the teacher doesn’t change your test grade, conveying to your teacher that you are invested in the class will leave a good impression., Remember that even if you did terrible on this test, it is only one of several assignments and there are other ways of improving your final grade., A crummy test can motivate you to change your study habits.

Alternatively, some states allow CNA licensure as young as 16, and some high schools offer CNA training programs., A clean record is generally necessary to maintain a career in nursing. At some point you will be screened to make sure you don't have a criminal record, history of drug abuse, or mental health conditions that would impair your ability to do your job. Criminal convictions will show up in a background check so be sure to be upfront about them if asked. Small offenses (traffic tickets, etc.) or criminal violations more than 7 years old may be overlooked when applying for a CNA training program, but keep in mind that they may still be an issue when you are looking for a job later on., While not always an official requirement, a certain level of physical strength is generally required for a career as a CNA. CNAs provide basic care services to patients such as bathing them, transferring them to wheelchairs, and other body intensive tasks.If you are concerned that you will not meet the physical requirements for CNA training, exercise to try building your strength.

, CNA training courses typically last from 4-16 weeks, depending on the institution giving them. Make sure that you have the time to devote to the course, as well as to studying. Keep in mind that training from a health care provider might include a provision that you work at said institution for a period of time after receiving your certification., You can receive your CNA training through long-term care facilities, home health agencies, and certain hospitals. Some health care providers will provide your CNA training with the understanding that you will work for that institution for a set period of time, often with the possibility of extending your tenure. To complete this training, a certain number of class time and hands-on work hours must be completed, varying by state and institution; strict attendance requirements generally apply., The Red Cross offers CNA training courses across the U.S. that last 4-8 weeks and combine lectures, in-class work and hands-on experience. The course aims to prepare students for work in a variety of health care environments and includes a clinical training component once classwork is completed. The structure of Red Cross training courses varies from state to state, given different requirements for hours of study and hours of hands-on training., Trade and vocational schools offer CNA training, the duration of which may be longer than that of other institutions (between 4-12 weeks). This training incorporates classroom and clinical learning, with an emphasis on preparing students for a competitive job market. Completion of these programs varies between institutions based on state requirements., You can access a state-specific application form for the CNA exam online, which is usually 1-2 pages. The form asks for information like name, address, social security number, date of birth, etc. You will also be asked for information about your CNA training program, and will likely have to submit proof of completion of the program.The Arizona state CNA exam, for example, asks for information about the applicant’s training (including the training facility code and completion date, as well as proof of completion), offers a choice of locations at which to complete the exam, and also offers several choices for methods of payment of exam fees: https://www.azbn.gov/Documents/applications/Experior%20CNA%20Exam%20App.pdf


, When applying for your CNA certification, you will have to submit your fingerprint so that a thorough background check can be conducted. In some states, this is a requirement before you can even apply to take the test. The background check will reveal any criminal convictions, however old, so make sure to be honest and consistent when divulging information during the application process., When applying for your CNA certification exam, you will have to pay the appropriate fees involved. These fees include an application fee, examination fee and fingerprint check fee. In most states, you can pay online by credit card if you are also completing your application form online.The fees differ from state to state- for instance:


in Oregon, the fee to apply for the CNA exam is $106.00in Arizona, applicants must pay $50.00 for the exam and an additional $50.00 fingerprint feein Wyoming, applicants must pay a $60.00 fee for the exam and a $60.00 “criminal background check/ fingerprint” fee, The CNA exam will be split between a theoretical, written exam and a hands-on, clinical exam. While it varies from state to state, the written section is generally made up of multiple choice questions that test knowledge, empathy, and good judgement. Study the training materials thoroughly (handouts, textbooks, and practice books) to prepare, and look up practice exams online. , The practical, clinical portion of your exam aims to test your on-the-job skills. You will be asked to treat a patient, or an actor portraying a patient, and evaluated on five skills routinely employed by CNAs (out of dozens of skills that are integral to the position). Be mindful of practicing and thinking about these skills, which may include:


the ability to use and help others use mobility aids such as walkers, crutches, prostheses, etc.
knowledge, tact and compassion in dealing with patients’ particular mental health needs and issues
ability to assist with personal care (e.g. bathing patients)
maintenance of a clean, hygienic environment

, A large part of getting prepared for a big exam like your CNA state exam is to make sure that you’re able to stay calm and composed to perform at your best. In addition to studying thoroughly beforehand, make an effort to think positively about the exam to avoid self-doubt while writing it. To stay sharp and focused, make sure to get sufficient sleep the night before your exam, and eat a nutritious meal before it.

, To ease your exam day nerves, remember that you can retake the exam up to three times within a two-year limit following the completion of your training. You are only required to retake the section of the exam that you didn’t pass (i.e. either the written section or the hands-on skills section). If you fail all three attempts at the exam, you will have to go through CNA training once again to be eligible to retake the exam.While CNA certification is transferable between most states, some states require out-of-state CNAs to pass training and testing all over again in their new location (e.g. North Carolina, where applicants must complete a state-approved training program and take a North Carolina CNA exam)."

Check your total score.,
Check the reading and writing score.,
Check the math score.",How to Check Your PSAT Score2," The total score is the score you get when you add the reading and writing to the math scores. The total score can range between 320 to 1520. This score helps you get an idea of how you would score on the SAT.You can use the percentile of this total score to see how you compare to other students who took the test.

, This is one of the two sections on the PSAT. You get a score that ranges from 160 to 760. Knowing this score can help you determine if reading and writing is your strength or if you need to focus on it before the SAT., The math score is the second of the two sections. The score ranges from 160 to 760. Checking this scores helps you determine if you will do well on the math section of the SAT or if you need some more prep before taking it."

The number is the percent of people you made the same or a higher score than.For example, if your national percentile rating is 92nd percentile, that means you scored the same or higher than 92% of the students who took the test on that day.
You will compare yourself to the national percentile of others in your grade level. If your are younger than a sophomore, you will compare yourself to the sophomore percentile., The PSAT is used as practice for the SAT. The breakdown of the PSAT shows you which questions tested which skills and what specific areas the questions covered. The PSAT uses a green, yellow, red system to let you know your strengths and weaknesses. Your areas of strength are in green. Areas that need work are in yellow and red.This can help you figure out which areas you should focus on as you study for the SAT.
For example, you may learn that you need to focus on vocabulary, algebra, or geometry. You may also learn that you need to go through certain sections faster so you finish.

, The PSAT breakdown allows you to check which questions you got right and wrong. The PSAT test booklet will be returned to you, so you can go over questions you missed and see what the correct answer is.The report will also show you the difficulty level of the questions, along with the specific area it measures.

, The PSAT also gives you a score indicating your college and career readiness based on your PSAT performance. The bar is divided into three colors: red, yellow, and green.Red means you are not ready and need to strengthen your skills. Yellow means you are close to the benchmark but not quite there. Green means you have met or exceeded the benchmark.

Understand what causes exam panic.,
Overcome your panic response with the STOP method.,
Take a breath.,
Observe.,
Proceed.",How to Beat Exam Panic,"  Assuming that you have prepared and revised for the exam that feeling that your mind has gone blank is actually your brain's way of dealing with a life threatening incident like being chased by a sabre toothed tiger. When you panic, the frontal lobes of your brain that are used for critical thinking (and thus for exams) are ""switched off"".This is to allow your amygdala to take over and save you from using the ""fight or flight"" response.When panic strikes, you are actually unable to perform quite simple tasks, such as putting letters in alphabetical order.;
, Start with S. The S in STOP stands for stop, meaning press pause. In an exam, close the paper, then close your eyes. This may sound like madness in the time pressured environment of an exam but a few minutes calming down will make all the difference to your overall performance.

, The T in STOP stands for take a breath. Use the ""Technique of four"". For four breaths, breathe in slowly for a count of 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds and pause for 4 seconds. 


Practise this technique outside of exams. It can be a great way to calm down in any situation or just to take a moment. Practise breathing right down into your stomach to really get the most from each breath.

, The O in STOP stands for observe. Without judgement, just notice how you are feeling. Exam panic is perfectly normal and you are a human being. Notice how the panic is making you feel, in a detached way say to yourself (silently) ""Oh look it's the fight or flight response"". Listen to what the panicky voice is saying; you shouldn't agree with it but acknowledging it can quieten it.

, The P in STOP stands for proceed appropriately. You should be feeling calmer after the first three parts of the STOP process. Open the exam paper and reread the first question. Answer it if you can; if not, read through the rest of the paper and start with something you are fairly confident about. As you calm yourself and reactivate your frontal lobes, you should find that you can answer more and more of the paper. If it is all still gobbledegook, then try the breathing technique again until you feel able to start.

Keep reminding yourself that your hard work will not go to waste.

,
If you are afraid of tough questions, it helps to know that most questions are of average difficulty and designed to be answered correctly by most examinees.

,
Designate a ""study buddy"", a classmate who is an expert in a subject you have trouble in, that you can come to with questions.

,

Get enough sleep.,
Review your notes and flash cards before class.,
Get advice from other students or older siblings.,
Be positive.,
Calm your nerves.",How to Be Prepared for a Pop Quiz1," Sleeping is an essential element in the learning process. Make sure to get your recommended seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Getting adequate sleep will help your brain process the information you learned the day before. Therefore, you will be able to remember the information better., Before class, always review your notes and flashcards. Since pop quizzes are unexpected, this will ensure that you will be prepared for any pop quiz. Review your flashcards with a friend, and focus your attention on the flashcards that you have difficulty with.

, If a classmate or older sibling has had your teacher before, then they are more familiar with your teacher’s tendencies and habits. Ask them about when your teacher is most likely to give out a pop quiz, and how often your teacher gives pop quizzes. Having more insight on your teacher’s teaching style and habits will help you prepare better for their pop quizzes.For example, your teacher might not assign homework the night before if there is a pop quiz the next day. Or, if your teacher keeps reminding everyone during the week that they should be focusing on a certain subject or topic, this could be clue to an upcoming pop quiz.

, Some students get anxiety when they think of pop quizzes. However, if you have prepared yourself by doing your assignments, studying and reviewing your notes, and by making flashcards, there is no need to be anxious. Remember that pop quizzes are meant to help you and your teacher understand which information you need to spend extra time on in order to be prepared for the big test.


Try to think of pop quizzes as fun exercises, and reward yourself afterwards if you do a good job.
Remember that pop quizzes do not make or break your semester grade.

, If you suffer from test anxiety the day of the pop quiz, practice breathing techniques in class. By learning to control your breathing, you can lower your heart rate, and thus calm your nerves and restore your sense of confidence.


Practice breathing techniques by closing your eyes, breathing through your nose, and exhaling through your mouth. Try to do this at least three times. As you are breathing in, visualize that you are breathing in positivity and confidence. Then, as you exhale, visualize that your are releasing negativity, i.e., anxiety, from your system. Your mind should clear, and you should be able to remember how well prepared you are for the pop quiz.
You can also calm your nerves by using your previous quiz experiences to help you predict what will be asked on the pop quiz, and how the questions will be asked.

"
"
Listen for clues.,
Take detailed notes in class.,
Ask questions in class.,
Talk to your teacher.",How to Be Prepared for a Pop Quiz2," If you teacher is prone to giving pop quizzes, they will most likely emphasize points during class that they want you to remember. Pay close attention to the points your teacher emphasizes, and jot them down in your notes. Put a star next to these points to indicate that it is important information, so that you can spend extra time studying to remember the information.If your teacher repeats information more than once throughout class or the week, chances are that it is important information and will be on the pop quiz.
When your teacher is presenting information and they say, “This is very important” or “This might come up again,” this information will most likely be on the pop quiz., During class, take notes on information that is on the syllabus or that was covered in your assignments you did the night before. Also, take notes on ideas or connections that you make in your head while the teacher is presenting. This will enable you to remember the information better.


Write down examples the teacher uses to explain concepts, particularly examples that stand out to you, i.e., examples that created a vivid image in your mind.Develop personal abbreviations that will allow you to take notes quicker. For example, make abbreviations for concepts or ideas that have long names.Paraphrase what your teacher says. You can remember things better if they are in your own words., Always ask questions in class to clarify concepts or ideas that you do not understand. While doing your assignments the night before, come up with a list of questions on the things you have difficulty understanding or that you find interesting. If the information your teacher presents in class still hasn’t cleared up your confusion, ask the question in class.

, Before or after class, talk to your teacher about any study guides they might have that can prepare you for a pop quiz. If they do not have a formal study guide, ask your teacher what they expect you to learn from their class. You can say, “I would like to be well prepared for any future pop quizzes. Today I learned X, Y, and Z during class. Is there anything I am missing? Am I understanding the information correctly?”


You can also ask them about the information that you should pay special attention to when you read the assigned chapters for homework.

Create a study plan.,
Take notes on each chapter.,
Make flash cards.,
Do the practice tests at the end of each chapter.",How to Be Prepared for a Pop Quiz3," Create a study plan by outlining your study goals, and how much time you will spend studying and reviewing each week. It is important that you write your study plan down so that you can stick to it.Identify and write down your study goal. For example, “I want to be prepared for my pop quizzes.” In a planner or on a calendar, set aside how many hours per week you think you will need to be prepared for your pop quiz. Then, find times throughout the week where you can fit in your study hours. For example, one hour after dinner, one hour each Saturday, or one hour before or after work.

, While reading your chapter assignments, take detailed notes. Take notes on information your teacher presented in class. Write out the definitions of new words you encounter. Take notes on concepts and ideas you do not fully understand so you can ask them in class the next day.


When taking notes, follow the chapter order. This will make your notes logical and easier to study., When taking notes, make flash cards of important information so you can review this information easily. Make your flash cards by writing down key concepts and ideas one side, and the answers or explanations on the other side. Try to review your flash cards at least three times a week, or before you sleep.

, To test your knowledge, do the practice tests at the end of each chapter. Spend extra time studying the information that you got wrong. Include the information you missed in your flash cards so you won’t get it wrong on the pop quiz.


If your book doesn’t have practice tests at the end of each chapter, you can make your own practice tests. Make your own practice tests by creating questions based off of your notes. Make these questions open-ended questions where you have to write out the answers. By writing out the answers, you will remember the information better.
Have a friend create a practice test for you. This is a great way to make preparing for pop quizzes fun and effective.

Take your homework seriously and try hard problems, even if you're not sure on them. If you are really having trouble, ask a friend or a parent. Don't stress about your homework though. Don't let yourself go over 40 minutes a night per assignment, don't procrastinate either. Manage your time.;
, If you have a big test or essay coming up, don't spend your time on watching television. Tests are a huge part of your final grade. Spend every free moment looking at the textbook, studying. When you have more free time, do some extra exercises. Make flashcards of words and remember to feel completely prepared when you come into class each day. A good sign is if you know all the questions, you're prepared.

, Make sure they are neat, so you can read them later on. Notes are judged upon in some schools, and if yours are, watch out. Write your name and date at the top of each. Use a nice, sharp, pencil and practice neat handwriting. Write what the teacher writes on the board and what the teacher says is important.

, This way, the next day you will understand more when your teacher explains. Don't really read them, just scan them over, and see what you'll be learning next unless that teacher does not want you to.

, If you don't pay attention it will be almost impossible for you to understand the lesson by yourself. Remember to participate in class as well. This is good for your relationship with your teacher, for your grades and for passing the time.

, If you are confused on something in class, ask the teacher. Teachers love questions, but not too many. Remember not to bug her/him all the time with endless questions. When asking them, be polite, simple, and get to the point. Only ask what you're confused on though, because teachers can tell whether or not you are confused.

, Say you have to complete a map on the names of all the states in the U.S. and their capitals. Do it neatly, add color and you could even cover it with contact paper. Try typing it if you have a bad handwriting and be neat.

, It's disrespectful to the teacher, and if you keep looking, it's going to seem like a longer class. If you feel the need to sneak a look, though, your best bet is to bring a watch.

Right before taking the test, rub on the same scent. Smell is closely linked to memory, and this trick can help you remember what you learned earlier.


Different scents may have additional effects besides reminding you of your studying. One series of studies showed that rosemary improved memory and test performance, while lavender had a negative effect.;
, Music, television, or even traffic noise can make it more difficult to study. If your house is noisy, find a quiet place to study after school. Libraries are a good option. If you can't find a quiet place, listen to some baroque music or even a constant sound source. The constant noise ""numbs"" you to the other noises.

, Your brain needs time to work through the information, and can do this even while you're asleep. 30 minutes each day for a week will give you more time to learn the material than a last-minute cram session.


If you have a question that you can't answer for yourself, write it down to ask your teacher. Make sure you have all your questions answered at least three days before a regular test, and at least two weeks before a major exam.
At the end of each study session, reward yourself for your focus and determination. Treat yourself to a video game session, a bubble bath, or something else you enjoy.

, Reading and listening in the classroom is a good start, but you can go further. Involve other parts of your brain, and you'll learn the material faster:


Write down the important facts to help yourself remember them.
Explain the subject aloud to a friend or family member, or even to a dog or hairbrush. ""Teaching"" the subject this way is a great way to find the gaps in your knowledge, and force yourself to fill them.
Make flash cards with questions on one side and answers on the other. Test yourself with these regularly.

, If you're studying for a math test, a big stack of problems is the best way to learn. Set aside your calculator and do the problems by hand. Keep these tips in mind:


Do all the problems in your textbook that were not assigned for homework. These are often the problems that show up on the test.
If you're learning addition and multiplication, practice these in your head while you're on the bus or waiting in line somewhere.

, In preparing for essays, don't take the time to write out entire papers unless you know the test topic in advance. Instead, outline answers for some of the major themes of the class. Include the thesis statement, introduction, and conclusion, but just write bullet points for the major points in between.

, A short break once in a while will keep you refreshed and focused. Take a 2 minute break every 15 minutes, or a 10 minute break every hour, whichever keeps you most focused.

, The right tools on test day help keep everything running smooth. Stash these in your backpack the day before:


Two sturdy #2 pencils made of real wood. A stressful test will make you push harder while writing, which can break mechanical pencils or other weak pencils.
A pencil sharpener. If you're filling out machine-read bubble forms, keep one pencil to a dull point. This fills in the ovals much faster.
If you like writing in pen, choose a pen that writes freely without leaving ink splotches. Avoid click pens, which can irritate other test takers. Pens with clips can be irritating to hold.
A bottle of water, if allowed in the test room.

, Last-minute cramming never works, no matter how tempting it is. Your brain, muscles, and eyes all need proper rest. You'll have a much harder time at the test if you're exhausted. Eight or nine hours are ideal, but treat 6 hours as an absolute minimum.

, Students who eat breakfast on the day of the test get higher scores on average than students who don't, especially on math tests.Pasta, oatmeal, or whole grain bread will all give you enough energy to get through the test. Round out the meal with vitamins and protein, such as fruits, yogurt, and/or eggs.


Overeating just before the test can make you sleepy or uncomfortable. Stick to an ordinary meal.
Avoid sugary foods, which quickly burn out and cause you to ""crash."" Potatoes can cause this as well in some people.

, These stimulants temporarily make you more alert, but too much can make you jittery, unfocused, or nauseous. Take these only if you are used to them as part of your regular routine, and even then only in moderate quantities.


Caffeine is a diuretic, meaning you might need to pee during the test. Don't take more than a small amount if you aren't allowed bathroom breaks.

, Choose a song that has a special meaning for you, or that make you feel empowered and happy. This can take the edge off nerves and worries.


Although studies disagree, background music probably doesn't have a major effect on test scores.Listen to a song (or think in silence) because it relaxes you, not because you think it's required.

, Five minutes of studying before the test begins can make you more confident. Instead of waiting around getting anxious, take out your flash cards.


If possible, have another student quiz you.
If you're too nervous to concentrate, don't do this. Instead, take deep breaths and stretch your arms and legs.

, Some people find it's best not to study or review the day before the exam (or the week if possible) because the excess information can blur your memory of the content you studied. The best thing to the day before any important exam is to relax and avoid any stressful situations that can produce cortisol in the body. Cortisol makes it more difficult to recall information.


Consider aerobic exercise. It might help relieve stress, make you more alert, and improve circulation before the test.

, If you can choose your own seats, look for one away from classmates that like to distract you or goof off. A seat next to an open window can calm your nerves, assuming the breeze is a comfortable temperature.

, Make sure you know exactly what you need to do before you answer the question.


Multiple choice questions can be especially tricky. Read each option carefully.

, Make a note of skipped questions. It's fine to skip a question if you're not sure how to answer it. Write down the number of that question in a corner of your paper. After you're done answering the questions you know, check your list of skipped questions and try to answer as many as you can.

, For a multiple-choice question, think about each option one by one. Cross out the ones you know are wrong. If there are still two or more possible answers, just guess one. Unless you're told that a wrong answer will lose you points, a guess is better than just leaving the question blank.

, If you feel nervous, sit up tall and take several deep breaths from your stomach. Talk to a calm friend, stretch your arms, or just think about your favorite book or movie. Anything pleasant to occupy your mind will help calm you down.


If you feel giddy or dizzy, grab a pencil and hold it very tightly.

, If you've finished the test and still have time left, check over each of the questions again. You might remember something new, or realize you've made a mistake. If you wrote essays, check them for punctuation and grammar.


Don't second-guess yourself. If you keep switching between two answers and feel yourself panicking, leave it as-is and move on.
If you're stuck on a question, reread other questions on the same topic. Sometimes, another question will give away the answer.

, When taking a test that involves a lot of writing, use these tips to give the type of answer your teacher is looking for:Before you start writing, look at the number of points each question is worth. An essay question worth 10 points should (usually) get a response twice as long as a question worth 5 points.
Read the question carefully. Are you supposed to analyze an argument, or make an argument of your own? Stick to the instructions, and try not to wander off topic.
If a question quotes a historical source, consider what you know about the source. If you know something about the writer's perspective or bias, include it in your response.
After you're done with the test, read over all your writing to check for grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

, Math tests are a source of anxiety for many students. Learn these strategies to improve your chances, especially on word problems:


Start a word problem by finding the question you need to answer. Cross out any information unrelated to that question, then rewrite the problem in your own words.If you're not sure what a word problem is asking, think about the relationships between numbers. Phrases like ""together"" or ""in all"" usually mean the numbers are being added together. The word ""per"" means two numbers are being divided.
For any math problem, check your work after finishing all your problems. One way to do this is to work in reverse, starting with your answer. For example, check a subtraction problem by adding your answer to the second number in the subtraction problem. If your work is correct, you should end up with the first term.

, A science question that you aren't prepared for can be tough to solve. Here are some tips that will let you tackle them anyway:


Read through all the questions first, in full. If you're not confident about some of them, leave them until last.
If a question has incomplete information, make a reasonable guess at filling in the situation yourself. Write ""For this problem, I assumed that..."" at the top of your question.Write chemistry diagrams as clearly as possible. A sloppy diagram can easily derail you halfway through.
When you see an unfamiliar term, try to think of words that sound similar. Many biology and medical terms are built from the same parts. If you know that the ""pulmonary artery"" leads to the lungs, you can guess that another term with ""pulmonary"" is also related to the lungs.

This will help you avoid getting lectured by the instructor for slacking off.;
, If your teacher is outright hinting that there will be a project or seems not to be giving out assignments often, there may be an upcoming large test or quiz.

, If you have any questions, ask the teacher! They'll be impressed by your initiative and wouldn't deny a student knowledge. That's their job. If a teacher is absolutely unavailable, ask a friend who knows what they're doing, or try to email the teacher; it actually works most of the time.

, If you try to do the whole project at once the day it's due, you'll be rushed and tempted to do a worse job just because you want to get it over with. If it's due in over a month, just work a little bit a day on it. If it's due in a week, then maybe set up a time every night to complete a major part of it. Design the schedule in a way that allows time for any activities you can't cancel, like other academic things, and make it so you have at least a bit of downtime-- the other teachers may still be giving you tests, and you have to be able to study. Do your other homework before you start work on the project, unless it's urgent.

, As you go along, make a checklist of things you have done and still need to do. This helps you map out what you are about to complete or what you have completed so far.

, It can be tempting to invite your pals over for a movie night or spend a day at the mall, but afterwards, you're going to feel pretty bad that you didn't work on the assignment. If they're your real friends, when you tell them about your project, they'll understand and give you a break.

, If that is impossible because you must wake early/go to bed late, try to take naps when you can.

, Turn it in the next day with a smile!

Speak loudly and clearly.,
Get into your audience's point of view.,
Have fun with it.",How to Ace Your Class Project," How will you pass your project without anything to show your teacher? Most teachers take off a chunk of points for late projects. Procrastination is one of the worst things that can happen, especially when it comes to projects. Try getting to work on it the day or the day after it is assigned. Even if all you do is type up the title on the computer, that's still progress. Do a little bit each day, and be sure that you don't overwhelm yourself.;
, Planning ahead will keep you more organized and more focused on what you want to do. For example, say it is October 5th and your project on the history of France is due October 26th. This means that you have three solid weeks of work time. Break up your project into a schedule. Make two columns. Write down each day starting from the day the project is assigned to the day the project is due in the left column, and what you plan to accomplish in the right column. Make sure that you're very consistent with this and follow your schedule, otherwise you will be lost and confused.

, If your teacher gives you specific guidelines for your project that you're required to follow, make sure that you do exactly what it says to do. Try not to overlook anything. Your teacher probably wants it in a specific way so it will be easier for him/her to grade it. Nothing says, ""I didn't read the guidelines and I don't really care,"" like a messy project with half of what you need missing. Even if you do not get everything because you couldn't find something, your teacher will likely give you credit for trying, as long as you can show them you did.

, If you fix yourself up a little more than usual the day you give your presentation, you will feel more confident about yourself. Feeling and looking like you just rolled out of bed late on a Monday morning will just add twice as much stress for you. Fix your hair in a different way. Wear your best outfit. Splash on your favorite perfume/cologne. If you be the best you can be, you will feel at your best.

, A lot of people may not like presenting first, but the thing about being first to present means you get to get it over with as soon as possible. Some teachers even give bonus points to students who are brave enough to present first, because they don't have to choose someone themselves. The day you're supposed to present, volunteer to give your project first. You will definitely feel a lot better after it's over. Think about it. Would you rather let everyone else go before you, with the the thought, ""I'm going next! I can't believe I have to present next! I don't want to do this!"" floating around in your head? You will just be putting more pressure on yourself. Don't be afraid. Remember, it's just a project.

, How many times have you watched your classmates presentations and noticed how quietly they spoke and/or how their heads were hung low? You may be able to name a few. Avoid doing this. For one thing, major points will likely be taken off. Second of all, you will give off the impression that you're unprepared, which will likely cause the teacher take off even more points. Stand up straight; keep your shoulders back at all times. This will help you to speak louder. Make sure you speak loud enough so the students in the back can hear you. You don't have to yell. Pretend you've given this project dozens of times already. Also, make sure you don't get too nervous and start speaking too quickly. There's no rush, so relax.

, Get into their head. Use the time you spend watching other people present to your advantage. What do you think of the person you're listening to? Are you paying more attention to them or their project? Most likely, it's the project. The audience likely doesn't care how you're dressed or how many times you're messing up. Do you care how many times a classmate messes up or how they are dressed when they present? Most likely, the answer is no. Most people worry that they're judged when they go up in front of a bunch of people. The truth is is that they're not. Do you judge other people when they present? Hopefully not. Just remember, they're not focused on you. Actually, half of them are most likely just zoning out into their own fantasy land. Their eyes are on the project 90% of the time and on you 10% of the time.

, Your project doesn't have to be boring. Get animated and really get into your project. Throw in a joke or two if it's appropriate for your topic. Add in some interesting facts to keep your class (and your teacher) interested. Your teacher will be impressed and you will earn more points.

, Who asked your best friend out won't help you on your test, so spend your time studying, not texting.

, Studying is so boring, drop the books and find a fun website for studying. If you can't at least crank up some tunes, don't make this music distracting though! Try listening to French or instrumental music to help you focus and have fun. Another great thing to listen to while studying is rain storm and thunder sounds. It is actually really very calming and helps you think.

, You have the rest of your life, so two hours aren't anything compared to that. Find a quiet place to study. Don't study in front of the TV or near where your sibling is practicing her flute etc.

, Write down some things that seem important but DON'T use these during the test: it's cheating. Only write the important information, like dates, names, formulae, or things you might easily forget. Extra details distract your brain.

, Try not to watch TV or check your e-mail because it will distract your brain and get you sidetracked.

Report abuse.",How to Avoid Being Punished with Bad Grades," If you got a bad grade on a test or on your report card, be upfront about the problem right away. This can help you avoid punishment. Your parents want you to be successful in school. If you tell them that you're honestly struggling, they'll be more likely to want to look for a solution than try to punish you.You may know your parents will find out about your grades soon. You may be getting a progress report, for example, or parent-teacher conferences may be coming up. If this is the case, give your parents a warning ahead of time. Say something like, ""Mom, Dad, I wanted to be honest with you. I'm really struggling in algebra and my semester grade isn't what it should be.""
When telling your parents about your grades, pick a good time to talk. Choose a time when your parents are free and there are no external time constraints. A Wednesday night when everyone's done with work and school, for example, is a great time to bring up the issue of your grades.Honesty is the best policy here. Tell your parents that you're struggling in a certain subject. If you know your exact grade, tell them. Do not try to obscure the truth. For example, if you're getting a D in chemistry, do not say, ""My chemistry grade is kind of on the low side."" Instead, say something like, ""I'm getting a D in chemistry and I thought I should let you know."";
, If you got a poor grade, there may be a reason for this. It may be that you were legitimately struggling, in which case your parents are unlikely to respond with punishment. However, even if your poor grade was due to irresponsibility on your part, confessing to your negligence may help evade punishment. The point of punishment is to teach responsibility. If you already understand your mistake, and want to do better, your parents may not feel the need to punish you.


If you're genuinely struggling, say so. Also, highlight how you did genuinely try in a course. For example, you may simply not be doing well in algebra. Point out how often you study and how you always do your homework. Your parents will see you're trying, and may respond by trying to get you a tutor rather than punishing you.
If you slipped up, however, admit it outright. Ultimately, your parents want to see you learn from your mistakes so you do not repeat them. If your D on a test is because you stayed up too late playing video games, admit this and promise to do better in the future. If you've already learned your lesson, your parents may not feel the need to punish you., If you're already willing to make the effort to change, your parents will be less likely to punish you. Offer to talk to your teacher in order to prevent your grades from slipping further. Remember, you want to make your parents feel like punishment would not be helpful at this point. Promising to speak to your teacher shows that you're handling the situation with maturity and already taking steps to change. It would be unnecessary to put more pressure on you at this point., The more maturity you show, the better. If you go into a conversation angry, expecting your parents to be mad, you're creating a problem. However, if you go into a conversation eager to find a solution, you'll be able to smooth things over and evade punishment. Your parents are invested in seeing you succeed. Ask them to help you work on your grades.Be as mature about things as you can. A little flattery can also help. For example, say something like, ""I know I screwed up, and you and Mom raised me better. You guys are super responsible. Maybe you can teach me how to do better.""
Offer to go along with whatever your parents want in the future. For example, your parents may request that you show them your homework when you finish it. They also may want to meet with your teacher regularly. While these regulations may feel stressful or embarrassing, go along with them. If you're cooperative about fixing the problem, you'll avoid getting punished.

, It's normal for your parents to be upset or frustrated over a bad report card. However, an extreme response can constitute abuse. If you're in an abusive situation at home, it's important you recognize abuse so you can seek help.


Physical abuse involves a parent beating, kicking, hitting, or otherwise hurting you. Your parents may feel physical abuse is a normal or appropriate response to what they perceive as bad behavior. They may believe in a ""tough love"" route to discipline. Understand that physical violence is never okay. It is not normal and it is not something all parents do. If you are being physically harmed, this constitutes abuse.Abuse can also be verbal or emotional. All parents lose their tempter at some point, and may yell on occasion if frustrated. However, if yelling becomes very loud, and is coupled by foul language, name calling, or threats, this is emotional abuse. Your parent, for example, may threaten to kick you out or abandon you when you present a poor report card. Emotional abuse is not normal and can be very damaging to your self-image., After confessing about your bad grades, make an effort to show how responsible you are. If your parents see you're taking the setback as an incentive to change, they'll be less likely to respond with punishment.


Start keeping your parents up-to-date on your grades. Show them your graded assignments, tests, and quizzes. If you get regular progress reports, show these reports to your parents without prompting.Keep your parents up-to-date on the progress you've made. Do not just say you'll talk to your teacher. Actually talk to him or her and, after the conversation has occurred, report back to your parents. Tell them what your teacher said and any suggestion he or she gave for improvement.

, You can avoid punishment by being willing to work on the problem with your parents mutually. Together, talk about ways you can work on bringing your grades up to standard.


A lot of your plan depends on why your grades were low. If you were genuinely struggling, a tutor may help. You also may want to ask your teacher for help on an assignment.
If you slipped up due to irresponsibility, you can take steps to be a better student. Promise your parents you'll always do your homework after school. Set a bedtime for yourself and stick to it. Write down assignments ahead of time so you do not forget them.

, There are many reasons your grades may have slipped. If you are having personal problems that are affecting your grades, let your parents know. They will want to help you get through difficult times and want to offer you suggestions on how to fix any issues affecting your studies.


Depression is a common problem in teenagers that can affect grades. If you've been feeling low lately, suffering mood swings, are having thoughts of death or suicide, and have lost interest in certain activities, you may be experiencing depression. Talking to a therapist to address the issue can help. Let your parents know if you're worried you may be depressed.Attention Deficit Disorder can also cause a slip in your grades. ADD is marked by irritability, an inability to concentrate, and poor decision-making skills. If you think you may have ADD, talk to your parents about getting diagnosed so you can get the treatment you need to get back on track in school.If you're having any personal problems, such as getting bullied in school, you should also let your parents know about this. This can also affect study habits.

, If you're in an abusive situation, it can be very difficult to talk through things with your parents. Your parents may be unwilling to listen or compromise. In this case, seek help from another adult.


A trusted adult can be another relative, like a grandparent, aunt, or uncle. You can also talk to your family doctor, if you get the opportunity to speak to the doctor alone. A teacher or guidance counselor at your school can also help.In the event you cannot think of anyone to talk to yourself, you can contact Childhelp. This is a non-profit agency dedicated to helping children in abusive situations. You can call at 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453). If you're not comfortable calling in your home, you can ask to use a friend's phone or even try to find a pay phone., Once you and your parents have worked things out, try to do better moving forward. You can prevent getting punished for bad grades by keeping your grades reasonably high. To do so, work on bettering your study habits.


Improve your organizational skills. Use a weekly planner or calendar to keep track of upcoming tests and quizzes. Try to have different binders or folders for notes for your various classes.Study in a location free of distractions, like a coffee shop or library. Turn off your cellphone and other electronics before studying. Bring all the materials you need with you when you go to study.Study in short intervals. Trying to cram too much in one session can be daunting. Study in 40 to 50 minute blocks, taking 5 to 10 minute breaks in-between.

, You should also strive to keep up with your homework, as homework assignments go towards your overall grade. Try to do your homework after school each day, before you engage in any fun activities like seeing friends or playing video games. You should also be upfront with your parents about your homework, letting them know what is due and when.


You can also write down homework assignments in your calendar or planner to make sure you remember to do them on time.

, Transparency is important to evade punishment. If your parents are concerned about your grades, they will want to keep track of your progress. Talk to your teacher about getting regular progress reports detailing how you're doing in a particular class. You can bring these home to your parents to show them evidence that you're working on keeping your grades up.

, Abuse needs to be reported. Hopefully, you'll have recruited the help of a trusted adult who can help you alert the authorities of the situation. You may have to report what's been happening to a police officer, therapist, or another authority figure. It can be emotionally devastating to report abuse, but it's worth it for your own health and well-being.How things will unfold after abuse is reported depends on your situation. You may be temporarily placed in a foster home or have to stay with relatives. Your parents may be required to attend counseling to work through certain issues.
The experience of reporting abuse is very stressful. However, remember that abusive situations are not sustainable longterm. It's necessary for you and your parents to get professional help in the event abuse is occurring."

Manage your stress.",How to Take an AP Class Without Crashing," In order to achieve your daily study goals, you have to push through feelings of apathy, failure, irritation, and other negative emotions. You also can’t give up every time you make a bad grade or don’t understand something.


Surround yourself with peers who will encourage you through every setback.
Don’t get discouraged if you find it difficult to adjust to taking an AP course at the beginning of the school year. It takes time to learn good study skills.
Rewarding yourself is very important for persevering. It creates a positive response in your brain, making you to want to repeat your actions.Some keys to persevering in order to reach your goals include staying optimistic and taking breaks.;
, One of the most tried-and-true ways of succeeding in any class is taking good notes. In an AP class, notes are your key to passing the AP exam at the end of the course because your teacher will reveal key concepts along the way.


Some things you can do to take good notes are start a new page for each new day, write down important ideas instead of whole sentences, and listen for verbal cues to important information.Learning how to take notes gets easier and easier over time. By the time you finish this AP course, you'll be way better at note taking than those who don't take AP classes.

, For AP students, the highlights, or most important points that a teacher explains in class, are bound to be on the AP exam. Review your notes each week and write down these highlights on index cards. This way you can quickly reference your notes instead of flipping back and forth through a notebook.These highlights are useful not only for the AP exam, but for tests throughout the course.

, One of the best ways to stay on track with your studies is to join a group of people doing the same thing. Study groups allow you to verbalize your notes so that you make sure you understand everything the class is teaching.Study groups also allow you to teach others what you’ve learned, further reinforcing the information for both of you.
If there isn't a study group yet, start your own. Talk to a few classmates to see if they are interested, agree on a meeting place and time, and get started. You should make a goal for each study group session just like you make a goal for each study session you do by yourself.

, If you want to make sure you study each week, you need to follow a schedule. If you don’t develop a study routine, you risk losing focus and negatively impacting your performance in the course.Resist the temptation to watch TV or play video games during your study times by promising to reward yourself with these activities after studying is over.
The amount of time you should study for each AP course differs from course to course. Some are more demanding than others. You should end up spending anywhere from one hour to 8 hours a week on one AP course.

, When you take an AP class, it means there are other students in your school who aren’t taking one. These students probably have more time for leisure, and they might invite you to come along. Taking breaks is fine, but if someone invites you to an activity that interferes with a scheduled study session or study group, you should turn it down.


The last quarter of an AP class is the most intense because this is right before the AP exam. If you want to pass the exam, consider avoiding field trips in other classes in order to stay focused., Just flipping through notes or the textbook, or even the AP book, is not effective. Set a goal for each study time in order to get the most out of your homework.For example, a goal could be to memorize a certain number of vocabulary words, or read a certain number of pages in the textbook.

, If you find yourself dreading a study session, tell yourself that you will get the hardest part out of the way first. This is also helpful because these tasks take the most brain power and focus, and your energy is highest at the beginning of a study session.This will positively impact your performance in the class overall.

, Look over your notes on weekends. Doing this on Sunday evening refreshes your memory right before returning to class so that your brain is in the game right away. You’re not having to recall last week's information while the teacher is starting a new lecture., These books usually contain practice tests and lessons on the subject of each type of AP course.These books can be assigned by your teacher or you can pick them up on your own, but they will help you know exactly what to expect on the AP exam, giving you peace of mind.


There are many different publishers of AP books, so do some research to find the most reputable publishers. (for example, Kaplan, The Princeton Review, etc.)

, Taking practice exams in the book is essential for getting you ready to take the AP exam, but you can also take practice exams online.This online access is useful if you aren’t able to obtain a book, and offers you more exams and more exam versions than a book contains.

, Multiple choice is a big part of the AP exam, but practicing the free response sections is very important for learning how to write in such a way that it shows mastery of the material.


Some teachers suggest you answer at least 3 practice free response questions in the last quarter the course to help you get ready for the AP exam., Make sure that you keep up with attendance at study groups. Studying on your own is of course essential, but being able to share the experience of intense study with others in the same boat helps you feel less alone and less nervous about taking the AP exam.


You can practice things like flashcards for terms and get others to grade your free response questions at a study group.

, In order to fully comprehend the subject in an AP class—and pass the class as well as the AP exam—it means you must read the full material, not Cliffs Notes or other summaries found in books and online.


The only way for your to produce free response answers that sound like you know what you are talking about is to actually know every part of the material. You can’t do this unless you read it.
You should keep in mind that AP courses require a lot of reading before you sign up for one. This prevents you from wanting to quit or being tempted to cut corners by reading summaries instead.

, You may be tempted to get worked up about the AP exam, but practicing good study habits throughout the year will ensure that you do well on it.


Do things to get rid of text anxiety like relaxation techniques, ignoring negative self speech, not cramming the night before the exam, and practicing for the exam.Staying ahead of test anxiety will ensure that you don't crash the AP course.

, You will encounter other students in your AP courses who make higher scores and rub it in your face. Instead of getting angry and irritated at these competitive students, use your irritation to make you a better student.


You might be tempted to give up on the class when you see how much better other students do, but instead let that push you to study harder and take better practice tests.

, Sometimes teachers know of people in your school who can tutor you, whether fellow students, other teachers, or even the teacher himself. If they don’t know anyone who has the ability and time to tutor you, they can recommend paid tutoring off campus at tutoring centers.


AP tutoring isn’t just available in live settings. You can now find a lot of AP tutors on the internet through tutoring websites like Tutor.com., In the world of AP classes, tutoring is more than just for students who are struggling. Tutoring, like study groups, is a key for succeeding in AP classes and is a good general study practice.

, Often other classmates will have their own tutors and can give you a reference to a good tutor. In some cases, fellow students may even be able to tutor you themselves. Just ask around in your class to find out where the best tutoring is happening.

, Even if you find a tutor and you’re a part of a study group, having a study buddy is a good way to stay strong through an AP course. Study buddies can help each other stay focused and exchange notes.Choosing a good high school study buddy for an AP course will help you find one in college.

, A great way to get an idea of what the AP exam will be like, and to get tips for not failing the AP course itself, is to talk to students who have taken both before. Someone who has recently had the same teacher as you can give you pointers for understanding their teaching style.


A previous test taker can tell you about their test-taking experience so that you aren’t as nervous about what the experience will be like.

, At home, you can get your family to help you study by being quiet during your designated study times. But you can also ask them to do any number of study tasks that don’t require knowledge of the subject matter to help you study.


You can use your family members to help you memorize flashcards.
You can ask family members to time your practice tests.

, If your AP classes are becoming overwhelming, seek help for dealing with stress. There are many ways to reduce academic stress, so employ one of these tactics before you get too far behind or the stress becomes too much for you to handle.


Managing stress will keep you from crashing the course.
Look for signs of stress like a lack of appetite, always feeling tired, and increased irritability.If you recognize signs of stress in yourself (or someone who knows you comments on it), take some action to prevent the stress from getting out of hand. Try taking breaks to treat yourself, not comparing yourself to your classmates, and exercising."
"
Ask yourself challenging questions.,
Restate material in your own words.,
Break your study sessions up.,
Switch off between the difficult subject and other subjects.,
Change locations.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Leave time to revisit your work.",How to Ace Your Worst School Subject1," Struggling to retrieve information, even if you think you don’t know the answer, actually helps you to develop your power of recall.When reading a textbook, turn first to the questions as the end of the chapter and try to answer them. Then, answer them again to yourself as you are reading. A few days later, return to the questions one more time to test your recollection of the material.
Before searching for an answer on the internet, pause and try to generate an answer for yourself.
When you sit down to study, ask yourself: what have we learned about this week? What are the big ideas that I’m supposed to learn? Refresh your mind before you even open a book or notebook.;
, Translating what you've learned into your own words is a useful test of whether you're absorbing the material. And, it helps to cement it in your mind.After you’ve done a section of reading or listened to a lecture, put it aside. Take out a clean sheet of paper and write down the main points of what you’ve learned. Don’t look back at the original: the idea is to solidify your own understanding.
You can practice this while reading complicated text. Pause every page or so, and try to restate the gist in your mind. If you can’t do it, it means you’re not absorbing anything while you read!

, Don’t try to cram for ten hours straight: instead, do one or two hours every day. Test your memory briefly at the end of each session by asking yourself what you’ve just learned or running through test questions or flashcards.

, This is called “interweaving”: you study one subject for a couple of hours, then turn to an entirely different subject.It might feel more challenging in the moment, as if you’re starting from square one each time you pick up the next subject. In the long run, though, you will absorb much more information.

, Study in a library one day, and a café the next. Learning the same material in different locations helps to anchor it more firmly in your mind., Do the practice problems at the end of the textbook chapter, even if they’re not assigned. Whereas homework problems can look overwhelming, working your way through drill problems can build familiarity and confidence: this is called practicing in a low-stakes environment.Check your answers to get immediate feedback.

, Aim to finish essays or problem sets ahead of time, and then go over them again the next day with fresh eyes.


If you struggle with writing, try reading your work out loud. Listen to yourself: do your words make sense? Reading an essay backwards can reveal typos."
"
Follow the assignments carefully.,
Study with friends.Sometimes, you may overestimate how easy everyone else finds a particular class or subject.,
Explain the material to someone who isn’t in your class.,
Seek out different ways of absorbing material.,
Get to know your teacher.Visit office hours and ask questions.,
Find out if you have a learning disability.",How to Ace Your Worst School Subject2," Most courses are designed to guide you, step by step, through a subject. If you have a syllabus, read it closely and try to follow its directions and suggestions. In other classes, pay attention to the calendar of assignments. Otherwise, you might find yourself trying to tackle an impossible task at the end of the term.


Don’t skip class.In class, focus on understanding what’s being said rather than writing every word down in your notes.
Don’t try to multitask in class. Close any distractions such as e-mail or social media. This kind of multitasking undermines your learning.Attend any extra test-preparation or study sessions offered.
Complete all the assignments in order and on time. Take on suggested reading or supplementary problems if possible.

, Studying with friends can offer moral support. In addition, you may understand a particular concept better if you hear someone else explain it.


Talk with your study group about what confuses you. Articulating the problem is frequently the first step to solving it.
Choose a study group that suits you. You want a group where you can learn, but not feel overwhelmed or intimidated.
Be especially careful not to rely too heavily on friends who find the subject easy. In the end, you will need to learn the material thoroughly for yourself.

, Talk to a roommate, a friend, or a sibling, and try to teach them the subject to the best of your ability.


Grab a whiteboard or large piece of paper so that you can sketch out concepts.

, Learning the same material through different modes can increase retention.If a particular style of learning appeals to you, make studying more pleasant by finding multiple ways to learn through that style.


If you learn well by listening to someone explain something, try looking up online lectures or demonstrations on the topics that confuse you.
Go to the library and check out another textbook on the topic. Does this one explain it in a way that is easier to understand?
If there are multiple sections or recitations for the class, check them all out. Some teachers will be a better fit for you than others.
Is there a movie or novel that relates to your difficult subject? Set aside some time for it. A dry history textbook might be more engaging after you’ve watched a movie set in the same time and place, for example.

, Don’t be afraid: your teacher wants to help you understand. Be prepared to explain what you’ve done to figure out the answers on your own, and where you got stuck: this will help your teacher to see that you’re trying hard and it might help them to understand what’s causing you trouble.

, Do you find it difficult in general to read, or to remember, or to follow directions or stay organized? It might not just be the one subject: it’s possible you have a learning disability.Talk to a teacher or a guidance counselor. With appropriate support, people with learning disabilities can be highly successful in academics.

Get enough rest.,
Take breaks in your work to allow for recovery and flashes of insight.,
Manage distractions.,
Try different things.,
Don’t let the subject intimidate you.,
Reward your hard work and recognize your achievements.",How to Ace Your Worst School Subject3," Few teenagers get the nine hours of sleep per night recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.But fatigue dramatically hinders brain function. It’s far better to get a good night’s sleep than to go through those flash cards one more time.

, When you’ve been working on a difficult problem and feel stuck, take break. Go for a walk, make soup, or do some yoga. Your brain may be puzzling out the problem in the background, allowing for a flash of insight that will move you forward., Don’t let your struggle with the subject lead you into endless procrastination.


Set a timer for twenty or thirty minutes. Work steadily for that time and then allow yourself five minutes to relax and recover. Repeat.Turn off the internet, if possible, while working on your computer in order to focus on the task at hand.
Close your computer altogether and try working on the subject with pen and paper, away from any digital devices.

, No matter what anyone says, there’s no one, single way to learn a subject. Play around with different study techniques, different ways of taking notes, and different approaches to solving problems. The goal is not only to learn the subject, but to become a better, more effective student overall.


For example, notice how you respond to different noise levels. Some people work best in quiet, while others prefer the hum of activity around them., When you’ve struggled with a subject for a while, it’s easy to feel discouraged. Try to cultivate a sense of curiosity instead.


Confusion is a sign of “beginner’s mind,” which is a state that can lead to profound insights and learning. It’s not always comfortable, but it’s a necessary part of creativity.Learn more about the subject in other contexts. Read newspaper articles about how the subject is applied in the larger world. Ask your teacher why they are passionate about the topic. Seeing real-life applications might help kindle your interest in the subject.

, Plan small treats for yourself along the way. Once you finish a difficult reading, for example, eat something tasty or go outside and play a game. At the end of the semester, throw yourself a party! People who reward themselves actually gain in self-control."

Pick the AP classes right for you.,
Make sure you get all the summer assignments and textbooks before the end of the year.,
Don't procrastinate on your summer homework!,
Consider buying a prep book for your AP classes.,
Be mentally prepared and organized before the year begins.",How to Take Multiple AP Classes (and Do Well in Them!)1," Don't take a bunch of AP classes in subjects you really hate, or ones you really struggle in. You can pick one that really challenges you, but make sure then that the other classes (including electives and non-AP's) are manageable. If you're good at math and science, but not foreign language or English, take a math and/or science, and just one in a subject that's harder for you.;
, Most AP classes have summer homework because there's so much more content to cover in a year than other high school classes.


Summer homework is also great to brush up on content that you might have learned in an early prerequisite class. For example, most people take Chemistry I before AP Chemistry, so it's good to have a solid foundation on what you've already learned before diving into harder stuff.
Don't be overwhelmed by the summer homework! It might look like a lot, but if you have a good AP teacher than the homework is very helpful and necessary.

, You may also have some summer reading and a bit of other work to do, as well as having fun (it's summer of course!), but you don't want to be cramming everything a week before the school year starts.


Review what work you have to do before the school year ends and plan out when you will do it and how long you think it will take. Once you break it down, it will probably look less intimidating.
Mix up work and play. If you're going to lunch and then the beach one day, commit to reading one chapter in the morning before you leave. Spreading work out like this will make your summer actually feel like summer, not homeschool.

, While it does not replace your textbook, they are helpful for last minute reviewing, practicing multiple choice questions, and getting an idea on how the course is organized.


Barron's, Kaplan, and Princeton Review are a few of the most popular prep books, but some books are better for some subjects than others. Ask around to see which ones may be the best for you and the subjects you're taking.

, Get all the supplies, including flashcards, lots of loose-leaf paper, and post-it notes. Go shopping for new clothes and try to get excited for a new challenge! Remember that it's only high school, that you can drop a class if you find it to be too much, and to not stress out too much about being a straight-A student. If this is your first time taking APs, or taking multiple, realize there will be an adjustment period, but be ready to adjust quickly!


Don't forget to enjoy your summer! Don't just work, work, work all summer or else you'll get burned out.

Get better time management skills quickly.,
Be flexible with your study techniques.,
Avoid cramming.,
Use your weekends efficiently as well.,
Try creating a study group, but pick your study buddies wisely.,
Be efficient while doing homework.",How to Take Multiple AP Classes (and Do Well in Them!)2," If you procrastinate a lot, have a very short attention span, start small. Set a timer for 10 minutes with a 5 minute break and spend it with completely undivided attention to your work.

, If you're studying for a test and don't do as well as you hoped, don't hesitate to try studying for a different angle!


Remember to study smart (and hard, but especially smart). With so many hard classes, you have to be efficient with your time and that means making every minute as productive as possible.
Create flashcards to review on the bus, during a free period, etc. It doesn't seem like much, but reinforcing info (especially for classes that require memorizing) is important to learning so much in a quick amount of time.

, While it can work for some people, at least if they pay attention in class, it doesn't keep the information in your head. It's only temporary knowledge, and this is bad in AP classes where the information is often cumulative. If you cram for multiple AP classes, by the time AP exams come you'll be rushing to learn everything all over again because you remember nothing.


Don't pull all nighters either. If all you do is go to school and come home, then maybe you can get away with it for awhile. But if you're dedicated to other activities, especially sports and active things, you'll really drain yourself. A rare all nighter is understandable, but several times a week is inexcusable.

, The weekend is a great time to relax and actually have a social life, but you need to use this time to get some work done if you don't want to be rushing the whole week.


Allow yourself to hang out with friends every other weekend (if you have other activities during the week that take up your time).
Use the time during your extra curricular activities to be with friends, like in clubs and sports. There is a lot of socializing in these activities, even if it's not going to movies or the beach.

, If you get distracted easily, just pick one study buddy. Make sure this is someone you enjoy being with, but can also focus and get stuff done with. Also make sure that you're all around the same level so that they can teach you something and vice versa. You don't want a study group where you learn nothing.


Study groups are also helpful for reinforcing things you've already studied. For example, asking and answering questions to review for an upcoming test is more interesting than just shuffling flashcards.

, AP homework can take 2 hours to finish, and even longer if you're not focusing on it the whole time.


Vocabulary homework: It helps to use two sources; your textbook, and Quizlet. This is especially true in history classes. Try putting the definition in your own words, because the textbook definition can be long sometimes. For some words, you can put more information so that your definitions don't all look short and copied. For others, use Quizlet because the definitions are usually shorter and more to the point (but put them in your own words!).
Short answers homework: It helps if you've already read the chapter/taken notes. Go to the page(s) that are related to the question and basically jot it all down (better to type). Once you dump all the information you can reorganize the sentences and words to sound better.
Math/word problems: Try to see what formulas relate to what information the question gives you. Break the work down so that you don't make mistakes. You can't rush math as well, and doing so may lead to a lower grade and more wasted time trying to fix your mistakes. You can go over your answers that morning or before class starts if you don't have time at home.
Essays: Decide what you'll talk about in each paragraph and look in your textbook for information that relates to each. Type down all the information. You can spread this out to a chapter a day if that's more convenient. Then go back and make the sentences and words flow better, adding transitions and good vocabulary. Make it concise! Go back into your textbook and double check whether you've missed anything. Get it revised if your teacher takes rough drafts.

Start early.,
Fill out of the form and hand in the money in time.,
Really start using your prep books now!,
Sleep well the night before the exam.,
Eat a good breakfast that morning, and don't study.,
Go in with a clear mind and the mindset that you've worked hard and are ready for this.",How to Take Multiple AP Classes (and Do Well in Them!)3," College Board (the company that controls everything AP) usually releases the AP schedule well ahead of time, around February/March, so go on the website and see which exams are first for you and start with those.


You could cram, at least for one class, for about two weeks, but this will lead to stress and may not be possible if you have stuff to do outside of school. It's much better to spread it out and do a little bit of review every day for a couple of months.
If you've been struggling with a class all year, start studying for that first. Spread it out to an hour, or even half an hour a day.

, This is usually due around late March. Tell your parents ahead of time (if they're paying) because AP exams cost a pretty penny--around $90. And with multiple, you could be paying $300 just to take a test! Remember though that this is better than better $1,000 for one class in one semester, which you would be doing in college.


The price should also motivate you to study harder for the exam. If you don't score high enough, all this work (and money!) won't count as any credit. Even if you took the class just for a challenge, it's pretty upsetting if you don't get some tangible credit for it.

, If you spread out your studying well, you can go over a section a day in the prep book, take the multiple choice, and then review it and what you got wrong the next day.


It's very important to not just practice multiple choice/free response, but go over what you did wrong and why. If you know why, there's a much lower chance you won't get the answer wrong again, and that's what practice is all about.
Take at least one practice exam before the actual one. Time goes by quickly taking the exam, and you'd be surprised how hard it is to cram in 70 questions into 50 minutes for some exams (that's less than a minute per question). You will also feel more prepared once you sit down on exam day, and that will calm your nerves.

, If you have to still study because of procrastination, don't study for more than an hour. Otherwise, you can flip through some pages on things that you're rougher on, eat a good dinner, shower, lay out your clothes (even if you usually don't), and go to bed early. 8:00 PM is the best time, but it can be 9:00 if it has to be.

, Don't look over your notes, don't flip through the prep book. Just wake up at a good time, get ready, eat something with protein, fiber, fruit, and juice or water. Also carry water with you to school. You're not allowed to drink during the exam, but you can drink before, afterwards, and between sections.


Consider wearing a watch so you can keep track of how well you're doing time-wise.

,


Pat yourself on the back for a good year and how well you conquered a new challenge. Then look forward to a nice, relaxing summer!

Vocabulary is a large part of your grade, so pay attention to that.,
Take notes on everything.,
Cherish the lab work.,
Do not procrastinate.",How to Survive AP Biology As a Freshman," You are a freshman taking a college level course almost five years sooner than need be. You may not have even had a general Biology class yet. Don't waltz into class thinking this will be easy, because it won't.;
, This is key. Being determined is a large part of being successful in AP Biology. You must be willing to do well and try your best. Always give 100%.

, One thing that can help is going over topics during the summer, before school starts. See if your school will let you check out an AP Biology textbook for the summer, or check out your local library for textbooks. You may want to look into Chemistry a bit as well, just to be prepared. Studying beforehand will help you avoid feeling out of the loop.

, If you miss class, then there could be important things discussed that you miss. Be punctual and try to attend school every day, unless it is for a medical appointment, family emergency, or you are sick. If you miss a lot of school days, it is hard to catch up in any class, especially an AP.

, It honestly does matter. If you're goofing off and talking the whole period on your first day, your teacher will tell that you aren't focused and motivated to do your best. Your behavior has a direct correlation with your grade, and being respectful, on time, etc. could help you move from an 88% to a 90%.

, Don't just sit there like a bump on a log; participate. Answer questions, even if you think you are wrong.

, It's as simple as that. Missing assignments or low points can really make a difference with your grade. Plus, doing your work is the only way to learn and be prepared.

, The unit tests are not a breeze, so be as prepared as you can be. Start getting ready at least a few days before. Pace yourself, and try not to cram. Avoid mindlessly memorizing notes and general ideas, so instead try to grasp large concepts and connect them to your pre-existing knowledge of the topic(s).

, Quizzes may be given in your class over vocabulary, and those points you score in these really rack up. If you don't have vocabulary tests/quizzes, then study all the terms anyway; it'll most likely appear in your AP exam.

, Whenever you read a chapter, be sure to take notes on the important things. Taking notes on lectures, labs, and any additional power points, etc. your teacher has is also a good thing.

, It's hands on and a good way for you to learn and understand many concepts.

, It's the worst thing you can do. AP classes have a very large and demanding course load and the class is fast paced, so keep up. It'll only be harder if you fall behind.

Watch John Green US History Videos.",How to Survive Advanced Placement American History," Depending on the school and teacher, A.P.U.S.H. tests cover between two and six chapters, each being about twenty to thirty pages. Units are short time-wise only about two weeks. Think about whether or not you would be able to handle this.;
, It will help you throughout the year and while reviewing for the AP Course. Try to obtain the book the summer before the new school year begins, along with any AP summer homework. Read ahead if possible.

, In A.P.U.S.H., small details are emphasized on. Don't memorize-understand what happened in history. Why did things happen, and what caused them? For each chapter, know the major people and events, along with minor details as well.

, Reading four chapters in one night for the first time is a bad idea. Read some A.P.U.S.H every day. Remember: preparing for an AP is like a marathon, not a sprint.

, Simply reading will not be enough in A.P.U.S.H. Take notes on the chapters.

, If you are knowledgeable enough about the chapter, then take practice quizzes online or in the book.

, It simply takes time to learn the studying process, but if you put in the effort, you will make it. Do not let the first grade change your mind about taking the course.

, If you cannot get a ride, perhaps create an online group. However, you should only form a study group if it will actually help you. More than often, study groups turn into social hours. Sure, they are fun, but they are not the best idea when preparing for a test.

, This could be time-consuming but will be worth it. Re-read the chapters or at least read the corresponding sections in the review book. This way, when the AP Exam approaches, you will be ready.

, Pace yourself and create a plan, be feasible. Unless you have totally slacked off throughout the entire year, you probably don't need to re-read the textbook. Buy two review books, because one book may not cover everything it needs to. Ideally, one of the books should be detailed and the other one covering more of the big-picture idea. Start out by reading through the big-picture book once, and then read the detailed book. Remember to skim the chapters in your textbook just to make sure you are covering all the important information. Then, right before the AP Exam, re-read the big-picture book once more. Make sure you understand major social, economic and political aspects of each time period and know important people. Quiz a friend and have them quiz you if it helps. Take practice exams until your score improves.

, The essays on the AP US History exam are Document Based Questions (D.B.Q.) and Free Response Question (F.R.Q.). The key in both these essays is to analyze. This is not just stating facts like one might in a regular history course. Analyze means to explain, supporting your thesis, like: ""The fact that Jackson issued the Specie Circular showed he did not care about the economy because if he did, he would not have issued something that invalidated a lot of currency."" In a D.B.Q., make sure to tie in the documents as well. Have a four to five paragraph essay.

, If you feel you are struggling, don't just wait it out. Search for extra instruction online or go to your teacher in your free time. If you wait too long it will all pile up and become overwhelming. Your teacher and the internet are there to help!

, His videos, while they are fast paced, are a really great review of US History. They detail just enough and give a great overview of every important time period. He also integrates humor into the history, which really helps to remember the material.

  Understand your score.",How to Study for the AP Biology Exam," As time-consuming as it sounds, the earlier you begin studying for the AP Biology exam, the more prepared you will be. Give yourself two months prior to the exam to study the labs and chapters, so that you do not have to cram in the few weeks before the exam. The earlier you begin to study, the less you must review each night. Start early, and give yourself about 20 additional minutes per evening to review old concepts that you may have forgotten.;
, Believe it or not, the notebooks full of notes  taken in AP Biology can be very helpful when studying for the exam. Quickly skim each section of notes. If you do not understand something you've written down, write down the concept on another sheet of paper titled ""Review."" Try making flashcards with any unknown words, phrases, or famous scientists. Review these flashcards every day leading up to the exam.

, There are a variety of study books available for the new AP Biology exam, and they can be very useful. Because only certain sections of certain chapters in the textbook must be understood, these books only review the sections that must be understood. They describe exactly what you need to know, and review the information associated with the concepts. A suggested study book is ""Preparing for the Biology AP Exam (School Edition) Update"", which can be purchased through the link called ""Study Book"" in the Sources and Citations section.

,  The College Board makes is very clear what AP Biology students need to know and understand in order to succeed in the exam. As of 2013, there is a brand new AP Biology test that is centered around ""application of concepts"" rather than ""remembering facts."" This means that you will not have to cram facts into your mind before the exam; you must be able to apply formulas, ideas, and concepts instead. The College Board has a list of four ""Big Ideas"" that students must be able to understand and explain thoroughly on the exam. The link to these Big Ideas can be found under ""Big Ideas"" in the Sources and Citations Section. In addition to these Big Ideas, students must understand and be able to explain the thirteen labs completed throughout the course. One of these thirteen labs will be asked about explicitly on the exam, so make sure you've reviewed them all.

, There are tons of explanatory videos about AP Biology on YouTube and other video websites. These videos are often more helpful than books because they put concepts into spoken explanations. Videos are especially helpful for understanding when and how to use the scientific formulas that may be necessary for the exam. Take brief notes while watching videos that ensure that you understand what you're watching. #*""BozemanBiology"" on YouTube has extremely concise videos on every Big Idea, every lab, and every concept taught in the class and is highly recommended for review. This account also covers how to take the exam, what to expect, and how to prepare. A link to the Bozeman Biology YouTube channel can be found under ""BozemanBiology"" in the Sources and Citations section.

, Never, ever cram for the AP Biology exam. AP Biology covers way too much information over the course of a school year for you to attempt to remember it all in one night. If you do cram, your mind will be exhausted and you're likely to forget what you already know. Start studying early, or study as much as you can, but never cram. The afternoon before the test the next morning, close your books and put down your pencil. You're as ready as you'll ever be.

, As scared as your AP Biology teacher may try to make you about the exam, do not stress. After all, they're not the one taking the exam; you are. If you have been doing your work and paying attention in class all year long, you will do just fine. The night before the exam, get at least eight hours of sleep and don't even think about AP Biology. The morning of the exam, eat a good breakfast and breathe a sigh of relief. The exam day is here; you're nearly finished!

, The AP Biology exam consists of a multiple choice section and a written section. Make sure you give yourself time to complete each question. However, do not linger on questions because you want to make sure you try to answer every question. If you have studied, you should finish with plenty of time left over.

, If you are finished with the exam and you have extra time left over, go back and make sure you've completed every question as thoroughly as you can. Maybe there are a few more ideas you'd like to add to some of your answers. Write as much as you can and as much as you know about every question. This could be the difference between a final score of 4 and a final score of 5.

, You will receive your AP exam score in late June or early July, depending on the year in which you take it. The score is on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest score you can receive. A 5 is considered ""extremely well-qualified."" A 4 is ""well-qualified."" A 3 is ""qualified."" A 2 is ""poorly qualified."" A 1 is ""unqualified."" You should aim to receive a 4 or a 5, but many colleges also accept a score of 3 for college credit. Be proud of your score. You worked hard for it.

Don't throw anything away until you know your AP score!",How to Succeed in an Advanced Placement Course," Expect a quiz the first day and expect it to be hard. Teachers are not going to sugarcoat anything.;
, Over the summer make sure you are prepared. Have a composition or spiral notebook, a 3 ring binder, dividers, a hole punch, and lots of paper by the time your course begins. Study how to take good notes and learn how to get organized. Good notes and organization come in handy later on in the year. Organize your binder; for example, for a history class you may want to organize by time periods. But, no matter what the class is, you will always need a section for writing. Writing essays is a huge part of any AP class, so if you are not good at writing, be sure to polish up your formal writing skills.

, Research the best prep book for your course. Prep books are written by AP or college teachers, and are usually published by a publisher focused on education. Prep books are indispensable and will provide background information for lectures and a speedy review for tests.

, You will be issued a textbook. Take a glance at it. If you have never taken an AP class before then it is going to be like a foreign language to you, but don't worry; as you begin to understand each concept it will seem much easier.

, This article will not go into much detail over the subject, but see other articles mentioned in the Related wikiHows section. Take them first when you are reading the text for homework and then take them during the in-class review. Take the notes in your notebook and keep them ordered chronologically. Be sure to head each page with the subject and the date.

, If you try to slide through this by skimming, you will not get anywhere. Don't worry though; the reading is hard at first, but after Winter Break it will be a lot easier. (Also many teachers like to scare students by making the work extra hard up to Winter break to scare off the cowards, so keep that in mind).

, Before now you may have had a pretty easy run and may have gotten good grades by just paying attention in class, but now you will need to study. Keep in mind that AP classes tend to focus more on concepts and critical thinking than facts, so don't waste your time memorizing facts if you have no idea what they mean.

, Depending on classes, this test will take anywhere from 3-5 hours. You will have about 50 minutes to answer 70 multiple choice questions and the rest for a couple of essays (again, depending on the exam). Cramming does not cut it for this test. Your brain will be like a pat of butter sizzling on a hot skillet so do not attempt to go to your other classes after and arrange to be picked up as you won't be able to drive yourself.

, This prep book will focus on the big details that may be overlooked for smaller ones. Dedicate at least two weeks to studying with your prep book so it is manageable and concise. On the night before the test, study only what you need to know or what you're weak on.

, You are now free from the countless demands posed by teachers at their every whim.

, Most universities will grant credit based on a 3 or 4-only the really prestigious will require a 5. Even if you don't pass, realize that what you have already experienced will aid you when you go on to take the course in college.

, If you've thrown away all of your notes and lecture gatherings and have received a failing grade, all of the permanent and first-hand references you will have gotten during the class' duration will be gone forever! If you've received your score and know for sure that the college of your choice will accept it as credit, then do what you will with the materials, but not a moment before!

The morning of the test, wake up early to give yourself enough time to get to the test center with a comfortable amount of time.

",How to Study for an AP Test in Two Weeks," Most of the time, it's easier to study if you feel pressured without feeling panicked.;
, This will help you to know what to expect and stop yourself from being caught off-guard. Find out what time it begins, where you have to go, what to bring, how it is scored, etc. Remember that there is no longer a penalty for wrong answers. Keep in mind that you do not need a 100%, or even an 85% to get a five.

, Go through old tests, notes, and the textbook briefly to pinpoint areas of both strength and weakness.

, During that time, turn off distractions such as your TV, social networks and cell phone.

, This will help you to further pinpoint places you need to work on and the places you can spend only a little time on. While you take the test, place tick marks next to the questions on the answer sheet that you are unsure of, but don't skip any. Take your best guess.

, Learn why you got the question wrong.

, Put a tally mark underneath each topic every time you get a question from that topic wrong. This will help you to see more clearly which areas need work.

, Start off with some of the easier topics (the ones where you got the least questions wrong) to get your brain going, but don't spend too long on those. Once your brain gets focused on the topic at hand, start working on the more difficult subjects.

, With the test only two weeks away, doing short drills multiple times a day can be one of the most helpful things you can do. See below for suggested drills.

, Like before, try to simulate the test conditions. Work at a desk with bright lights, don't take breaks in the middle of a section, time yourself, and tell the people around not to disturb you. If possible, do both the multiple choice section and the essay section in the same day, taking a 5-10 minute break in between.

, Use the same methods as before - keep track of which topics you are frequently having trouble with, and understand why you got each question wrong.

,, Stick to the things you need to know.

, Make sure you have all the materials you will need for test. Remember to have non-mechanical, number 2 pencils, an eraser, pens for the essay section, and a calculator if you are allowed one. Also bring a snack, bottle of water, and your ID.

, Don't stay up too late, but don't try to throw off your sleep cycle by getting 12 hours of sleep, either.

Underline when an example essay uses evidence to support a claim, and identify how often a writer uses transition words.Be aware of the time constraints as you do your sample essays. Practicing with the time pressure will help you fit everything in on exam day. Keep in mind that you have 120 minutes to write 3 essays.;
, Your initial strategy for getting a high mark on the AP English essay is to forget writing for a moment and focus on reading the prompt. You need to fully understand what the prompt is saying before attempting to write about it. This is because your job is to analyze it, not summarize it.Make notes in the margins and underline key parts of the argument.
Follow the acronym SOAPSTone to help you answer key questions about the prompt: Speaker, Occasion, Audience, Purpose, Subject, Tone.Look for action words in the prompt that indicate what kind of argument the prompt wants you to make, words like “qualify,” “support,” and “refute.”, Basically your job after analyzing the prompt is to decide how the main argument of the prompt text (if one is provided) connects to what it is asking you to do.For example, if it asks you to defend the assertion that a quote makes, you would need to put this assertion in your own words and build an argument for why it is valid.


If no text is provided—such as if the prompt asks you to analyze a general topic based on your experience—you would instead need to consider how to use aspects of that topic to make your argument.
For example, decide whether you agree or disagree and make a diagram of the strong points on each side.

, After analyzing the prompt and any source text, go ahead and formulate your argument. Are you for or against the statement the prompt gives you, or the issue it asks you to examine? This step is not about making a thesis. Just write down your argument at this point.


The highest-scoring AP essays are those that employ an argument that “qualifies” rather than simply defends or agrees with. To qualify an argument means to consider both sides. Ability to do this demonstrates that you have an understanding that most issues in society are not cut and dried.

, After deciding what your argument will be, you need to gather evidence to support your argument. The key to getting a 9 on an AP English essay is coming up with plenty of evidence.If the prompt provides you with a passage to analyze, underline quotes that will support your argument. Then think of examples independent from the text that will support it.
If the prompt asks you to use your knowledge of an issue, brainstorm and make a list of as many examples you can think of.
If you have memorized quotes from famous people that will help your argument, list these as well.
Having a list of evidence to choose from as you go makes writing your essay that much faster.

, Now that you have formed an argument and made a list of examples and underlined quotes to support it, you can make a solid thesis sentence. A thesis directly answers the prompt and makes a claim that can be disputed.You may want to include the basic gist of the evidence you have gathered as part of your thesis sentence. For example, a thesis statement can follow this format: your argument + 3 reasons why.
___________ is true because ___________, _________, and ___________.
A thesis statement may sound like this: By combining the concepts of artistic expression and creative license, Van Gogh’s Starry Night becomes the epitome of the ideal night sky.
A thesis sentence usually appears at the end of the intro paragraph, often as the very last sentence.

, One you have identified your argument, made a list of evidence to draw from, and formulated a clear thesis statement, it is imperative that you now create an outline. This is because an outline helps you organize your ideas so that your essay is clear and direct.Make sure the flow of the argument is logical, going in order of occurrence if you are using events as examples, or making sure that you don’t present one example without first introducing where you might find it.
The first paragraph is the intro paragraph, followed by at least three body paragraphs, and ends with a conclusion sentence. Map out this outline on paper before starting the essay.You may find it useful to fill in topic sentences in the outline before writing the essay so that you can stay focused when writing the essay.

, Although AP readers are told to grade the essay in its entirety, essays that stand out are the ones that begin with a strong lead-in.Start your essay with a hook sentence to get the reader’s attention, followed by three or four sentences explaining your topic, and end with the thesis sentence.


In this paragraph, you should introduce the author and title of any literature you are analyzing, followed by a reiteration (though not repetition) of the prompt. You should also include any literary elements that would help your analysis.Literary elements include character, setting, tone, etc.

, If you haven’t included topic sentences already in the outline, it is important to create them now. Topic sentences guide each paragraph and create a claim for each one. Make sure each topic sentence relates back to the thesis sentence.


It is also useful to use transition words in the topic sentences to make the essay flow better. Use words or phrases like “also,” “likewise,” “in addition,” and so on., You should include quotes and examples within body paragraphs to prove that your thesis sentence and each topic sentence is true. Evidence gives your essay credibility, because other people and circumstances agree with you. Evidence is how you convince a reader to agree with your argument.


Make sure you frame each quote or example so that it connects to the topic sentence.You can accomplish this by “sandwiching” the quotes/examples between a sentence that introduces them followed by one or more sentences that explain them.
Avoid using quotes longer than 4 lines. In MLA format, which is standard for many English papers, a quote that is longer than 4 lines (or 3 lines of a poem) must be “blocked,” or given a one-inch margin. This formatting can take valuable time away from your writing, and you need every moment you can spare., When you get to the conclusion, it is wise to re-state your thesis and the main idea of each body paragraph. However, be careful not to simply swap out words you have already used for new words that mean the same thing. Re-state the thesis in new words entirely. The same goes for summarizing body paragraphs.


Finish the conclusion paragraph with a sentence that challenges the reader without bringing in new ideas. This sentence can push the reader to think about your topic for themselves.
For example, your last sentence might be, “In this day and age, this topic is definitely something every college student should be thinking about.”

, Your writing will be very choppy and not flow well if you do not use sentence length variety. It is ok to use some basic sentences like, “The people hate the government,” but this type of sentence should be used in the midst of longer, more complex sentences. Such variety displays an understanding of writing and reading.Use transition words to connect sentences within paragraphs, not just between them, such as “also” and “likewise.”

, The AP English essay is a good time to employ your knowledge of vocabulary, of course, but make sure that each word makes sense when you use it. Don’t use big words just because you can. Using them appropriately is just as important for scoring a 9 on this essay.For example, make sure your large vocabulary word makes sense: ""The methods were carried out with perfect punctilio.""
You could also write, ""The defalcation of the government this fiscal year is appalling.""

, As you write, sound out the words in your head to make sure they “sound” correct. Whenever something you write sounds wrong, this is usually an indication of incorrect grammar. Proper grammar is imperative for making a 9 on this essay.


Grammar is learned over time through reading and school classes, but a basic review of grammar during your AP studies is helpful.
Review things like sentence structure, subject-verb agreement, pronoun agreement, and so on.

According to College Board, you do not need to attend an AP course to take the test. However, your school might not be willing to offer you the test if you did not take the course.
If you are homeschooled, you can contact AP Services to be put in touch with schools that have AP coordinators. Schools with AP coordinators can administer the test to homeschool students. You should contact the coordinator at the local school by no later than March 15.;
, Every year you have the option of sending one free cumulative score report to a college of your choice. You should know in advance what college you want to send the score to and you should list it on the first “registration” answer sheet on your exam day.The report will include every AP test that you have ever taken.
If you take an AP test before your senior year, you can send your existing to the college of your choosing. High scores can help you get into rigorous universities. However, you will need to resend the scores after your senior year to receive credit for AP exams taken during that year.
You should bring with you the name of the college you want to send your score report to, as well as the city and state that it is located in. Also, you should find the four digit college code for the university on the college board website. The college board uses the same college codes for the AP and SAT exams.If you sign up to send the score before taking the test you will not be able to prevent the college from seeing poor scores. However, if you do wait, you can have a poor test score canceled for free before sending the report., To request score reports for additional colleges, you will need to obtain the proper information from the exam to identify yourself. There are two ways to do this. You can either provide your student ID or the AP number.


Some schools provide their students with a unique student ID number. If your school follows this practice, you can write your student ID number on your AP answer sheet. You will then be able to use this ID number to access your score report online.
In your AP student pack you will receive bar-coded number labels that you attach to your exam materials. Keep one for yourself. Under the barcode is an eight digit AP number that can be used to identify your test. The AP number changes every year, so you will need to keep track of the year you received the AP number, which should also be listed on the barcode.

, If you have registered online for the SAT or ordered AP scores in the past, you should have an online account with the College Board. If this is the first time that you have taken either exam, go to colleboard.org and click on the “Sign Up Now” button.


You should refrain from creating more than one account with College Board; it can make it harder to access your scores.
If you have forgotten your username or password, use the “forgot username” or “forgot password” option to retrieve them. The site will ask you for some identifying information. If you cannot provide sufficient information, College Board will email your account information to the address you have provided., In early July, your scores should become available. Visit Apscore.org for more detailed information about when your scores will become available. You will need to use either your AP number or student ID number to access the score.If you lost your AP Number click on “I do not have an AP number” when requesting your scores from APscores.org. The number will be sent to the email address you provided when signing up for the test. If your email address has changed, you can call AP Services at 888-225-5427.

, Some colleges require AP scores to be sent by July 15th. It costs $15 dollars to send a score report, and $25 to send it express.


Any orders placed between July 6th and July 15th will automatically be expedited without any additional fees.Rushed deliveries will arrive between 5-9 days.

Set aside at least an hour each day to review the material or do practice questions. If you didn’t start studying early, you’ll need to make a condensed plan. Make an outline of all the concepts you need to study and prioritize them based on the likelihood it will be on the test and your mastery of the material.If you only have a week or two to study, you need to set aside at least three hours a day to focus on chemistry. Start by focusing on the concepts you really struggle with and then review the material you know pretty well a few days before the exam.
Take at least one practice exam before the actual test day. Ideally, you will have taken 3-4 practice exams to prepare.;
, Chemistry is a subject that continues to build upon itself so if you haven’t mastered the basics, you will get stuck very early. Review the concepts from the beginning of class, focusing on the ones that gave you trouble early on.Mastering the basic concepts will make it much easier to approach complex problems.

, It is easy to think you understand a problem when you’re reading through the solution. This is the best way to start studying, but you also need to go back and attempt the problem yourself. It may not be as easy without the solution in front of you.Chemistry is most easily understood by doing actual problems. Make sure you understand how to solve a problem and get the correct answer.
Always double-check the units at the end of the problem. If the units don’t make sense or the answer logically can’t be right, you need to go back and figure out what went wrong.

, Review books are a great resource to help you focus your studying. You can work through the book and the material without having to create an intensely detailed outline on your own. It can also help you structure your time and study habits.Review books also have practice problems and full practice exams that are very useful for studying.

, Forming a study group with your classmates is a great way to stay on schedule with your studying. It is also very helpful to study with other people who may understand the material better than you do. You can quiz each other or explain concepts in different ways to help each other out.Set up a study group schedule and stick to it.

, The best way to study for the test is to take practice exams either from previous years or from review books. The College Board releases the free-response questions from the previous year’s exam. While the questions will not be identical from year-to-year, it will give you a good idea of the format and the type of questions you will be facing.Practice tests are a great way to evaluate where you have weaknesses. Use this as a guide to tailor your studying to the concepts you struggle with.
When taking practice exams, abide by the time given for the actual exam. This will help you with your pacing so you don’t run out of time on the day of the test.
Practice tests from review books can be harder or easier than the actual exam, so try to find and take exams from the College Board., You can easily simplify your studying process by knowing what you will not see on the exam. This helps you narrow your study focus and avoid spending time on concepts you know won’t be on there. While these concepts may be useful as background knowledge, you will not need to know them specifically for the test. This list is not exhaustive but includes some of the concepts you can spend less time on:Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons
Phase diagrams
Nuclear chemistry and molecular orbital theory
Extensive organic chemistry
The Nernst equation
Lewis acid-base concepts and computing pH changes in buffers

, Knowing the different types of chemical reactions, how they occur, and how to find their products is essential for the exam. Single and double replacement, synthesis, decomposition, combustion and redox reactions are all ones that you need to know.Know how to recognize each type of reaction and how products are formed.

, There are many concepts that are a “must” to know for the exam. Knowing how to do the following calculations with ease will make the exam that much easier:Percent composition, mole fractions, and molar solutions
Kinetics calculations, titration calculations, and thermodynamics calculations
Equilibrium constants, standard electrode potentials, Faraday’s laws of electrolysis
Stoichiometric relations and gas laws
Molecular formulas from empirical formulas and empirical formulas from experimental data

, The AP Chemistry exam is a long test and is all about proper pacing. There are two sections: multiple choice and free response. The best strategy for the multiple choice section is to go through all of the questions and answer as many as you can, taking 40 seconds per question. Mark a “Y” next to questions you know you can answer with more time and an “N” next to questions you have no idea how to answer.Try to get through all 60 questions in about 40 minutes (15 questions per 10 minutes).
Give yourself about 10 minutes for the short question and 16 minutes for the long question free responses.

, Go back through the multiple choice questions and address all of the ones you marked with a “Y”. If you have successfully gotten through all of the questions in the first pass in 40 minutes, you should still have 50 minutes left for the section. Spend the next 40 minutes answering the questions you are pretty sure you can answer.Ignore the questions you marked with an “N”.

, With ten minutes left to complete this section, go back through a final time and try to answer the questions you have no idea how to solve. Try to eliminate at least two of the answers and make an educated guess for the answer.There is no penalty for guessing, so try to answer every single question.

, This step is especially important for the free response section. You want to make sure you are providing an answer to what the question is asking before you try to solve. Many questions have multiple parts, so read each question before answering and think about how the previous answer helps you answer the next question.Use proper significant figures for each response.
If a question asks you to use the answer to the previous question, make sure you use it.
If you couldn’t come up with an answer to the previous question, but know how to answer the next part, make up a number and explain how you would solve with that number.

, If the question asks you to compare two answers or explain/justify your answer, make sure you do it. Simply stating an answer will not be enough for full credit. Clearly articulate your reasoning to get all of the points or at least partial credit.Present your work neatly so that exam graders can read it easily and give you the credit you are due."

No more studying!,
Relax, Recharge.,
Hydrate yourself.,
Get a full night's sleep.",How to Avoid Distractions During a Standardized Test1," If you haven't got it by now, one day of cramming is very unlikely to make a difference. In fact, it's more likely to actually harm your performance, as you try to overlap short-term information over top long-term information. Refuse the urge to keep your nose in the books.;
, You've hopefully been exerting yourself a great deal as you've prepared for your test. Now is the time to spend the day relaxing, diverting your attention away from everything test-related. This may mean renting a few movies for the day followed by going out to dinner. Whatever it is you do to relax and recharge, do it (but avoid alcohol, see section below). If you feel your mind creeping toward thoughts of the test, re-direct it immediately toward relaxing and recharging.

, Men should consume roughly 3 liters (about 13 cups) of total beverages a day and women should consume 2.2 liters (about 9 cups). In particular, adults should ingest approximately 35-50 milliliters of fluids per kilogram of body weight per day. (Use a fluid calculator). Optimize your fluid intake the day before testing. See the section below, ""Fluid intake,"" for why.

, Adult sleep requirements vary but average around 8 hours per night. Whatever a full night's sleep is for you, get it. Also, during the week leading up to your test day, buy a battery-powered alarm clock and use it. A late-night power surge has ruined many test days.

Don't be late!",How to Avoid Distractions During a Standardized Test2," Even if you are unaccustomed to eating breakfast, eat one on test day. However, don't eat just any breakfast. A small meal of complex carbohydrates is ideal, say, whole grain cereal with fresh fruit and low fat or skim milk. This will help maintain your energy throughout testing. Avoid a breakfast of fatty foods, such as eggs, meat, and fried potatoes. Such foods require extra energy to digest, which is better left for your brain.

, Despite eating a breakfast as advised, you may still experience an energy crash. Avoid it by bringing a few ""fun-sized"" Snickers bars to your test. Just prior entering the testing site, including between breaks, eat one, no more. This will keep hunger at bay while giving your brain quick energy it can use to optimize your performance.

, Since you've optimized your fluid intake the day before, minimize it prior testing. You don't need the distraction of a full bladder half-way through your test. That said, don't minimize fluids so much you are distracted by thirst.

, Most standardized tests begin in the morning and finish around noon. If yours is on a different schedule, follow the same principles for lunch or dinner as described in the above section on eating a light breakfast.

, Test day is not the day to dress to impress. You should wear the most comfortable clothes in your wardrobe. Loose-fitting jeans, casual loose-fitting tops (but see the section below), comfortable shoes, and nothing that overly constricts or pokes at you is ideal. The point is for you to not even so much think about what you're wearing while testing so you can avoid it as a distraction. Also, please don't be a distraction to others by wearing perfume or cologne. A morning shower and deodorant will suffice.

, Oh, wait, it's hot! Everyone's preferred body temperature is a little different. The room you will be testing in will probably be either too cold or too hot. It's ideal to dress your upper body in three layers. This may mean wearing a very light shirt under a button-down-the-front shirt under a light jacket. The point is for you to be able to avoid the distraction of room temperature by adding or removing a layer or two of clothing during the minutes leading up to test time.

, On test day, there will definitely be room noises to which you are unaccustomed, whether from the person behind you who is constantly reading quietly aloud, or the person across the room with a frequent, barking cough. If you are easily distracted by room noise, or even if you are not, consider wearing ear plugs. Most pharmacies have them. You want the kind that you roll between your fingers and insert into your ear canal. If you think ear plugs might help you avoid room distractions, first get used to them during the week leading up to the test. All you'll hear is yourself breathing!


Who are all these people? Some people dislike being in new large rooms full of strangers with whom they are unfamiliar. If that describes you, remind yourself that everyone is there for the same task as you. The situation is little different from being in a movie theater or shopping mall. You'll be fine. It may help to stop by the testing site during the week leading up to your test and ask to see inside.

, If you normally drink one or more caffeinated beverages each morning, you should make provision for yourself to avoid the inevitable ""caffeine crash"" several hours later. Consider over-the-counter products that contain caffeine, but be very careful not to overdo it or use Guarana, especially in its whole form, as the caffeine source. Getting overly wired on caffeine is just as bad as a crash in the middle of 40 math problems. Your goal should be evenness.

, If you routinely use tobacco in any form, avoid even the possibility of experiencing a ""nicotine fit"" while testing. Consider getting some nicotine lozenges, available over-the-counter from most pharmacies, and let one dissolve slowly in your mouth while testing. Don't wait until after you start experiencing nicotine withdrawal, because by then the agitation has already distracted you and affected your performance. Again, your goal should be evenness.

, Don't take the above advise to ""relax and recharge"" as encouragement to drink in excess on the day before your test. Either avoid alcohol altogether or drink no more than one ounce during the 24 hours before your test. Detoxification requires your body to focus energy in organs other than your brain.

, The people who make your test will inform you of items you must bring on test day. This will always include a state-issued photo I.D., such as a driver license. During the week leading up to your test, make sure the I.D. you plan to bring will be acceptable. You may also need to bring some sharpened #2 pencils, ink pens of a certain color, and a calculator. There may be other items you must bring, plus items you should not bring. Whatever the items are, make doubly sure you arrive for your test exactly as directed.

, The people who conduct high-stakes tests have figured out that hand-held and other electronic devises, including watches, can serve as modern ""cheat-sheets"" and test copying mechanisms. That's why they've created absolutely un-bendable policies to completely prohibit them from their testing rooms. If you have such a devise in your possession, expect to be mercilessly expelled, period. You'll have to reschedule and repay. No, the test proctor absolutely will not watch or hold your devise for you. Leave it outside the door of the testing room. You've been warned.

, Plan on not only arriving early, but encountering a traffic jam and getting a flat tire on your way to the testing site. Give yourself a very large buffer on your arrival time. The people who administer your test are un-yieldingly serious when they say late-comers will not be admitted.

Don't leave your preparation to the last minute!,
Beware of the scams of those UMAT Prep Courses.,
Take a speed reading course as part of your UMAT preparation, particularly for sections 1 and 2.,
Be organised!,
Make sure you organise to get to your designated testing centre by the designated reporting time on your admission ticket.,
Time management is key!,
Utilise your nervous energy.,
Have confidence in your abilities.,
Be careful if you are trying to think like the test writer or assuming they are trying to trick you (even if they are).",How to Achieve UMAT Success," The skills required to succeed in the UMAT cannot be learnt the night before. Make sure you don't leave all your practice exams and questions to the last minute. If you practice consistently over a longer period of time the skills will consolidate and you will have time to improve in all areas as well as focusing on your weaknesses. If you are cramming the night before you will not be aware of your strengths and weaknesses and will most likely be wasting a whole heap of good value practice exams because you were 'saving them for later'.;
, There are many websites that claim to be UMAT prep organisations when they are actually scam websites. If you avoid these websites and go with a good quality UMAT preparation organisations, you are sure to get the quality preparation that you pay for so that you can practice your UMAT skills, gauge your strengths and weaknesses and improve your ability to respond efficiently to questions in a timely manner.

, The whole of section 2 is based around comprehending large chunks of text, and in section 1 there are many questions which also involve reading a large text. You want to waste as little time as possible reading but you do not want to rush through it as you will not understand very much and you may have to go back over what you have already read. A speed reading course will help you increase your reading speed and your ability to understand and pick out the key ideas in the text whilst speed reading.

, Depending on the time you are allocated you may need to get up really early on the day of the UMAT and if not it is still important to be organised. Have all of the things you need (e.g. pencils, admission ticket, correct identification, transportation) organised the night before (or earlier) so that you do not have to stress of worry about them on the morning. You don't want to be printing out your ticket or searching for the correct pencils right before your exam. You want to be calm and collected going into the exam, not stressed and flustered.

, Allow for any transportation mishaps (like missing your train or being stuck in traffic). Also, you may want to take a snack while you are lining up to go in. The lines are really long and you can't take any food or drink other than bottled water into the test. If the test has started and you are late you will not be allowed in (the UMAT begins once all of the pre-testing procedures - checking of Admission Tickets and identification have been completed).

, One of the most daunting factors of the UMAT for candidates is the sheer amount of work that needs to be done in a short amount of time. This is where the preparation comes in. If you have practiced UMAT style questions you are likely to be faster and more efficient at answering the questions. If you feel you are spending too much time on a question, take an educated guess and move on so that you have time to come back to it at the end (do not leave it blank, because if you run out of time, you cannot go back and you will be left with an unanswered question).

, On the day of the UMAT it is healthy to be a little bit nervous. Psychological studies have shown that people perform poorly when they are not aroused or when they are too aroused. If you are extremely stressed you are likely to become easily confused and misinterpret questions. Without any anxiety you will not perform as actively as you would with slight arousal. If you have a little bit of nervous energy and you are able to harness it, your performance will be heightened and it will allow you too perform at your best level.

, If you go into the test with a negative mindset, expecting to perform poorly, this will be the case. You should go into the UMAT confident in all of your preparation with a 'can do' attitude in order to make the most of the UMAT and score as high as possible! A positive mindset may be a small factor, but it does contribute significantly to a person's performance in any test.

, You could waste valuable time channelling the writer when you could be using that time to use the methods and logic you learnt and prepared in order to answer the question correctly. Beware of the endless ""what do they think I will think?"" cycle. You may end up completely confusing yourself and will gain no ground on selecting the right answer.

Look for any vocabulary words you learned recently in class, and any study terms you recognize., Quickly go through the test and fill in the blanks that you are sure you know. This will give you confidence, and it will “prime” your brain – you'll be subconsciously working on the answers you skipped over. Then go back and answer the hard questions., If you have more than one idea, and you truly can't decide which is more likely to be correct, write them both down.

Try to picture what your professor would give as the answer.

, If you are having difficulty figuring out the answer to a question, or if you have several possibilities in mind, use the margins (or the back) of your exam to work it out.

Be careful not to change the question when you rephrase it., If you know your teacher will be giving you a short answer test, prepare beforehand by making note of any key ideas or terms you find in the text book or reading materials. Always include key points your teacher makes in his or her lectures, especially points that are repeated two or more times.Write the key word on the front of the flashcard, and a brief description on the back.
An alternative to flashcards is to fold a regular piece of notebook paper in half, lengthwise (from top to bottom). Write the key terms on the left half of the paper, and the corresponding descriptions on the right side. Then fold the paper so you can only see the descriptions, and try to recall the terms.

, Briefly read through the test questions. Then, if you are allowed to write on the back of the test sheet, or on a cover sheet, try to list any information you think might help you during the test.List any of the terms on your flashcards that often stumped you – get those down, so you don't get stuck on them when they appear on the test.
If you memorized any lists or collections of terms by using mnemonics, quickly write them down.
If you aren't allowed to use the Periodic Table during a chemistry exam, memorize it and sketch it out before you take the test. Then you'll have it to refer to during the test.
Always be sure your teacher is okay with this method, and that it is obvious you didn't bring the paper in with you to class – otherwise, it might look like you're cheating.

This process helps to improve your concentration, and will exercise your memory.

, The answers on an exam often follow the same order you learned the material in class, or in the same order it was presented in the textbook. Answering them in order may help give you clues as to what the right answer might be. But don't waste a lot of time on a difficult question and become frustrated, as this may affect your performance on the rest of the test.


If you are really stuck on a question, make your best guess and put a question mark next to it. If you finish the test with time to spare, go back and reconsider the ones you marked.
If you do not want to guess, skip the question and put a mark beside it, so you can return to it if you have time at the end of the test.

, On most tests, you are not penalized for guessing. It's better to risk getting a question right, and possibly get it wrong, than to leave it completely blank, and definitely get it wrong. However, be aware that there are certain tests where you are penalized for guessing. If you aren't sure, ask your teacher or exam coordinator before you begin the test.The SAT will penalize you for guessing. You'll be deducted ¼ point for every incorrect answer – you will not be penalized for answers left blank.
The ACT does not penalize for guessing. It's better to answer every single question, if you can, and hope that some of your guesses are correct.
The GRE does not penalize for wrong answers. Skip answers when you are stuck, but try to get back to them if you can – it's best to answer every question you can, within the allotted time frame.

, Many people say that your first guess on a test question is usually right, so you should never change your answer. However, recent studies have shown that isn't the case – you're just as likely, or even more likely, to get it right if you change an answer you aren't sure about. So don't stress over whether to change an answer because it wasn't your first choice. If you change your mind, change your answer.Empirical evidence from data collected from takers of the GRE test shows that test-takers who changed some of their answers tended to score higher than those who always stuck with their first choice.
Test takers in the GRE study most often changed answers from wrong to right, which resulted in a higher score.

, When you are considering an answer that you aren't sure is correct, ask yourself if it completely answers the question.If the answer is only partly true, or applies to only one part of the question, it is probably not the one to choose.
If the answer is only true under certain conditions, it is probably not the right one. If a question asks about a specific behavior of an elephant, but the answer would only be correct for an elephant in captivity, it doesn't exactly answer the question.
If an answer is incomplete, or is not correct under every circumstance, eliminate that option. This will leave you with fewer options to choose from, which will increase the odds that you will select the correct answer.
If you find an answer that looks “almost” complete, see if there is another option that is very similar to that answer, but is complete. This may be the correct choice.

, Teachers very rarely put trick questions on their tests. If you think the question might be a trick, read it over again very carefully. You might have misunderstood the point of the question, or you might be trying to make the question more complicated than it really is.If there is a simple answer that solves the question, that is probably the correct choice. For example, if the question is “What does 0 times 0 equal?,” don't over-analyze it. It's not a trick question – the answer is 0.
If a history tests asks, “What was the name of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s father?,” it's not a trick. The answer is Martin Luther King, Sr.

, If there are two answers you like equally, visualize the first one as being the right answer. Then try the second option, and imagine in your mind that this answer is the correct one. You will probably have a “gut feeling” that one of the answers is wrong. Then choose the other one.We sometimes have a strong feeling about something, without remembering specific details about it. For instance, we can remember if we liked or disliked somebody we recently met, even if we can't remember their name.

, If two of the choices are exact opposites of the other, one of these is likely to be the right answer.If two answers on a math test are a) 7, and b) -7; one of these is likely to be correct.
For example, a question on a history exam asks about the impact of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and two of the answers are: a) It allowed more citizens to vote, and b) It increased voting restrictions. These express exactly opposing ideas, and in this case “A” is the correct answer.

, If an answer insists on an absolute, it is usually not the correct answer. Avoid answers that include the words never, always, all, every, and must. (Math tests are the exception to this one.)Answers that do not contain absolutes are more likely to be correct. For example, correct answers often contain these words or phrases: generally, probably, most likely, seldom, tend to, and usually.

, Be on the lookout for grammatical matches between the question and the answers. The correct answer to a question will most likely match in tense and number, and the nouns and verbs will agree.For example, if the question asks, “What IS the most endangered species in the world?,” you can eliminate “The Amur leopard and the Javan rhinoceros ARE the most endangered species,” because the question is phrased in the singular. (In this case, the answer would be, “The Ivory-billed woodpecker IS the most endangered species.)

, Questions for tests are usually based on the information in your textbook, and teachers often use the same words and phrases the book does.Underline any answer that contains specific phrases from the lecture or textbook, and consider those answers more seriously than the others.

, Often, there will be one answer that is obviously too large, and one that is clearly too small; or a date that is way too early or far too recent. You can toss these out, and choose between the remaining answers.For example, if a question on your history test reads, “What year was John F. Kennedy assassinated?,” you can ignore “1863” and “2003,” because those are clearly outside the correct timeframe. Then choose between the remaining options (in this case, the answer would be 1963).
If a math question reads, “What does 4 squared equal?,” you could easily eliminate “2” as being too small, and “200” as being too large. Then choose from the remaining answers (in this case, 16).

,, Often, the choice that contains the most words is correct, because the teacher needs to include a large number of qualifiers to ensure that the answer can't be contested. The teacher may not take the time to phrase incorrect answers in quite such specific terms.For example, imagine a driving test with this question: “If you want to turn right, you should be in:” The answers given are: a) The left lane, b) The lane that's nearest the direction you want to turn, c) the right lane, d) the center lane. The test maker has been most careful in phrasing (correct) option b, to make sure that this answer can't be disputed.
Qualifying phrases might include over a period of time, in rare cases, orwithin a small segment of the population.

Read information out loud.",How to Avoid Getting F's on Tests1," One of the best ways to avoid getting F’s on tests is to attend class and complete your work on time. Tests are usually based off of material discussed in class or from previous assignments, and if you don’t keep up, it will be hard to do well.


Before the test, teachers often discuss the format of the exam or give advice on how to study, and if you’re not present you could miss crucial information.
If you have to miss class or can’t turn in an assignment, ask a classmate or friend to borrow notes. Also, try to complete the assignment even if you can’t receive credit so you’re better prepared for the test.;
, Writing out information will help you remember it, so taking good notes in class or when you’re studying will help ensure you get a great grade on the test.Having clearly written and well-organized notes will also make studying a lot easier.
If you already have notes from class, try recopying them before the exam. This will be a more effective study strategy than simply re-reading them.

, Organizing your study materials will make it a lot easier to prepare for the test. It also helps you feel more in control, confident, and ready to tackle the exam.


Use a binder or folder to keep track of and group your notes.
A planner or calendar can help you remember test dates and due dates, and you can also schedule regular study sessions.

, Familiarizing yourself with the format of the test will help you be as prepared as possible when you sit down to take it. Take the time to do research and ask your teacher questions about the test format.


If this is a standardized exam that many people all over your state or country take, look up some information online about the test. Pay attention to the type of questions they ask, the time limits, and look for any specific test-taking tips or resources that might be available.
If it's an exam for a specific class, ask the teacher if they can tell you about the format of the exam. They might be willing to give you some details

, Taking tests is stressful, especially when you feel a lot of pressure to do well, but negative thoughts can limit your ability to successfully study for the test. Try to push these negative thoughts aside, and replace them with more positive ones.Instead of focusing on how you are going to fail the exam or fail the class if you don’t do well on the test, remind yourself that you’ve been working hard and preparing. Tell yourself that you’re going to do well.
Try visualizing yourself easily answering the questions on the test.

, Although it can be tempting to wait until the last minute to cram for an exam, it won’t help you learn the material or ace the test. The earlier you begin studying, the more prepared you’ll be for the exam.Studying right before the test often makes you feel more panicked and it limits your ability to learn and correctly recall information.
While it might depend on how important the test is and how much material you have to get through, it’s a good idea to start studying at least one week in advance.
If it’s a bigger test such as the SAT, ACT, LSAT, or GRE, you will probably want to spend several months preparing.

, When you begin studying, the amount of material you have to get through can seem overwhelming. To keep from feeling as stressed out and to make your studying more effective, split your studying up so you are only reviewing small amounts of material at one time.For example, instead of trying to memorize a long list of vocabulary terms or definitions all at once, break up the list and focus on small parts each time you study. You will retain the information better and get through the list much faster.
It can also be helpful to switch up the material you are studying. For example, try working one type of math problem during one sitting and then switch to a different type of math problem for your next study session. Your brain has to work harder to decide which strategy to use to solve the problem. Don’t stick to one topic; instead, study a bunch of different material in one sitting.Try to split up your studying into 25 to 50 minute intervals, and take breaks in between. You’ll feel more relaxed while studying and also get through the information more effectively.Education experts describe this technique as “spaced repetition” and have found that it’s much more effective than trying to memorize lots of material all at once., Although you might feel like you need to focus exclusively on your studying, research has shown that taking regular breaks will improve your focus when you return to studying and keep you calm before the test.While you can choose to do anything you enjoy during your break, researchers have concluded that exercise improves your memory and lowers your blood pressure. Walk, jump rope, dance, or jog during your break and get pumped to ace your test. Yoga has also been shown to improve focus and attention span, which might come in handy when taking a test.

, Music, phones, and the television can all distract you while you’re studying, so it’s best to eliminate them while you’re preparing for the exam.If you have to listen to music in the background, choose instrumental music or classical music.
Turn your phone off or put it in another room so you’re not tempted to text, check or your email, or use social media.
If you need the computer to study, disable email alerts, messaging functions, or anything else that might distract you from your goal of doing well on the test.

, Although most of us have stayed up all night studying for a test before, it’s not an effective study approach if you want to avoid getting F’s on tests. It will make you feel more anxious, less prepared, and will interfere with your ability to remember the material you stayed up all night studying.Instead of pulling an all nighter, review the material once more before you go to bed, and make sure you get plenty of sleep. Your brain will keep working to remember the information while you are sleeping.
One psychology study found that pulling an all-nighter actually hurt your ability to reason and remember information for up to 4 days after you stayed up all night.

, While you might have a go-to study spot such as the library or your room when preparing for a test, holing up in one location can actually keep you from remembering the information as effectively. So, instead of remaining in one place, switch locations.A quiet coffee shop, a bench outside, and an empty classroom are all great places to try.

, While it might sound silly, telling yourself a crazy or funny story about the material can help you remember it more quickly and clearly. This technique works particularly well for ordered lists, formulas, or anything with an acronym.The story doesn’t have to make sense or be real, it’s just to help you recall the material.

, When preparing for a test, many of us focus on re-reading chapters and highlighting or underlining material. Research indicates, however, that these methods are not as effective as creating flashcards or taking practice tests.


Make flashcards with a friend and then quiz each other. You could also ask a parent or sibling to quiz you with the flashcards.
If there is a practice test available for the test you are about to take, make sure you take advantage of this resource. Give yourself the appropriate amount of time so you are taking the practice test under the same circumstances that you will take the actual test.
If there isn’t a practice test available, try making your own. If you have a general idea of the test’s format, the act of writing and answering the questions will help you learn and retain the information.

, When you’re studying for a test, read information out loud. It helps you learn the material more quickly and effectively because you are seeing the information as well as hearing it.


Try reading your notes out loud.

Choose “True” answers over “False.,
Examine every part of an answer that includes a reason.,
Be wary of answers containing extreme modifiers.,
Favor answers that use qualifying words.,
Look out for double negatives, and negative prefixes.",How to Answer Hard Questions on a Test4," If you can't decide, mark the answer “True.” Teachers usually find it difficult to make a false statement sound like it's true. Therefore, there are usually more “True” answers on a test than “False” ones., Answers that are phrased to include a reason are often false. The first part of the answer might be true, but then the teacher will add a modifier that is incorrect or incomplete. This makes the entire statement false.Look for words like because, if, since, and when.

For example, consider this statement: “Thomas Edison is considered a brilliant visionary because he invented the electric lightbulb.” Thomas Edison invented many things, but he didn't invent the lightbulb; he invented a longer lasting, incandescent version of the lightbulb.

, Statements that contain words like always, never, everyone, no one, absolutely, best, worst, invariably, all, and only are usually false., Statements containing words and phrases such as usually, sometimes, may apply, probably, some, a majority of, and seldom are more likely to be true than false., Read through the statements very carefully, paying attention to words that employ a negative prefix – for example, inability, unpopular, and insignificant. Misreading these words will completely change the meaning of the statement. A statement that describes something as not uncommon is actually saying the event is common."
"
Look at the first and last sentences, for the main idea.,
Take notes to find the main idea.,
Eliminate answers that are too broad or too narrow in scope.,
Eliminate answers that contradict a statement in the reading.,
Eliminate answers that aren't supported by the writing.,
Look for synonyms, when asked for a specific detail.",How to Answer Hard Questions on a Test5," If you are asked to identify the author's “purpose,” “intent” or “main idea,” try looking closely at the first sentences and the last sentences. If they seem to closely relate to each other, this is a good indication of the main idea the writer was trying to get across.Main idea questions usually contain words and phrases, such as emphasizes, focuses on, is primarily concerned with, or the essence.


, Note key words as you read, and pay attention to words or concepts that are mentioned more than once, or in great detail.Also look for words like although, but, except, unless, and yet, because these words highlight a key idea that the author believed needed to be qualified or clarified.

, Certain answers you can rule out right away, and then focus on the remaining choices.The answer is too broad in scope, or too narrow, to fit the passage. For example, if the reading concerns college students in France, an answer describing all the people of France is too broad. An answer that only pertains to female college students in France would be too narrow.

, If an answer says something that is clearly different from something the author said in the passage, you can rule that one out right away., If there are facts specified in the answer that are not included in the written passage, you can rule out this answer as well., If an answer contains a word that has the same meaning as a main idea in the text, focus on that answer first to see whether it is supported by the reading."

Get sleep.,
Eat a balanced meal before the test.,
Calm pre-test nerves.,
Read the directions carefully.,
Skim through the test.,
Write down key information.,
Skip questions you aren’t sure about.,
Make sure you answer all the questions.,
Review your answers before you hand it in.,
Don’t throw your test away.",How to Avoid Getting F's on Tests2," The night before the test, make sure you get plenty of sleep. Remember, pulling an all-nighter or cramming can actually undermine all your hard work and make you feel more nervous about the test., Being hungry while trying to take an exam can make it difficult to concentrate and might result in poor performance. Make sure you eat before the test.Scientists have determined that foods with antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber are brain boosters, so reach for some trail mix, eat oatmeal, grab a piece of fruit, or eat a tuna sandwich before you head in to the exam.
Don’t choose something greasy or heavy that’s likely to upset your stomach and make you feel ill in the middle of the exam. Also, avoid overloading on junk food and sugary drinks.
A little caffeine can help boost your brain power, but too much will make you feel jittery and anxious during the test, so don’t overdo it.Eating a few minutes before the test might make you feel sleepy and your body will focus more on digestion than thinking, so try to eat a couple hours before the test., It’s totally normal to feel nervous before an exam, but anxiety can make it hard to focus on the exam and cause you to panic. To prevent this from happening, try some of these techniques to settle your nerves right before the big test.Before the exam begins, try staring at the wall for a few minutes. A simple meditative exercise like this one can help soothe your anxiety.
Take a few deep breaths. This can stop your racing thoughts and lower your blood pressure.
Chew gum, if allowed, which can relieve anxiety.
Bring a snack with you if you’re allowed. It can help you feel more calm and distract you from feeling nervous.
Remind yourself that this test is only a small part of your school career, and if doesn’t go well, there will be other opportunities to improve your grade.
Think about something positive and fun that you can do when the exam is over. This will be a reward to help get through the exam and keep you motivated.

, While you might feel rushed when you start the test, don’t dive right in and start answering questions. Take the time to carefully read the directions and make sure you understand how you are supposed to complete the test and respond to the questions.If something is unclear or confusing, don’t be afraid to raise your hand and quietly ask the teacher or test proctor for clarification.

, After you read the directions, it’s also important to take a few minutes and skim through the exam. You will get a good idea of how many questions are on the test and what types of questions are on it. This will allow you to pace yourself and finish on time.A good approach is to start with easier questions and then move on to the harder ones that might take more time or make you feel more nervous. This way, you feel more confident when you get to the difficult material and don’t get bogged down or stuck.

, If there’s something you are worried that you might forget during the test, before you start answering all the questions write it down in the margin of the exam or on scratch paper.This can be especially helpful with dates, formulas, or key terms.

, If there are any questions that you aren’t sure about on the test, mark them with an asterisk or symbol and then move on. You can come back to them after you’ve tackled other questions, and won't waste time.You might think of the answer while you’re working on a different question or it might be easier to recall when you look at it again.

, While it can be overwhelming and upsetting if you don’t know the answer to a question, make sure you put an answer down. Something is better than nothing, and you won’t lose any credit for attempting the question.


You might even guess correctly or receive partial credit for your response, which can help you improve your grade on the exam.

, If you finish the test with time to spare, don’t throw away the opportunity to check your answers or review your work.


You might catch a mistake or be able to improve the wording of a response.

, While you might feel like chucking your test and never looking at it again, it’s important to hang on to the test and review it so you can understand what you did right and what you should work on.


Make a list of the study strategies seemed to help you, so you can definitely employ these next time. At the same time, write down what didn’t seem to help or what you had a hard time with during the exam so you can improve.
If you’re allowed to keep it, your old test can be a useful study tool.
Set up a time to meet with your teacher so you can review the test and learn what you can do to improve your performance. They will appreciate that you’re making an effort and want to do well.

Form a study group or organize a review session.,
Work with your teacher.,
Talk to your parents.,
Sign up for tutoring.,
Seek help for test anxiety, concentration problems, or depression.",How to Avoid Getting F's on Tests3," Studying by yourself can be lonely, but you might also find it easy to get distracted. Instead of going it alone, try organizing a study group with your classmates or setting up a review session.You’ll feel less isolated, and chances are good that someone in the group may understand something that you do not or that you can help other people.
The act of reviewing the material out loud together will also help you absorb the information.
If you organize a review session or study group, make sure you establish guidelines in the beginning so that it is effective. Each person should know what they should do to be ready for the meeting, and you should talk about how you’ll study. Make an agreement to only focus on the material you are reviewing and eliminate distractions.

, If you are struggling to do well on tests, set up a time to talk with your teacher. They might be able to help you identify the problem and adopt more successful preparation and test-taking techniques.They might also be willing to work with you individually so you can improve your score on tests.
Teachers also want to know that you are making an effort, and they will respect your willingness to admit you might need help.

, Although you might worry that your parents will be upset about poor performance on a test, they will be able to help you study for the exam or find someone who can help you study. If you involve them, they’ll also be able to recognize how hard you are working.Your parents have probably taken a lot of tests in their lives and might be able to offer some good tips or study strategies.
Try explaining the test material to them. Even if they aren’t familiar with it, explaining what you are learning and studying to another person helps you retain the information.
Ask if they could help you locate a private tutor.

, Many schools and community centers offer free or reasonably priced tutoring services, so do a little research in your area and consider signing up for tutoring. This will help you stay on track and prepare for tests so you can do your best.If you have an older friend, classmate, or sibling who is familiar with the subject you are studying, ask them to tutor you. Sometimes, this is more comfortable than working with a stranger.

, If test anxiety, concentration problems, depression, or other factors are keeping you from doing well on tests, don’t be afraid to ask for help. This is the first step in feeling better, and if you can address these problems you will find it much easier to do well on tests.Let your parents, teacher, guidance counselor, or school know about your situation. They might be able to provide you with resources or accommodations that will help you be more successful when taking tests.

, This involves using key alphabets to remember and retrieve large amounts of information.

, You need to love and have interest in the subject you want to study. Interest forms a magic elixir and motivates you to learn, and it will help change your wrong concept of studies as a ""mental torture""

, This also helps recall the information more easily.

, Recalling information becomes much easier when you attach significance to the surroundings you studied in. A new environment also breaks the routine and this makes learning more interesting.

, Focus on the good things to come, after your examinations. This will motivate you to accelerate your study mode, knowing that better things like fun and enjoyment are yet to come.

, When mentally tired or when laziness creeps into your study time, do yourself justice by simply reading through the subject material. Read with comprehension and understanding. This will help you tie up information on the day of exams.

, Self doubt will set you back and these feelings will inhibit your study programme.

, Read out loudly. This method utilizes two sensory systems. One is the audio-hearing and the other is visual-seeing. Another alternative is to let someone else recite the information out to you. This technique is very useful as you will associate the study material with a different voice at the back of your mind.

, This will give you more control and enough time to tie up loose ends. Knowing that you have control over the situation, will ensure greater success. This will also avoid nervousness and unnecessary exam jitters.

, Their constant self pity and complaints will do you no good and this will reduce your chances of passing.

, There are others out there feeling the same feelings, experiencing the same insecurities and having the same doubts as you.

Understand the rationale behind an open book exam.,
Locate and mark key information beforehand.,
Strive to understand the material.,
Attend all lectures and class periods.,
Organize your notes.,
Focus on the important things.,
Stay calm.,
Use test taking strategies during the exam.,
Review your answers, if there's time.",How to Take an Open Book Exam," Open book exams do not rely on learn-and-regurgitate learning. Instead, you will have the information in front of you, but what you will be asked is typically quite involved. Open exams are meant to teach students how to take information and apply it in a thoughtful, deep manner. In an open book exam, the focus is not on memorizing information but applying that information. What this means for you is that you will not simply be summarizing material from a textbook. You will be interpreting it in the context of specific questions and scenarios.

For example, you will likely not be asked in a class about Shakespeare, ""What is Romeo's family name?"", more likely it will be, ""Using citations, explain why Romeo's family contributed to his eventual death.""
There are generally two types of open book exams: a restricted type and an unrestricted type. In a restricted exam material is limited to specific documents, such as a single set of notes or single textbook. In an unrestricted exam, there is no limit on what can be brought into the exam room or take-home test. Make sure you know if your exam is restricted or unrestricted before taking the test.Memorization is largely unnecessary for an open book exam. However, this does not mean you do not need to study. This is not the case. Focus is shifted to understanding the material rather than simply being able to memorize and recite it. You will not be asked questions like, ""Define X"" but rather, ""Explain how X applies to Y situation"" or ""What implications does X have on Y current event?"" You should make sure you truly understand the material before entering the exam room.;
, If your exam permits you to take your book in, organize your textbook beforehand to help you locate key information quickly and easily.If permitted, highlighters can be a great tool. Mark key terms, historical dates, equations, and other difficult to remember material that you might need to draw from for questions. You can flip through your book and easily spot the highlighted sections during the exam.
Margin notes can also be a great means of organization, if allowed. Jotting down your instructors commentary or brief summaries of difficult paragraphs in the margins can help you spot important materials fast.
Mark pages. Many people dog-ear important pages, but simple folding can be easy to miss. Try investing in multicolored sticky notes specifically designed for marking pages, which you can buy at most bookstores and department stores. You can even color coordinate any passages you're marking, using different colors to indicate different areas of focus.
In the event of a restricted exam that does not permit a textbook in the exam room, these strategies still have merit. Organizing your book during the course of a class can help you easily spot key information while studying.

, Studying for an open book exam can be tricky as the skills required are not as easy to test as simple memorization. However, there are tricks you can use to make sure you're prepared for an open book exam.


Write your own commentary on information. As you'll be tested primarily on interpretation, write down your own commentary and insight in your notes. Challenge yourself to explain what you think about the material, and why. This helps hone your critical thinking skills, which will be needed for an open book exam.If your professor provided any model questions, answer them while studying. Open book exam questions promote a genuine understanding of the course material, so quizzing yourself using model questions is a great way to make sure you're prepared going in.Team up with other students. While study groups are great for any type of exam, they can be especially helpful for an open book. Rather than quizzing one another on materials, you can discuss and debate information from class. This helps you learn how to apply the information you learned., This should be obvious, but the best way to assure your notes are reflective of the testing material is to attend all lectures and class periods regularly.


Remember, an open book exam is not just memorizing material; it's striving to genuinely understand it. Each professor and teacher has a unique area of focus when it comes to covering reading materials. You can't replicate your instructor's preferences by studying the reading materials alone. You need to attend class.If you do not understand something, note this. Many people will make a notation, such as a big question mark to indicate an area which you do not understand. Leave a section in your notes to be filled in later. Ask other classmates or email your professor if you're struggling to understand this concept.

It is OK not to be clear on something--a good teacher will be happy that you have questions.
If you are still foggy on an area, it's also good to know that. If you have a choice of essay questions, it is good to be able to ascertain quickly which topic to write on.


If your instructor talks fast, consider recording the lectures--with his or her permission first, of course. While you are probably unable to take recordings into a lecture hall, you can always listen after the lecture to try and better catch the material.Some teachers will actually record lectures so that you can review or make up classes, too.
In the event you have to miss due to illness or emergency, have a friend or fellow classmate whose notes you can borrow. Ask someone you know is a good note taker and dedicated student rather than someone who misses frequently and appears disengaged in class.

, You don't want to walk into your exam with a stack of papers covered in random facts and figures. Organize your notes during lectures and then again while prepping for the exam.


Use a system of enumerating and indenting your notes. Many people use roman numerals, using capital letters for headings and lower case for subheadings (e.g., IV and i.v.).Date all of your notes. That way, you can locate subjects that confuse you if you remember the approximate time of year they were reviewed in class.Keep your class notes separate. Use a three-ring binder or notebook to separate one class's notes from another or use a different notebook for each class.Write legibly. If you know your handwriting is sloppy, see if you can bring a laptop to class and type notes. Be careful, however. Many instructors ban laptops as they assume students are using them to disengage with class.While you might be tempted to doodle during dull moments in class, try to refrain from doing so as these drawings will distract you later on while trying to study.Place material you struggle with at the beginning of your notes. This way, you'll have quick access to it during the exam. You should also list equations, key terms, and dates towards the beginning as this information can be tricky to recall and will likely show up on the exam.

, We're sometimes tempted to transcribe more or less entire books or entire lectures when prepping for open book exams. However, this method is not only incredibly time consuming it's ineffective. You'll end up scrambling through pages and pages of notes and run down the clock during exam time.


Pay attention to where the most focus is placed during lectures. If something is written on the board, repeated, or discussed for an extended period it will probably show up on the exam. Include those subjects in your exam notes.Listen at the end of lectures. Oftentimes, your instructor will provide a brief closing statement that summarizes the most important takeaways from that day's class.Compare notes with classmates. If certain subjects overlap, these are probably important areas to focus your notes for the exam. You can also see what key issues you might have missed., Exam anxiety can affect performance, so make sure you know good strategies to keep your nerves in check in the exam room.


Stop studying an hour before the exam and use this time to take care of yourself. Take a walk or eat something light. If you're poring over material right before an exam begins, you'll likely psych yourself out.Know the time and place of the exam and give yourself extra time to get there. Getting lost or running late can increase anxiety and affect performance.Get a good night's sleep before the exam. Anything that affects you physically can affect you mentally, so make sure you're rested and refreshed before entering the exam room.If you start to feel nervous during the exam, take a moment to stop. While time is an issue, plowing through and exam despite feelings of anxiety will lead to a poor overall performance. Do not hesitate to stop, close your eyes, and take several deep breaths to calm yourself before continuing., There are a variety of strategies you can take to make the most of your time during the exam period and improve your chances of getting a great grade.


Your open book exam will probably be timed. Be aware of how much time you have and take a quick moment to calculate roughly how long you should spend on each question.Answer any questions you can without notes first. This will save you time by allowing you to get through certain questions without fumbling with your notes. This also gives you more time with the questions where you might have difficulty and need to consult your notes.If you're really struggling with a question, treat it like you would on any other exam. Simply leave it and come back at the end of the test when you've had time to calm down and gather your thoughts.

, If you have time left at the end of the exam, go through the questions one more time using your notes to your advantage.


Go back through your exam and check areas that include information that's easily mixed up, like dates, names, vocabulary, and equations.
Find any questions that you feel your answers were weak on and try to improve them in the remaining time.

Don't panic. Panic will only make your situation worse. You will be focusing on the horror, and not the upcoming test. Many times, panic can even deter your chances of doing well on the exam. If you panic, take deep breaths (try not to hyperventilate), and think that you can do this.
Activities such as yoga and meditation can help decrease your stress levels. A clearer mind and rejuvenated body will be ready to tackle on an exam.
You're smart enough to realize you need to study days in advance. While some people study the day before, and some people always study this way, realize that last-minute cramming is not the ideal way to study, especially not for the sake of long-term retention of the subject matter. Also make sure not to study too much! Take some breaks for about 5-15 minutes.;
, Most exams cover specific subjects and material, and it's important to know which material or components you need to study. Otherwise, you may be using your precious remaining study time incorrectly. Ask your teacher about the subjects you'll be tested on and which chapters you need to cover. For example: What period in African history? Are diagrams important? Ask your teacher if you're unclear, as they want you to succeed.


Study the most important topics first. Exams usually cover a few core ideas, concepts, or skills. When pinched for time, focus your energies on the very important bits you'll be tested on, rather than scattering your studies everywhere. Review sheets, the highlighted topics in textbooks, and the parts your teacher stressed repeatedly are all clues as to what the most important topics or components are.
Find out how the test will be presented. What types of questions will be on it (multiple choice, essay, word problem, etc.)? Find out how much each section is worth. If you do not know, ask the teacher. This will help you know what the most important sections will be, and how the exam will be presented.

, It may seem like a basic and simple task, but people who make a detailed study plan often have an easier time with studying and they find they have more time to relax and chill. When making a study plan, build in the amount of time you have left before the exam date. Is the exam in a month? Did the teacher spring the test on you suddenly? Is it a mid year exam that has been building since the start of the year? Depending on the time frame, make your study plan long or short.


Determine what subjects you don't know as much about and include more study sessions on these topics. The aspects you know more about still need reviewing, but they will come easier, so try to focus on the more challenging topics.

Plan your time. It's tempting to put everything off until the night before the test. Instead, figure out how much time you will put aside each day for study. Remember to account for breaks. A good rule is: study for a half-hour, have a break for ten minutes.

, Study methods include using colors, pictures and brainstorm or mind map pages. Some people learn and remember things better if they're in certain colors whereas other people may remember diagrams and pictures more easily. Use the method that works for you; as long as it's effective, it doesn't matter what it is. It's no use reading a ton of text if your study method is diagrams. Remember, everyone has different methods to study, what works for your best friend may not work for you.


Use tools that will help you to study. Tools like flash cards may be boring, but really help memorize important things. If flash cards don't seem to help, typing out an outline of your notes may work.
Tape flash cards in random places to quiz yourself. This is a good way to sneak in study time, as discussed below.
Remember to study smarter, not harder.

, It's never too late, and the sessions before the exam are usually for review, which is just what you need. If you're studying and happen to come across a part you can't understand, write it down. Ask your teacher either during class or during office hours. And don't worry – you aren't dumb if you ask questions. Questions mean that you're actively paying attention, and you're learning. Besides, a question ahead of time could mean a better grade on the exam.

, Your textbook, notes, online sources, classmates, teachers, and possibly your family members can all be of use. Old assignments are especially good, as some exams have questions directly off homework.

, You don't get bonus points for doing it alone. Classmates can be helpful in studying, but choose someone who will really help you, not the friend you tend to goof off with. Ask help from your parents or siblings; they may really appreciate being asked. Younger siblings especially like ""quizzing"" older brothers or sisters!


Form a study group. Not only do you have additional help, you also have the advantage of studying with people you know well. However, avoid accepting those that will be of no help, and only distract your whole group from studying. Don't be rude and reject everyone whom you don't like, but do be cautious about who you add to your study group!

, The key to top performance is the ability to memorize all relevant materials. There are tricks for helping to memorize, otherwise called mnemonics. These can include, for instance, poetic or rhyming mnemonics for the auditory learner, visual imagery and fantasy for the visual learner, dance or movement for the kinesthetic learner (as muscles have memory), or some combination. Repetition is another form of memorization that is most commonly used. It allows for high recall if practiced in regular intervals. Practice it even beyond the point at which your memory recall is instantaneous, because this serves as a form of reinforcement.


A common mnemonic is HOMES for the Great Lakes. Another one is drawing stick figures to represent vocabulary words (like a good reason for drawing cartoons!). Create your own mnemonics that suit your needs.
Try rewriting down your notes to study. This is an effective way to memorize.

, Short, repeated periods of study are often more effective than long periods of study. Go over your flash cards while waiting for the bus. Look over a diagram of the spleen while waiting for your breakfast. Read an important quote from ""Macbeth"" while brushing your teeth. Review the information during study halls or extra time at lunch.

, It can help to have a reward to strive for in meeting your goal. Have rewards in place for study milestones and for achieved results, in increasing value to you.

, Be sure you have what you need for the test the night before. If you need a No. 2 pencil, a calculator, a German dictionary, or any other supplies, you must have them. The more put-together you are, the calmer you will be, and the more likely you will do well. Be sure your alarm clock is set, so you won't oversleep.


If you're allowed to take food in, take some jelly babies for a sugary hit, but it's best to stick to healthy fruit and vegetables. Apple or carrots make an easy snack that will help replenish your brain power.
Take a bottle of water with no stickers or labels (these could raise suspicions that you're hiding answers on them).

, Good nutrition is vital for optimal thinking. Try to stay away from high sugar and fatty foods such as ice-cream and cookies. Replace sweet sugary drinks with a cool glass of water or a fresh juice or milk.


Have a ""brain"" meal the night before. Fish makes a great meal the night before, as it is nutrition for your brain. Try eating some fresh vegetables and pasta with the fish.

Eat a good breakfast. It will keep your mind alert. An example of a good breakfast is a glass of juice, an egg, toast, and cheese. If you do have to eat a bowl of cold cereal, make sure it's wholesome and whole-grain, not a sugary brand, or you may experience a 'crash' during the test.
Avoid drinking coffee, as this will only keep you up and provide you a sugar rush. Once the caffeine has worn out, you won't be able to keep your eyes open. Taking a test while you're drowsy is a no-no, so avoid intake of caffeine or any other foods too close to bedtime. All that digesting will keep you awake at night.
Be careful about making any abrupt eating changes; eat what you would normally eat on a regular school day in order to not disrupt your digestive patterns.

, This step is extremely important and cannot be skipped. Without sleep, your chances of doing well on the test quickly lower, because your brain can't focus on what it needs to.


If you can't get to sleep, try some warm milk or tea, but be sure there is no caffeine in your drink!
Do not alter your sleeping patterns. Go to sleep at your regular time in order to keep your sleeping patterns regular.

, Set your alarm clock in the morning; arrive on time or even a few minutes early. If it's a test that requires registration, fees, identification and the like, schedule extra time for that.


Keep a positive attitude! Studying lots, but thinking you can't really ace that exam, will reduce your chances of succeeding. See yourself as acing it, relying on all the preparation and attention you've given your studies to this point. Confidence is the key!
Aim high. Don't just aim to pass the test (if passing the test is quite easy), aim to get an A+. This way, you get a better grade. Plus, if you don't do as well on the next test, your A+ will still keep your overall grade high enough.

Remind the unsuccessful candidate that he or she is only human.,
Show the unsuccessful candidate the advantages of not letting things slide.,
Refrain from mockery and damaging comments.,
Become directly involved in trying to remedy the situation.,
Build and work on the person's self confidence.,
Encourage consistency and commitment.,
Help the student to create stirring visions for his or her future.",How to Offer Encouragement to Someone Who Has Failed an Exam or Test," It happens to all of us some time or another. Sometimes a sensible reminder of the reality that we all err or make mistakes, helps calm and stabilize the situation. Many great and distinguished icons in society have used their failures as a stepping stone to success.;
, Encourage him or her to look to the positive side and to embrace practicing persistence. Remind them that the only real failure is to give up too soon. If it seems that the unsuccessful candidate lacks the motivation or the determination to continue trying, overcome this by focusing on their previous successes in exams, tests, and other challenges, and the strategies they used in those situations.


Take a moment to help them identify the benefits of continuing to stick with their goals over abandoning them - this makes an excellent writing exercise as creating a list can help them to see things more clearly.
Listen to all they want to say.Let them open up and put out all the frustration. It will surely make them feel good. Tell them that failures make us stronger.
If you have time, have a look online for stories about people who have taken exams or tests more than once. You might be surprised how many people have done so! But more to the point, these people eventually succeed because they don't give up.

, Nobody benefits from being called useless, stupid, or having it insinuated that they're incapable of ever getting a thing right. Those kinds of barbs stick and are not motivating; worst of all, saying such comments will assure the person that they are a failure in someone else's eyes, causing them to believe it. If you're already emotionally involved with the person in question and feel a sense of anger or annoyance that they didn't pass (as is the case with some parents), take some time away to calm down before broaching the subject.


You're more likely to be upset if the exam or test involves monetary losses on your behalf. Try to see this as being about the person, not the money. And the money needs to be something that you believe will return to you some day even if it doesn't seem so now. Your support of the candidate will be beneficial in the long-term, whereas going on about lost money will only further rub in the pain for the candidate who is already more than aware of the costs involved.

, Be sensitive to the needs of the candidate when seeking to implement solutions. For example, adult education often involves juggling other roles and responsibilities while trying to achieve a college or part-time degree or diploma and this can eat up a lot of the person's study time. Are there ways that you can help practically? Offer assistance where you can. This might involve helping run errands, helping with household chores, driving them to the exam center etc. Lending a helping hand in small ways can lead to better exam success.


Something to consider is to suggest that the student take a break to refresh before tackling the learning process again. Getting away from it all can restore a battered sense of confidence as new sights, sounds, and experiences bring back their sense of purpose and drive. If you can accompany them and this would be a pleasant thing for the student, then do so.
For all students, consideration to more intensive tutoring might be useful. Talk to the student about his or her feelings concerning such tuition and work from there.
If there is a chance to sit exams earlier than other students, be supportive and alleviate the student's workload elsewhere so that he or she can concentrate just on studying in the lead-up to the exam. This also includes being thoughtful about how you spend your time, such as not making too much noise around the student, or rubbing it in that you have time spare to enjoy yourself while he or she is knuckling down.

, If the student lacks in self esteem and confidence, seek ways to enhance their feelings of self worth. This can be easily achieved through motivational and self help literature and books. This kind of inspirational material is freely available at public libraries or from friends. Of even greater value for many people is the gift of your time to listen to them and to help them through challenges by talking together. Often we are so busy that we don't realize that simply having the chance to talk things through can make a huge difference to a person's self-esteem and can help them identify ways of fixing things for themselves.


In addition to building personal self-confidence, be sure to help them with building exam or test confidence. They did something wrong in order to fail and it's important to pinpoint what that was so that they don't repeat it again. Encourage them to talk to the teachers or lecturers, to read reviews of the exams or tests, and to purchase books that can help them improve the studies in that field.
It might also help to ask them if they feel calm and confident when taking an exam. If not, it may be necessary to focus on some calming skills.

, To pass a difficult test or exam, being committed to this success is vital and important. Ultimately the amount of time spent on learning material will ensure if the student passes or fails. Encourage them to break away from a ""fixed time and schedule"" for studying. Learning and revising the test material can be done at any place and at any time.


Consider making some short-term personal sacrifices if these would help. Things such as not having the TV up too loud while the student is studying, and turning off your light earlier when it's bedtime so that he or she can get a full night's sleep.

, Success breeds success and once the student has a good handle on how to study successfully, this habit becomes part of his or her entire educational cycle. Ultimately, learning how to handle failed exams helps the learning process about failure in general; this leads to a better quality life and most importantly gives the person dignity and independence as an individual.

Don’t cheat.",How to Pass Final Exams," At the beginning of any term, teachers or professors will usually hand out a syllabus with the assignments and expectations for a class. Make sure you read the syllabus carefully to know exactly what you need to do to pass the course.Make sure to pay attention to the breakdown of how assignments, attendance, and exams factor in to your grade. This will help you prioritize how much you need to study, and where to focus your attention.
If you have any questions on the syllabus, ask the professor. It’s much better to ask a question at the beginning than plow on with no idea of what you’re doing.;
, You cannot successfully pass a class or exams if you do not attend the class. This will allow you to hear vital lectures and take notes, as well as help you understand your readings and assignments.Most exams are based on what happens in class, so skipping class is never advisable. Some teachers will penalize absences, meaning you might not even pass the class if you skip.
Teachers and professors usually discuss what is on an exam during classes, so if you aren’t in class you can’t get this crucial information.
If you cannot attend class, let your professor know in advance. Ask her what you will miss in class and if there is anything you can do to make up for the absence and get the information.

Don’t ask your teacher or professor questions like “Did I miss anything in class yesterday?” The assumption is that all days give you valuable information, and questions like this come across as disrespectful of your teacher.
Don’t “zone out.” Sometimes, it’s tempting to play solitaire or check your phone during class instead of listening, especially if you’re in a class you feel you understand pretty well. However, you might miss something important if you do this. Stay attentive for the whole class period., Lectures and discussions are a key component to a class and contain information you will need to pass the exams. By paying attention and taking notes throughout the term, you will have a built in study aid that will help you effectively study without scrambling for additional information.Come prepared. Use a binder or notebook, and bring pens or pencils to class. If you will be discussing things from a book, bring a highlighter too. Teachers will often say things like, “This passage is very significant for understanding ____ in general” or “Make sure you understand the information in this sidebar.” If your teacher notes something specific in class, mark it immediately.Taking notes is a delicate balancing act between getting too little and too much information. You don’t want to write down everything a professor says, just the important information. For example, it’s less important to know what type of planes bombed Dresden in February of 1945 than why the bombing was significant for World War II.
Try using keywords instead of trying to copy out full sentences. Trying to take dictation from your professor could mean you don’t get the essence of what’s really important. Try using key phrases and words instead of full sentences.
Take notes by hand. Studies have shown that people learn more by writing notes instead of typing them in to a computer or recording them on a device.Check out some note-taking systems. There are a bunch of systems for learning how to take notes. Cal Poly has information on several types, along with their pros and cons., Most professors and teachers will assign reading during the semester and then draw upon this as they write the exam. By doing the reading assignments, you will not only be able to participate in class discussions, but will also have the information you need to pass the exam.


Make sure to take notes on the reading assignment as you read. Just like taking notes from lectures, you only need to write down the most important information.Skim back over your reading assignments every few weeks. You don’t have to go through everything in-depth, but going back over the main points will help them “gel” in your memory, so you can access them later on the exam.

, Since class assignments are usually meant to help you learn a subject more thoroughly, it’s important that you do them. They may even serve as practice for an exam question.


The material you use and produce for any type of assignment may show up on an exam. Everything from math or scientific problems to short essays will help you be prepared and pass an exam.
Participating in class discussions will also help you pass an exam because it gives you a chance to verbalize and work out your thoughts with other students and the professor.

, It’s important throughout a term to know what your grade is. If you keep this information in mind, it will help you know how much time you need to devote to studying for an exam.


If you aren’t sure what your grade is, check your syllabus. Most teachers give “weights” to assignments and other course elements (participation, etc.). You should be able to get a rough idea of how you’re doing from this.
If you’re still unsure about your performance, talk with your teacher.

, Teachers and professors have different methods and formats for final exams. Some will make an exam comprehensive, while others will only test on a certain section of the material covered in class. Some exams are essays while others are multiple choice. Finding out what information the exam will cover and its format can help you more effectively study.Check the syllabus to see if this information is on there. Paying attention in class will also help, since most teachers and professors will announce what material the exam will cover.
If you are not sure or missed a day of class, you can ask your teacher or professor, but it’s important to not annoy them with repeated or overly detailed requests. Simply asking “could you please tell me what material I need to know for the exam” is enough to direct your study time., Every individual learns differently. Knowing the conditions under which you study best will help you most effectively learn and retain information that you need for your exam.For example, if you know that you need absolute silence to concentrate on the material you need to learn, you can either study in a library or in a quiet room at home. You may also be someone who needs a little noise or commotion to help you focus.”Multitasking” is a myth. While you might think you’re able to watch TV, text your friends, and study for exams at the same time, your brain simply can’t handle that many competing streams of information. Give yourself some quiet, dedicated study time, and leave the other stuff for your leisure time., Figure out which exams are the most important and devote the most study time to them. By doing this you will optimize your study time and help ensure that you pass your exams.If you are in college and have an exam in one of your major or minor fields, you’ll want to give the most time to studying for these exams over general education courses, for instance.
If you are doing poorly in any class, devote enough time to studying for this class to make sure that you pass it and don’t have to repeat it.

, It is never too early to start studying for a final exam, but a month before the test date is a good time to begin your preparations. This will ensure that you’re not cramming information too close to the exam and then forgetting it on test day.You can study simply by reviewing your notes for 20-30 minutes a day. If you have questions, ask the professor.

, No matter in which class you have an exam, from the easiest subject to the most difficult, you need to study. Even if it’s only reviewing class notes for 30 minutes, studying the material from your class will benefit you on the final exam.


Study by reviewing class notes, thinking of discussions, or going to a study group will often remind you of information you forgot over the course of the term.
It’s important to have confidence that you will pass. But beware of overconfidence, which can sabotage your ability to think clearly about an exam.
Consider making free associations between information you learn and what you know. You can also make up things to help you out.It may also help you to write index cards with information you need to know.

, Taking part in a study group or attending a class study session can be very useful in understanding course material for an exam. Just make sure that you’re actually studying and not socializing.Study groups with friends or classmates can be very helpful study tools. Every person has different strengths with learning and material you may not understand someone else likely will.Teachers and professors will sometimes offer study sessions for their classes. These are an excellent opportunity to learn material that will likely be on an exam as well as ask any lingering questions you may have.

, Studies suggest that changing your environment after spending a long time studying in one place can help improve your brain’s retention.Having a couple of different study spots -- your room, a quiet coffee shop, the library -- may help boost your brainpower., Practice exams are an excellent, highly effective way to study for tests. They will help you relax and point out any weak areas you may have going in to the final exam date. In fact, some studies suggest that practice-testing is a more effective way to study than highlighting, re-reading, or summarizing material.You can take any essay or problem and use it as your mock exam.Make sure you do the mock exam in the same allotted time as the actual exam.If you test yourself just twice, you will remember 75-80% of the material two weeks later. With no practice tests, that figure is just 20%., At some point, you cannot study any longer without stressing yourself out or confusing yourself. Within a day of the exam, set aside your study material and be confident in the fact that you’ve done the work.You will not learn a lot of new content within 24 hours of an exam., It may sound like a good idea to stay up all night cramming, but without sleep, your brain just won’t function. Almost all students pull all-nighters at some point, but they can have damaging effects on your brain for up to four days.Stick to your regular sleep cycle as much as possible. Disrupting your sleep schedule by staying up too late or waking up before your body has fully rested messes with your REM (rapid-eye movement) sleep, which will leave you feeling sluggish and can hinder your memory.Set aside a specific time to study for an exam and use that time wisely. Then, go to bed!Take off at least one full day a week to give your brain and body a chance to rest and recover from studying.

, If you’re not eating properly, your brain won’t be able to function at its best. Getting enough nutrients will allow your body and brain to function optimally on exam day and while you study. Make sure that you eat at regular intervals and don’t mindlessly snack on junk.Try starting your day off with complex carbohydrates, such as oatmeal and whole grains. Complex carbohydrates help your body produce energy that your brain needs to perform.Because they digest slowly over a longer period of time, you’re less likely to get nasty blood sugar spikes and crashes, too.
You might also want to incorporate some eggs into your diet. Eggs contain choline, which is linked to memory and cognitive performance.Oily fish that contain omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, are also tied to brain function. A salmon croquette isn’t going to ace your test for you, but the protein and nutrients will definitely help boost your brainpower.Avoid simple carbohydrates and processed sugar. These may give you a temporary energy bump, but they cause crashes and fatigue later. If you crave something sweet, go for fruits -- especially those that contain vitamin C, which may help improve your mental functioning.Salty snackers may prefer pumpkin seeds or nuts, which have vitamin E and zinc.

, It’s tempting to load up on caffeinated beverages when you’re studying for final exams, but be careful. Caffeine is a diuretic, meaning it will dehydrate you. It can also give you a wicked case of the caffeine jitters. Dehydration can cause fatigue, so drink plenty of plain, clear water.Adolescents (under 18) should limit caffeine intake to about 100mg a day.Depending on the variety, that can be as little as a single cup of coffee, or two 12-ounce cans of cola.Adults should keep caffeine intake between 200mg-400mg a day.Men need, on average, 13 cups (3 liters) of water per day. Women need about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water per day.Get yourself a refillable water bottle. You may be more likely to drink water from a bottle than a glass, especially if you often drink bottled soft drinks.
Avoid alcohol, especially the night before a big exam. In addition to the hangovers and other nasty side effects, alcohol dehydrates you, which can cause fatigue on test day.

, There are several ways that visualization can help you feel more prepared for a final exam. You can use “outcome and process visualization” to help you imagine achieving your goal, and relaxation visualization to help you destress.Use outcome and process visualization to imagine yourself achieving your goal. Imagine what it looks like for you to pass your final exam. Imagine this success in as much detail as possible. Then, imagine the steps you need to take to achieve your goal. In this case, things like “taking notes,” “going to class,” and “studying” are obvious steps you could envision.Use the “palming method” of visualization to help you relax. Close your eyes and cover them with the palms of your hands. Don’t touch your eyeballs. Imagine a scene that’s very relaxing to you, such as a day at the beach or curled up in bed with a good book. Picture as many details as possible to make it realistic, and spend 1-2 minutes enjoying the relaxing scene. Open your eyes and wait 1-2 minutes, then repeat the visualization scene. This process will give you a “safe place” to help you feel calm and relaxed before you sit down to your exam.

, This probably sounds counterintuitive: you wouldn’t have anxiety if you weren’t worried about passing your final exam, right? However, research shows that anxiety blocks your ability to focus, which can really put a damper on your studying and test performance.Try some relaxation techniques when you’re feeling freaked out.


A few minutes of deep breathing will oxygenate your brain and help you feel relaxed and ready to perform. Inhale deeply through your nose for a 4-count. Hold the breath for 1-2 seconds, then slowly release the breath through your mouth for a 4-count. Repeat this 6-8 times per minute for 5 minutes or so.Try yoga. The deep breathing and meditation in yoga have been scientifically shown to reduce test anxiety.Try the “tensing and differential relaxation method.” This involves tensing and relaxing your muscles all at once. Put your feet flat on the floor while sitting in a chair. Grab the seat. Push down with your feet, and pull up on the chair at the same time for 5 seconds. Relax for 5 seconds, then repeat 2-3 times.

, Physical exercise has been proven to reduce stress. It also helps you get better sleep, improves your alertness and concentration, and can even enhance how your brain functions.Regular aerobic exercise can even boost your learning and memory!Get at least 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity activity, such as jogging or brisk walking, per week.Try things that get your heart rate pumping, like swimming, jogging, martial arts, or even dancing.
A little is better than none. Even 20 minutes a day of cardio can boost your memory., Study breaks are important for several reasons. There’s a limit to what your brain can handle in any one study session. Trying to push past that without giving your body any time to recover will just leave you tired.


Your brain consumes glucose when you’re studying. Give yourself a mini-break (5 minutes or so) every hour. Stretch, take a short walk, or grab a brain-boosting snack such as fruit or almonds. This gives your body time to replenish your glucose stores., If you didn’t have time to prepare for your exam in advance, you may need to cram, or learn as much as possible in a short period of time, for the exam. It’s not a very effective way to study, but cramming is better than not preparing at all.


Read over your course notes the morning of the exam. Figure out if there were any subjects the professor highlighted in lectures and focus on these.
If you haven’t done any reading, read the introductions and conclusions of any article and books. This will help you figure out the most important arguments and facts about a subject.
Have a study group with friends the night before the exam if you can. Talk through any points that you may not understand.
Review the hardest stuff right before you go to bed the night before the exam. This may help you recall it more easily during test-time., You will likely be a bit nervous on the day of the exam, and it’s important to stay as calm as possible so that you can effectively take the test. There are different ways to help calm yourself, including have a good breakfast and taking a walk.A good meal will give your body and brain energy to perform their best during the exam.

, You want to make sure that your body and brain are as alert as possible before and during an exam. Eating and drinking the right foods and beverages will help ensure that that you not only are awake but also attentive to your exam.


Don’t eat heavy meals before an exam, which will divert blood from your brain for digestion. Soup or a salad with some protein are good, light choices that will give you energy without weighing you down.
Make sure that you’re hydrated before an exam. One of the symptoms of dehydration is fatigue, so bring a bottle of water with you.
You can have a cup of coffee or tea if you like. One or two cups may temporarily increase feelings of alertness.The effect wears off fairly quickly, however, and more than two cups could actually cause impairment, so use moderation.Chewing mints or mint gum will also help you stay alert. Studies have shown that mints or mint gum increased alertness, accelerated reaction time, and increased how people process information.Don’t load up on sugar just before a test. If you’re craving something sweet, try dark fruits (plums, blueberries, etc.) or a small square of dark chocolate., If you’ve attended class, taken notes, done the assignments, and studied, you can be confident that you’re ready to take the exam. Having this confidence and visualizing yourself passing the exam will help you be successful.


If you attended class, did your work, and studied, you can be confident that you will pass the exam.
If you took the time to go to a study session or discuss the exam and your standing in class with your professor, you can have confidence in your ability to pass the exam.
Knowing that you have formulated a plan to complete each section of the exam will also instill confidence in you.

, In order to help yourself remain calm, make sure to arrive at the exam room before the exam starts. This will not only relax you but also ensure that you can get settled in to take the test.


Make sure to find out where your exam is ahead of time, and note the location in a place you can easily find it later.
Set an alarm so you arrive on time. In fact, setting more than one alarm may help you feel more at ease.

, You only have a certain amount of time to complete an exam, so pace yourself as you work. This will ensure that you get through every section of the exam.Before you start, read over the entire exam and identify the easiest, most difficult, and most time consuming sections of the exam.Break the time of the exam down by section. For example, if you have two hours to finish two essays, you can take one hour to compose each. Or if there is one essay and eight identification and short essays, you can break this up based on time as well as your strengths and weaknesses.Decide on the best strategy for you. After you’ve read the exam, figure out the best strategy to finish the exam based on your strengths and weaknesses., After you’ve given the exam a once-over, approach it strategically. This will help you maximize your knowledge and avoid getting “stuck” on things you don’t know.Answer easy questions first. Not only will this get them out of the way, it can help boost your confidence for the harder stuff.
Eliminate any obviously wrong answers. If you can, cross out any answers that are obviously wrong. Even if you don’t know the right answer, you increase your chances of guessing correctly.
For essay questions, write an outline before writing the essay. Note down your main “argument” or thesis plus the main points you want to hit. This will help you stay on track as you write your response.
Review your answers before you submit your exam. Look for any incomplete or missing answers, errors, etc., Whatever you do to pass an exam, never cheat. Looking at your notes, writing information on your hands, and copying off of another person’s exams are all forms of cheating.


Cheating will guarantee not only that you fail a class, but also could have other significant consequences such as expulsion.

You will probably want to review but you should also take a few hours for yourself. The best way to find a good balance is to use a daily sheet to monitor your activities.Leave time for breaks. It’s important to stop once in a while to allow your brain to rest. Get up, walk around, give yourself a good stretch.Be realistic. Instead of trying to review everything, set priorities. If you target your weaknesses, you will cover far more ground.;
, Stress has an effect on the body and on our ability to study. Try to maintain a healthy diet and remember that moderation is the key. There is no need to drink ten cups of coffee or energy drinks to work more efficiently. If anything, it will make you more nervous and might prevent you from sleeping.Drink plenty of water. It's good for your body and research has demonstrated that it boosts your brain's reaction time.Don’t eat spicy, greasy, or heavy food. It takes longer to digest and could keep you up late.Try a relaxing herbal tea. Chamomile, peppermint, and passionflower are all good choices to help you unwind.Avoid illegal substances. Many students use cognitive-enhancing drugs to get higher grades.It is both illegal and dangerous.
Don’t drink alcohol. You might think it helps you sleep, but alcohol actually disrupts your REM sleep, the type of deep sleep that helps you feel awake and alert the next morning. Plus, you don’t want a hangover the morning of the big exam! Skip the booze -- you’ll be glad you did., Sport is a great way to release the pressure after a hard day of work. You will probably have spent a lot of time in your room studying. Going outside and doing physical activities will relax your muscles and occupy your mind with something fun.Sport is great but avoid dangerous games. You don’t want to break your leg the day before your final exams.
Go with your friends. Combining social and physical activities is rewarding.

, If you’re feeling very jittery, try using an essential herbal oil to help you unwind and relax. Add a few drops to an eye mask or your pillow, or soak in a calming bath. You could use an oil diffuser, too. Lavender has been shown to help people relax, de-stress, and fall asleep.You can also try one of the following to help battle anxiety and stress:Chamomile
Sage
Neroli
Rose
Lemon balm
Bergamot
Jasmine

, The warm water will help you relax and get ready for bed. Add a few drops of lavender or another essential oil to help soothe your nerves., You need a cooling-down period. Listen to some music or read a book. Don’t call a friend to talk about the exams. It will only stress you.


Avoid blue light from screens, such as from phones, TVs, laptops, or tablets, for at least 2-3 hours before you want to sleep. Blue light emitted from screens can interfere with your body’s melatonin production and keep you from sleeping well., Deep breathing can help you relax your body and get ready to sleep. Focus on breathing from your diaphragm and take about 6-8 deep breaths per minute.Place one hand on your belly, below your ribcage, and one hand on your chest.
Inhale through your nose. You should feel the hand on your belly lift as you breathe in. If you don’t, adjust your breathing until you feel your stomach expand as you inhale.
Hold the breath for 1-2 seconds. Then, slowly exhale for a count of 4.
Repeat this 6-8 times per minute for a few minutes.

, Called progressive muscle relaxation, this technique can help you de-stress and get ready for sleep.Begin with your toes and squeeze them as tightly as you can for 5 seconds. Release the tension and relax for 5 seconds. Then, move up to your feet. Curl them towards your knees as hard as you can for 5 seconds. Release the tension and relax for 5 seconds.


Continue tensing and relaxing muscle groups all up your body, including your legs, buttocks, stomach, back, shoulders, neck, and face.

, Having a good night's sleep is important but there is no need to go to bed earlier than usual if you aren’t tired. You don’t want to get nervous in your bed because you can’t sleep. Once in bed, try to keep your mind off your exams. Think about something relaxing, such as your next holiday, or about a happy memory.


If you can’t sleep, get up and go to another room, but don’t turn on the TV or play with your phone. Listen to some quiet music or read a book. You’ll probably feel sleepy in a few minutes, and then you can go back to bed.If you don’t manage to sleep much or at all, don’t panic. Research shows that it might not be as important as you think. Your body can usually handle one night of less sleep because adrenaline will kick in.Don’t forget to set up an alarm. You don’t want to be late.

, You will probably wake up feeling stressed. This is normal and there are ways to keep the anxiety at bay. Take a relaxing shower or a bath and dress for your exam. Wear comfortable clothes to feel at ease. Eat a healthy breakfast and make sure to drink plenty of water. Dehydration can make you feel foggy or tired.Don’t work while eating your breakfast. It is important to dedicate your attention to one activity at a time. Enjoy your food and make sure to start the day with a positive attitude.

, Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day. Studies show that people who eat breakfast tend to perform better on exams.Eat some whole-grain complex carbohydrates, such as oatmeal or low-sugar muesli, that will digest slowly, helping your blood sugar stay steady.A few eggs would also be a good idea, as they contain protein and choline, which may help improve your memory.A portion of fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as mackerel or salmon, may help boost your brainpower.If you’re in a rush, consider some protein-packed yogurt, a banana, and some seeds and nuts. The mixture of carbohydrates and proteins will help power you through the morning.
If you usually enjoy a cup of tea or coffee with breakfast, go ahead! Caffeine may have a positive effect on your memory, according to researchers.Just don’t drink so much that you feel jittery.

, If you have studied seriously, you shouldn’t need more than fifteen minutes to go through your notes or a difficult point. Now is not the time to accumulate more information.


You will probably have the feeling that you forgot everything. It’s a common sensation among students and there is no reason to panic. When asked specific questions during the exam, you will remember what you studied.

, If you feel like panicking, try a relaxation technique. The following techniques should progressively relax your entire body:


Breathe deeply. It might seem unnatural at first but it will slow your heartbeat and lower your blood pressure.
Focus. Sit comfortably, breathe deeply and slowly. Once your body gets used to this, close your eyes and focus on something relaxing. Do this for at least ten minutes.

, Pack your food and a big bottle of water and think about what you need for the exams. Do you need a ruler? A pen? Paper? Make a list and cross every item off once it’s put in the bag. Don’t forget to silence your phone. You don’t want it to ring in the middle of the exam!


Take more than little. It’s better to come prepared and ready than having to borrow what you need for the exam.

, You don’t want to be late for your exam but there is no reason to arrive too early either. Being stuck with other students and comparing your knowledge is not the best way to stay relaxed.


At this point, don’t talk with your friends about the test you’re about to take. Stress is contagious.Don’t let the others make you feel bad. If you have studied, there is no reason to think you will perform worse.
Stay positive even after the exams. It’s sometimes difficult to tell if you did well. Once again, don’t let the others affect your morale. If you’ve done your possible, there’s no reason to panic.

Form a study group.,
Rely on your support group.",How to Feel Confident Before an Exam," To make sure you don’t leave studying to the last minute, create a schedule for when you will study during the days or weeks before the exam. For example, you could commit to studying for one hour a day right after school for one week before the exam.


Making a study schedule can help you to avoid allowing other activities to interfere with studying.
Plan to study for about 45 minutes at a time. It’s difficult to concentrate for more than 45 minutes. You may find it easier to concentrate if you take short breaks once an hour.If the test will cover a lot of material, consider using the “chunking” technique. Break your topic into sections so that you can focus on each one comfortable instead of trying to cover all of the material in every study session.You can then plan your study sessions around specific sections of the material.;
, Choose tools that fit the subject matter and your learning style. Options include flash cards, outlines, timelines, charts, and sample test questions.Create a one-page summary with the most important ideas, equations, or methods for the exam. The process of creating this summary will prompt you to identify the most important information that you need to know for the exam, which will help you to study more efficiently. If the exam is open-book, this summary sheet can also be a helpful guide to your notes or textbook while you’re taking the test.Keep your learning style in mind when creating your study tools. For example, if you are a more visual learner, you may retain more information by drawing diagrams or mindmaps., You’ll need to prepare differently depending on whether your exam will require you to write an essay or answer multiple choice questions. Make sure you know what kind of test you’ll be taking and prepare accordingly.If you are taking a standardized test, take a few practice tests to familiarize yourself with the structure and timing of the test. For national standardized tests like the SAT, you will be able to find copies of previous versions of the test which you can take for practice.If you will be taking an essay exam, practice writing essay responses while you study. It can be helpful to time yourself so that you know you’ll be able to complete the essay during the allotted test period.
If your test involves a lot of memorized material, remember that you probably won’t remember everything on the first try. Memorization and recall improve with repetition., Make sure that you have everything you need -- pencils, pens, a calculator, your notes -- to take the test prepared and ready to go the night before to avoid test day anxiety.If you’ll be using a calculator or other electronic device, check the batteries and/or bring a spare with you.Find out which optional items you are allowed to bring, such as snacks or your textbook for an open-book test.

, Scientific research has shown that our expectations can affect our performance. If you expect to do well on the exam, you will still have to study; but if you expect to do poorly, studying may not be enough to help you do well.Practice self-affirmation - the process of transforming your thoughts to focus on the positive and downplay the negative. For example, remind yourself that you worked hard to prepare for this test.
Challenge your negative thoughts. For example, if you think that doing badly on the exam will ruin your life, tell yourself that this is not true. Then replace that thought with a more accurate one - failing a test may hurt your grade, but it’s not the end of the world.If you’re having a hard time quelling negative thoughts, try distracting yourself using humor. Watch a funny movie or TV show, read a funny book or comic. You can even try to remember all of the jokes you know., Remind yourself that your grade on this one test will not determine your success or failure in life. Even an extremely important test such as the bar exam can be taken again if you don’t pass.


Research shows that some anxiety can actually help your test performance. Remind yourself that manageable levels of anxiety can increase your alertness and energy.To combat anxiety that arises when you’re first given the exam, make sure to read over the entire test before beginning. Look for “easy” questions - when you’re prepared, you shouldn’t have trouble finding them. Finding the questions you’re sure you know the answers to will help to remind you that you do know the material., While you’re studying, imagine yourself taking the test and answering the questions with confidence. Imagine yourself getting the test back with the grade you want. While visualization can’t replace preparation, it can help you to feel more confident, which can improve performance. Visualization works because your brain and body react to visualization as if you were actually experiencing the event you’re imagining. Your brain forms and strengthens connections as a result - in this case, between test taking and success., Fear releases adrenaline, preparing the body to deal with danger. Your heart rate and breathing speed up and you may feel shaky, sweaty, and/or dizzy. Anything you can do to counteract these physical reactions will help you think more clearly and feel more confident. Remember to use these techniques during the test if you feel anxious.Calming techniques include:


Breathing. Breathing exercises can help you to relax, including slow, abdominal breathing and ‘equal breathing’ - equalizing the time you spend breathing in and breathing out. Stretching. You don’t have to do a full yoga routine to get the benefits of stretching. Try stretching your arms above your head and behind your back to release shoulder tension; standing forward bends can release back and neck tension.Relaxing your muscles. You may not even be aware that you’re holding tension in your muscles. To become aware, try a body scan, which involves focusing on each body part for a few seconds, starting with the toes and moving up progressively to the top of your head.Walking. Moving your body will help clear your mind. Just remember to pay attention to your surroundings -- don’t spend the whole walk worrying about the exam!

, Don’t skip breakfast to study. Make sure you eat something an hour or two before taking the test. Choose protein-filled snacks and avoid sugar, which can give you quick energy that may run out in the middle of the exam..


Eat something even if you feel nauseous - try crackers or toast to settle your stomach.Avoid caffeine and energy drinks, which can increase anxiety., Studies have shown that you will do better on an exam if you get enough sleep than if you spend all night studying.If the test is later in the day or the evening, or if you just couldn’t get a full night’s sleep, take a nap. Research has shown that a short nap - less than an hour - can improve alertness, memory, creativity, productivity, and mood, and can decrease stress., Don’t just rely on your books and notes. If you have a question as you study, ask your teacher, parent, or tutor. You’ll feel more confident knowing you got the answer to your question from the most reliable source.


Don’t forget to ask your teacher what materials will be covered. For example, ask if the exam will be based on homework, reading assignments, and/or on class discussion.If you are having trouble understanding a topic, you can also ask a librarian to help you find other resources that you can use for clarification.

, Make sure you study with other students who are serious about studying. You’ll feel more confident if you have worked with other students to make sure you are studying the right information and understanding the material.


Invite students at a variety of ability levels into the group. Students can learn from teaching each other.The members of a study group may benefit from sharing class notes. Different students may have taken note of different information during class - compiling and verifying this information from a number of students can help ensure you know the material that will be on the exam., Friends and family may not be able to help you understand calculus or learn French, but they can help you to feel more confident.


Ask a member of your support group to let you explain the material that will be on the test to them. You need a solid understanding of a concept to be able to explain it to someone who doesn’t know much about it. If you can explain the Second Law of Thermodynamics or the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire to your grandmother, you may feel more confident that you have a grasp of the material.
Friends and family may also be able to help you in peripheral ways. For example, if you know you tend to sleep through your alarm clock, ask a reliable member of your support group to call you to make sure you’re awake.

Make plans to celebrate when the results come out.,
Get organized for next term.,
Open your results on your own terms.",How to Calm Post Exam Nerves," Stress and anxiety trigger your body’s “fight or flight” response, flooding your body with adrenaline and making your breaths shallow and rapid.Fight this stress response by taking some calming deep breaths.Put one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen, below your ribcage. As you inhale, you should feel your abdomen expand along with your chest.
Inhale slowly through your nose. Try to inhale for a count of 4.
Hold the breath for 1-2 seconds. Release the breath slowly through your mouth.
Repeat this process 6-10 times per minute for ten minutes.;
, Progressive Muscle Relaxation, or PMR, can be very helpful in releasing tension and stress. When you’re stressed, your body tenses up, which you may not even realize while you’re anxious. PMR teaches you to consciously tense and then release your muscles in groups from head to toe. Once you get the hang of it, it’s a helpful way to force your body to relax a bit.Find a quiet place free of distractions, if you can. Loosen any tight clothing and take a few deep breaths.
Begin with the muscles in your face, starting with your forehead. Raise your eyebrows as high as they will go, and hold this tension for 5 seconds. Release the tension. Furrow your eyebrows together as hard as you can for 5 seconds, then release. Enjoy the sensation of relaxation for 15 seconds.
Move to your lips. Purse them as tightly as you can for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Smile as widely as you can for 5 seconds, then release the tension. Again, enjoy the relaxing sensation for 15 seconds. You want to learn what “relaxed” and “tense” truly feel like.
Continue holding tension in each muscle group for 5 seconds, releasing, and relaxing for 15 seconds for the other muscle groups: neck, shoulders, arms, chest, stomach, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, and feet.
If you don’t have time for a full-body PMR, focus on your facial muscles, since they can hold an incredible amount of tension.

, Some people find it comforting to talk to friends a little about what they wrote, whereas some find it much better not to talk about the exam at all. However, going over the exam in great depth, no matter how tempting it is to do so, will only make you worry about answers you can’t change and will unnecessarily stress you out.Going over the exam immediately afterwards is also a bad idea because your brain does not perform well under stressful conditions. You will likely not be thinking as clearly or rationally about your performance right after a stressful exam as you will be once you’ve had a while to cool down. You’ll probably feel like you performed much worse than you actually did., You might not feel like hitting the gym or going for a run directly after an exam, but getting some moderate physical activity in is a great way to reduce stress! Exercise produces endorphins, which are natural painkillers that boost your mood. If you’re stressed out over your exam, try an aerobic activity like running, swimming, cycling, or even a brisk walk.Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to decrease overall feelings of stress and tension, improve your sleep, and elevate your mood. Even if you aren’t a huge fan of exercise, getting some on a regular basis will help you feel better., Regardless of your results, you should celebrate the fact that you worked hard on your exams. Reward yourself by doing something you enjoy. If you can do it with friends, all the better.Studies have shown that spending time with friends and loved ones is an excellent way to bust stress and promote a sense of calm and well-being.One study even showed that spending time with a person you consider a “best friend” lowers the levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in your body.Make a plan to go out with your mates or see your family after exams.

, Laughter really is the best medicine. It releases endorphins that make you feel happy, and can even increase your body’s ability to tolerate physical pain.Go see a funny film. Watch your favorite comedy show. Look up pictures of funny cats on the internet. Whatever makes you laugh will help you sort out your post-exam stress.

, “Ruminating” is that “broken-record” loop where you find yourself thinking about the same thing over and over, generally without having anything to add to the thought. It’s common to ruminate about things like exams, but you need to remember that worrying about them after the fact will not have any effect other than causing you stress. Here are some ways to break that broken-record thought loop:Try problem-solving instead. Worrying about whether you did badly on your exams can’t change how you performed in the past. It could, however, keep you from performing well in the future. If you’re worried about how you did, try to identify a few concrete things that you can do for the next exam you take. This keeps you focused on positive action for the future.
Figure out what you’re really worried about. Often, stress over exams is actually stress over something else, such as failing a course or worry that you will look foolish. Identifying your real fear will help you face it -- and realize that you can handle it.Schedule a “worry break.” Take 20-30 minutes to worry about your exam. It’s often helpful to allow yourself scheduled time to acknowledge negative thoughts, rather than trying to simply ignore them. Set a timer and indulge in your worries. Once the time is up, move to something positive and productive., Usually, you collect your exam results at your college or school but some universities provide an online service for checking results.


If you aren't around on results day, make sure you have arranged to have the results sent to your house or the address you will be staying at.
Don’t obsessively check for results if they’re available online. Refreshing your browser every 5 minutes won’t make results come out faster, but it may up your stress and worry levels.

, Studies have shown that humans “catch” emotions about as easily as we catch colds.If you hang out only with people who are also stressed about their exam results, you won’t be able to soothe your own nerves.


Try hanging out with people who are handling their stress well. Don’t talk about exams or worries when you are together. Focus on positive thinking and fun with each other instead.

, The human brain has a strong negative bias, meaning we generally focus more on the negative things and allow the positive things to slip past us.Identifying and reminding yourself of your strengths will help you combat this bias to make sure you’re giving yourself a fair shot.Try making a list of things that you know you do well, and things that you can be positive about. For example, if you have studied and revised carefully, acknowledge that as a strength.

, All you can do is to control your actions. You’ve done that by working hard and taking your exams. The rest isn’t up to you. Letting go of your need to control outcomes -- which can’t be done -- can be incredibly helpful to reduce stress., Make Plan B for if you do worse than expected but not terribly. Make Plan C for if the worst really does come to pass.


For example, if you have just finished your GCSEs and want to go on to sixth form, Plan A would be to go on to sixth form. Plan B might be to still go on to sixth form but to take different courses with lower entry requirements. Plan C might be to try to get a part-time job whilst arranging re-sits.
If the exam is for a single course, rather than something like GSCEs, Plan A might be to continue on with your other required college courses. Plan B might be to see if you can re-take the exam or make up your grade with extra credit. Plan C might be to re-take the course after getting some tutoring or taking a remedial course.
You should also talk this plan over with your parents and friends to get an objective view of things - sometimes, when you're nervous or upset, you can start to make silly and illogical choices!
Considering the worst-case scenario can actually help you bust stress if you do it rationally. Think about what the worst thing is that can happen. Can you handle it, really? The answer will almost universally be “yes.”, Planning something enjoyable for results day will give you something to look forward to instead of just fearing the day., After you’ve enjoyed some relaxation and celebration time, start sorting out and organising any notes, books or paperwork you will need to have ready for the next academic term. Not only will it take your mind off of the wait for the exam results, it will also make sure you don't have any last minute panics before the next term begins.Make sure to take a complete break from schoolwork before going back to it, though. Give your brain time to refresh itself, or you could face burnout.

, Some people like to open their results in front of their friends, some people prefer to have their parents with them, whilst others prefer to find a quiet place where they can deal with the result by themselves. Don't let anybody push you to open them at any other time than one you are comfortable with.


Make sure that you do actually face your results, even if you expect them to be unpleasant. It’s natural for people to want to avoid unpleasant experiences, but you need to know how you performed on your exams. Don’t let yourself procrastinate out of fear.If you really can’t face opening your results on your own, ask someone else to do it for you and share the results with you. Sometimes, it can be helpful to share the experience with a friend.

Allow your children to have some downtime after school.",How to Help Your Child Excel in Elementary School," Students who perform below grade level are at a disadvantage, not only during the following school year, but throughout their educational experience. Students who cannot locate the information they need, understand the meaning of words or utilize other essential learning skills are far more likely to drop out of school.;
, It’s important for you to realize that starting a new grade is a major milestone in a child’s life. Your child, although excited at the prospect, may have some fear and anxiety about beginning each school year in a different class with a different teacher. Ease his fears and concerns before school begins, so that he feels confident and happy on the first day of school in his new grade level.

, Find out what the curriculum will be for the school year, and ask your child’s teacher to give you a list of milestones the students are expected to meet throughout the school year.

, Volunteer to work at the school in some capacity. Studies have indicated that a parent’s physical presence in his child’s classroom is a better predictor of the child’s literary development than that of the family’s income level. Your physical presence is a powerful way to tell your child that you care enough to be involved. This message reinforces your child’s self-esteem and confidence, as well as his desire to excel academically.

, Children learn differently, or their ability to learn is affected, by physical and emotional development. It’s perfectly natural for a second grader to be antsy and to have trouble concentrating. Knowing that will help you devise ways to help your child settle down long enough to do his or her homework.

, It’s important to praise your child for his abilities, but it is just as important to praise them for trying, even if they don’t succeed. Children who are praised for their work effort are more likely to focus on their studies

, Watch TV programs with your child. Mute the commercials and ask your child questions about what he just watched. Ask him about the characters and the story line. This will help foster his cognition skills, and will help him when he has to write book reports. He can draw upon this skill of summarizing a plot and becoming a critical thinker. Watch shows together that can teach moral and ethical lessons, as well as academic ones. Keep a globe nearby and incorporate geography into your daily TV viewing. If your child watches a program that takes place in Nigeria, have him find Nigeria on the globe. If he watches a program about bird migration, ask him to trace the migratory paths on the globe.

, Avoid talking to your child in simplistic terms. Use complex words and help him look the words up in the dictionary. Go a step further and ask your child to try to use the new word in a sentence.

, Natural settings are great for decreasing stress, which aids your child’s ability to learn. Go for regular walks or hikes with your child and help him discover the natural world around him.

, Arrange for your child to take music or dance lessons. Every activity your child engages in is a learning opportunity, and every activity he masters or becomes proficient at will increase his confidence.

, Encourage your child to add to his book collection. You can find books at bargain prices at tag sales and library book sales. Studies have shown that children who have a small home library score higher in math and reading than children who don’t have daily access to books.


Help your child with reading. A solid command of language and literacy is the most important asset your child can have. If a child has excellent reading and comprehension skills, he can learn any subject.
Read to your child every night.
Encourage your child to read out loud.
Make a game out of reading everywhere you go. Point out road signs; help your child read a menu, or a movie marquee. You won’t just be helping him to become a better reader, you will showing him that reading is an important skill that he will use every day in every situation.
Discuss stories and books with your child. Ask him to make comparisons between the events in the story and in his life. Have discussions that allow your child to compare the similarities and differences between different stories and experiences. Make sure your child sees adults and older siblings in the house reading and writing.

, Ask him to write shopping lists; have him write thank you notes and encourage him to write in a journal or diary.

, Children who are physically active get better academic scores. Physical activity doesn’t just keep your child’s body healthy; it improves his mind as well.

, Doing chores can help your child learn valuable skills. Young children can better grasp the concepts of math, time and money by doing simple chores around the home. Have your child help you cook and use measurements. Give him a modest allowance and teach him about money. Buy a coin counter and help him distinguish monetary denominations. Play “store” and teach him how to count back change after a purchase.

, They will do their homework better and have a better attitude towards it if they have been allowed to blow off some steam first. No one wants to sit down and do more schoolwork after sitting in a class room all day.

Understand fully that the IQ test is used to describe and not categorize a person.,
Always be aware of the fact that intelligence is composed of several different functions.,
View IQ tests as both a measure of prior achievement and a predictor of future achievement.,
Realize that there are many other psychological functions that are not measured by the IQ Tests.,
Do not stereotype or label anyone with a low IQ score.",How to Avoid Misunderstandings Concerning the Intelligent Quotient (IQ) Tests," Unfortunately, IQ tests are often used in a labeling manner by teachers and other educators who often lack sufficient training in the field of IQ testing. As a result, a lot of psychological damage can be done when such information is not handled correctly. By labeling a person as the sum of the results of their IQ test, the person is doomed to negative reinforcement of the test results as if that is all there is to the person and intelligence limits are absolute.


Do you perhaps know of a school friend who was perhaps labelled ""dull"" at school, but who later became very successful, exceeding all expectations? It may even be true of yourself.
This cuts both ways. Being labelled as having a high IQ can place unrealistic expectations on a person to always be ""the intelligent one"", funneling the person's development into certain fields even if they don't want to do these things or are a bad fit overall. Moreover, being labelled as intelligent can actually lower emotional intelligence as a person over relies on IQ as a form of social acceptance and fails to hone EQ adequately.;
, Intelligence as stated by an IQ test is not a measure of a single ability. Considering someone to be intelligent or not intelligent based on academic achievement alone is an example of such an erroneous interpretation. And intelligence does not equate with achievement; many a person who didn't have ""book smarts"" has had ""street or business smarts"" and achieved a great deal outside of the academic stream. Moreover, the qualifications for successful achievement differ between cultures, as well as being historically grounded - what may be taken as achievement in one century or decade may be viewed as not so useful in another.


Can you think of people who are not intelligent in the ""conventional"" (psychometric, IQ score) sense, but who are achieving or have achieved much in life and who are making or have made a success of their lives? As an example, it was stated that Einstein was not a good scholar, but he nevertheless became one of the most noted scientists of our time.

, It is important to note that achievement here refers to scholastic/academic achievement, because these are the types of criteria used to evaluate and assess IQ tests.

, Aspects such as musical ability, artistic ability or creativity are not covered by the IQ Tests. Success in some fields do not require a high IQ, as measured in the conventional way. And emotional intelligence (EQ) is not covered by IQ tests either. Nor do IQ tests account for people who perform badly under test situations or being tested in the manner in which IQ tests are undertaken. People's emotional states and level of motivation clearly affect performance in general, as well as performance in IQ tests. If people come to a test situation emotionally upset due to some personal crisis, it is clear that their scores that day will not be a true indication of their usual ability. Being distracted, emotionally upset and poor concentration will not allow them to perform at their best.

, The points above are important indicators for every person to remember. Ignorance on these issues can have disastrous repercussions for the growing child, who can very easily be made to feel inadequate in the community or in social circles. Words are powerful and must be used with caution!


Stigmatizing a child whose IQ is not high or even average is bigoted and prejudiced. A child whose IQ is mediocre or low does not equate with their fulfillment in life. IQ does not determine how a person loves, is lovable, or whether he or she is likely to lead a happier, more fulfilling life. Each child is a unique individual in need of acceptance for who he or she is. Sometimes mental differences need addressing to ensure the highest possible level of functioning but a child remains the unique, inspiring and incredible individual he or she was born, regardless of the IQ outcome. We are all special in our own way.
Bear in mind that a desire to stereotype or confine other human beings to one's own idea of intelligence is about wanting to control others. We can only control ourselves and the best we can do for others is to motivate them to be their very best.
Remember that ""smart people do dumb things"" as much as anyone else in the community. Confining intelligence to meaning one set of currently valued traits is very limiting and unrealistic, and unhelpful to the whole education system.

"
"
Determine what the real issue or problem is.,
Speak with the child's teacher/instructor on what he or she thinks the issue is.,
What are your own limitations, as a parent, tutor, friend, etc.,
Survey the situation.,
Put together a plan, using what you know about the situation, for improvement.,
Stick to the plan, but also adjust as you get new information or results.

,
When the class/subject is over, re-asses the results, and see if you would like your child to go at a slower pace in future classes, or if they are now ready to progress without as much monitoring.

",How to Help a Failing Child to Pass," Does the child have comprehension problems, or is something distracting him or her in class?;
, Communication is key in getting help from the teacher/school, and to also let that person know that you are interested in helping fix the issue.

, with this same topic? Are you knowledgeable enough to be qualified to help your child, or will you require a tutor who has that extra experience?

, What parts of this subject is the child unclear or failing to understand, and what can be done to address this? The teacher/school can be very helpful in this respect, and you can also find online assessment tests to do your own testing on where the child's current level of achievement in the subject is.

, Set goals/benchmarks, and also set up rewards to motivate. Make sure to actually follow-through on the rewards, or this will backfire! You should have a scheduled amount of extra time spent on the topic, as well as reviews of the material before the test, and reviews after the test to highlight what went right, and to re-examine and re-work what went badly.

Plan to meet and greet.",How to Get Your Child Ready for Back To School," Whether your child is returning to the same school or starting at a new one, it's always a good idea to get the lowdown on any changes at the school.


Is there a new principal?
Who are your child's teachers?
What's going on with the curriculum?
What tests will be administered to your child?;
, As most school districts in the northern hemisphere start in September (or in February in the southern hemisphere), many schools tend to be open up to a month before first term starts. You can call the school directly and speak with an administrator, or visit the school for information. You may also be able to check on a website or webpage for extra info.

, During the summer, staying up late and sleeping in are the norm. But as the start of school draws near, children need to get back into a routine.


About three weeks before school starts, have your child go to bed 15 minutes earlier at night and get up 15 minutes earlier in the morning.
When school is two weeks away, have your child go to bed 30 minutes earlier at night and get up thirty minutes earlier in the morning.
When your child is about to start school in a week, have him or her go to bed an hour earlier at night and get up an hour earlier in the morning.

,, In addition, if you're not already doing this, have your child lay out her or his clothes before going to bed. That will teach your child to get organized and be prepared in case she/he (or you) are running late in the morning.

, Regardless of whether or not you're a teacher, we all have knowledge to pass on to our kids.


What were your strengths in school? Reading? Writing? Science? Math? Whatever your favorite subject, use what you've learned in school and in life to go over some of the basics with your child.

, In essence, you can play school with your child. It should be in a room without distractions (i.e. no TV or video games) and geared towards learning (i.e. den, family library or home office). A run-through of the basics should take no more than 30 minutes to an hour and should be done two to three times a week. This is an excellent opportunity to see where your child needs help and to pass that information on to his teachers.

, This will help the child to get a good start, even if he or she is yet to learn the alphabet or how to write numbers.

, Depending on your child's grade level (K0-12), the type of supplies needed will vary. Some schools sends a list out a couple of weeks before the school year. If no such list is provided, what your child needs for school can be determined by a trip to a suitable schools supply store. Every August, these stores often provide free school supply lists for their customers, arranged by grade level.


You can contact the school directly to find out what supplies your child will need.

, The first day of school has arrived. This is a big day for you and your child. This is the time to go with your child on his/her first day and introduce yourself to the teachers. As your child settles into his/her classroom, you can have a quick sidebar with the teacher to find out who she or he is and what your teacher is planning to teach your child.

Be sure to exchange contact information with the teacher. The teacher should provide you with a copy of a lesson plan or syllabus that gives you the gist of what will be taught in class.
Don't be afraid to ask questions of everyone you meet. You and the teachers should work together for the benefit of your child.

If they reply, they will tell you either that you have gotten the scholarship, or that you have to take  an assessment before they decide.,
Study for the assessment!,
Try to remain focused when testing.,
Choose a program.,
Realise that some people might be jealous.,
Enjoy your time at school!",How to Get Private School Scholarships in the UK," These usually include sports, music, and academic, but there are generally other options too.;
, For example, if you're really good at sports, you could get a sports scholarship, or if you're intelligent, you could get an academic scholarship.

, For example, if you picked the sports scholarship to try and get, find out what sports you'd have to be able to do, how many, and whether there is a test/assessment or not.

, For example, if one of the requirements is that you are able to play two or more of the sports the school has teams for, but you only play one sport, you would not be able to get that scholarship. If this happens, you can try to find another scholarship. However, if you have a lot of time before you have to submit the scholarship application, you could try to meet the requirements before then; for example, you could start another sport.

, You could also see if you fit the requirements for any other scholarships too.

, There is often a scholarship form on the school's website, but if there isn't, you can ring up the school and ask for one. Make sure you get the form in before the deadline- for some schools, the deadline can be a year or more before the first day of school. However, most schools (that aren't sixth forms) accept scholarship applications closer to the first day of the school year. Sixth forms ask for the forms further in advance.

, If it doesn't have the right information on it, the school may not even consider you for a scholarship.

, Now that you've sent in your form, all you can do is wait for the school to tell you whether they will proceed with your application or not. In the meantime, you could work on your sports skills or music, or try to study for any academic tests they might give you.

, If they don't reply, it might be worth ringing them to check that they received the application.

, The school will probably tell you what they will test you on and how they will do it. However, in case they don't, here's how to study for different types of assessment:


If you applied for a sports scholarship, practice the sports you told the school you did. They will probably want to see you doing them. If you're in secondary school or above, they may also give you a test on the sports, to make sure you know the rules.
If you applied for a music scholarship, practice your best pieces, on all the instruments you put on the application. Also work on you music theory, in case they test you on it. In the UK, if you are at a certain grade in your instrument(s), for example Grade 3 in piano, practice pieces that are at that grade.
If you applied for an academic scholarship, study the subject(s) you applied with. They will almost definitely test you on them. Try to learn not only the information for your age level, but also information for higher levels, to show them you are above average for your subject(s). Sometimes, the school will say you can't study for the test, as there's nothing you can memorise. Although that may be the case, you can still practice the subject.
If you applied for a drama scholarship, practice reading and acting pieces. The school might let you pick a piece to read for the assessment, or it will tell you which ones to read. If you get to pick, try to pick pieces that are very different to show you are talented in more than just one type of piece.
if you applied for an art scholarship, pick pieces for your portfolio, as they might want to see it. Pick pieces that are in sections (for example, a sketch, then the same picture sketched and painted) so the school can see how you work. Also, try to pick different types of pieces, so the school can see you are talented in multiple ways. For example, pick a painting, and a drawing, and a sculpture, and a collage. Also pick pieces that are different in style; for example, a dark piece and a light piece.
if you applied for an all-rounder scholarship, or a scholarship that covers multiple topics, try to study them all!
If you applied for a scholarship that isn't listed above, practice and study your topic until you think that you would do well on a test!

, There isn't much more you can do but try your best!

, Some schools have special programs for people with scholarships. For example, people who got an academic scholarship could be part of an Academic Scholars group which encourages all members to do academic clubs, such as a writing club. However, not all schools do this. If your school does, try to do what the group tells you, because it will help you develop in that area!

, Some people might try to bully you for getting a scholarship. They might say that you got it because you were too poor to afford the fees for the school, and other things like that. Even if what they're saying is true, don't let them get to you: usually, they're just jealous because they know you're better at the topic than them. If they say anything like that, just think of a comeback. For example, ""I don't really care what you think- I'm proud of my scholarship. It means that I'm good at art, not that I'm poor."" If the people continue to bully you, tell a teacher. Practically all private schools don't permit that kind of thing, and will try to stop it immediately.

, But, don't slack off––if you do badly at the topic you got the scholarship for, the school might take your scholarship away. This would be really unfortunate, especially if the only way your family could afford the school was because of the scholarship. If that's the case, it's likely you'd have to leave the school.

Find a time when your child is calm and cheerful.,
Lay out a set of building blocks in assorted shapes and sizes.,
Let your child engage in free play with the blocks.,
Ask your child to build a structure such as a bridge, enclosure, or house.,
Build vocabulary and measuring skills during construction.,
Practice counting while assembling the building blocks.,
Admire your child’s work and let them survey it before disassembling.",How to Introduce Your Kids to Math Games1," While pedagogues used to hypothesize that children’s brains work best in the morning, recent research has concluded that every individual has a different circadian rhythm—that is, a different daily schedule when their body and brain work most efficiently.While you probably can’t adjust your child’s schooling to fit their natural rhythms, you can make sure that any at-home lessons or games take place when your child is feeling receptive and mentally sharp.


The best way to gauge your child’s receptiveness is through simple observation: when your child is smiling, laughing, or looks interested and alert, start introducing them to math games. Studies have shown that people learn more effectively and perform better at problem-solving tasks when they are experiencing positive emotions, so your child’s frame of mind is particularly important for getting them interested in educational games.In the same way, never try to force your child to participate in math games or lessons when they’re fussy, tired, or generally unruly. Not only will they learn poorly—if at all—but they’ll develop negative associations with the games and subjects you’re trying to teach going forward.;
, One of the best ways to start learning about fundamental mathematic principles is by playing with building blocks. These simple toys allow your children to start counting, measuring, and understanding geometrical shapes in a hands-on activity. The active nature of this game is particularly important, as countless studies have shown that children learn best through active, concrete experiences, games, and lessons, rather than through passive ones.Wood building blocks are the classic building block material which you probably remember from your own childhood, but you can also use plastic or ceramic blocks. Just be sure to check the label for a child-safe stamp which indicates that there are no harmful chemical paints or detachable features on the toy.

, Your child has probably already played with some kind of building block before, so they won’t be accustomed to using them in an organized task or game. Let them warm up by playing around with these familiar objects as they normally would for a few minutes before introducing them to the new game.

, Your child has probably already built several structures during their free play, but assigning a specific structure to them will develop what’s called “spatial thinking.” In this kind of thought process, they learn to think about design and shapes in relation to one another, as well as how to apply these plans or ideas to concrete materials.Make it a challenge by seeing whether you or your child can make the same structure more quickly, or who can make the tallest structure, use the most blocks, or incorporate the most shapes into it.


If you have little figurines such as plastic knights, dinosaurs, or animals, you can incorporate them into your game. For example, ask your child to build a sturdy new zoo enclosure for the giraffes and elephants, or have them put together a big castle and stable to house the knights and their horses.

, As your child builds their structure, have them identify the shapes and sizes of the blocks they’re using. This will help them learn geometric shapes and spatial vocabulary and concepts, such as ‘under,’ ‘behind,’ ‘above,’ and ‘within.’ It will also get them thinking about measurements and volume.For example, when your child selects some triangular and rectangular blocks for the roof the house they’re building, ask them what shapes they’ve picked and where they plan to put them.
Also have them begin thinking about measurements by asking them to compare different blocks’ sizes and to figure out how many blocks or figurines will fit within the structure.

, If your child is just starting out in their counting career, ask them after they’ve built their structure to count how many blocks they used, how many blocks are left out, and how many of each shape and size there are. If your child is a bit more advanced, ask them to use a prescribed number of blocks in their design: for example, challenge them to build a bridge using ten rectangular blocks, five cubes, and ten long sticks or struts.Once your child has a finished structure and has counted how many blocks it contains, you can practice some basic arithmetic. Pile some extra blocks on top or take away several blocks from the structure and then ask them how many blocks the new, ‘renovated’ model uses.

, One of the reasons building block games are such effective learning methods is that they allow the child to see and touch the products of their labor. They see and understand that they’ve created something that didn’t exist before, and thus feel pride and a sense of tangible accomplishment."

Play some games of regular bingo.,
Use your bingo cards to make equation prompts.,
Introduce and demonstrate the new rules.,
Update equation prompts over time to include new skills.",How to Introduce Your Kids to Math Games2," Before making bingo into a slightly more complicated math game, you should introduce your child to this family favorite by playing a few games with standard rules. This will familiarize your child with the ground rules as well as show them that it’s an enjoyable activity.


If you have a set of bingo cards and prompts already, great! If not, simply print out a free set from online game portals or make your own using a word processor., Take your existing bingo cards and some index cards or ping pong balls which you can write on with a marker. On these index cards or balls, write different formulas which equal the different numbers on the bingo cards. For example, if the cards have a space with the number 27, write out an equation like 20+7 or 36-9.This can be adjusted according to your child’s sophistication. If they’re still on a very basic level, create your own bingo cards with numbers that only go up to 20 or 30. If they’re more advanced, make the equations more complicated, such as 5+50-30+7.
You can also switch it around and make it so that the bingo cards show equations and the prompts are solutions. This way you read out a number and your child looks for equations on the bingo card which equal that number.

, Once your child is comfortable with bingo, tell them you’re going to use the arithmetic they’ve been learning in school to switch up the game and make it even more fun. Show them the new equation prompts and review some answers, then play a few example rounds.


Make sure you wait to introduce this game to your children until they’ve been using arithmetic in school for at least a day or two. You want them to be practicing learned concepts rather than overwhelming them with new ideas and skills.

, The importance of challenging students at all levels—and particularly those who are gifted—has been documented repeatedly in pedagogical studies, so make sure your child’s favorite math game doesn’t lag behind their skill sets.Keep an eye on your child’s homework and incorporate multiplication, division, geometry, and exponents when they get to them in school.

Gather objects from around the house that you can use for games.,
Use found items to ‘act out’ or represent arithmetic worksheets.,
Make these counting activities into a game.,
Practice activities which reinforce math lessons and concepts.",How to Introduce Your Kids to Math Games3," Studies have shown that children find math lessons and games using concrete items more enjoyable than ones which utilize strictly symbolic or abstract methods. They also learn and retain information more effectively when performing these tangible tasks.You can implement this pedagogical principle by using simple, countable objects such as playing cards, beads, string, butcher paper, beans, or measuring cups in the math games you play at home., Using your child’s homework or a supplementary workbook you’ve purchased, ask your child to solve the offered equations using your countable objects. For example, if the problem in the workbook says 10+12, have your child string ten beads onto a piece of yarn or thread, and then add twelve more beads on top it. Afterward, they count the sum total of the beads on the string and check the answer with you.


If you’re using small candies like M&Ms as props in your counting game, you can reward correct responses with a piece of candy.

, Once your child is well-acquainted with using props to demonstrate abstract equations, turn this activity into a competition. For example, challenge the players to complete their counting first. If they do this and identify the correct solution, they earn a point. If they get three points, they get to tie up their string of beads into a necklace or bracelet., Once you’re done playing math games, you can cement the concepts you’ve just practiced by asking about and reviewing these ideas while you’re going about the rest of your day. For example, after playing the bead-counting game, you can sing a song that involves counting skills—for example, Ten in the Bed and Five Little Monkeys—in the car or while getting ready for bed.You can even do this by simply incorporating learned vocabulary into conversations with your children. For example, next time you’re at the park with your child, ask questions which encourage them to use spatial language or counting. Ask, “Where are the ducks swimming? What will they do when they come up to that bridge? How many of them are there? How many of them are swimming, and how many are flying?”

Play some easy card games such as go fish and crazy eights.,
Introduce your child to card-based math games.,
Play a practice round.,
Keep game play fair and engaging by enforcing time limits.,
Create your own deck of cards to accommodate more complex equations.",How to Introduce Your Kids to Math Games4," If your child hasn’t played with regular playing cards before, you should make them comfortable with cards before introducing card-based math games.

, Once you’ve familiarized your child with some basic card games, get them acquainted with the idea of completing short arithmetic equations as part of a card game. You can do this by starting with an easy game, such as fast figuring. In this game, players race one another to create equations which result in a ‘target number.’ They can use any of the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to make this equation.Make sure your kids have learned all the requisite operations, as well as the order of operations, before attempting this game. Ignoring the order of operations will cause confusion later when your child learns it in class., Before beginning play in earnest, deal five, face-up cards to every player. Deal a final card face-up into the middle of the table. This card shows your ‘target number’—that is, the solution which all players are trying to make with their equations.


Before you deal the practice round, be sure to filter out the face cards, aces, and jokers.
Once you’ve dealt the dummy round and explained the basic rules, go over each person’s hand and discuss how each player could hypothetically solve the equation.

, Once your children understand how to play the game, you can keep them interested by implementing time limits for each hand. If a couple of players are struggling, set up a one- or two-minute minimum, meaning that no player can present their equation before the two-minute mark.


Even if everyone is doing well at the game, be prepared in any case to encounter hands which trip everyone up. Keep the game exciting and snappy by establishing a three-minute time limit. At this point, have everyone turn over their cards so that the group can try to brainstorm and build equations together., Since the standard deck of numbered cards only goes up to a ten, your children might quickly outgrow your existing deck. This doesn’t mean you have to say goodbye to fast figuring, though! Just create your own decks—for example, a 1-100 deck or a fraction deck—and you can keep the game going throughout several units and even years of your child’s math schooling.

Assess appropriate times for playing on the computer.,
Ask your child’s teacher about current class time concepts.,
Browse games on free sites and through paid educational retailers.,
Download a mobile app about math.,
Show your child educational series featuring math concepts.,
Set parental controls on your computer and mobile devices.",How to Introduce Your Kids to Math Games5," Computer games have been shown to be great way to encourage higher-level thinking.While these virtual activities can help your child get some valuable practice in math, though, they’re not always the best option. Before popping your child in front of the computer, think about whether this is the best use of their time.


For example, time spent watching television should be minimized, so feel free to switch on a computer game when your child would be doing this otherwise.
In contrast, if other classmates, friends, or siblings are around, you should opt for some interactive math games rather than virtual ones. These kinds of games establish, develop, and expand your child’s interpersonal skill set, something which is essential to later-in-life abilities such as teamwork, self-esteem, and problem solving., Before you pick an appropriate computer game for your child, make sure you know what concepts and skills they need to practice. This will ensure that you're not forging ahead of their class and causing confusion or lagging behind with long-familiar concepts.


Even if you’re already aware what your child is learning in class from homework assignments, ask their teacher if there are any problem areas or error-prone concepts which your child should work on.

, Once you know what your child is learning in school, you can pick a computer game. Free websites such as education.com, funbrain.com, and pbskids.org/games/math/ provide access to multiple, easy-to-use math games, as well as instructions for you and your child to read. You can also find several consumer review and parenting sites which offer reviews and rankings of educational math games available for purchase.


In general, you want to purchase a game with kid-friendly Entertainment Software Rating Board ratings and that you can return if you or your child find it unsatisfactory., You might think that mobile apps are primarily designed for adult lifestyles and needs, but you’d be way wrong! There are an increasing number of mobile apps made to help children use and improve their math skills. These options offer the added bonus of allowing your child to play math games even when you’re on the go or only have a few minutes to spare between other activities.


For example, the app Bedtime Math presents your child with a math problem to solve every morning and night, encouraging them to incorporate math and critical thinking into their daily life. The app Attributes, in contrast, develops children’s problem-solving skills through puzzles and other graphics., While interactive media is the best virtual way for children to learn and practice math, sometimes this just isn’t an option. Perhaps your home PC isn’t available for your child to use, or they’re too tired or fussy to use the computer. In these cases, you can switch on an educational program which features mathematical concepts to optimize their passive media consumption.


You may remember programs such as Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land from your own childhood, but don’t limit yourself to these classic cartoons! There are many contemporary series such as Odd Squad that feature math and problem-solving, so check out sites like concommonsensemedia.org for parent- and kid-friendly options., If your child is using your device in order to play math games or watch educational programs, you want to make sure that they can't access your other, adult apps and programs. Even if your child has their own tablet, phone, or laptop so that only kid-friendly apps and programs are installed on it, they could potentially access harmful or problematic information through the internet.On video game consoles, you can set parental controls in the Settings part of the menu. On a laptop or tablet with internet browsers, you should adjust parental controls on both the device itself, as well as in each browser.

Be patient and understanding.",How to Help Kids Self‐Edit Their Work," For most children, their work is something very personal. Realizing that they’ve made an error might frustrate them or diminish their self-confidence. Explaining that self-editing is important for every person, even famous people they like, can help them get into the right mindset to revise their work. This can also help you clearly tell them what the self-editing process looks like.Give your child examples of people who self-edit their work as a motivation. For example, “Do know who also goes over their work, Sam? Shel Silverstein! He went over all of his stories so that you and other kids love them.”
Assure your child that self-editing is makes good work great. For example, “You always do your best, Max. Taking a few minutes to edit your work will make it even better!”;
, Write out a detailed list of things kids need to edit. This can help them better understand the process of self-editing. It also helps them get through simple tasks that may prevent frustration.Work with the child on the list. For example, “What steps do you need to take to edit this story, Taylor?” Praise them and make suggestions, “That’s great, Taylor! You’ve got punctuation and spelling listed. You really understand what you need to do.”, Ask what things on the list are most important to do and in what order. This can help the child break up their list into smaller pieces. Encouraging this can also help them learn to more independently self-edit and minimize frustration.For example, “You’ve made a great list, Ayelet. What things do you think are most important parts?”

, If possible, tell the child to wait a day or two to self-edit. Explain that it’s easier to proofread when they’ve let something rest. This can also help kids distance themselves emotionally from the work.Explain this in words kids can understand. For example, “Sam, when you’re writing a story, let it sit for a couple of days and then go back and read it out loud. This can make it easier for you to see or hear mistakes. You might also realize that there are better words you can use.”

, Avoid putting your child in a situation where they feel rushed to self-edit. This may cause frustration, stress or anxiety. Involve kids in deciding a good time and place to work so that they have some control over the process.For example, “Hey Charlotte, you do a really great job self-editing before dinner. Do you feel like this works for you? Where do you like to work?”

, Once you’ve picked the best time and space to self-edit, work it into the child’s daily schedule. This can help them anticipate and more independently self-edit their work.It may also reduce any stress or anxiety they feel.Stick to your routine if possible. Tell kids about any changes and what alternatives are available. For example, “We’re going to meet some friends for dinner at your favorite restaurant, Dahlia. I know you’re working on some hard math problems. Let’s finish what we can tonight and then check the answers tomorrow morning. You can also work on your problems at the restaurant and no one will bother you.”, Kids may need some incentive to self-edit their work. Offering them small prizes or other things they may want can motivate them to edit independently.For example, give kids a gold star to put on a chart when they self-edit their work. When they earn 25 stars, let them choose a small prize to keep up their good work.

, Kids need different writing implements and other tools to self-edit their work. Have them gather anything they may need before they begin. This can prevent procrastination or interrupting their workflows. Some items kids may want or need include:Pens and/or pencils
Paper
Ruler
Calculator
Computer
Dictionary and/or thesaurus
Worksheets and instructions
Checklist of tasks and goals

, Some kids may need some help self-editing their work. Giving a little support when necessary can prevent frustration and keep them on track with self-editing.Keep help you give constructive and interactive. For example, “What do you need help with, Christopher? Did you leave this problem and come back to it? Ok good, now show me where you’re having trouble. Let’s tackle this together.”
Give concrete examples on how to self-edit the work if you can. For example, “See this number here, Christopher? Ok, what if we switched that we another number? What could we use? Does that help solve the problem?”

, Reinforce your willingness to help kids self-edit their work. Tell them that as long as they are trying and looking for solutions, you’re happy to help.Reassure kids if they get frustrated. This can help them better learn how to independently self-edit. For example, “Let me help you out, Emma. I see you’ve been struggling with this paragraph for a bit.”

, Include kids in any self-editing or work you may need to do. Showing that you self-edit, too, can show them that it’s an important process in finishing their work.For example, “Jack, I’ve got to edit this report for my boss. Maybe we could sit down together and edit our work. This way, we get it out of the way and can go play afterward.”

, Kids love to hear praise because it makes them feel good and offers incentive to self-edit. As they self-edit, give plenty of verbal praise for following their checklists or finishing tasks. For example, “Wow, Felix, you’ve done so much of your checklist! That’s awesome! Gimme a high five!”, Avoid showing any signs of impatience or not understanding your child. This can further frustrate or stress them. Remain patient and calm as you talk them through any problems they may have with self-editing. This can help your child relax and get them to work on their own again.Take a deep breath before you say anything negative to your child.

Attend Back to School Night to find out about volunteer opportunities.,
Join the PTA.,
Contact the office.,
Suggest your own volunteer opportunities.,
Consider your schedule when figuring out your volunteer plans.,
Stay up-to-date on the events going on at the school.,
Donate supplies if you do not have time to volunteer.,
Ask questions.,
Attend training if necessary.",How to Get Involved at Your Child's School1," Most schools announce involvement and volunteer opportunities at Back to School Night at the beginning of the school year or during parent-teacher conferences sporadically throughout the year.If your child’s teacher or administrator doesn’t mention volunteer opportunities at these meetings, they can be a great opportunity to approach them yourself.;
, The Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) is a very common way for parents to become involved in their child’s school. The PTA usually requires a membership fee which not only admits the parent to the school PTA, but also to the national organization. Parents can often be elected to hold the office of president, vice president, treasurer, and recording secretary in the school PTA.


School PTA meetings are held about once a month and can involve anything from managing fundraisers to discussing changes to the curriculum and education standards that are being implemented in the school.

, If your child’s school doesn’t have a PTA group, contact the office or teacher to see what volunteer opportunities are available. Some schools publish volunteer opportunities in a periodic newsletter or on the school website.


Ask your child’s teacher the best way to stay involved on current volunteer needs.

, Most schools are always in need of volunteers, and there are generally a lot of ways to get involved. Choose the activity and outlet that matches your schedule and interests. If there is a particular project or event coming up or if you see a need at the school, don’t be afraid to approach a teacher or administrator with a suggestion of how you would like to be involved.If you have expertise in a certain area or see a need that fits your interest and skillset, contact your child’s teacher to see if there is a way to volunteer in that area.

, There are opportunities to get involved that will match nearly every parent’s schedule. Be open about your availability and time commitments from the beginning to find the volunteer activity that will work best for you.


Stay-at-home parents might be more able to help in the classroom during the day, while parents who work can help with evening special events or by representing the school at school board meetings.

, Attending school events is a great way to be involved in the school. These events include Open House, book fairs, science fairs, spelling bees, festivals, class productions, and sporting events. These events give the children higher self-esteem and pride in their school.

, Things like No.2 pencils, folders, art materials, and other common school supplies are necessary for the children to succeed in school, but some families cannot provide them for their children. If a child does not have the supplies that they need, the teacher will usually provide it. Often teachers will purchase these extra supplies with their own money so that the children do not have to go without.


Schools can always use help with having enough supplies for all of the children and many of them have established Wish Lists that they will provide to parents.

, Before committing to volunteer at the school, ask questions so you are clear as to what is expected of you. Find out the schedule and time requirements for your assignment, as well as who you’ll be working with and if there is any financial requirement, such as purchasing supplies or paying for admission on a field trip.Clearly understanding your role can help avoid confusion later.

, Depending on your volunteer assignment, you may be required to attend trainings. This can be as informal as meeting with a PTA leader to learn how a certain event works, or as formal as going to a district-wide safety training that some school districts may require.


In general, once you are trained on a school or school district’s practices, you don’t need to be re-trained for a while.

Sign in when you get to the school.,
Sign out when you leave.,
Sign up to be the class parent.,
Become a classroom reader.",How to Get Involved at Your Child's School2," For safety reasons, most schools do not allow a parent to just walk in and go to a classroom. Instead, the parent needs to stop in the office and sign in. Sometimes this just involves literally writing their name and arrival time in a ledger as well as the intention of the visit.


There are also schools with more advanced visitor programs that require the parent to scan their driver’s license and wear a temporary name badge that is printed out with the date and time of the visit.

, The parent needs to stop in the office at the end of their visit as well, in order to sign out and turn in the temporary name badge. Not only are these systems used for the safety of the children and staff, but also for the parent by accounting for everyone that is in the building in the case of a fire or other disaster.

, Most elementary schools encourage parents to sign up to be the class parent for their child’s room. The class parent is the one that is responsible for the arrangements for class parties. This includes bringing in the party supplies such as treats and drinks as well as goody bags.


The class parent also plans some type of entertainment for the party such as a quick craft or a simple group game.
Depending on the school and the teacher, the class parent may have other responsibilities. Sometimes they might be asked to help chaperone field trips or help with rehearsals for school productions.

, Young children that have not learned how to read love to have someone read to them and many schools will allow parents to be volunteer readers. The reading might be done in the school library or it could be in one or more specific classrooms.


The teachers will usually supply the books in order to be sure that the reading material is age appropriate and adheres to school policy. They also do this in order to tie the stories in with what the children are learning in the classroom. Story times are usually less than an hour and can be as many times per week as the parent and school agree on.

Sign up to be a lunchroom or playground monitor.,
Consider monitoring more than one group.,
Become a crossing guard.",How to Get Involved at Your Child's School3," There are schools that allow parents to be lunchroom or playground monitors. They do this because the student to adult ratio can be 30:1 in some classrooms and often the schools will combine the lunch and playground time for all of the children in one or possible two grades. The total can reach 90 or more children per group with several groups rotating from classrooms to the lunchroom and then the playground.


Having extra adults keep an eye on the children during lunch and play time helps reduce the possibility of misconduct among the children.

, This volunteer opportunity usually lasts about an hour unless the parent decides to monitor more than one group of children. Sometimes all that is needed is for the parent to be present, but at other times they may need to remind children of the rules or actually stop children from misbehaving.


Usually the discipline of the children is handled by the teacher or other school staff member that is also monitoring the children.

, If you have early morning or mid-afternoon time available, you can sign up to be a crossing guard. You will be assigned a particular street intersection and will be responsible for helping the children safely cross the streets when they are walking to or from school. The available intersections are usually within a certain distance of the school building.


Crossing guards wear reflective safety vests and usually carry some type of sign that is used to stop the traffic so that children can cross safely.
The morning shift usually starts about 30-60 minutes before school starts and ends about thirty minutes after the tardy bell rings. The afternoon shift starts about fifteen minutes before the end of the school day and usually ends within an hour.

Own your grade.,
Take notes.,
Study hard.,
Get some people to help study with you.,
Prepare for tests.",How to Ace a Class," It is you who is responsible for your own grades, and nobody else. You might make excuses, but you have to change up your thinking. The first thing you must do is realize that it isn't the teacher, or the textbook, or the students that are going to determine if you will do well in or fail the class.;
, You absolutely have to take notes, it's the only way you'll remember the content of the lecture. If the lectures are long, you may want to have a cup of caffeinated tea or coffee before the class, to keep you awake and alert during the whole thing.

, Don't just take notes on the lectures--take notes on the textbook too! Are there math or science problems in the class? Do as many practice problems as you can. This is maybe the most important step, as in classes, if you have a bad teacher, you can't always count on the lectures.

, It's not fun to study by yourself. Invite a few of your best friends or classmates over and form a small study group. Have a time every week to work on each persons worst subject. Remember to not get distracted and start getting off topic. If you want to ace that certain class studying will be important. It'll be fun and helpful at the same time!

, Make sure to study hard for these! Make sure you've completed all the memorization you need. A couple hours before the test, have some green tea, it has enough caffeine in in that you'll be alert, but won't be hyper.

Prepare your child for the new school year.",How to Decide if Your Child Should Repeat a Grade," The biggest factors to consider when deciding whether to promote or retain a child in school are the child's academic progress and level of maturity. Many school districts have developed tests to evaluate these factors, but as a parent you may wish to consider your child's abilities as well.If the child has significant struggles with mathematics, reading, or writing, he or she will struggle even more in the subsequent year's classes.
The child must also meet generalized performance expectations designed and implemented by the school district. These expectations may include things like test scores and class participation.
Consider how many school days your child has missed. If your child has missed a significant number of class sessions, his or her teacher may recommend repeating the year so your child isn't behind in the following grade.;
, Depending on how much your child is struggling, you may want to consider having him or her tested to see if a learning disability might be the problem. While this may be embarrassing for your child, identifying and correcting the problem can help prevent future problems in school.


Some classroom problems like not being able to sit still or listen during class may affect a child's ability to learn.His or her teacher may recommend repeating a year if this resulted in a lot of missed material.
You can have your child tested for a learning disability by speaking to a qualified mental health expert or by contacting your local chapter of the Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA).Talk to your child's teacher about whether or not your child may need specialized or remedial education.

, Many children who have to repeat a grade feel embarrassed to be older than their classmates.However, if your child is young for his or her grade, repeating a grade may not be as much of a problem. A child who is younger than his or her peers and struggles in school may actually end up performing better after being held back a year.


Talk to your child's teacher about whether repeating a grade would be helpful or hurtful at your child's age.

, Another factor to consider is whether your child is as emotionally developed as his or her peers. Being emotionally underdeveloped can be a major hindrance to academic progress, so talk to your child's teacher about your child's emotional preparedness for the upcoming grade.


A child should be able to cope with mild frustrations and inconveniences without losing his or her temper.If your child has a hard time caring for his or her personal and emotional needs, you may want to talk to your child's teacher about whether repeating a year could be helpful.

, Some studies suggest that repeating a grade can lead to social and emotional problems like poor self-esteem and an inability to feel like part of a cohesive group.If your child already struggles with social issues like these, or if you believe he or she may be prone to these types of problems, repeating a grade may be detrimental to your child's sense of self.


If a child acts immaturely or behaves too ""young"" for his or her age, an instructor may recommend retaining the child for another year.Socially-developed children should be able to collaborate with other students and work within a group dynamic.If you're unsure how to gauge your child's social development, consider talking to a school counselor, psychologist, social worker, or behavioral specialist., The main advantage of retention is that the child has another year to spend working on his/her reading, writing, and math skills. If the child were advanced to the next grade, he or she would struggle and ultimately fail at that level. Because each year's course material builds off of foundations established the previous year, a child would be even farther behind and may feel even more frustrated or embarrassed by his/her performance.It's worth noting, though, that any achievement gains made by a retained student typically fade within three years. You may want to consider the negative effects before making a final decision.
The only time retention really works is when students receive specific and detailed attention to help resolve the problems that led to poor grades. This requires increased effort on both the teacher's part and the parents' part.

, Being retained for a year can have a very negative effect on a young student. Students who are held back a year typically have lower levels of academic achievement, increased susceptibility to behavioral problems, diminished socio-emotional adjustment, and increased risk of premature drop out than their peers.If your child's instructor recommends repeating a year, talk to the instructor about any concerns you have. There may be other alternatives to retention that the instructor might be willing to implement.
If the instructor insists on retention, make sure that your child will receive specialized remedial attention to get caught up on the concepts he or she struggles with. You may also want to address the risk of any behavioral problems that could potentially develop.

, If your child is really struggling and his/her instructor recommends repeating another year, you may be able to discuss alternative options with that instructor. Providing additional support, both inside and outside the classroom, could help get your child back on track without having to repeat a grade.One-on-one or small-group tutoring sessions may help introduce new concepts to your child that aren't clear from in-class instruction.
Consider special education services for your child. Just make sure his/her IEP goals and benchmarks match the school's standards to ensure your child is on the right path.
Ask about summer school attendance, extended day classes, or extended year classes in lieu of having to repeat a grade.
Help your child with homework. If your child refuses your help, have a sibling or an older student/tutor work with your child on assignments he or she struggles with.
Try giving your child more social exchanges with his/her peers through extracurricular activities. Some children become more motivated to do well in school through interacting with their peers.

, Kindergarten is an important developmental stage for young children. Before being promoted to the first grade, kindergarten students must typically show a strong command of the communication arts and the math skills standard for their state.Communication arts skills at the kindergarten level usually involve asking and answering questions about a text, retaining important details from a text, identifying characters in a story, comparing character experiences, and engaging in group reading.Standard math skills at the kindergarten level typically include identifying and comparing numbers, counting in sequence, identifying shapes, and completing simple addition and subtraction problems., First-grade skills build off of the lessons learned in kindergarten. In order to be promoted to the second grade, a first-grade student must receive a passing grade (typically a C or higher, or at least a 70% where numerical grades are used) in both communication arts and mathematics.Communication arts skills include retelling key details of a story, describing characters/settings/events, and read prose and/or poetry that has been deemed appropriate for a first grade reader in that child's state.Standard math skills include extending the sequence of counting, adding and subtracting numbers within 20, learning decimal places up to 100, recognizing and working with measurements, and building on spatial reasoning that involves geometric shapes., Second-grade skills pick up directly where first-grade skills left off and build off of them in increasingly complex ways. A student must earn a passing grade in both communication arts and mathematics in order to advance to the third grade.Second-grade communication art skills include asking and answering questions about a text (specifically who/what/when/where/why/how), describing the ways in which a character responds to major events, using visual and written information to better understand a character, and read literature deemed appropriately complex for students in the second grade.Math skills expected of a second-grade student include adding and subtracting within 20, developing a simple understanding of multiplication, learning decimal places up to 1000, working with time and money, and developing a more advanced spatial reasoning., Third-grade progress is once again determined by a passing grade in both communication arts and mathematics. If a student in third grade is not progressing at the expected level, though, the third grade is the level at which teachers may put into place a conditional promotion with a mandatory improvement plan instead of recommending a retention year.Communication art skills include recognizing the meaning of words and phrases, referring to the various parts of a story, describing how illustrations and words work together to tell a story, comparing/contrasting two or more texts, and reading literature deemed appropriate for third-grade students.Third grade math skills include multiplication and division within 100, using the four operations, explaining mathematical patterns, and understanding fractions.The third grade reading improvement plan (for students who advance to the fourth grade with poor grades) typically includes at least 30 hours of additional reading lessons during the fourth grade year. The teacher may also mandate summer school in addition to those reading lessons.

, Fourth-grade progress requires not just a passing grade in communication arts, but also a passing grade on a grade-level reading assessment in some states. Any student who reads below a fourth-grade level is required to repeat the fourth grade, attend at least 30 hours of reading lessons during the repeated fourth-grade year, and must attend summer school classes with at least 40 hours of reading instruction.Communication art skills for fourth graders include citing details from a text, identifying the theme of a text, recognizing the meaning of words in a text, differentiating between different types of texts, and reading literature deemed appropriate for fourth-grade students.Math skills for fourth graders include developing an understanding of factors and multiples, using the four operations more extensively, building and ordering fractions, and converting across units of measurement.Fourth graders are also required to receive passing grades in science or social studies in order to advance to the fifth grade.

, Fifth-grade progress is determined by passing grades in communication arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Some school districts also impose ongoing assessments to ensure students can read proficiently at the fifth-grade level.Fifth-grade students must be able to quote from a text, compare/contrast two or more characters, identify and understand figurative language, recognize how chapters or scenes work together to form the plot structure of the larger story, discuss how a narrator's point of view influences the description of events, and read at a fifth-grade level.Fifth-grade math skills include analyzing patterns, performing operations with decimals to the hundredths, multiplying and dividing fractions, and graphing points on a plane.Science abilities in the fifth grade include understanding simple machines, classifying plants and animals, understanding the water cycle, and learning about the solar system.Social studies skills in the fifth grade include differentiating between the powers of various branches of government and understanding the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights., From grades six through eight, students are expected to receive passing grades in communication arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Other than increasing expectations with each subsequent grade level, there are no changes in evaluation or testing requirements during this time., If you're unsure about your child repeating a grade, you should certainly raise your concerns and have a respectful conversation with the instructor. However, the teacher has the ultimate say. Remember that a trained educator is more qualified to objectively assess a child's growth and abilities than a parent. You may not like the choice, but you have to accept the teacher's decision and trust his/her abilities.Blaming the teacher may make your child feel like he or she doesn't have to work harder the second time around. If you tell your child that it's the teacher's fault, it may make your child feel ""off the hook"" for his/her own responsibilities.

, Telling your child that he or she needs to repeat a grade is never easy. It's best to have this conversation in a private, comfortable space that is free from distractions and any other siblings or friends.Remind your child that he or she will be the oldest in the class, and therefore will be a better athlete and academic achiever. Tell your child about other perks of being older, like being the first one in the class to drive.
Point out all the good work your child has done in school. Let him or her know that you're proud, and highlight specific accomplishments to make your child feel better about the previous year's work.

, If you've made the decision to hold your child back a year, your child may have strong feelings about your choice. He or she may feel angry, frightened, or otherwise concerned with having to repeat a grade with younger students. Take the time to talk to your child and work through his or her feelings before the school year starts.


Don't be dismissive if your child feels scared or embarrassed. Instead, meet each negative feeling with reassurance that child will have more fun and do better the second time around.If your child is really struggling with accepting your decision, you may want to consider having your child talk to a teacher, principal, or child therapist. This may help your child work through his or her concerns and learn new coping skills.

, Embarrassment may be one of the worst things for a child repeating a grade. Your child may fear that other kids at school will make fun of him or her. This may have even happened already. While you can't prevent other kids from being mean, you can teach your child how to brush off insults and maintain his/her confidence.Try to help your child make friends with other kids who will be in his/her class this year. Set up play dates over the summer, or encourage them to meet and spend time together so your child has at least a few friends right from the start of the school year.
Help your child figure out what to say to mean kids. For example, your child might dismiss insults by saying something like, ""I just needed to get better at some things. It's no big deal or anything.""
Don't let any siblings or other family members tease your child. It may be best to let other relatives know in private and then ask that they not bring it up to your child so he or she doesn't feel self conscious.
Emphasize to your child that you still have nothing but love and pride for him or her. This type of reassurance can go a long way towards boosting your child's self esteem.

Find a grading scale.,
Collect the most recent grades you can by asking your teacher, an office administrator, or registrar.,
Record the point value for each grade.,
Add up all the values of your grades.,
Take this final number and divide it by the number of classes you are taking.",How to Calculate GPA1," The most common grading scale for schools in the United States is a four point scale. Using this scale, a grade of A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point, and F = 0 points. This is called an unweighted GPA.Some schools use a weighted GPA, which allots 5 points for more rigorous classes, such as honors, Advanced Placement (AP), and International Baccalaureate (IB). Other classes are weighted the same. Students who take the 5-point classes can end up with GPAs above a 4.0.


Some schools use plus and minus grading, which values a plus as +.3 and a minus as -.3. For instance, a B+ is worth 3.3, a B is worth 3.0, and a B- is worth 2.7 points.If you’re unsure what your school uses, try asking your teacher or an administrator.;
, You might also be able to figure out what grades you've received by going back over old report cards or transcripts.


You want to collect the final grades for each of your classes. Individual class grades, midterm grades, or grades on mid-semester report cards do not count. Only final grades for the semester, term, or quarter factor into your GPA.

, Write down the correct point value next to each grade using the four-point scale. So, if you have an A- in a class, record a 3.7; if you have a C+, record a 2.3.


For easy reference, use this chart from the College Board to help assign the correct 4.0-scale value.

, After recording the scores for your grades, add the values up. So, let's say you received an A- in Biology, a B+ in English, and an B- in Economics. You'd add up the totals in the following way: 3.7 + 3.3 + 2.7 = 9.7.

, If you have a value of 9.7 on a 4-point scale for three classes, you will calculate the GPA using the following equation: 9.7 / 3 = 3.2. You have a GPA of 3.2.

Get your brain and body ready to learn.,
Learn in a way that works for you.,
Pay attention.,
Learn how to take notes.,
Do your homework on time and well.,
Look for extra ways to learn.,
Study earlier.",How to Be the Best Student in Your Class1," You will learn best and have the easiest time in school if your body is ready to learn! There are lots of things that you can do to get your body ready. Try:


Get lots of sleep. You’ll need to get the right amount of sleep for your body if you want your brain to work at its best. You should feel alert through most of the day. If you find yourself needing to shut your eyes by lunch, you’re not sleeping enough. For most people, you’ll need about 8 hours of sleep.
Your body can’t work right if all you eat is junk like chips, candy, and hamburgers. If you want to be the best student you can be, eat your vegetables (like broccoli), some fruit, and lean proteins (like chicken and fish).
Drink plenty of water. Your brain needs water in order to work right. In fact, your whole body needs water in order to work right. Drink several glasses of water a day but keep in mind that some people need more water than others. If your pee is coming out dark colored, you need more water, whereas if it's clear, that's typically excess water.;
, Everyone learns best in different ways; this is called a learning style.Find a way that works for you and try to learn that way as much as you can. You’ll have more control over this when you study at home, but you can also talk to your teacher about adjusting how the lessons are taught to include more variety for different style learners.


For example, have you noticed that it’s really easy for you to remember charts or pictures? This means you might be a visual learner, which means you should use more images and pictures in order to learn. An example of this would be if you drew yourself a chart to memorize the parts of speech.
Maybe you've noticed that you have an easier time studying when you listen to music quietly or that you can't remember what your teacher wrote on the board but you can ""hear"" what they said in your head as if they were in the room now. This means you might be an auditory learner, which means you learn better with sound. An example of this would be if you record your teacher when they're talking so that you can listen to it while you do your homework or study.
Maybe you've noticed that, during a lesson, you feel like you still want to pay attention but you really need to stand up or move around. Maybe you pace around your room while you study. This might mean that you are a kinesthetic learner, which means you learn better when you're doing things with your body. Try playing with a piece of clay in your hand while your teacher talks.

, The best thing that you can do to become the best student in any class is pay attention when your teacher is talking. If you get distracted you might miss important information and you'll have a harder time understanding what to do or when you have to study later.


If you're having trouble staying focused when your teacher is talking, try sitting in the front and participating more in the class. Raise your hand and ask questions when you don't understand something or when your teacher says something interesting and you want to know more about it.

, Taking notes (and taking notes well) can be tricky, but it will make it much easier for you to learn and study, which means your grades will get better and your test scores will improve so you're the best student in your class. Just remember, you don't have to write down everything your teacher says. Just write down the most important things and the things you know you'll have a hard time remembering.

, Even if you don't get very good grades on your homework, just doing it on time will help keep your grade up as much as possible. You should aim to make your homework marks the highest in the class or you're not really trying to be the best in your class. Beyond that, do as well on your homework as you can. When you don't understand it, ask someone for help! Your teacher might be able to set you up with a tutor or even help you themselves.


Schedule enough time to actually get your homework done. This might mean watching less TV or spending less time with your friends but it will be worth it in the end.
Getting a good environment to do homework will really help you to get it done. Go somewhere quiet where you don't have any distractions. If you can go to a library, that's a good spot. If you can't leave your house and the people you live with are noisy, try your bathroom.

, Learning stuff that isn't included in your classes can help you understand the information you do cover a lot better and it can also really impress your teacher. Pursuing information in a way that follows your interests can also help you stay focused in class. Look for more ways to learn about all of the subjects you study and you'll find that all of school is more interesting and that you're more and more successful.


For example, if you're studying American history, you can watch documentaries online to learn even more about the era you're learning about.
You can learn by studying books from your local library and you can also learn a lot online. While Wikipedia isn't always accurate, it's usually pretty good. You can also find documentaries and educational videos on YouTube, like the popular shows Crash Course and TedTalks. These have a lot information that your teacher or professor didn't explain it well enough for you.
Learn when school is out of session too. Keep learning during the summer, on the weekends, and start preparing for your next year of school as early as you can by finding out what kind of stuff you'll study. As for the summers, just reviewing the information you already learned for just two or three hours three or four times over the course of the whole summer can help make sure that you're ready when the school year starts.

, One of the most effective ways to get better scores on tests is to start studying and preparing for the test as early as possible. Definitely don't leave it until the night before. The harder the test will be, the earlier you should start studying. Two or three weeks is usually a good starting point.

Determine the number of credits.,
Assign the appropriate scale value for each letter grade.,
Calculate the weighted scores.,
Find your total weighted credits.,
Divide the grade points total by the credit hours total.",How to Calculate GPA2," For some schools, especially college courses, each course has a number of credit hours. Credit hours are units schools use to measure the work load. Generally, credit hours are based on mode of instruction, number of hours spent inside the classroom, and number of hours spent studying outside the class.Find out the number of credit hours assigned to each course you are taking. It should be listed on your transcripts or in the school catalogue.


Some schools mostly offer 3 credit hour courses, other colleges 4 credit hour courses, and some schools do a mixture. For many schools, labs are 1 hour.
If you cannot find the credit hours for each of your courses, talk to an administrator or the registrar.

, Use the common 4-point GPA scale to assign the values: A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point, and F = 0 points.


If your school allots 5 points for upper level classes, such as Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB), you will be using a weighted GPA scale.
Add .3 for each plus value or subtract .3 for each minus value. If you have an A- in a class, mark it as 3.7. Match up each letter grade with its scale value and write it next to the grade (e.g. B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7).

, To find the GPA, you must do a little bit of math to determine the different values for the scores that go into the overall GPA.


Multiply each scale value grade by the number of credit hours to get the grade points. For example, if you made a B in a 4 credit hour class, you would multiply the scale value of 3 for the B by 4 credit hours, which gives you 12 grade points for that class.






Add the weighted grade points for all of your classes together to calculate your total grade points.







, Add together the number of credit hours you have taken in total to get the total credits. If you took 4 classes that were 3 credit hours each, you will have a total of 12 credit hours.

, For example, if you have a total of 45.4 grade points in a total of 15.5 credit hours, you would have the following math problem: 45.4 / 15.5 = 2.92. Your credit hour-weighted GPA is 2.92.

Set up your initial columns.,
Input the scale values in column C. Determine the numerical scale values of the grades you are inputting.,
Type an equals sign (=) into the first cell of column D. All excel equations begin with an equals sign, so you should use one every time you do a new calculation.

,
Type the letters SUM.,
Fill in your equation.,
Press the Enter key.",How to Calculate GPA3," In the A column, type in the names or numbers of the subjects you're taking. In the B column, type in the letter grades you want to factor into your GPA.

, To complete this step, you will have to decide if your school uses a weighted or unweighted GPA scale.


The common 4-point GPA scale is as follows: A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point, and F = 0 points. If your school uses a weighted GPA scale, they allot 5 points for upper level classes. Ask an administrator, teacher, or registrar for this information. You can also look on your report card or final grade sheets.
Add .3 for each plus value or subtract .3 for each minus value. For example, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7.

,, This will indicate to the program that it will be calculating a sum (adding) equation.

, The equation you will use to calculate your GPA will be determined by how many grades you have, but the basic format is =SUM(C1:C6)/6.


C1 is the cell number (C- column, 1-row) of the first grade in your column.
The number on the right side of the colon should be the cell number of the final grade on your list.
The number after the slash should be the total number of courses that you are calculating. In this case, 6 courses are being calculated. If you have 10 courses listed, you will replace the 6 with a 10.

, You should be greeted with a single number in the D column, which is your final calculated GPA.

"
"
Know the kinds of classes you've got.,
Multiply the grades according to their weight.,
Find the mean or average.",How to Calculate GPA4," Certain classes have weights which alter the 'strength' of the class. A regular (also called on-level) class is multiplied by 1, or left alone. A PAP (which stands for Pre-Advanced Placements which can also be called Honours) is multiplied by 1.05. An AP (Advanced Placement, also called College or College Level) is multiplied by 1.1.


Let`s say a person N. has 5 classes, and these are his grades; PAP Literature=94, Regular Chemistry=87, AP World Civilizations=98, PAP Pharmaceuticals Training=82 and Track=100 (lf unspecified, assume regular).

,


PAP Literature had a 94 which gets multiplied by 1.05 for 98.7%AJ (AJ=adjusted). Chemistry and Track are regular classes so they are left at their grades, respectively 87 and 100. PAP Pharmaceuticals Training is 82, multiplied by 1.05 is 86.1%AJ, and AP World Civilizations` 98 gets multiplied by 1.1 for a 107.8%AJ.

, The formula is very simple; (g+g+g...)/#g, when g=grade. Or in words, add the grades and divide by the number of grades added together.


So 98.7+87+100+86.1+107.8=479.58. 479.58/5=95.916. So after rounding, Perso N. has a 95.2 or 96 GPA Percentage. lf the number seems too high or too low, be sure to check your math. lf on a calculator, be sure to use parenthesis or mistakes may occur.

Make people feel good, not bad.,
Be helpful to everyone.,
Be respectful to people, even when they're being mean.,
Stay calm.,
Make things fun for everyone.,
Be yourself!",How to Be the Best Student in Your Class2," Being the best student in a class is about more than just getting good grades. You should also work on being a good person. You don't want to be a bully or a class clown; that will not make you the best student in the class. Focus on making people feel good by giving them compliments and telling them when they do a good job. Don't be mean to people and tease them or say hurtful things.

, Be a good person by helping people when you can. If you know how to do something or you have an easier way of doing it, show them how. Don't make yourself seem smarter or better, just be nice and friendly. You can also do small nice things, like holding a door open for them or helping them carry something heavy.


For example, if someone was gone for a few days, offer to help them get caught up and share your notes with them.

, Even when people are mean to you, you should still be respectful. Don't shout at them or physically hurt them. Don't call them names or cut in front of them in line, just to spite them. Simply ignore them and treat them like you would treat anyone else.


Be respectful to people by not talking over them and definitely giving them a chance to talk if they want to. Respect their opinions and don't worry if they think a little bit differently than you. You should also let people be themselves and don't make them feel bad for being unique or different.

, When you're in class, stay as calm as you can. Don't run around and disrupt people. You should also try not to get stressed when school gets tough. This is bad for you and it might also cause you to lash out at other people.


Help yourself calm down by breathing slowly. Remind yourself that everything will be okay. You're strong enough to do this!
Avoid worrying about perfect grades. Perfect grades really only matter your last year and a half of high school and then when you're in college (if you plan on going to graduate school later). Otherwise, just focus on learning the material as well as you can and don't worry about the numbers or letters that your teacher assigns. Knowing the material is more important than getting a grade.

, Try to help everyone have fun. Be enthusiastic and positive when you're in class. This excitement to learn will make everyone feel more okay about learning. It might even get some people to show excitement when they wouldn't normally let other people see that they care.


For example, you might start learning about the planets in your science class. Find a cool picture of your favorite planet and show it to other people, then challenge them to find a cool picture of their favorite planet.

, Most importantly, be yourself. You can't be the best person you can possibly be if you're pretending to be someone else. Do the things that make you happy. Share the things that you love. Be friends with the people that get you and make you feel good about yourself. Don't worry about what other people think. The truth is that years from now, you won't even remember half of their names. If they don't think you're the coolest person now, you're not going to care in five or six years. What you will care about is how unhappy you are that you didn't do things that made you happy.

"
"
Be respectful.,
Ask questions.,
Ask for help.,
Be a helpful student.,
Stay on top of your work.",How to Be the Best Student in Your Class3," If you want to make your teacher happy, being respectful is really the best way to start. Especially if other students are disrespectful, you'll stand out and quickly become their favorite. You can do things like:


Don't be disruptive. Don't pass notes, talk to your friends, make jokes, or move around too much while your teacher is talking.
Be punctual (on time or even early) and definitely don't skip their class.
When you're talking to them, be polite. Address them as Ma'am or Sir and use words like please and thank you. Be serious when you use the words and don't let them feel like you're making fun of them by talking like this.

, Teachers like it when students ask questions. There are a few reasons for this. First of all, it tells them that you're paying attention. Second, it shows them that you think they're interesting and that you're enjoying the subject (even if you're not). Third, it makes them feel smart and helpful. Everyone likes to feel smart and helpful. Ask questions when you have them and you'll find your teacher liking you more and more.


For example, if your teacher is talking about chemistry and Avogadro's number, ask them how they memorize the number.
As a warning, however, try not to ask pointless questions. You don't want to ask a question just so you have a question to ask. Eventually, this will annoy your teacher and they'll think that you're doing it just for the attention.
Do not ask personal questions or something that is important only to you. You can ask about homework, pop quiz dates or something that does not bother you alone or if you don't understand. ""What pages do we have to read for tomorrow?"" and ""Ma'am, is there a better method to memorize this?"" will be appropriate. ""Why did I get a D?"" and "" Ma'am, which boy band is the hottest according to you?"" are definite nos. ""Ma'am, do you have a boyfriend?"" type of questions which are related to personal relationships of teachers are not to be asked at any cost. Teachers get ticked due to this and can get you suspended.

, You might think that asking your teacher for help will make them mad because it makes you look stupid. This couldn't be further from the truth. Asking for help actually makes you look smart and it will make your teacher happy. When you ask questions, your teacher knows that you'll work hard and understand what they're teaching much better. They'll be proud of you for taking the initiative to get the help you know you need.


For example, if there's a math test coming up in a few weeks, and you know that you didn't fully understand how to divide fractions, then ask your teacher if they can go over the instructions with you one more time and do two or three problems with you until you understand it.
Say something like, ""Mr. Green, I'm having a hard time with the homework. For some reason, the genitive case is just really hard for me to get. Can we maybe meet after school or during lunch, so you can try explaining it in a different way?""

, Be a student that not only keeps out of trouble, but also makes the classroom a kinder place. This is about more than just starting fights and arguments (although you shouldn't do those things either). This is also about being a person that helps solves problems when they come up. For instance:


You remind others (without being bossy or rude) to keep to classroom rules.
If a fight breaks out, you immediately get the nearest teacher, or diffuse the fight, or whatever is appropriate to the situation.
You help the teacher with tasks such as handing out papers, materials, making copies, helping a student with a question, or whatever is appropriate.
You help classmates who are having problems. If a peer is clearly upset, you try to help him. You open the door for a teacher wheeling the AV cart. You do not pass on ugly rumors, even if it is juicy gossip.

, Do your homework on time. Get study guides and ask for help at least two weeks before a test, and not two or three days before. Take notes. When your teacher sees you working hard, even if you're not the smartest and even if you don't get the best test scores, they'll still like you best.

"
Sign up and begin the AP World History course offered by your school.,
Get interested in the subject!,
Do well in class.,
Practice writing Document-Based Essay Questions (DBQs) and pay attention to the feedback you get.,
Register for the test.,
Buy an AP World History study guide as soon as possible, at least a full month before the test.,
Start taking practice tests, including essays.,
Go in and take the test on the designated day (usually in mid-May).",How to Score 5 on the AP World History Exam," If the course is not offered, you can still take the test, it just takes a lot more effort.;
, Read books on historical figures, time periods, etc. Even reading Historical Fiction books helps! Be sure to read about all areas, not just European or American history.

, Participate as much as possible, and put real effort into all of your work. Take notes, and be careful to focus on important information- textbooks can contain excess information that will not help you on the test.

, Since you only have 10 minutes to read the documents and 40 minutes to write your answer, it's important to practice so you can write a DBQ within the 50 minute time limit.

, Some schools will automatically register you if you're taking the course. If you're not taking the course or your school does not do this, find out where and when to register for the test. If you are still not sure, ask your counselor for help.

, Read it chapter by chapter, and take the chapter quizzes. If you find any problematic areas, pay special attention to them and read up on them. Quiz yourself after every section and make sure you understand the content. You don't really need to know specific items, so knowing time periods and regions is what you should focus on. Also, look up history guides and online help courses like Crash Course World History by John Green.

, Take as many as possible by collaborating with your friends and using their review books. For the essays, use the tips given to you in the review book.

, Don't be nervous because it is really easy to mess up if you're too anxious, and don't stress or cram. You should receive your test results by July.

"
If you see any of the above, or especially, if you find any issues that you feel directly point to mold or indoor dampness problems, you may wish to alert the school district (if it is minor) and select another school or healthy building for your child(ren) if you feel the problem is serious.,
If your child is ill, seek medical advice from a physician familiar with mold-related illness (this goes beyond allergies).,
Remember: what is most important is your child's health.",How to Find a Healthy School Building for Your Child5," Parent options include another classroom or building, another school within the same district, a different district, a charter school, private school, or homeschooling. Remember to inspect the buildings for the options, first - and do everything legally, within state law.

, Lists of physicians are available on www.schoolmoldhelp.org on the Resources - Medical page.

, Many schools in America are suffering from mold infestations and poor indoor air quality - even new schools are not exempt. Familiarizing yourself with the above list can prevent your child from remaining in or ending up in a school with mold and dampness problems that can produce chronic illnesses. Do not hesitate! Act quickly!

Let your child see your interest in science.,
Follow their lead.,
Provide books and activities related to their interests.,
Answer their questions.,
Ask open-ended questions.,
Teach your child how to observe.,
Let your child make their own mistakes.",How to Encourage a Child's Natural Curiosity Through Science1," Children like to mimic and mirror what their parents do. If they see you really interested in something science-related, they will also be interested. If you’re watching a science show, have them join you and explain what the show is talking about., Don’t try to force a certain type of science on your child. If they’re particularly interested in nature or the weather, foster that curiosity. Provide them with more information specific to their interests.If your kid really likes bugs, go on a bug hunt and see how many different types you can find.

, If your child really likes dinosaurs, go to the library and get some books about dinosaurs or visit a natural history museum. Resources are accessible everywhere. Simply going online and finding information on what they like can give you ideas for easy and free activities.


Help them find out information on their own as well. Guide them to resources and let them discover from there.

, Kids have lots of questions, but it’s important to try to answer them in ways better than “that’s just the way it is.” Provide an explanation and then encourage a discussion afterward. Reward their curiosity with the information that they crave.If you don’t know the answer, say “That’s a great question that I don’t know the answer to. Let’s find out together!” Then, go to the library or search online to find the answer.

, Try to avoid asking questions that have a simple “yes” or “no” answer. Ask questions that make your child think about the answer. Ask them “how do you feel about…?”, “what do you think will happen if we do…?”, “why do you think this happened…?” These type of questions encourage your child to develop their ideas and how they feel about something.These questions don’t have to have a right or wrong answer, they just need to make your child consider their thoughts before answering.

, When you are out and about, point to things and ask your child questions about them. If you see a bird, ask what color it is. If you are looking at the leaves of a tree, count the number of points on each leaf. Compare different things, asking them “what’s different about these two things?”


After you have been somewhere, ask them questions about where you were to encourage them to constantly observe their surroundings. Ask questions like, “What interesting things did you notice at the park?” or, “How many cats did you see at grandma’s house?”, When they are trying something new or experimenting, it is important to let them make mistakes and not correct everything along the way. Sometimes it is hard to let them fail, but it’s necessary to their learning process. If they make a mistake, they will figure out how to correct it and they will remember the lesson better than if you told them how to do it.If they ask for your help, guide them towards the solution instead of directly telling them how to do it. Ask them, “How do you think you should do this?” or, “What order do you think we should do these things?”

Take notes.,
Be prepared.,
Pay attention.,
Remember why you took the class.,
Turn in all homework.,
Study!,
Never be afraid to ask questions.,
Form a study group.,
Overachieve.,
Don't shy away from a class because you dislike a teacher or other students taking it.,
Practice your writing.",How to Pass AP History," They help you remember important events, books, times, events, and so much more.;
, Always bring the things you'll need, if you have your supplies out you should never have to scramble to find them when the times comes

, Do whatever you need to do to ensure that you give your teacher your full undivided attention: sit away from friends, silence phones, turn music off, don't pass notes, and try not to talk.

, AP classes are very hard; the work load and subject matter are so intense sometimes you wish you shouldn't have taken the class. Don't let yourself fall into that, always remember why you took the class and it will get you through those dark times.

, This is a must, if you don't turn in homework then you're condemning yourself to adversity. Do whatever you need to do in order to ensure you get this done. If you can't keep up with your homework load talk to the teacher about maybe working ahead so you have less homework or about transferring out to a normal class.

, Always read and study every night! This is invaluable, if you spend an half-hour to an hour every night reading, taking notes, and reviewing notes you will find yourself so prepared for that big test that it will be a piece of cake.

, It goes without saying that the only stupid question is the one that is unasked. Don't hesitate to ask your teacher a question about something you don't understand. Some teachers stay after school so take the time for yourself and get help if you don't understand a concept.

, Some teachers require you to form or assign you to a study group. These are great for sharing ideas, improving upon each others ideas, proofreading and editing essays, and for getting help. If you have group projects to do, always assign work and due dates as equally as possible among the members and never hesitate to check on their progress.

, Don't be afraid to do more than what is needed especially if it'll help you later on.

, Think of all the money you'll have saved by not taking the class in college.

, Writing is nearly two-thirds of the exam. It helps to practice your FRQ (Free-Response Questions) and DBQ (Document Based Question) skills, and will help you perform well on that section.

Understand what a charter school is.,
Learn how many children attend charter schools.,
Look at the Annual Growth Rate.,
Understand the admission process.,
Know about their cost and their funding.,
Research the workforce.,
Determine whether a charter school is the best fit.",How to Decide if a Charter School is Right For Your Child," Based on choice, rather than assignment, a charter school is a publicly funded independent school, which is established by teachers, parents, or community groups under the terms of a charter with either a local or national authority. Schools are usually run by independent boards elected by the families of that school, and it's often required that board members have students of their own in the school. In exchange for its independence, a charter school is subject to performance reviews and may close for failing to meet agreed-upon outcomes. Charter schools can be small, independent operations or can be part of a larger education company.


These schools operate under the Charter Innovations, which include allocation of resources, new approaches to administration and governance, extended learning time, and educator evaluation.
Students attend charter schools as a choice made by parents or guardians, rather than a school district. Because of the opt-in nature of these schools, there is often greater parental involvement.;
, 6,723 charter schools currently exist in the United States, and these schools make up 6% of total public enrollment. An estimated 2.9 million children attend approximately 6,700 charter schools across the country in a variety of many settings --- rural, urban, and suburban. As of the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, charter school students made up 6% of U.S. K-12 students in 42 states.

, Charter schools are the fastest-growing school option in the United States public education system. Over recent years, the number of charter schools has grown by six percent, nearing 7,000 as of the end of 2014. It is estimated that charter schools will begin to educate 20-40% of all public school students by 2035., Charter schools accept all students, regardless of where they live or of their ethnicity. In fact, they must be non-discriminatory in admissions and serve all students, including those with disabilities, and their students tend to be as equally diverse as public school students in terms of both race and economic status.If applications to attend a charter school exceed spaces available, the enrollment is deemed by a lottery system, and students who do not get the opportunity to attend can be put on a wait list.

, Since they are public schools, charter schools are unable to charge tuition. Therefore, they are based on a slightly different system than both private schools and district public schools. Like public schools, charter schools are funded according to enrollment and receive funding from the district and state. However, unlike public schools, charter schools often don’t have access to capital or facilities funding, or they may receive less than districts do from these funding sources.In fact, charters receive on average 28% less funding, or 3,509 dollars per pupil, than their public school district peers, which could determine program cuts. , Whereas public school teachers need teaching certifications, charter schools may hire educators that often have professional experience in their subject, but may not be traditionally credentialed. Charter school employees also tend to be more diverse than district schools. For example, Caucasian teachers make up 82% of district school teachers and only 70% of charter school teachers, and African American teachers represent 12% of charter school educators and only 7% of district school teachers. , Like any type of school, a charter school comes with its pros and cons. While it may get less funding, it can also offer an alternative learning environment that may work for your child. Charter schools are no longer just alternatives in low-income urban areas but are beneficial alternatives in rural and suburban areas as well, and successful charter schools can increase access to a high-quality education and help close the achievement gap. If you don't think that the district public schools in your area are the best option for your child, you might want to compare the pros and cons to consider whether a charter school would be a preferable alternative.

Go on nature walks.,
Experiment in the kitchen.,
Observe the weather.,
Visit zoos, aquariums, and science museums.,
Grow a plant.,
Look at things under a microscope.,
Start a nature collection.",How to Encourage a Child's Natural Curiosity Through Science2," Walking around outdoors offers endless opportunities to encourage your child’s curiosity. You can look for animal footprints, birdwatch, identify different types of plants, and look for bugs. Bring a guidebook with you to help you identify things that you find on your walk.While your walking, ask your child questions about what they’re seeing and doing: “What do you think…? What else might be affected…? What do you think happened here? What would happen if…? How can we find out more?”

, There are many experiments that can be done in the kitchen for the curious kid. With just a few ingredients commonly found in the kitchen or around the house, you can do all kinds of experiments that will amaze your child and foster their curiosity in the world around them. Below is a list of just a few options:Place different objects in water and see if they sink or float.

Make ice cream and discuss why the rock salt is important.

Dissolve the shell of an egg and play with what’s left.
Build a baking soda and vinegar volcano.

, Keep a journal that tracks the weather. Each day look out the window and write some things down about the weather for the day. If it changes, make a note of that. You can even go online and write down the high and low temperatures and air pressures for the day. Take pictures to add to the weather journal.After a few weeks, look through the weather journal and ask your child if they see any trends in the weather patterns. Hint: compare changes in air pressure with storms.
Look up the weather in other parts of the world and see how it compares to the weather in your own town.

, All of these places are specifically designed to foster curiosity in their visitors. At zoos and aquariums, you can learn about different types of animals, sea creatures, and the places they live. Science museums and technology centers have lots of hands-on activities throughout to make you think and ask questions.As your child gets older, their experiences will be different, so go to each of these places more than just once.

, Watching the life cycle of a plant is an engaging long-term experiment that they can check on every day over time.Plant the seed in a clear cup so your child can see the roots growing as the plant itself grows. This experiment is also good for promoting patience since the seed will not sprout for a few weeks. The following steps should work for growing any potential seeds that you have.


Fill a small plastic cup about 1/3 full of potting soil.
Make a small hole and place the seed in the hole. Cover the seed with soil.
Water the seed each day and make sure it has plenty of sunlight.
After a few weeks, you should see the seed begin to sprout and watch your plant as it grows.

, If you have access to a microscope, it can be a great learning tool. You can look at almost anything you’d like under a microscope. You might be surprised at everything you can see with a bit of magnification. Even a magnifying glass is a good place to start if you don’t have a microscope.Take a small sample of water from a nearby pond or stream and look at what is floating around in there.
Look at a flower petal or a piece of clothing. What do you see? Are they similar or totally different?

, Let your child decide what to collect. You could make a general collection of the natural objects you have found, such as shells, feathers, rocks, fossils, or bones. Alternatively, you may have a themed collection, sea pods or shells, for instance. This is a great way to compare the different shapes, sizes, colors and other characteristics of natural objects.Help your child to identify and classify the various items they have collected.

In order to naturally be interested in a subject, you should first know your own interests and hobbies.,
If you're a music fanatic like many of us, then the best way for you to grasp the concepts taught in AP World History is probably through remixed, 'geeked-up' versions of your favorite songs with a change of the lyrics so they relate to the chapter or time period you are currently studying in class.,
If writing is more of your 'thing', then perhaps you can weave the tricky details of your current lesson into a short story that you choose to write.,
On the other hand, if you are more of the movie-and-popcorn type of person, then all you need to do is ask your teacher for their favorite history-related movies, paying attention to those which are the most accurate.,
Some of us enjoy reading so historical teen novels would really help these certain individuals.,
If you're the type of person whose mind is a bit slow in grasping a complex concept like the connections between all the different beliefs and religions in the Reformation, you can always consult www.brainpop.com for a simplified overview of an important time or concept in history.,
If you, instead, spend your days surfing the net then this is a useful website for an accurate review of different subjects in AP World History: <http:,
For the gamers/comic-fanatics, you should pay a visit to the comics section of a local bookstore like Barnes and Noble and scan the shelves for history-related material.",How to Enjoy AP World History," Ask yourself what you usually do or - as in most cases - want to do in your spare time. Start by categorizing your main interest into one of these broad categories: listening to music, reading, creative writing such as poetry, short stories, or games and comics.;
, If your creativity is low, you can also look these up on YouTube or another video-sharing website. A great example of a remix that relates a famous hip-hop song to history is the following: <http:

, For example, if you're a guy that goes gaga over action/adventure situations and currently needs to main beliefs behind the European Reformation, you can write a part of a confrontation between Martin Luther and John Calvin and put your own unique spin on how their meeting turns out, all the while incorporating their individual beliefs.

, Some teacher-approved movies include Gladiator, The Last of the Mohicans, and The Mission.

, Asking your history teacher or maybe even English teacher for suggestions is a good idea. If not, you can always inquire about interesting teen-approved historical nonfiction from you school librarian, local librarian, or even a ""Barnes and Noble"" or ""Borders"" associate.

, This can also serve as a vague review just so you remember the key points of a chapter.

,, Some Marvel and Asterix comic books take place in the past and address some of the global issues that took place during that time... be careful for inaccurate information, however.

Start preparing early.,
Take AP courses at school.,
Take advantage of down time.,
Join a study group.,
Take practice exams.,
Review the rules and regulations.,
Take breaks.,
Eat right.,
Stay active.,
Practice relaxation techniques.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Gather your materials.,
Get to the testing center 30 minutes early.,
Ask if noise-canceling headphones are available.,
Pace yourself.",How to Get Ready for AP Tests," It’s best to start your test prep at the beginning of your senior year, about eight to nine months before the exam. Review your notes after each class. This will allow your brain to absorb the material into your long-term memory. Make it a habit to have one- to two-hour study sessions most days of the week. The longer you give yourself to prepare, the calmer you will be on test day.;
, Don’t try to “wing it” without a course for each subject test you want to take. AP courses allow you to absorb the material before your after-school study sessions. They also give you access to teachers who can answer your questions and offer good advice about the test.Before the summer vacation, ask your AP teacher if you need to complete a reading list before classes start in the fall.Other questions might include:

“Where is the testing center?”
“How much time should I dedicate to outlining on each free-response question?”
“Do you recommend any books (aside from what was on the summer reading list) that go into greater depth than the course booklet?”



, Read over your study material as you wait for or ride the bus. Make flashcards to review during commercial breaks. You could also record yourself reading the material aloud and save it to your MP3 player. This will allow you to listen to the material while you walk home, do your chores, exercise, etc.

, Research shows that students learn best from their peers.Studying with trusted classmates will also keep you accountable and motivated. Discuss material from class and practice exams. Quiz each other. Ask questions about material you don’t quite understand. Take notes on everything you learn in your group.


If material is still unclear after a study session, contact your AP teacher(s) for assistance.

, You can find these in the back of many AP study guides or online at CollegeBoard.org.Treat each practice as a “dress rehearsal” for the real thing. Work in a quiet, distraction-free area. Set a timer for the allotted time of each test section. Stop working when the timer goes off.

, Familiarize yourself with what you need to enter the testing center. Know what you can and cannot bring on test day. Read the fine print regarding your additional rights and responsibilities.If you don’t have this information in paper form, save the information from the website as PDFs for future reference.


Check the AP section of the CollegeBoard.org for multiple-choice and free-response time limits of each subject. Know your time limits, and calculate how much time those limits give you per question.

, Treating yourself to some “fun” time will help you avoid burnout. Spend some time with your family and friends. Listen to music. Read a non-academic book. Watch your favorite movie or TV show. This will allow you to enjoy yourself while also giving your brain a chance to rest and better absorb the material., Don’t postpone healthy meals until the last minute. Drink plenty of fluids. Focus on foods high in omega-3 fatty acids and B vitamins for brain health. Foods rich in Vitamin C and zinc will keep your immune system healthy. Eat foods rich in fiber and complex carbohydrates to maintain your energy.Some examples include:



Omega-3: Walnuts, winter squash, flax seeds, fish.

B vitamins: Bell peppers, dark leafy greens, broccoli, beets, B-12 supplements.

Vitamin C: Citrus fruits, berries, kale, broccoli.

Zinc: Beans, peas, nuts, oatmeal.

Fiber: Legumes (beans, peas, nuts), whole grains (wheat, barley, long-grain rice).

Complex carbs: Oatmeal, quinoa, nuts, seeds.

, A regular exercise routine is a great way to reduce stress.Use the treadmill or elliptical machine for some cardio. Hit the weight machines for some strength training. Go for a jog or a swim. Play team sports with your friends. If high-intensity workouts aren’t your thing, try yoga or pilates.

, Relaxing, along with exercising, will help you to unwind from a stressful day. It’s best to practice relaxation about 30 minutes before going to bed. This will help you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly.Try meditation, tai chi, or deep breathing exercises.

, As a teenager, you need about nine hours of sleep every night.Stick to the same sleep schedule every day, including weekends and holidays. Never pull all-nighters. They wear down your immune system and harm your ability to retain the information you need., Do this the night before the exam to avoid any undue stress in the morning. At the testing center, you will need your photo ID and official letter stating that you have permission to take the test. You will also be allowed to take several non-required items into the test area. These include:Several sharpened #2 pencils for multiple-choice questions.
Pens with blue or black ink for free-response questions.
A ruler or straightedge if you’re taking the physics exam.
One or two approved calculators for biology, calculus, chemistry, physics, or statistics.
An analog watch that doesn’t beep and cannot connect to the Internet.

, This is especially crucial if your testing center is not your school. You will have enough time to find the building and the designated room. Look for signage to direct you to the right place. Don’t be afraid to ask for directions if you get lost!


If the test is held in your school, early arrival will give you enough time to collect your thoughts.

, This is especially crucial if you prefer to work in silence. When you’re under pressure, the slightest sound can be a major time drain. Even if background noise doesn’t usually bother you, keep the headphones handy just in case.


Don’t bring your own headphones. They may be confiscated by the proctor(s).

, Time limits on each section vary between each of the 30 subject areas. How you budget your test-taking time will depend on the limits of each section on your specific test. Here are some general strategies to remember:


Take a minute or two to scan the layout of the test.
Skip questions you can’t immediately answer, but circle them as a reminder to come back.
Answer the multiple-choice questions first. After that, proceed to the free-response questions.
If you're struggling on a multiple-choice question, try to find at least one obviously wrong option. This will increase your odds of a correct answer.
Always have an introduction, a body and a conclusion of each free-response question.

Don’t stress.",How to Do Well on AP Exams," AP exams require mastery of lots of material, too much information to cram at one time. The AP courses you are enrolled in are designed to prepare you for the exam, so take the classwork and homework seriously. Pay attention, take notes, review on your own time, and take the time to memorize material.


You can take an AP exam without taking the course, but an AP course is always the best preparation.;
, These often summarize the material in a succinct way and offer plenty of opportunities for practice. Take a diagnostic test and review the material you seem to have trouble with the most.Many companies produce test prep books. If you want additional study materials, buy books from different companies. Although most companies produce new books every year, they largely replicate the material from the preceding year, so buying multiple editions of the same book will do you little good.

, The College Board has free questions on its website and practice books are replete with test questions. Try as much as possible to replicate actual test conditions by timing yourself and performing the test in a quiet environment.

, With one-on-one instruction, the tutor is more likely to be able to help you understand material or focus on your weaknesses than a teacher in a large course. This can be better than studying on your own, because you a tutor can easier notice and correct mistakes as well as objectively evaluate your tests.

, With practice, it becomes easier to write under the time constraints imposed by the AP test. It is also important to get a good sense for your pacing. You don’t want to go on so long on a particular subject that you can’t finish. Get a sense for your limitations so that you know when to wrap things up on your exam.


Try to find another student, a tutor, or a parent who is willing to read your essay and help correct mistakes. It can be difficult to objectively evaluate your own work.
Remember, it isn’t imperative to discuss all of the documents on Document Based Questions. Doing so, might, in fact, make your paper disorganized and cost you valuable time. Familiarize yourself with how many documents you are expected to discuss and stick to that number., To avoid unnecessary stress, be sure that you are familiar with the structure of the test. Know how many questions you need to answer and how much time you have for each. Review the rubrics for the essays. Understand the procedure on test day.For each of the essay assignments, there is a rubric that explains exactly how the grader evaluates the essay. You might be required to cite a specific number of documents or a particular number of countries. Be prepared for this in advance.
Research where and at what time the test will be given to be sure that you can arrive well in advanced. You will be given a barcode upon arrival to identify your test. Familiarizing yourself with these details can eliminate test day stress., Remind yourself how much you want to do well--write out your goals and post them somewhere on your desk you can easily see. Remember, AP exams can be a huge asset for getting into college and freeing up time to focus on the subjects you care about during your undergraduate years.


Beware of distractions like YouTube or Facebook. Do not fall prey to procrastination.

, It is important that you don’t get too rusty over the summer, especially if the subject is something like math that builds on itself from year to year. Review the fundamentals that you have learned. You should even consider getting ahead on your work for the following year.It might seem impossible to start studying for a course you haven’t begun to take yet, but there are some ways to do it. You can buy a test preparation book and study it or you can work with a tutor.

, Until December, you should devote a little bit of time every week to a bit of studying on top of your assigned coursework. This is important to make sure that you are staying on track with your current material., Use the free time you have over Christmas break to review what you have done so far. You will spend much of your time during the spring learning new material so it is important to make sure that you have mastered everything so far. Use this time to catch up on anything you had trouble with., By the spring time, it is important that you are seriously testing your skills. One good way to do this is to work in groups with other students who can correct you when you make mistakes or otherwise force you to the next level. Alternatively, take diagnostic exams to determine what areas you need to focus on.In an AP class, you should ideally be with other intelligent and motivated students who can help you.

, Take practice tests to assess where you are and what you need to work on. Try to replicate real testing conditions so that you are comfortable on exam day. Create a schedule that will allow you to review all of the topics you have trouble with., Spend May working on the topics that you were still having trouble after your April cram session. Go back and review these topics. Don’t study up to the last second though; be sure to get rest., Sleep has a huge effect on your intelligence. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to rest when you are worried about taking a test the following day. Because of that, it is imperative that you rest well the day before and try to get a lot of sleep the week of. Try to get eight hours a night.


Electronics can keep you up at night. Turn them off at least an hour before you go to bed.
Try to exercise frequently. This will help you focus when you study and fall asleep when you need to.Do not fall for the temptation to cram the night before. This will be counterproductive.

, You will need a big breakfast with lots of protein to give yourself the energy to make it through the test. Eggs, bacon, yogurt, nuts, and milk are appropriate. Avoid sugars, like candy, chocolate, and desserts. These will cause you to crash., Unlike on the SAT, you will not be penalized for answering a question incorrectly. Even if you do not know the answer to the question, you have an incentive to guess. If you are stuck on a question, guess and move on so that you get to the other questions.If you are spending too much time on a question, take your best guess and mark the question on your scrap paper. That way, if you have time at the end of test, you will know where to go back and take a look.

, While the essays are a great way to demonstrate your knowledge of the subject, they aren’t intended as an info dump. You will need a clearly defined thesis and information that doesn’t support your argument does not belong in the essay. Discussing irrelevant information will cost you valuable time and will not look good to the readers., Stress can be counterproductive. A 3 won’t hurt your chances at college, it just won’t help as much as a 5. Furthermore, you can retake the AP exam as often as you like, so if something unfortunate happens on test day, you will have an opportunity to make up for your mistakes."

Biology and chemistry are the prerequisite courses that must be finished successfully. , It is always a good idea to introduce yourself to the teacher so he can or she get to know you. You want your teacher to be able to differentiate you from the other students so they are more willing to help you. Send and introductory email or visit the teacher in person.
Gather information regarding prerequisite reading or prep work.
Address your teacher appropriately using “Mr.”, “Ms.”, “Miss.” or “Dr.” after sufficient research to determine the proper title.
Express your intent to work hard.

, It is very important to have everything necessary for a rigorous class like AP Biology. Research supplementary materials that may be helpful besides what is required. Buy them during the summer months to familiarize yourself with the concepts early. , Make sure you have adequate time to complete homework and study. If you find that your schedule is packed with too many activities, prioritize so you can put forth essential time and effort. , Do not wait to organize your materials for the class. You’ll want to be systematic with the way you complete homework, study, take notes, and prepare for upcoming exams. Purchase a planner and use it to mark important due dates.
Highlight important information on your syllabus.
Pack items such as: pens, pencils, highlighters and erasers.
Mark chapters in your textbook using colored tabs to find information and quickly turn to chapters.

, Do not show up the first day without all of the required materials. You will be unprepared and look careless to your teacher. You want to make a good impression right from the start so the teacher knows you are serious about their class. , While sitting in class, try your best not to doodle, daydream, or become distracted. It is vital that you are paying good attention during the entirety of the class to avoid missing pertinent information.


Choose a seat near the front and close to the teacher to avoid falling victim to chatting with others.
Sit near someone who also has a vested interest in the class and can assist you if needed.
Listen attentively so you can retain the information, ask questions, and participate.

, Many students are afraid to ask questions during class, but this is imperative to gauging comprehension. Make sure to ask any and all questions that you believe are necessary to your understanding of the concepts and listen carefully when given the answer. , Make sure you are writing down information while the teacher is lecturing and write it legibly. Also, write with a purpose so you don’t waste time writing down pointless information. , A quarter of AP Biology consists of practical laboratory work that stresses the importance of inquiry-based investigations. If given the opportunity for a partner, and choice in selecting one, pair up with someone you can depend on that will conduct the experiments safely.

, Your teacher is assigning you homework because it is the best way to put into practice what you learned during class. Homework also generates good questions you can ask during your next class meeting. Complete your homework as best you can. You may get stuck while working on a particular question or task, but just the process of figuring out how to complete the challenging assignment is helpful, so complete the homework entirely, regardless of how tough it is.
Questions on the exam will require you to put into practice the mathematical methods and quantitative skills acquired through completion of homework.

, Even if you think it is a waste of time to read your book, do it. Each and every assignment is extra practice needed to master the concepts you are learning and this includes reading, so treat it like any other assignment, despite the fact that it can’t be turned in. You cannot rely on the lectures from class to acquire all the material from your textbook.

, Make sure you’ve set aside plenty of time to complete assignments. You don’t want to be scurrying to get it done right before class begins.

, While completing your homework write down questions to ask your teacher. Your teacher will be able to help you and maybe even set you up with a tutor. , Everyone knows from experience that cramming doesn’t work and is surely a recipe for disaster. Start studying on the very first day of class. If you devote a little time every night to studying, you’ll only need to review the material, come time for the test. While in class, indicate the items your teacher alerts you will be on the test so you can refer to them when studying.
Work on a few skills at a time so you are not overwhelmed at the end of the course.

, By using practice tests to train, you will familiarize yourself with the exam’s structure and knowing this beforehand will be very advantageous. Build your endurance early for this three hour exam by treating the practice exams like the real one.
Practice answering the types of questions on the exam; multiple choice and free response questions.

, By completing practice tests you will learn your strengths and weaknesses so you can allocate more time to particular questions. You will be able to perform better because you will spend more time on the questions that you are aware take you a little longer to answer. , Set goals to encourage yourself to do better. After completing a practice test, write down your score and create a goal for the next one. Perhaps you want to score higher or you just want to finish quicker. Whatever your goals are, set them and you will aim higher each time you sit down to test. , You want to be well rested so you can get up with plenty of time to eat and mentally prepare yourself. Have a light breakfast and don’t eat foods that are too heavy and can cause you to tire or foods you’re not used to eating that may upset your stomach.
You want to satisfied and energized before sitting down for three hours.
The AP Biology exam accounts for a large percentage of your grade, half to be exact!

, You must be fully aware of the types of questions on the exam and the substance of those questions. The four Big Ideas that this course is founded on, consists of concepts relating to evolution, biological systems, and living systems. You will be able to focus on these notions and prepare for the exam with an emphasis on those main ideas. Evolution as a process expounds the variation and harmony that characterizes life.
Free energy and building blocks are used by biological systems for essential processes.
Biological systems all work together as a network to perform specific jobs.
Life systems accomplish 4 major tasks concerning information, tasks fundamental to the processes unique to life.

, The test is comprised of 2 parts, a section for multiple choice questions and a section for free response questions. If you know the how the test is structured before taking it, you will be significantly more prepared. You will be able to dedicate more time to the section of the test that will take you longer to complete because you will already be aware of your strengths and weaknesses. The multiple choice section accounts for 50% of the exam score and consist of 69 total questions.
The free response section account for 50% of the exam score and consists of 8 long and short answer response questions.
You are able to use simple calculators for mathematical calculations during the test.

, By understanding how the AP Biology exam is scored you’ll be better equipped to attain the score you desire. A machine scores the multiple choice section of the exam.
Expertly trained teachers score the free response portion of the exam.
Each free response question is worth more points than each multiple choice question.
The scores calculated for the multiple choice questions and the free response questions are combined to produce a score representative of 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 in descending order of value.

"
Study well before the test.,
Get a study friend.,
Take breaks.,
Relax.,
Pay attention in class.,
Do all available practice questions.,
Get some sleep the night before.,
Have proper meals before the test day.,
Have your test-taking materials assembled and ready.,
Listen to music you like.,
Go into the test in a positive manner.,
Take deep breaths to try to keep calm.,
Read the questions carefully.,
Do the easy questions first.,
Go with your first answer.,
Use logic if you're stuck on a multiple choice question.,
Review your answers thoroughly when you are done.",How to Ace a Test," Do not put off studying until the last minute. If you hold off until the night before or, even worse, that morning, you are less likely to retain all of the material because of stress. Start studying when you find out about the test, or the week of the test.


It may benefit you to make a study schedule. When you set aside time to go over the content, you're less likely to let the week slip by, never having studied once. If you're feeling extra ambitious, set aside different times for different sections of study. Say, 15 pages a day?
Do it every day, repeat and repeat and repeat. As Practice makes a man perfect.
;
, Get a friend, family member, colleague, your girlfriend or boyfriend to help quiz you -- or at least to listen to you rattle off information. Talking to someone else and making the information interactive makes it that much more memorable. However, remember not to choose a friend who will goof around instead of studying!


Or get two or three study friends who are taking the same test if possible! Studies show that groups of three or four people that have a leader to keep them on track and cover all the necessary bases do better than those who study alone. And make sure everyone brings some light snacks for studying such as:
Potato chips
Chocolates
Rice puffs
And many more.

, It's easy to think charging through a 6-hour study session will ensure you pass any test, but studies show that if you take breaks, your brain has an easier time absorbing information. Your brain is like a muscle and it needs time to relax to perform well, too. Aim for ten minute breaks every hour or so.And take breaks in your content, too. Instead of sitting down with the periodic table of the elements, sit down with just a row, for example Tomorrow take on another. And the next day and so on and so forth. This will also give you multiple times to go over all the information instead of putting all the pressure on yourself at once.
In two hour studying session, take a break. So, it helps you to remember the stuff more accurately.

, When you stress a whole lot about the test, this makes your body uptight and your brain less functional. So do something relaxing before you go to bed the night before the test.


Take a hot bath with some scented oil in it. Heat relaxes the muscles in your body and calms you down. Also certain scents are proven to effect the mind in certain ways. Coconut, lavender, and citrus reduce stress and anxiety but obviously in no way guarantee you will Ace any test.
Music and reading also help. Put on some relaxing music and grab your favorite book for instant relaxation.
If you have a hobby that is easy to do at home, do it. Doing something familiar makes it easier to relax.

, Paying attention to the teacher, lecturer or trainer will improve your understanding and you can ask clear questions you may have during your instruction. You may also find that your instructor addresses certain test answers or elicits bonus options, so don't start snoozing!


When you're in a lesson, take notes on the material. Focus on concepts, definitions, and formulas that you think will be on the test. Use your highlighters and write in pictures and diagrams, too. The funner you make it, the more you'll enjoy it. And the more you enjoy it, the easier it'll be to remember!
If you have any questions after you finish your work, you can ask the instructor there instead of getting to the next study period early the next time or not asking them at all!
Never miss any class.

, Some may be assigned or in the textbook or on the textbook website and your instructor may use them for his or her test. Talk to your instructor? Or -- do they think this format is especially useful? Do they use the practice questions on their tests?


And take practice quizzes and tests, too, if available. You'll feel more prepared in addition to being familiar with the content and structure of the actual test.
There are many websites that provide you test and exams of your board.

, If you thought cramming was a good idea, you're in for a surprise. Your brain forms memories while you're asleep -- and on top of that, depriving it of the sleep keeps it from firing on all cylinders. So resist the temptation to cram, because it won't do you any good.You'd be much better off shutting the book and getting some shut eye.


There's a few more things to add here when it comes to sleep. For starters, get good sleep in the days prior to the test, too. And try studying right before bed or right after you wake up -- studies have shown that the former leads to memories that are synthesized in your memory automatically (because sleep leads to memory formation) and with the latter, your brain is empty and ready to ingest information. But ultimately, you should study when you find it the most effective., If you're stuffed or if you're famished, both will lead to your mind being other places. Make sure you're feeling neither hungry nor too full. So be sure to eat breakfast if your test is in the morning!


Eat normally, too. If you're on a vegetarian diet, you don't want to suddenly mix it up with a three-quarter pound cheeseburger. That could be very distracting in the worst of ways. It's hard to ace a test in the bathroom.
The most preferable breakfast for test day is corn flakes.

, You are already nervous, so the last thing you want to do is panic if you cannot find your pencil or pen. Keep extra ones handy in your backpack or your pocket. Keep loose leaf ready and have it all organized to take to the exam.


Have your notes ready, too. That way if you wind up with 5 or 10 minutes of downtime, you can whip them out and go over them on the bus, between classes, or when waiting for a friend.

, That whole ""listening to classical music"" makes you smarter isn't exactly true. What is true is that music calms you down and, if you like it, it can increase your ability to focus for about 15 minutes.Prior to the test, play some tunes you like and revel in your new-found attention.


Classical music is good for stress, though. If you're feeling a little strung out about this exam, you may want to forgo your preferred gangster rap and settle on Mozart.

, It's proven that if you think that you are going to do well on the test then most of the time your grade will be higher than if you think you are going to do poorly on the material. Sort of a ""fake it till you make it"" idea. But it works!


Take a piece of paper and write positive stuff like ""I will ace my test!"" on it. This will remind you to keep up the positive vibes. Be sure to take it out right before the test to get you in the uplifting zone.
Do a big smile with victory pose before you go to test.

, It's proven that your attitude during the test affects the result much more than how you remember the material. Relax. You've got this! You've done what you could -- now all you can do is stay calm and check the right boxes.


If your invigilator allows it, bring a peppermint or two to suck on during the test. Peppermint stimulates the brain and allows you to focus longer and harder.
If test anxiety is a thing you're too familiar with, try yoga, meditation, or listening to your favorite song before the test. If you get in a good place beforehand, you'll be more likely to stay there.

, Read the questions at least twice, in case you missed something before. Underline the keywords in the question. Don't rush. If possible, read the entire exam through before beginning to work. This will give you an idea of what is in store and will help you to manage your time better. It also prevents any nasty surprises with only a few minutes left.


If you're concerned about time, don't go over the entire test beforehand. If you're a slow test taker, wait to go over it until the end. You may need more time to write down your answers. Any answer is better than a blank answer!
A trick is that read every question twice. You just have to under stand the demand on question.

, Look through the paper to check if there are any difficult questions that take a lot of time and leave them for last. You don't have to do the test in the order it is written. Work through easy problems first to build your confidence and calm yourself down.


When coming back to the tough questions, you will know you have at least made a decent grade, and you know how long you have left. Then if you get correct answer to these questions, it's like you have bonus marks. Win win!

, Your first answer is probably correct and if you go back and change your mind several times, you are likely to make a mistake due to self-doubt. Often when we think about things too much, all reason and logic go away. It was your first inclination for a reason!

After you complete your test, check it accurately to justify your win.







, Usually one or two of the question choices are clearly wrong, so take those away. Now you should have two answers, creating a bigger chance of you getting it right. Now go over everything and find the best answer out of the two. The key to multiple choice isn't thinking ""Which one is right?"" but instead ""Which of these are not right?"" and eliminating answers until you have only one left.


Try your best to work out the question. Guess if you have to, because a blank answer surely won't get you any points. But a guess? You could get lucky!

, Make sure you answered all questions, never leaving one blank. If it is multiple choice, you'll have a 25% chance of getting it right (assuming there are four options) if you don't leave it blank. It's worth a shot!


Also, a final look through is a good time to catch any obvious mistakes you might have made and you might remember something more to add to a question as well. Double-checking your work is always a good idea.

Skipping class will cause you to miss a lot of valuable course material and in-class discussions, and may cause you to lose points for attendance.It's not enough to simply show up to class. Strong attendance means showing up prepared and on time, having done the homework and any assigned readings.
Plan on asking questions if you didn't understand any part of the assignment, and participating in any in-class discussions that take place.;
, You should take notes while completing your assigned readings at home, and take notes during in-class lectures. When you get home from class or finish a reading you were notating, it's important to review what you've written and recopy your notes. This will help reinforce what you've learned and consolidate the material that you've been introduced to.In addition to at-home study sessions, you should set aside approximately 10 minutes before each class to review your notes from the previous class session. This will help refresh your memory, reinforce the material, and prepare you to connect what you've already learned to any new material that is taught that day.Take notes on any at-home readings. Read through the material once, then go through it more slowly, taking notes on any relevant or important information. Then make an outline of the material, drawing on the main concepts and terms of the chapter.
Use mnemonic devices or other memory games to help you memorize words/terms or concepts that you struggle with. Try using the first letter of each word to form a new acronym or nonsensical sentence that will help you remember what you're studying. (For example, the sentence ""Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge"" is a common mnemonic device for remembering the musical scale EGBDF.), Whether you're struggling with AP Spanish or just want to deepen your understanding of the material, a tutoring session may help reinforce what you've learned.Tutoring services are offered through some schools, or you can look online or in a newspaper for private tutors in your area.

, Spanish vocabulary is a central part of AP Spanish. If you're going to do well in the class, you must learn and study vocabulary words from class and from your text book. One way to do this is to make and use flash cards. Simply buy a stack of blank index cards and write the term or phrase in Spanish on one side with the English translation on the back. Then quiz yourself, keeping a separate pile of words/terms that you tend to struggle with.Study active verbs like alquilar (to rent), ayudar (to help), cantar (to sing), and escuchar (to listen).You can strengthen your understanding of these terms by forming your own sentences as you practice.
Learn adjectives like comprensivo (understanding), considerado (considerate), vanidoso (vain), mimado (spoiled), and modesto (modest).Try studying adjectives in pairs so that you learn one adjective and its opposite, then try using both words in a sentence.
You should have a list of vocabulary terms from your class or from your text book. If you do not have such a list, ask your teacher for a comprehensive list of words and terms to help you study and prepare for the exam. You can also search online to find a compiled vocabulary list at many school district websites, such as Elma, Washington's AP Spanish website., Interpersonal communication is the basic use of language in day-to-day conversation. This includes class discussions, asking questions, exchanging information or points of view, and explaining your opinions. You'll need to work on interpersonal communication to form a better understanding of the use of Spanish. It is also considered a core learning objective of AP Spanish.Practice forming questions and responding to those questions completely in Spanish.Work on writing your observations of people, places, and things entirely in Spanish. Then try to explain or justify those observations in Spanish, pretending that someone asked you to clarify how you jumped to those conclusions. This is good practice for an actual conversation, where someone would respond to what you said by asking a question that you'd need to answer.

, Interpretive communication means being able to listen to and watch materials in the Spanish language in order to understand the main ideas of a piece of work, identify points of view, and recognize varying points of view. You can find Spanish media by listening to podcasts and music or watching videos in Spanish, all available online for free.Work on identifying the rhetorical audience of a text/speech/video, the genre of that form of media, and the point of view of each speaker. Then try to relate that work to the larger sociocultural issues it addresses.Practice relating a secondary piece of media to a primary piece of media. For example, if you listen to a political figure deliver a speech, and then watch a news correspondent discuss that speech, try to contextualize the news correspondent's discussion based on what the politician said. Identify what important issues both parties are talking about, and if they have conflicting opinions, try to figure out what informs those opinions based on what you've seen/heard.

, Presentational communication skills are the ability to deliver well-considered ideas to a variety of audiences, using details and supporting information to enrich your communication skills. This could involve delivering a narrative, explaining something to others, comparing two or more things to an audience, or persuading someone with a well-supported argument.In this form of communication, you may not have the opportunity to clarify or negotiate what you mean by what you say. Therefore, it's important to work on clarity and precision when you choose your words and formulate your sentences.Practice organizing information, concepts, and ideas into a coherent and logical format. As you get comfortable with this, try timing yourself. Work on pushing yourself to organize information/ideas within a set time frame to prepare you for an actual presentation.

, Being able to read and comprehend text written in Spanish is a key component of AP Spanish. The best way to strengthen your reading comprehension skills is by diving into Spanish texts, both those delivered in class as well as news and culture articles found online.You can find many Spanish publications online for free. Some instructors recommend reading about a variety of relevant topics in Spanish on a regular basis to strengthen skills, including articles about:


the economy
arts and entertainment
politics
technology

, Cramming for a test simply won't work, and it will not help you retain any information long-term. Spacing out your study sessions is a much more efficient and low-stress way to prepare for an important examination. For example, rather than spending 12 consecutive hours cramming for a final exam, you're much better off breaking your study sessions up into three hour blocks, with about one week between each block (spread over the course of four weeks).Generally speaking, the more time you give yourself between study sessions, the more likely you are to retain the information you learn over the long run.
Take breaks intermittently. After an hour or so of studying, give yourself a five minute break. Try having a healthy snack during your break to reenergize your mind and body., Some people find they perform better when studying and doing homework at night. Others are morning people who prefer to hit the books first thing after waking up. Still others prefer something in between, like an afternoon session. It's important to determine when you are most productive in your studies, as well figuring out where you study best.Do you work best in the comfort of your room? Or are there too many distractions there that might pull you away from your studies? Is the library a productive place for you to study, or does it feel too overwhelming to be out of your element? Learning where you work most efficiently will help you build effective, productive study habits.

, Once you're adequately familiar with the course information and have spent enough time studying that you can answer practice questions, try doing a practice exam session while working under a time limit. You can find practice exams and other study materials on the AP website.Try using a stop watch, kitchen timer, or alarm clock to complete each section within the allotted time, and keep track of how long each session takes you. Work on cutting your time down without decreasing your score so that you can do well under time constraints when you take the actual test.

, The AP Spanish exam is approximately three hours long, divided into two sections: a 95 minute multiple-choice section and an 85 minute free-response component.As you work, it's important to pace yourself. Give yourself enough time to complete each section without rushing or skipping any necessary components.


Wear a watch or take note of the time on a wall clock when each section begins. That will give you a decent idea of how much time you've spent on a given section and how much time remains.

, Section one (multiple choice) is split into two parts: print texts (part A) and a mix of print and audio texts (part B). You will be allowed to take notes during this section, and will be provided with writing space to do so. Points are not deducted for incorrect or unanswered questions, and the total score is based on the number of questions you answer correctly.Part A will require you to read a text, draw out the main concepts and supporting details, then answer questions about the content of the text, the meaning of certain terms, the author's point of view, and the intended audience of that text.
Part B entails listening to audio materials, which may include interviews, podcasts, public service announcements, recorded conversations, or short professional presentations. The first portion of part B will pair these audio recordings with relevant printed texts, while the second portion will be all audio recordings. You will then answer questions on the recordings, similar to the way you did in part A.
Before your read the answer section, try covering it up and coming up with an answer on your own. That way you are less likely to rationalize an incorrect answer.Look for repetition of words. If a response in the answer section uses some of the same key words that are written in the question, there's a good chance that that answer is correct.
An answer that uses absolute words like ""never,"" ""always,"" or ""necessarily"" is often less likely to be correct than an answer that uses conditional words like ""often"" or ""probably.""
Remember that the correct answer will always be in a multiple choice question. If you cannot determine which answer is definitely correct, try eliminating answers that you know are wrong or only partially correct. If multiple answers are correct and one of the options is ""all of the above,"" there's a good chance that that is the correct answer.

, Section two consists of free response assignments. In this section, you will be given four tasks, which you'll have a total of approximately 85 minutes to complete. There is no minimum length for written responses, and you can complete these sections in any order that you'd like. However, you will be working within a time limit for each part, and you are scored on your ability to analyze and contextualize a text, as well as your ability to use appropriate and varied vocabulary and syntax in each answer.The specific assignment for each task will vary somewhat, but will fall into the following categories:email reply (interpersonal writing) - you'll be given the text of an email in Spanish and write a response to that correspondence (also in Spanish). You must answer questions posed in the email and provide any requested information that the email asks for. You have 15 minutes to complete this task, which is worth 12.5% of your final exam grade.
persuasive essay (presentational writing) - you will be given an essay prompt and three sources to draw from, which represent different attitudes or points of view on the topic you're to write about. You must then prepare and compose a persuasive essay in Spanish which makes clear your point of view, and you must use information from the three provided sources to support your opinion. You have 55 minutes to complete this task, which is worth 12.5% of your final exam grade.
conversation (interpersonal speaking) - you'll be given the text outline of a conversation. You will then have to ""participate"" in the conversation by responding to five prompts. You'll be given 20 seconds to complete each response. This task is worth 12.5% of your final exam grade.
cultural comparison (presentational speaking) - you will be given a prompt about some relevant cultural topic. You must then prepare and present your own oral presentation on this topic in which you compare and contrast differing attitudes or perspectives on the topic, drawing from your own community and from a Spanish-speaking community you're familiar with. You'll have four minutes to read the prompt and prepare an answer, then two minutes to present and record your presentation. This task is worth 12.5% of your final exam grade.

Give your child choices.",How to Prepare Your Child for Nursery School," Many schools will expect your child to be at least partially potty trained, especially if your child is 4-years-old or older. If your child is younger, your child may not need to be completely potty trained, but you should be working on it with your child.Wait for you child to be ready. Your child should start showing interest in the toilet and underwear, at about 2 or 2 and a 1/2, before you begin. Your child should also be able to understand directions and stay dry for about 2-hour periods. To make potty training a little bit more successful, make sure that your child can communicate and wants to be clean and dry. Coming to your when he/she needs a change is a wonderful readiness skill. Your child should also know what up and own, clean and dirty, and wet and dry are. They should know the names of their body parts and the potty terminology used in your house such as pee and poop. Get tools to help you potty train. It's difficult for your child to use a regular-sized toilet without any adaptions. You can either get your child a small toilet that is their size, or you can invest in a smaller child-sized toilet seat that fits over your regular one.You can also try switching to underwear or training pants. A lot of preschools will appreciate it if your child wears disposable training pants because they are easy to clean up after accidents and the child can pull them up and down making it easier for toilet usage. In fact, letting your kid pick out underwear or training pants can help get your child excited about the process. It's also important to have clothes that your child can get off easily.;
, Try to take regular bathroom breaks throughout the day for your child to try sitting on the potty. Your child shouldn't have their diaper on while sitting on the toilet. Both boys and girls should start sitting down, even though boys will move to standing up later.Try having the kid sit on the toilet about half an hour after eating, as kids are more likely to need to go then. You should also encourage your kid to take a break when your kid looks like they need to go. Your kid may wiggle around or grab at their crotch area, for instance.
Get your kid to the bathroom as soon as you notice the signs. If your kid ends up going in the potty, make sure to show your excitement so they get the idea. Letting your kid flush the toilet can also be a fun reward for most kids.
Rewards can be helpful, too. You can use whatever incentive your child enjoys, such as stickers or even reading time with a parent or sibling. Give your child a reward every time they use the bathroom in the toilet., Of course, your child's teacher will help when your child needs a zipper done up or shoes tied, but the teacher only has so much time. The more your child can do by themselves, the better. Try to make learning dressing skills into a game. For example, you could have your child see how fast they can dress themselves and tie their shoes, then see if they can beat their time. At the end, show excitement for the the skills they've done well.Let your child practice shoe tying with a string attached to a board.
You also find toys that help your child work on buttons, zippers, and Velcro.

, Most preschoolers only take naps in the afternoon. The rest of the day, the kids are busy doing activities. Your child may still be on two naps a day. If so, try keeping the child up through the morning, then letting them sleep more in the afternoon.Try keeping your kid engaged and very active in the morning. Play outside or choose an activity that's physical instead of choosing a quieter activity like watching a movie. That way, they won't want to sleep in the morning, and they'll be tired out by the afternoon.

, Once your child enters nursery school, they should be able to play for at least a short period of time by themselves or with other kids. They can't need to be constantly told what to do by an adult because preschool consists of some independent play with a large group of kids.As your child gets to nursery school age, at age 3 or 4, try encouraging your child to play independently.
When your child is bored and wants to play, ask them what they'd like to do. When they name it, help them get it out, and walk away to let them play. If they ask you to play with them, let them know that you'd like them to play by themselves for a little while.

, The best way to help your child develop social skills is to plan play dates and put them in other situations where they interact with other kids, such as at the playground. You can also enroll your child in parks and recreation class to interact with other kids in a more structured setting.You can also help your kid learn social skills by playacting conversations with them. For example, you could pretend to be one of your child's friends and playact a conversation your child may have with another child.
Try focusing play dates around activities your child enjoys or is interested in. That way, they are more likely to interact with the other kids., Reading to your child introduces them to books and reading, which gets them on the road to school. Plus, reading to your child teaches them to sit still for a period of time, which is also an important skill for school.As you get closer to preschool, pick up some books about going to school. That can help introduce the topic to your child, giving them a chance to talk about their thoughts and emotions.

, Your child will need to be able to listen to instructions because that's the only way a teacher has of corralling a class of kids. Work on giving your kid directions and having them follow through, such as when they're brushing they're teeth. You can also try fun activities like baking together where you tell them what they need to do.Other games can help encourage listening, such as I, Spy, Simon Says, Mother, May I?, and Red Light, Green Light.

, Encouraging your kid's artistic side is not only fun for both of you, it helps develop fine and gross motor skills, which is important for starting school. Coloring, painting, sculpting, and drawing all help your kid work on those skills, and they'll have fun doing it.Try working on art activities together. Your kid will be even more enthusiastic about art if you get to spend time together.
If art isn't your kid's thing, try other activities that build motor skills, such as using building blocks or putting puzzles together. You could also try practicing some basic cooking skills.

, When your child is at school, they need to be able to tell their teacher when they need things, like going to the bathroom. They don't need to speak perfect English, but they should be able to able to communicate with other adults.One way to encourage communication is to not immediately fill your kids' needs. That is, you may already know what your kid wants before they ask. However, make them ask for what they need before you give it to them. That will encourage them to be more communicative.
You can also model behavior by vocalizing needs you have. If your kid sees you asking for what you need, it will help them learn that behavior, as well.

, In the days leading up to nursery school, talk to your child about what will happen at school. You can tell your child where they'll be going, what they'll be doing during the day, and what will be expected of them. Try to keep it as light and fun-sounding as possible, but let your child express their fears. Try to answer any questions they have honestly and openly.For example, you could say things like, ""In a few weeks, you'll be going to nursery school. Nursery school is when you go to a place where there are other kids. You'll get to play and listen to stories. Mommy and Daddy won't be there, but you'll have another adult called a teacher looking after you, like when you go to daycare. Does that sound like fun?""

, If the first time your kid has ever been away from you or other family members is nursery school, it can make the process that much scarier. To help take some of the sting away, practice the separation by asking a friend to babysit for you.Start with shorter periods, such as 30 minutes, and work up to longer periods.
Tell your child you're going to leave, but that you'll be back soon. When you come back, you're proving to your child that you'll do what you say.
If your child doesn't stop crying the whole time you're gone after several sessions, they may not be ready to go to nursery school yet., Most schools have open houses where you and your child can see the school. Seeing the school ahead of time helps you prepare your child for going there. Plus, letting your child see the classroom can get them excited about going to school, as it will probably be bright and colorful with toys and books.Another way to help ease your child into nursery school is to have your child meet the teacher. That way, your child will be able to see how nice the teacher is, and they'll have a friendly, familiar face on the first day of school., While school is in session, trying take your kid by the school so he or she can see the other kids playing. Seeing the fun they're having will help your child be more comfortable with the idea of going to school.

, Whenever you're talking about school, talk about how fun and exciting it will be. If your child sees you're enthusiastic, they'll be enthusiastic, too. Keep the enthusiasm up even when you're taking your kid to school for the first time. If you're upset and anxious, it will rub off on your child, while if you stay excited, it will likely be easier on them the first time., Another way to encourage enthusiasm is to let your kid pick out school supplies in anticipation of school. Obviously, the school will have some required supplies, but letting your kid pick out their lunchbox, backpack, and even new school clothes can make them more excited.


Another way to give your child choices is to let them pick out things for school in the morning. For instance, you can let them choose their outfit, as well as their snack or lunch.

Point out rhyming words.",How to Teach Young Kids Using Repetition and Rhyme," Teach children to put their toys away, take a nap, or transition to a new activity through repetition of songs or rhymes. A quick song can signal to a child that it’s time to transition and do something different. Especially if the child struggles to leave one activity and start another, having a transition song can help them learn to do this more easily and with less fuss.For example, have a song for cleaning up and a song for nap time.;
, Babies and toddlers can learn to recognize patterns and begin learning introductory math skills through the use of songs or chants. Sing songs and do movements to the lyrics. Think about what songs or rhymes use counting, patterns, and accompanying movements. The children will learn to sing along and do the movements on their own.For example, check out the songs and movements to “Roll Over, Roll Over,” “Monkeys on the Bed,” and “Open, Shut Them.”

, If children are familiar with “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,” substitute new words into the song, then explain their meaning. For example, sing, “Twinkle, twinkle brilliant star” or, “Twinkle, twinkle giant star.” Because the children already know the repetition in the song, they can sing along and learn new words. For example, when singing about a giant star, sing in a giant voice, or sing about a silent star in a very small voice.Allow the children to get creative and introduce new words, too!

, Get kids actively engaged in music by going beyond just listening to it. Use repetition in movements to teach kids to clap, stomp, rock, march, or move to the beat. Use hand motions and movements or include instruments. Skills in keeping a beat and making coordinated movements can help them throughout their development and build skills for school.Participate in music by joining in on an instrument or singing along. Do hand motions and movements to encourage children to do them, too.

, Some songs rely on memory. For example, “The 12 Days of Christmas” and “There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly” rely on remembering the other items previously mentioned in the song. These songs rely on repetition to remember words and build memory skills.Create songs around lists to help children remember things to do.
For example, instead of “The 12 Days of Christmas,” change the lyrics to “The 12 Steps of My Day” for a morning routine song.

, Make rhyming a fun activity by turning it into a game. For example, play rhyming “Bingo” by either purchasing or creating the game at home. Make or buy rhyming “Memory” by matching rhyming words instead of exact pairs. Create a rhyming scavenger hunt for a group of children. Assign children to small groups and have them be on the lookout for hidden objects in the classroom that rhyme. Give them a list of items to find to make it easier.There are lots of ways to include rhyming activities into your day. For example, if you’re driving your children to school, play rhyming “I spy” by saying, “I spy a car!” Then, have your child come up with something that rhymes with car.

, Find ways to rhyme your child’s name with things. Call them “Silly Milly” or “Tall Paul.” Play fun games that use name rhyming such as “If your name rhymes with Chariot, stand on one foot. If your name rhymes with Ziego, touch the table.”Create a “mirror twin” for your child each time they look in the mirror. For a child named Ethan, his mirror twin may be named Bethan. Have them play games with their mirror twin and make sure they know it’s a silly game, not real.

, Children are often drawn to pictures and illustrations which can aid in their learning. Find rhyming books that have bright, colorful pictures and interact with them. Use flashcards to identify which two pictures show rhyming words. Making visual associations with rhyming can help create a stronger connection of the similarities.Get children to draw rhyming words. For example, draw a picture of a bear, then have them draw a picture of something that rhymes with bear such as chair, hair, or whatever else they come up with.

, Read lots and lots of rhyming books to the children. When reading rhyming words, read them in the same tone so that children can pick them up. Have children say or guess the second rhyming word, or begin creating their own rhyming word to complete the story.Some common books that include rhyming include “Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,” “How Big is a Pig?”and, “Moo, Baa, La La La!” Dr. Suess also wrote many rhyming books that children enjoy.

, Rhyming stories can help children learn to anticipate words, build their vocabulary, and practice using the rhythm of speech. Allow children to complete rhyming stanzas of books and learn how speech can be rhythmic and predictable. Let them fill in words during songs or poems or make up their own words that rhyme into a song.Regularly let children complete the verse or poem when reading aloud.

, Introduce new vocabulary words and practice known words through stories that use the word in repetition. Repeating a word can help the child learn the pronunciation and meaning of the word while enjoying a story or song. This is especially helpful for toddlers so that they can practice how to say their words in a fun way.Use contextual clues from the story to help children learn new words. Explain new words to them if they ask.

, Even young children can ‘read’ books that are repetitive and use rhythm and rhyme. This allows them to pick up on speech patterns and memorize the story. When children memorize books it allows them to familiarize themselves with the story and begin early reading skills.Begin to point at the words as they ‘read’ so that they learn to recognize words individually and begin to build their reading skills.

, When a child learns to memorize a story, start to build their skills. When you read a book together, ask what two words rhyme or sound the same. Repeat the words or pause and have the child say the rhyming words. Rhyming can help with reading skills and teach children to listen to words and their sounds.Say, “Which two words sounded the same?” or, “Point to the objects on the page that sound the same in the story.”

If you know this event took place during World War II, include it!,
Remember that your essay needs more outside evidence than inside evidence.",How to Answer Document Based Questions for AP Tests," These questions briefly come up in AP exams and related high-level academic testing. Knowing when to anticipate these kinds of questions will help you deal with them as they arise.;
, In some kinds of tests, only primary documents will be included for DBQ questions. Others may include the use of secondary source documents.


Ask questions in class and learn about how to use secondary source documents. When you have to prioritize sources, this task can often be confusing. Having some upfront knowledge about how to order various levels of source material can help you with more complex DBQ questions.

, Some types of DBQ questions will rely not just on text, but also on some visuals included in the test packet. Having familiar knowledge of what will show up in source documents can also help you on test day.

, DBQ questions measure specific skills that you will use later in life. Bring these skills to the table when dealing with these question formats.


Make good use of comparisons and analogies. In some kinds of academic tests, the goal is to employ good comparisons in addressing or responding to text cues. Look for effective analogies and draw lines between congruent ideas to score well.

, In some kinds of DBQ questions, another goal is to argue one side of a situation or support one point of view. Even though experts recommend seeing the source material from various points of view, you may be able to benefit from boiling down the material into one supportable stance.


Create a thesis statement. The thesis statement will effectively state your position for the response. This is the most important part because it provides a brief sentence(s) on what you are about to write. A strong essay will most likely have a strong thesis, and vice versa.
Support the thesis statement with well-ordered examples or ideas. Part of going beyond the basics with DBQ questions is being able to draw out supporting ideas for a general thesis statement from wherever they are within the text. Follow this strategy and employ it in either essay questions or a series of short-answer questions as the test develops them.

, The AP essay readers are not looking for a summary of each documents. They want to know if you can use the information provided in the documents and use analysis with critical thinking, and tie it in with other documents.

, Back up your details with document references. Make sure to include the document number at the end in parenthesis.

, In other words, what point of view is missing from these documents? If all the documents are from high-class aristocrats, could the missing voice be the common people's perspective? If all the documents are written or said by men, the missing voice may be women's point of views. Explain why it would be beneficial to the reader. Something as simple as this will earn you a point.


Make the transition to the body of the essay by citing the additional document: ""To better understand how these documents relate to each other, a document about x would be useful because...""
The rubric for this type of essay only asks for one additional document, but AP essay readers are really looking for TWO additional documents; the more the merrier. Simply include one more viewpoint.

,, This will show the AP essay readers that you know your history background, which is a big plus for you.

, For example if the document is about the Great Depression, you may want to include information on the TVA, Works Progress Administration, Public Works Administration etc. Remember to analyze and not state facts.

Babies should be introduced as early as possible to the book format. there are plenty of board books available that are sturdy in design and get the child used to the format of a book with pages. Bright , bold images with one of=r two words on a page are great and babies love to see pictures of other babies.

, Story books with a lot of pictures could be the first step for children under the age of 5. Children ages 2-3 should be introduced to picture books with large bold pictures and short texts. Also interactive picture books are great for this age. As children grow older, say 3-5, they can handle more text and more intricate pictures and more developed story lines. Caregivers should use there hands to illustrate the pathway of the text, moving , of course, from left to right and let the child begin to turn the pages of the book. often children want their favorite book read to them over and over.. this is the beginning of reading, they are memorizing the story and connecting it with the pictures.


The book should be in simple language for the child to be able to read at ease with just few attempts.

, Initial guidance maybe very useful to make things interesting to the child. Read out the line and then ask the child to repeat it.

There are many Catholic schools in Australia and most Australians live within walking distance of a Catholic school.

,
Catholic schools charge tuition fees but they are the cheapest of all private schools in Australia.,
Some catholic schools are coeducational and others are single sex, usually single sex schools don't start until at least Year 5.

,
Catholic schools will never turn away a Catholic student on the basis that they can't pay fees.,
The third common type of school in Australia are private schools.,
Most Private schools have some sort of religious affiliation such as Uniting church, Anglican, Lutheran, Adventist or most commonly non denominational general Christian education.,
Private schools usually offer an excellent education with smaller classes, more specialty subjects than a non private school.,
Boarding school is another option in Australia.,
Many Private schools offer boarding fro students from years 5-12.,
Many boarding schools offer the option of weekly boarding where students can board from Monday morning-Friday evening and spend the weekends at home.

,
The school of distance education is also a choice for students.,
Distance education students are officially enrolled in a school and have teachers, they just don't see them every day.,
Home school is also an option.,
If your child has a disability such as a physical impairment, and intellectual impairment, a visual impairment, a hearing impairment, and speech/language disorder or an autism spectrum disorder are entitled to special education.

,
Students with mild disabilities usually attend a regular school and receive some classroom support.

,
Most regular schools have a special education unit that caters for a particular type of disability.,
Students with severe disabilities may attend a special school.

",How to Choose the Right School for Your Child in Australia," Every child has a right to a free education at a state school. State schools are usually divided into primary school (for kids from 4 or 5 to about 12) and secondary or High schools (for kids from about 12 -17 or 18). Some state schools offer a seamless education from 4 or 5 years old right up to 17 or 18. State schools are usually coeducational, in all but a few exceptions.;
,, Australians may send their child to any state school. Any state school that is not reaching capacity must accept any school age student unless they have a disability or have been previously expelled from that school.

, Not all state schools are equal. Some are very large and others very small, some are more competitive others more laid back, many will offer different subjects, some are strict others are not. State schools will vary depending on the area the school is in, the size of the school, the special programs offered by the school, the principal and the teachers.

,,,, Catholic schools offer an education to students in a similar way to state schools but with a Catholic education. Many Catholic schools have a catholic church on campus.

,, Fees are usually between $1000-$3000 per year.

,, They accept catholic students first and foremost but will accept non catholic students if extra places exist.

, Private schools may be Primary or secondary schools or a combination of both. They are fee paying schools and can be expensive. Fees for private schools range from $3000-$12000 per year. They may be coeducational or single sex.

, Some private schools exist that do not have a religious affiliation but these are less common,

, Private schools are usually selective with students and have high expectations for behavior. Scholarships are usually available

, All boarding schools in Australia are also private schools so they are quite expensive. Boarding fees are usually $9000-$12000 per year and this must be paid as well in addition to the tuition fees at the school.

, Boarding school is a more popular option for families who live in rural areas and could not access a school in their local area, or those who are out of the country for work. Boarding school is also popular for parents who want the boarding experience and supervised study at night.

,, The school of distance education allows students to attend school at home. The school sends schoolwork and offers radio lessons as well as phone and computer access to their teachers. Distance education is offered to those who live too far from a regular school, whose parents are overseas for a long period of time, whose parents need to travel frequently for work, who have a medical reason for not attending school, whose parents choose to home school them or who have another approved reason.

, Get together and social days are frequently organized.

, Home school is different to distance education. Home school parents are their children's teachers and they set their own curriculum.

,,, Those with moderate disabilities, attend these units while doing some regular classes.

Read to your child every night.,
Create time for reading and writing.,
Provide your child with a place and materials for creative writing.,
Focus on creativity, not grammar.,
Show interest in your child's ideas.,
Display your child's work.,
Play stenographer.,
Write and read along with your child.,
Correspond with friends and family often.",How to Improve Your Child's Creative Writing Skills1," Reading and writing go hand-in-hand.Good writers are well read in various subjects and writing styles. Your child's teacher and local librarian can help you select books that are appropriate to your child's age and interests.


In addition to reading to your child, have your child read to you if she is old enough.
Ask your child questions about her favorite books. Why does she like some books and not others? Help her to develop her tastes as a reader and to be thoughtful about words, characters, settings, and plots.If your child has a favorite author or book series, you might also consider taking your child to see the author speak or sign books in order to inspire your child to write.;
, Make sure your child's schedule isn't packed with other activities.Reading and writing take a lot of time and mental energy, so you cannot expect your child to write a story in between soccer practice and piano lessons. Let your child explore the world of words during times when she can relax, breathe, contemplate, and think freely.

, Just as children should have a quiet place to study and do their other homework, the same is true for their writing assignments. Ideally, this would be a desk in the child's room, away from the television. If your child wishes to have privacy, be sure that you afford that to him: do not read over his shoulder unless he says you can.A child's writing area should include the following materials:A notebook or journal
Pens, pencils, and erasers
A bookshelf to keep inspiration nearby
An age-appropriate dictionary
A thesaurus. A thesaurus isn't necessary for very young children, but it can be helpful for older children who wish to expand their vocabularies.

, If your child is to succeed as a creative writer, she must learn how to experiment, take risks, and think outside the box. Don't discourage your child's creativity by harping on her spelling, grammar, or punctuation. Feel free to gently correct these mechanical errors, but do not make your child feel like she has failed a homework assignment.Instead, praise her creativity and talk to her about her ideas., You might be your child's sole audience for her stories for quite a while. Encourage her to love creativity and writing by demonstrating your keen interest in her ideas, thoughts, and stories.Ask her questions about her stories that show that you were paying attention.Compliment your child when she has done something well, such as come up with an interesting character, write a funny plot, or use a difficult word correctly in a sentence., Children love it when their own drawings, stories, and paintings are displayed for the whole family to see. Keep your child motivated to write by putting their stories up on the fridge or placing them on a bulletin board.You can also work with your child to make a special ""book"" out of her stories, including homemade illustrations and decorations. Stitch the book together with ribbon or yarn to create a special venue for her creativity., If your child is too young to write and spell out long stories, ask your child to come up with stories out loud. Write down your child's thoughts and read them back to her.You can do this with very young children to help them learn to connect spoken and written words or with older children to help them focus.

, Be a model reader and writer for your child. Demonstrate to her that reading and writing are valuable and fun activities. The more your child sees you reading and writing, the more likely she will be to continue the practice on her own., Sometimes the most valuable writing activities are those that build and maintain important personal connections. Develop email or letter-writing correspondence with friends and family members and ask your child to assist you.If your child is excited to receive and send letters, your child might apply this excitement to other writing activities.

"
"
Incorporate writing activity into imaginative play.,
Play word games.,
Play a collaborative story-writing game.,
Keep the games short.",How to Improve Your Child's Creative Writing Skills2," Your child likely already plays a number of fascinating, imaginative games. Perhaps he likes to pretend that he is someone famous or enjoys playing ""cops and robbers."" Figure out a writing activity that fits into your child's interests and enthusiasms to spark his creative writing talents.For example, you might:


Ask that he write a letter from the perspective of a character he likes to play
Suggest that he write about ""a day in the life"" of his imaginary friend
Help your child invent an imaginary country and ask him to write about what people do there
Ask your child to create a ""mashup"" story that includes his favorite characters from completely different worlds, There are a number of games and toys that can help build your child's vocabulary. These can all help your child develop a love of words and learn how to use different words appropriately.Some popular word games and toys include:


Scrabble
Mad Libs
Magnetic poetry
Boggle
Balderdash
Catchphrase
Taboo

, If your child is shy or uncomfortable coming up with her own creative writing ideas, propose a game where the two of you can write a story together. Try to keep the story silly and light-hearted in order to keep your child interested and engaged. A few game ideas include:


Write a story by switching off each sentence. First you write a sentence, then your child continues with the next sentence, then you take over again, etc. Try to add unexpected surprises and goofy twists to keep the story fun and exciting.Draw a picture and ask your child to imagine a story behind the picture.Make a list of words by having you and your child point to random words in a dictionary. Then brainstorm a way to use all of those words in a single story.

, Depending on how old your child is, your child might have a limited attention span. Keep the games age-appropriate and brief in order to keep your child from becoming discouraged.Limit these games to 15-30 minutes and allow your child to quit early if she seems bored, stressed out, or tired. Remember that these games must be fun in order to work."
"
Ask questions about the world around you.,
Ask your child to rewrite a famous story.,
Have your child write a story around a random sentence.,
Have your child ""read"" wordless books.",How to Improve Your Child's Creative Writing Skills3," Develop your child's curiosity in order to develop his creative writing skills. Ask your child questions about the world around you in order to spark his curiosity and creativity.Having interesting, thoughtful conversations in the home will help your child develop the curiosity and vocabulary necessary to becoming a creative writer.For example, you might:


Ask your child to look out a car window and think about where people on the sidewalk are headed
Point out animals while you're walking and ask your child to think about what the lives of these animals are like
Ask your child to come up with a new name for his favorite park
Ask your child what his favorite building is and why he likes it so much

, Sometimes children might not be able to come up with completely unique characters, settings, and plots. In order to get them to practice writing creatively, consider having your child write a new version of an old classic, such as a fairy tale.What would your child change about the story to make it his own?

, An effective writing prompt can be to pick a sentence out of your child's favorite book and asking her to write a story around that sentence.See if your child can come up with a story that departs from the original source material to teach her how versatile creative writing can be.

, Wordless books can be an excellent way to have your child practice coming up with story ideas. These books have intricate, whimsical pictures that can allow your child to brainstorm an infinite number of new stories and ideas.Check out or purchase a few wordless books and ask your child to figure out what the words might be.

"
Encourage daily writing.,
Encourage your child to keep a journal.,
Encourage your child to plan before writing difficult things.,
Resist the urge to do the writing yourself.,
Provide fun opportunities for revision.",How to Improve Your Child's Creative Writing Skills4," The best way to improve writing skills, no matter the writer's age, is through regular practice. Your child might be getting a lot of good practice at school. However, if your child's school provides limited writing practice or if you're homeschooling your child, you may want to include additional formal writing lessons at home.Even having your child write very straightforward things (such as what he did at school that day or what kinds of snacks he wants to eat) can be excellent writing practice. It doesn't always have to be creative writing practice to be effective.


Recognize, however, that sometimes children will be reluctant to write. Let them take some time away from writing if they need to (unless they have to complete a school assignment)., A daily journal can be a terrific way for a young writer to expand her vocabulary, develop a unique writing style, and learn how to express complicated thoughts in words.This builds essential skills and gives children an important outlet for sharing their thoughts and feelings., Sometimes the best writing practice is freewriting when your child simply writes whatever comes into her mind. However, if your child is a bit older and wants to write a longer or more ambitious story, encourage your child to make a writing plan first. Make sure your child has a sense of what she will write about, what the point of her story is, and (if relevant) what the assignment entails.Does she have a plan for the beginning, middle, and end of the story?

, Perfectionism can be harmful to your child's creativity and self-confidence. Rather than fixing your child's errors and mistakes, have your child reread his own writing and ask him what he thinks about it. Let him locate his own errors and encourage him to fix things himself.Never take over and rewrite his story yourself.For example, you could underline the words he has misspelled without giving him the correct spelling. Ask him to look up the correct spelling in the dictionary.
Be sure that you provide your child with positive feedback as well as gentle suggestions for improvements.

, One of the most important skills your child will learn is how to revise first drafts into final drafts. Encourage your child to make changes to his story and to work hard at improving it. For example, you can ask him to use sticky notes to build off of the first draft of a story in order to add more details, clarify his language, and vary his sentence structures.Let your child know that practice and perseverance are essential to the writing process."

Select a suitable time of day.,
Select the particular days.,
Break down the reading.,
Read together.,
Read individually.,
Talk out loud when you are reading.,
Visit the library once a month for story telling.,
Praise your children.",How to Make Time for Reading to Children," The most suitable time of day is often bedtime but it might not be suitable for you. It is very important to take into account your own energy levels and availability throughout the day. If reading a goodnight story at 8pm has you yawning and trying hard to remain awake, perhaps a story before dinner, or a story in the afternoon will work out better. You need to direct this decision to make it fit in rather than miss it.;
, One good idea is to alternate days or to only read on certain days. For example, you might read weeknights only and not weekends. Or not read Friday and Saturday nights. Or read every second night. Provided that you set in place a regular and consistent reading routine, this will still work really well. It can help you to work around the ebb and flow of dealing with other children's activities, work-brought-home, night meetings for clubs, church, etc.

, Rather than trying to go through five chapters of a large book each night, cut it down to two chapters. Rather than read five storybooks, cut it down to two. When the alternative is nothing at all, less chapters or books will be much preferred by your child.

, When you have more than one child, make reading communal. Where an older child is able to read finds this ""unfair"" or ""annoying"", suggest that they do their reading time alone (and you can check the story's content later). Another way to engage more than one child is to read a story pitched at each age group and have each of them listen politely in turn. You will also find that ""family favorites"" develop over time that all the children will love hearing. And don't forget recounts of your own childhood!

, Even where you adopt the group reading, make at least one time a week per child to read individually. This is both a bonding exercise and a source of encouragement for your child.

, If you're reading a newspaper article or something online and you think it would interest your children, read it out loud to them. This can happen at any time and is a good indicator to children that reading is an everyday, useful activity.

, Make use of your local library's story telling facilities; take your children when these are happening. While they are listening to the story, you can be relaxing or borrowing some books for your own interest.

, When your children read anything - be it the label off a cereal packet or a book, be sure to praise their reading at every chance you get. Creating a reading culture in your family is an important way of helping children cope with their feelings and problems, as well as answering their curiosities, and developing their imagination.

Show her how to work within the lines.,

Have sensory fun.,
Make her writing instruments fun.,
Get her a book of mazes.,
Play with play-dough.,
Get coloring.,
Color the driveway.,
Focus on grip.,
Pay attention to posture.,
Turn the paper to the correct angle.,
Don't be afraid to talk to a doctor.",How to Improve a Child's Handwriting," Lines can help her get her proportion correct, which in turn makes her handwriting more readable. If she's having trouble with it, show her the best way to do it.Capital letters should go from the top line to the bottom line, and they should be twice the size of a lowercase letter.
Also, help her make sure her letters don't float or sink by always positioning the bottom of the letter (with the exception of tails) on the line.
One way to help her get this right is to highlight the bottom half of the space. Tell her the small letters need to stay within the color and that only capital letters can extend above it.;
, That is, letters should be made from the top down, for the most part. Also, your kid should work from left to right. Try watching how your kid writes. How she writes may surprise you. If you notice your kid making letters abnormally, take her hand and help her make the correct motion., Have your kid place her finger on the paper after the word. Tell her to start the next word on the other side of her finger. This process will help her space out her words properly, which can make her handwriting look better overall.If she's left-handed, try a popsicle stick instead.
You can also have her make a small dot after each word so she knows to leave a space.

, One way you can show her how handwriting should look is to have her trace handwriting. You can buy handwriting books for tracing, or you can simply write on a piece of paper. Make sure to make your handwriting as standard as possible if you are doing it yourself. Also, make sure to not write too small, as that will make it harder for your child.Have you child trace over the letters first with her pencil.
Next, have her write the letters again underneath the traced letters.

, Some letters are commonly confused or put backwards. For instance, the lowercase ""b"" and ""d"" are often confused. One way to help your child is to tell them to ""make their bed"" by making two thumbs up symbols and bumping them together, forming a ""bed."" The left side looks like a lowercase ""b"" and the right side looks like a lowercase ""d.""Another commonly confused pair is Ws and Ms. One trick you can use is to mix up a bunch of Ms and Ws on a page and have your child circle all the Ms or all the Ws.

, If your child has trouble remembering how letters are formed, you may need to go over them again with her. Making up little stories as you go along can help, such as ""T is a singe line that likes to wear a hat across the top.""One option for helping them to remember how to form letters is to make a box with landmarks. For instance, make a box with a star in the upper left hand corner. For an ""H,"" you could say, ""Start at the star, go all the way down the side to make a wall. Make a wall on the other side, then connect them across the middle.""

, One of the best ways to help a child is to get her to practice as much as she can. Try to sneak writing in throughout the day so your child is constantly practicing.For instance, have her take down a grocery list for you.
Another good way to practice is to have her write letters to friends or relatives.
Another way is to pass notes. That is, leave her notes, and in them, ask her to write back. It can be a fun little game you play together.
Alternatively, make a book together. Tape, staple, or glue a few pages together, and have her write a story.

, For instance, teach him how to play hangman, taking turns being the guesser and the writer. Alternatively, try simple word puzzles. For instance, try mixing up a word, and see if he can figure out what it is., Work on letters by using fun substances to write in. Doing things a little differently makes it more engaging, and it can help it stick better. Plus, it makes the whole process a lot more enjoyable for your child, who will see it as a game rather than work.For example, try putting shaving cream on the table, and have her write letters in it. You can also use sand or rice.
Another option is finger painting letters.

, That is, don't just give her a plain pencil. Let her use colored pencils or markers. Gel or glitter pens are also great options. Some people also swear by vibrating pens, saying that they can help solidify letter shapes in your child's mind.If her writing instruments are colorful or sparkly, your child will be more inclined to want to use them.
Crayons are also a good option.

, Mazes are a fun way to disguise handwriting work. That is, they work muscles that your child needs to have good handwriting by improving fine motor skills. They also help develop thinking skills., Another way to develop fine motor skills and muscles is to give your child play-dough to play with. Sit down with her, and come up with things for you and her to make together.You could also incorporate letter work by making letters with the play dough.
Another way to help letter recognition and reading skills is to say something like ""Make something that starts with the letter 'A'!""

, Just working with pens, markers, and pencils can help your child improve her fine motor skills. She's learning to grip and move the pen correctly, so it's a step in the right direction. Some people say working with broken crayons or triangle crayons can even help your child learn to grip better.Sit down and have a color session with your kid. You'll both have fun, and she'll be improving without even knowing it.
Alternatively, load up on new coloring books so your kid will be excited to draw.

, Take some chalk outside on a nice day. Spend some time coloring outside with your child. Sneak in some letter writing by each of you writing your name or by creating a fun message., Not having the correct grip can make writing worse. Make sure your child is griping his pencil or pen correctly. It should rest on the thumb, but it should be held in place by the index and middle fingers. Also, make sure he's not gripping it so hard that he's making his hand hurt., Posture can affect how well your child writes. For instance, if he's sprawled out on the floor, his writing probably won't be as good than when he's sitting at a table.Kids should sit up straight, with their back all the way to the back of the chair.
Feet should be flat on the floor with knees at a 90-degree angle. If his feet don't reach the floor, you can stack up telephone books underneath so he has something to rest on.

, You don't write on a piece of paper head on. You usually tilt it. Your child may not realize he needs to tilt his paper before he writes to accommodate the angle of his wrist. The angle can help improve his handwriting, as it makes it easier to form letters.Show him how to tilt the paper 45 degrees to the right if he's right handed.
If he's left handed, tilt it to the left 45 degrees.

, If you notice your child is having trouble with fine motor skills across the board, don't be afraid to discuss with his pediatrician. She can help you determine if there's an underlying cause or if your child may need to spend a little time with a physical therapist to catch up.

Create the right environment.,
Set a consistent homework time.,
Give them tools to stay organized.,
Find a tutor.,
Make studying fun.",How to Motivate Teenagers to Do Their Homework1," Designate a consistent location that homework will be done. This environment should be free from distractions, so their bedroom may not be the best choice. Make sure that all electronics are turned off or put on silent. Also, be sure that any family members, including younger siblings, give the teenager the quiet time that they need.Doing homework at the kitchen table or a desk in the office or living room will provide them with enough space to complete their work.;
, Children thrive when they have a routine. Pick a time each day that your teenager does homework. You might consider including your teenager in this decision. Estimate the amount of time that they need to complete their homework. Be sure to consider regularly scheduled activities like ball practice or church functions.For example, your teen has baseball practice immediately following school. He doesn’t get home until 5:00. Your family eats dinner at 6:00. So, the best time for him to complete his homework is at 7:00.

, If your teenager has trouble remembering everything that they need to do, make sure that they have the tools that they need to help them remember all of their tasks and assignments. Provide them with a planner, post-it notes, highlighters, or other organizational tools. These tools will also help them manage their time to ensure that they complete their tasks on time.

, Parents often help their children with their homework. However, as your child gets older you may find that they need help with a subject that surpasses your knowledge. If you feel uncomfortable or incapable of providing your teen with assistance on a particular subject, consider hiring a tutor. A tutor can provide your teen extra, one-on-one assistance in a subject to increase their knowledge and help them achieve a good grade. A tutor may also help your child comprehend a subject by teaching them a number of techniques that the teacher has not covered.Ask your child’s teacher for recommendations on a good tutor in your area.

, Get involved in helping your child study and complete their homework. Try to come up with new ways to make learning fun and enjoyable. Learning a variety of ways will often make a new concept “stick”For example, if your teenager is having a hard time understanding geometry but understands basketball, consider taking a geometry lesson to the basketball court. Help your teenager understand different triangles by using your bodies and the basketball hoop to represent the different corners of a triangle. What happens to the triangle if one of you step further away from the basketball hoop?
Watch an interesting historical movie or documentary about a topic that your child is learning in history class.

"
"
Make a presence at their school.,
Collaborate with your teen.,
Provide reminders.",How to Motivate Teenagers to Do Their Homework2," Introduce yourself to your teenager’s teachers and school administration. Make it clear that they can get in touch with you if they have any questions or concerns involving your child’s education. Volunteer at the school or make an appearance at school functions. Your teenager might be more motivated to stay on top of their schoolwork if they know that you are active in their school community.Schedule a parent/teacher conference.

, Instead of fighting and creating a tense environment regarding school work and performance, consider working with them to develop a plan. Offer your advice and allow them the space to develop a work plan that works for them. Instead of arguing about the results, provide constructive criticism to see if they can solve the problem themselves. This will make the teen feel more grown up and respected.For example, your teenager just received their midterm grade in math and they have a D. They have three weeks to bring their grade up before their next report card. Have a conversation with your teen by asking them what they need to do to bring their grade up. If they say that they need to study more, suggest that they bring home their math book each day and spend at least 30 minutes studying what they went over in class that day.

, Teenagers often need prompted or reminded to do something, especially things that they don’t want to do. Try to remember that you are the adult and they are still a child. Teenagers do not need to be prompted as regularly as an elementary student, but they do still need reminded to stay on track from time to time.


Consider using technology to set reminders for your teenager. Set calendar reminders on your phone and sync it to their phone. There are also several family management apps that may help.

"
"
Help your teen set goals.,
Give them incentives.,
Help your teenager see the bigger picture.,
Offer them encouragement.",How to Motivate Teenagers to Do Their Homework3," Long and short term goal setting are important skills to learn in order to achieve success in school and in your career. Help your teen to set daily, weekly, and semesterly goals to keep them on track with their school work.For example, a short term academic goal may be to raise their history grade from a C to an A this grading period. A long term goal may be to get straight A’s by the end of the semester.
Have the teenager write them down and evaluate progress as the semester continues.

, Teenagers are often motivated by incentives. Brainstorm some possible daily, monthly, or semesterly incentives to help them stay on track with their schoolwork.Pay them for their report cards. Pay a set dollar amount per A on your teenager’s report card.
Offer them a weekly allowance for staying on track with their schoolwork. Treat their schoolwork as a real job. If they do their job, they get paid.
Consider extending their weekend curfew as a reward for improved grades on their report card.

, It is hard for teenagers to understand why they need to learn all of the things that they learn in high school. Many of them can not understand how algebra will help them once they graduate from high school or college. Your job is to make the connections between the school work that they do today and their success in the future.Be prepared to answer questions like, “Why do I need to learn algebra? I don’t want to be a math teacher and no one else uses algebra every day.” Give them clear examples of the algebra that you use every day, like when you balance a checkbook or pay your bills.

, Praising your teenager’s work and improvements is a natural response as a parent. However, offering them encouragement instead of praise can often motivate them to continue to do a great job. Offer them encouragement on things that went well and things that need improved upon.Instead of saying, “Great job on your science fair project!” say something like, “Look at that science project! I can tell that you spent a lot of time making it look so great. Doesn’t it feel good to get such a good grade?”

Don't wait for your child to ask for help.,
Familiarize yourself with the topics being covered.,
Don't give your child the answers.,
When your child is finished, check the work over.,
The next day, help your child again.,
Continue helping your child until he or she gets it right every time and is confident.

",How to Help Kids with Homework in Secondary School," Middle schoolers often see themselves as independent and because of that don't ask for help. If you see your child struggling, go and help.;
, Especially as your child goes into the more advanced math or a class you never took, make sure you know the topic well enough that you can explain it.

, Instead, walk him or her through the problem or offer suggestions to find information.


When you walk you child through a problem, ask questions such as ""what comes next?"" or ""what does that equal?"". Never give away an answer, no matter how much your child begs.
If your child doesn't know an answer, give suggestions to look it up, like a textbook or trusted websites.

, Even if the teacher doesn't collect the homework and check it, it is still a good idea since homework is for practice and you want to make sure the kid is doing it right.

, Make sure he or she is doing it right. If not, repeat the same procedure you used yesterday.

Read the instructions given by the teacher.,
Ask your child to explain the assignment to you.,
Look at sample problems or writings together.,
Focus on the quality of the effort made.,
Suggest a short break when they get stuck.,
Don’t keep trying to re-teach difficult concepts the same way.,
Go over the assignment or problem with them at the end.",How to Help Your Child With Homework1," In order to make sure you are helping effectively, you need to familiarize yourself with the assignment. Read the instructions carefully. If you need further explanation, reading the corresponding lesson in the textbook will be helpful too.


Make sure to read the material given to your child, not look up explanations on the internet first. You may end up finding a different method or explanation than the teacher is using, and this can cause unnecessary confusion for your child.;
, After reading the instructions yourself, ask your child to explain them to you in their own words. This will help ensure that your child knows what they are being asked to do and what is expected of them by the teacher.


Ask questions to clarify instructions if you think it is necessary. Their answers will help you decide how much help they need.
If they do not clearly understand, go over the lesson in the textbook with them. Ask them to read a section and then explain it in their own words.

, If their book offers some sample questions or essays, read over them with your child and make sure they understand both how the instructor got to the answer given and/or why the answer or sample essay is complete.

, When going over a problem or assignment with your child, praise them for things they did well, especially if it indicates an improvement over past assignments.


For writing assignments, you might say “Good job with indenting paragraphs,” or “This is a great start. What do you think happens next?”Do not get angry if they continue having trouble with a problem or assignment. Punishing them for not understanding will likely cause them to stop asking for help.
Do not give away answers, but explain how to find them. Ask the teacher if you need assistance, or find a reputable tutor.

, If they are having trouble with a task, a break may help them refocus. Take 10 minutes to do something fun or active before trying to re-approach the issue or problem.

, If they are having trouble getting a particular idea down, repeating yourself isn’t going to help. Automatically showing them a different method of doing it might be confusing if the teacher has been teaching them with another method.If the problem relates to your child’s learning style, you can try to reframe the information from a different perspective, but make sure the teacher knows you did so and specifically why your child had trouble with the assignment as given.
For older elementary or middle school students, allow them to ask their teacher for help instead of doing it for them. The more agency kids have in their learning, the more they actually learn., Don’t just check their answers and say to do the problem again. Go over each issue/problem individually with them if the assignment is particularly hard. If your child is just having trouble with one or two questions, focus on those, and refer to others they did well as examples.Only go over in detail those assignments or problems your child has particular trouble with. Don’t read over every assignment they get for the rest of the year, or they will not learn as much and/or will become too dependent on you.

Discuss why homework is important.,
Be a good example.,
Find a tutor for subjects you aren’t well versed in.,
Set goals together early in the year.,
Create a regular study schedule.,
Go over good study habits.,
Set up an effective workspace.",How to Help Your Child With Homework2," Make sure they know the purpose of homework and what they should be gaining by doing it. If they don’t understand the reasons behind doing it, it might just seem like busywork or a chore they have to drudge through.Ask them first why they think its important to direct your conversation accordingly.


Homework provides a chance to review and practice concepts or skills they learned in class.
Practicing offers a chance to see where more explanation might be needed before the next class.
It teaches necessary study skills and self-discipline for succeeding as schoolwork becomes more involved and specialized as teens, like time management and independence.
It gives them the chance to explore a subject or idea more fully than was possible in the classroom.
It teaches them how to process and use information in general, which will help in every aspect of life as they get older.
Children who do more homework, in general, score better on standardized tests through secondary school., Teach your child good study habits by doing them yourself. While they do homework, consider doing something academic too. Read a book or newspaper, start learning a new language or skill, balance your checkbook or go over and return your emails.Get a language program like Rosetta Stone, or download a free phone app, and work on lessons while your child does homework. Since you have to speak during lessons, sit in a nearby room or open room while they work at their desk in the bedroom or office. Show them your progress to encourage them to study hard throughout the year.
Going over your expenses or checkbook demonstrates why learning math is important. Instead of using a calculator, let younger kids see you do the work by hand like they do.
If your child needs to visit the library, pick out some books on a topic about which you want to learn. Don’t always choose the same subject, but learn something new to show your child that it’s important to expand your knowledge., An online tutoring site might be enough help, but your child may need one-on-one assistance. A knowledgeable tutor may be able to identify where they are having difficulty and approach the subject in a new way. They also will be less emotionally involved than you are.

, It’s better to set goals before workload starts increasing and problems arise. Children best meet their goals when they help make them, so ask what they hope to achieve this year. Set 2-3 goals for the year or semester, and write them down in a prominent place to refer to monthly.Ask what, if any, problems or stumbling blocks they had the previous year or semester. Did they start homework too late in the evening to finish before bedtime? Did they have trouble concentrating in the location where they tried to work?
Where do they see areas for improvement? Are there certain subjects that they need to spend more time on each day? Is there another time or area where they might be able to study better?
If they didn’t enjoy a certain task, like reading, discuss ways to make it more fun. Maybe you could set up a special reading nook under a small tent in a corner, or designate a comfortable chair for reading and let your child decorate the space around it.

, Pick a time during the week when they will do their homework every night. Give them Friday evenings off, if they want to celebrate the end of the week, but include time during the weekend for regular study, too. Get a calendar for them to write down study time and any due dates, if applicable, for larger projects.If the teacher provided a syllabus, add test dates to the calendar, and schedule practice tests or extra study time ahead of them.
Give your child a 30 minute break right after school for a snack and down-time, but no screens!Make a rule together that they can spend this time doing certain things—playing a quick game of basketball, walking the dog, having a brief dance party—or something else active that won’t grab their attention too much to get to work afterwards.
Make sure to account for after-school activities or sports on the weekends. Some days they might need to do homework at a different time to adjust for other activities.Try different times for studying at the beginning of the year, before homework gets heavy, to evaluate together when your child works best. Maybe they concentrate better after dinner than before. Perhaps they find it more helpful to do homework after their 30 minute break, while lessons from the school day are still fresh on their mind.

, What kinds of assignments take longer or need to be prepared for? When should they start projects and papers, and what advantages are there to finishing these early. Are there study tools your child might want to try out: flashcards, practice tests, study games, etc.?Help your child learn to organize their time efficiently early in their school career so they will be able to do it on their own by high school.
It’s best to learn study tips early in elementary school, instead of waiting until homework becomes unmanageable simply because they haven’t developed a way to break up larger tasks.

, Younger kids might work best at the dinner table while you are working nearby. Older kids may need to be in a separate room at a desk. Wherever it is, make sure they have all the materials needed to work (pencils, erasers, a sharpener, pens, paper, books, a dictionary, etc) and eliminate distractions. Ensure there is good lighting and a comfortable (but not too comfortable) seat.


Turn the TV off or don’t include one in the room where they will be working.
Let them listen to background music if it helps them concentrate, but make sure it isn’t distracting. Instrumental music is best.
Have a computer if they need one, but set up filters to make sure they don’t get caught up in internet. Ask the teacher if they post assignments or examples on their own website or a school-run blackboard. Sometimes, students can send questions via the web to teachers as they are working.Keep loud siblings away. For older kids, if there is not a place in the house where they can be alone, the library may be a better study spot."
"
Be a homework monitor, not a teacher’s substitute.,
Find out their teacher’s expectations early.,
Allow the teacher a chance to give extra help.,
Stay in touch with the teacher throughout the year.",How to Help Your Child With Homework3," It’s good to check for complete work at the beginning of the year or if your child is having problems turning in assignments, but it’s not good to “check” their work in detail. Kids do better on standardized tests when parents don’t go over their homework every time. Also, their teacher won’t be able to evaluate how well they are learning.


Check the first couple answers on an assignment to make sure your child understood it, but don’t look over the whole assignment for accuracy.Ask if they were able to complete everything or if they have any questions about the assignment you might clarify. If they completed a math assignment and just had trouble with one problem, you might be able to identify any missteps. If they couldn’t do any of them, you and the teacher may need to find another method of teaching them the necessary skills.
If you had to give your child a lot of help on an assignment, make sure the teacher knows. Write “completed with parental help” on the assignment or send an email that evening., How long should assignments take? How do they want you to be involved? Develop a positive relationship with their teacher(s) at the beginning of the year, before any problems come up, so you can work together throughout the year to best help your child.Generally, in K-2, homework should ideally take 10-20 minutes a day (independent of reading practice); for 2-6, 30-60 minutes a night is average; from 7th grade on, the amount should depend on specific assignments and may vary from day to day.Find out if the teacher has open hours for extra help every week.
Make sure you know what materials you need to provide your child. Typically, elementary school kids get a list of supplies on the first day, or even earlier. If not, ask the teacher what your child should bring to class everyday.
Find out their homework and attendance policies. What happens if a student fails to turn in an assignment? How do you arrange to make up a test if your child has to be absent?

, If they have after school hours set-up, make your child attends them and brings specific questions or assignments. If the teacher has a website or forum, help your child compose an email or message with their questions. Don’t speak for them, but assist in figuring out what to ask if needed.


It is important for students to take responsibility for their own learning. If you aren’t sure they will ask for help, send the teacher a message letting them know your child will be approaching them for extra help at the next class, but give your child the responsibility of doing so on their own.
Ask the teacher for advice on other resources your child can use at home—study websites, reference books, a good tutoring app, etc., Attend parent-teacher conferences. Check in on your child’s progress every month or quarter. If you question the value of an assignment or think the teacher might be assigning too much homework, speak up. Teachers may not realize how long an assignment will take.Always come to a parent-teacher meeting with a cooperate spirit and leave with a solution or plan to address the issue.If the teacher is not budging--the workload seems way too high, they don’t understand the problem, they won’t take responsibility for helping your child learn--make an appointment with the school’s principal to discuss it.

Find out whether packaging is included in the postage costs.",How to Ship Packages and Never Pay for Packaging Materials1," Before buying the packaging, check out what the post carrier offers by way of free packaging. For example:


Some parcel post options provide a pre-paid bag or box that covers everything. Simply pass the cost on to the consumer.
In the USA, priority mail might include free shipping boxes; ask first, as this tends to depend on box size.;
"
"
Visit your local supermarket.,
Check out recycling bins and centers.,
Leave ""Wanted"" messages for boxes on Freecycle and similar sites.,
Keep all boxes you receive.",How to Ship Packages and Never Pay for Packaging Materials2," If they don't have a box area, ask them to set aside boxes for you regularly. Always be prompt about picking them up so that they're not having to keep piles of boxes in the way.
, Always be careful about taking boxes out of bins though, as bin lids can be heavy and some jurisdictions may prevent this by law. If you visit a local recycling center, they might be happy to help out with boxes that come their way.

, After people move, they often have many spare boxes. Large moving boxes can be cut down to smaller sizes and reused in many ways as packaging.

, As long as you have storage space, keep all the boxes you bring your groceries, appliances, shoes and other purchases in. This will give you a ready supply of free boxes.


Ask neighbors, family and friends to supply you with their unwanted boxes too.

"
Keep a store of packaging and stuffing items gleaned from all sorts of places.,
Find free tape.",How to Ship Packages and Never Pay for Packaging Materials3," Again, keep anything you bring home that can be repurposed as packaging. Remember that paper based items are made of wood and weigh more than packing peanuts, bubble wrap or Styrofoam. Free packaging possibilities include:


Newspaper (great for stuffing and wrapping) - either reuse your read papers or pick up free newspaper from junk mail, free distribution, etc.
Styrofoam (great for protecting fragile objects) - collect from furniture and appliance stores, from purchases of appliances, from Freecycle requests, etc.
Old clothes cut into rags.
Bubble wrap collected from things sent to you (start keeping it, if you buy things by mail, you will start amassing it).
Scrap paper - check the recycling bin in your own home, use up old printer paper, wrapping paper, etc.
Cereal boxes - these are great for protecting wrapping. Simply break down after the cereal is finish and keep flat in piles awaiting reuse.
Envelopes - repurpose junk mail envelopes.

, This is a bit harder but if you wrap inside the post office, some will provide you with the tape. However, this is likely to be fairly inconvenient and other shoppers might find it so too. You will find very cheap tape options at dollar stores or through bulk online purchases.


Use the main shipping centers, not small post offices when using their tape.
Ask friends and family to donate unwanted tape to you. This can be helpful if they're hoarders!

Understand the benefits of homework.,
Make peace with the reality that most kids don't like doing homework.,
Be a facilitator rather than a force to be reckoned with.,
Discuss homework with your kids in a direct and enabling manner.,
Use praise to achieve intrinsic motivation.,
Shift the responsibility from you to your child.,
Let the kids deal with the consequences of not doing their homework.,
Remove your knee-jerk reaction of needing to do your kid's homework.,
Be engaged, not nosy.,
Consider doing your homework at the same time as your younger kid.,
Find out what motivates your kid.,
Find a new name for homework.,
Turn the homework into a game.",How to Get Your Kids to Do Their Homework," If you're not convinced that homework matters, it will be even harder to convince your kids. There are some good reasons behind a moderate amount of homework:


Homework reinforces learning taught during the day. Some learning won't stick as well unless kids give it more practice and the classroom environment isn't necessarily going to provide adequate time for more practice. This is of special importance for math and critical thinking skills.Sometimes homework teaches additional skills not taught at school due to lack of time or resources. This is a ""broadening"" learning effect of homework.Homework instills self-discipline, teaching time management, organizational skills, concentration skills, and self-responsibility.Self-discipline is a key life skill that can only be learned in the doing.;
, When there are many other infinitely more interesting things happening, especially in our electronic gadget age, it's hard to make homework appealing, so stop trying. As a parent, guardian, or other person responsible for getting kids to do homework, acceptance isn't about agreement with them. It's about understanding and infusing the rest of your approach with that understanding, while remaining prepared to set the boundaries and stand by your expectations that they will do it.

, You can cajole, plead, yell, threaten, bribe, and jump up and down with your face turning blue but none of this negative and mutually exhausting behavior will make your kids do anything. Sure, they'll respond to immediate threats of withdrawing privileges and you standing over them until it's done, but this will not turn into reformed homework behavior, and who has time to stand over them instead of getting other tasks done? Instead, aim to facilitate the homework process as much as possible:


Provide a distinct, comfortable, well-lit, quiet, and non-distracting place for the homework to be completed.Somewhere away from electronic items, pedestrian traffic, and other kids playing is ideal.
Ensure that your child has everything needed to do homework, from pens and paper, to a laptop and books, calculator or phone with a calculator and be sure to get special project materials in advance, to avoid the excuse of ""I don't have what I need"".Take a moment to sit down with them when they start homework to see what else they might need, including bookmarking quality kids' information websites they can use as part of their homework research tools, such as the US Kids.gov site,and an online dictionary.
Invite or encourage your child to keep you informed about homework progress and any interesting facts that arise out of it.

, At the beginning of each term or semester, sit down and talk about how your kid intends to handle homework in the coming months. In this way, you set mutually shared ground rules for getting homework done, ground rules that you can call on to remind them when they're slipping, or to praise them for when they're meeting them.



Empower your kids. Rather than setting the time for homework, have a family meeting to discuss possible times. Let the kids feel they’re somewhat in charge by giving them the choice of when to do their homework—before dinner, after dinner, or half before and half after. The only rider on this is to refuse to allow homework to be left until just before bedtime – set an agreed cut-off point by which time homework must be completed; this can be sweetened by making allowance for fun reading time, or other enjoyable wind-down activity prior to bedtime. And you can help by keeping the evening mealtime as regular as possible.
Find out if there are specific areas of homework they're having difficulties with. Ask them if they would like to consider having more hands-on help with those issues (you, a sibling, or a tutor, for example). Sometimes homework isn't working because they're struggling with it in class, as well as, out of class.
Help your child figure out what is hard homework and what is easy homework. Having your child do the hard work first will mean he is most alert when facing the biggest challenges. The easier material will seem to go faster once fatigue begins to set in.
Agree on homework free times, such as parts of the weekend, or Friday nights, etc., and allow them to plan how they use this free time.

, Praising work done well and ignoring or downplaying poor performance is an approach that will enthuse your kid a lot more than focusing on the negatives, and it helps to remove the tension for you, along with any inclination to tear your hair out.


Be careful when using rewards to spur homework completion. The aim is to rely principally on intrinsic motivators (fostering satisfaction at a job completed) rather than material rewards. Bribing is the ultimate demotivating strategy because any kid who associates completing homework with a new DS game or an allowance increase learns to do the activity for material gain rather than internal gratification, or for greater understanding. Occasional rewards for a special project done really well can be a great boost but regular material rewards are best avoided.
Reward homework with exciting games and/or toys completed with praise, including informing your kid that you are really proud of her for being organized/timely/proactive, etc. It is important to define the exact reason why you are proud of your kid, so that she knows what to keep up. The idea is to ""catch them doing something good"" and keep noticing the good.Ignore poor behavior. When your kids don't achieve what they need to, avoid a yelling match. Keep your message simple, reminding your kids what you have agreed upon together when discussing how they'd approach homework and expressing both disappointment and a hope to see things return to normal the next day.
Keep real rewards simple, such as a walk to the park, a pizza dinner, spending time playing a game with your kid that you usually find too hard for you, going to the zoo, etc. This way you remain involved, your child links good performance with spending more fun time with you, and having fun as a family.

, This may feel really hard for you, especially in a time when parents feel a sense of self-responsibility about homework, but it's absolutely vital that your child learns as early as possible that the consequences for not completing homework rest on them, not on you. Don't carry the weight of your child's unwillingness to complete homework on your shoulders; provided you are giving them a supportive and caring structured environment, and you've defined daily homework times, homework not completed is your child's lesson in learning about self-responsibility.After a few times of learning first hand the consequences of not completing homework, your child will soon start to see that he or she has responsibility in this matter. This is not the same as not caring at all. It is about taking a conscious approach to letting your kids learn to be responsible.

, Teachers are usually not very happy with students if they don't do homework. If your child flat-out refuses to do their work, then let them see what their teacher does the next day. They probably will do their homework after that!


Naturally, if you have a child with learning or other disabilities, you may need to vary this more hands-off approach. However, don't be afraid to seek support from professional people skilled in your child's particular disability; getting help is important when you don't know what else to do.

, If homework is meant to be done by your child alone, stay away. Too much parent involvement can prevent homework from having some positive effects. Homework is a great way for kids to develop independent, lifelong learning skills., Nobody appreciates the nosy, stand-over person, and kids are no different. Try to make your approach to their homework one of engaged curiosity, not of nosiness or trying to cross off every discrete task as it's done.


Avoid asking your kid for precise details of homework the moment he or she walks through the door. Allow for chill time first.
Avoid probing deeper than you need to. If your kid says ""I've got math homework"", ask ""What sort of math?"", not ""How many pages and exactly what sort of equations? I want to see it when you're done, mister.""
Avoid demanding that you keep track of homework. Place that expectation back on your kid or you'll suffer the consequences of having to keep constant checks on everything, be at the receiving end of your kid's irritation, and end up realizing that all you've really taught your kid is that you'll manage her affairs rather than the other way around.

, When you are inspiring younger kids to get involved in homework, one neat trick is to do some homework of your own, to show your child that you're being responsible and completing essential chores too. Show your child that the skills they are learning are related to things you do as an adult. If your child is reading, you read too. If your child is doing math, balance your checkbook., A recent study has shown that middle school aged kids who have an ambition that requires education before a career are more likely to knuckle down and do their homework than kids who lack ambition or who seek to work in an area that doesn't require a university education.If your child is motivated to enter a career requiring college education, you can use this knowledge to encourage your child to view homework as an investment.
Even where this is not apparent, it doesn't hurt to talk to your children about the importance of ensuring that all opportunities are left open and that homework enables this. Of course, this type of reasoning is best reserved for middle school and up.

, Every kid's ears prick up at the mention of ""work"". It's bad enough asking them to clean their room or to clear the latest art and craft disaster off the floor without having to insist also that they do homework. A little trick is to sidestep this in your household, and no matter what school is referring to it as, calling it something like ""home learning"", ""brain boosting"", or even just plain old ""study"". Always talk about it in terms that suggest it's about learning and growing, not about work.


Be positive about homework. Use positive language for it and subtly talk about how learning will help your child in the future. For example, tell your would-be actress daughter that she won’t be able to memorize her lines if she’s not a stellar reader. The attitude you express about homework will be the attitude your child acquires.

, Usually kids don't do homework because it's boring. Why not turn it into fun?


Put math problems in terms of sweets, or money. When it's about sweets, tell them they will win the answer's number of sweets and that he can eat a part of them when the next correct problem set is done correctly. Or play for pennies, monopoly money (you can make your own with blank index cards), or points that can be redeemed for treats, such as a visit to the pool or park.
You can also turn difficult words into weird funny ones. Or, make collectible cards, like baseball cards, only for vocabulary or spelling words.

Market your business.",How to Start a Drop Shipping Business," There are hundreds or more drop shipping businesses and it can be difficult to compete on price alone. Accordingly, you need to find a niche and decide what sets you apart from the competition.


Find a niche where you can add value. For example, you can sell electronics equipment and run a blog that shows people how to put the equipment together.Or you could sell pet supplies and accessories on a website where you blog about the topic.
Plan on selling products that are hard to purchase locally but instead are bought online.Your products shouldn’t be too cheap. Ideally, a good niche is one where the products cost $100-200. This price point allows you to make a solid profit from each sale without having to provide a lot of customer support. When you charge more, customers usually want to talk to a person before buying.;
, After choosing your niche, find suppliers who are willing to drop ship. There is no one place to look to find suppliers. Instead, try the following:


Search online for “wholesaler” and then the product you want to sell. Because wholesalers don’t invest much in online advertisement, you might have to dig through 20 or more pages to find results. If you can’t find anything, then swap out “wholesaler” for other terms like “distributor,” “bulk,” “reseller,” and “supplier.”You can also look through your Yellow Pages under Suppliers or Wholesalers to see if there are any in your area.If you know the manufacturer of the product, then you can contact the manufacturer directly and ask for a list of distributors.

, One good way to find a reliable supplier is to locate your competitors and then find out who they use. You can find other drop shipping sellers by searching the Internet. If the business has only one location listed on its “Contact Us” page, then it is probably a drop shipping business.They may even highlight their bestselling brands. Chances are these are reliable suppliers you also can contact.
If they don’t highlight any brands, then scroll through the products that they offer. Write down the names of any brands that offer products you want to sell.

, After identifying possible suppliers, reach out to them and ask if they handle drop shipping. Not every supplier is willing. Suppliers might be hard to reach, so plan on sending emails and making regular phone calls until you reach the right person.When you do, ask the following questions:How long does it take them to ship after you’ve placed an order with them?
What shipping methods do they offer? For example, ask if they ship overnight or internationally.
Do they offer warranties on their products? If a product is defective, then you want them to replace it.
What quality control systems do they use?
Do they set minimum advertised prices? Ideally, they will. If not, then other drop shipping businesses could lower the prices too low for you to compete.
Do they charge a monthly or annual fee? If so, then you might want to avoid them.
Can you put their product photo on your website? Preferably, they will allow you to use their picture.

, Once you’ve found a supplier, you should go through their product pages and see what items you want to sell. Ideally, you will want to sell products that are in high demand. You can use a couple of different techniques to gauge a product’s popularity:


Perform market research. You can find out the demand for the product by using Google’s Keyword Tool. This tool provides data on the number of people who have searched for a term.For example, if you want to sell cat sweaters, then check how many people have searched for that term.
Look at the completed listings on eBay. Go to “advanced search” and check the “completed listings” box. Then enter keywords and category. As you scroll through the pages of listings, check items that sell 60% or more. These items are usually popular., You should call or go online to set up your account. Some suppliers will require that you complete an application. They may also request a copy of your reseller’s certificate, business license, or other document.In that situation, you should form your business first.


Also discuss payment methods. You can pay upfront or pay on terms. When you pay upfront, you pay at the same time as you place your order. With pay on terms, you pay all of your orders at a later date, such as at the end of the month.
Because you are just starting out, suppliers might only agree to work with you if you pay upfront. After you establish your reliability, they might be willing to change their billing.

, Every business has a certain legal structure, and you must get your government’s permission to create some of them. In the United States, you will register with the state where you are located. Each structure has advantages and disadvantages, which you should discuss with a lawyer or accountant:



Sole proprietorship. This business is run by one person and is easy to set up. Most drop shipping business are probably sole proprietorships. You don’t need to file paperwork with your state to form a sole proprietorship. Instead, you can use your Social Security Number as your business ID and report business income on your 1040 form. You are personally liable for all of your business’s debts.This means that if your business is sued, you might lose personal assets like your car or home.

Limited liability company. You can form an LLC by filing Articles of Organization with your state’s Secretary of State. An LLC is a separate legal entity and shields its owners from personal liability for business debts.Corporation. You form a corporation by filing Articles of Incorporation with your state. Like an LLC, a corporation shields its owners (called shareholders) from personal liability for business debts. Corporations pay their own taxes.However, if you form an S corporation, then the business’s profits and losses pass through to the shareholders.

, To find what you need, visit the Small Business Administration website at https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/business-licenses-permits/state-licenses-permits and click on your state.


Don’t forget to get a reseller’s certificate. Suppliers will usually want to see that you have either a state sales tax ID or a resale certificate.This certificate exempts you from paying sales tax when you buy items from your supplier.
Not every state requires a reseller’s certificate, but most do.It can go by different names, such as certificate of resale, reseller’s permit or license, or resale license.
If your state doesn’t require the certificate, then tell the wholesaler. They could have paperwork you need to fill out.

, You need to pay taxes to the federal government, so you need a tax identification number (also called an employer identification number). You can apply for one here: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online.


If you run a sole proprietorship, then you can use your Social Security Number instead.

, You have two options. You can create your own eCommerce site, or you can sell on an existing online marketplace, such as eBay, Amazon.com, or Bonanza.com.Selling on an existing marketplace will require less work, but you might get lost in the crowd of sellers.


You can create your own eCommerce store using websites such as SaleHoo. Alternately, you could purchase a domain name and create your own website.
If you choose to sell on an online marketplace, then diversify and list on several. Not everyone buys on eBay.

, Marketplaces like eBay and Amazon will process payments for you. However, if you create your own eCommerce site, then you will need a merchant account and a payment gateway account so that your clients can pay with credit cards.Several companies offer both as a bundle. Contact CyberSource, Verisign, or Authorize.net.
PayPal might be the easiest way to process payments. Go with PayPal and avoid getting merchant and payment gateway accounts altogether. Instead, you can add their Shopping Cart feature to your website for free. Your clients can then pay with credit cards or their PayPal account.

, You’ll look more legitimate as a business if you have a toll-free number customers can call to lodge complaints or ask questions. You can buy an 800 number from many different providers. Look online. Some providers even allow you to link the number to your cell phone.If you don’t want to use your home address as your business address, then get a mailbox at a post office or at a UPS store.

, Pricing right is important. You don’t want to price too high and lose customers to competitors. However, if you price too low, then you won’t make much of a profit. Always factor in how much you must pay your supplier when setting your sale price. Remember that your supplier also charges for shipping.Also remember to clearly tell your customers about your shipping and return policies in your listing.Customers need to know that information upfront.
Online platforms, such as eBay, will require you to identify where the product is located. For example, if your supplier is in Mexico, then include this information in your listing., As a drop shipper, you wait for a customer to order from you. Then you turn around and order from your supplier. Make sure not to delay, since your delay will only cause a delay for your customer.


Pay the supplier using a rewards credit card. In this way, you will reap all of the points for the purchase.If you receive a tracking number, then hold onto it and track the product so that you know when it has arrived.

, You should stay in contact with the customer after they purchase a product. Send a follow-up email telling them when the product has shipped. Also provide your contact information so that they can contact you if a problem arises., All kinds of problems can arise in the drop shipping business. For example, a supplier might not be trustworthy and will mail something too late. Or the supplier doesn’t package the product securely and it breaks on the way to your customer.


You can protect yourself by having multiple suppliers for most of your products. This way, you’ll have a fallback option if your primary supplier can’t deliver.
When a product is sold out, you can give the customer an upgraded product for free instead of cancelling the order outright.Remember to stay in contact with your suppliers. You want a good working relationship with them so they will help remedy problems.

, There are many ways you can reach potential customers, even if you are selling on an auction site like eBay. You should try several marketing techniques and find out what works best.


You can create a mailing list customers can sign up for. Put a link in your email confirmation after the sale, and tell them to sign up to receive special email offers. You can use MailChimp to build and keep track of your mailing list.You can also run Google or Facebook ads, though these can be expensive.
Another way to increase your visibility is to run a blog or to guest blog. Look for blogs in your niche, and include a link to your website or your email address.

Provide positive feedback for your child's progress whenever you are able to.,
Look for places you can help them feel successful, praising good efforts and playing down negative aspects of their work, while realising you may have to nudge them to work harder to make up for poor efforts.

,
Organize a reasonable schedule for homework.,
Have your child begin their homework, if they are mature enough to work independently, let them.,
Check their progress frequently until you have established that they are performing sufficiently and accurately enough to complete their work successfully.

,
Be sure your child understands that you are willing to help with subjects/assignments they are not succeeding in.,
Provide a good workplace for their homework regimen.,
Provide resources including books, references, internet if needed (help your child remain on track, could get lost if left alone), pencils, paper, and tools like a calculator, compass, or rule to make their work possible.

,
Offer snacks and breaks for a reward for successful completion of a section or subject they are working on.,
Check their work when needed to make sure their answers are correct, or that projects, etc, will be done correctly.

",How to Encourage a Child to Do His Homework," If your child didn't complete a task, but gave it a reasonable effort, tell them you don't feel like they failed, and recognise their efforts.;
,, Children should have time after school for healthy and enjoyable activities, but to succeed in school, homework cannot be ignored.


When your child gets home from school, let them have a little break. They have probably been in school at a desk most of the day.
If time allows, go over their homework while they take a break so you can estimate how much free time to allow them.
Once you have estimated how much time they should require on each subject, create a schedule for homework and give it to the child.

, It is much better for a child to do their work independently than to hover over them and micromanage their work.

,, Nothing can be more discouraging for a child than to spend significant time on a subject without seeing results. They should know they can turn to you for help if they need it.

, Good lighting, a clean, neat work area, and little or no distraction will improve their concentration.

,, For long, arduous sections of work, allow them a break at regular intervals.

Assess students' spelling knowledge.,
Teach in small groups.,
Prioritize spelling instruction.,
Teach word knowledge, not just spelling.,
Demonstrate usefulness of spelling.,
Integrate strategies for independent spelling.,
Encourage all writing, regardless of spelling.,
Expose students to written words.",How to Help First Graders With Spelling Words1," The best teaching practice starts with learning what the student already knows. Take a moment to check the students' knowledge of spelling by asking them to spell a list of common first grade words. Assessment allows you to start teaching at the area of your students' competence.Words found at the first grade level are short, 1-4 letters long. They are 1 syllable words. Examples of first grade words are: a, to, at, boy, bad, dip, cat, nest, sand, play.Assessment continues by analyzing students' independent writing. Provide opportunities for your students to write, whether in art projects or academic activities.
Continue assessing throughout the school year. Ongoing assessment is vital for effective teaching practice.;
, Most teachers are aware of the disparity between their students' abilities and know that small group instruction is preferred when possible. In helping first graders with spelling, it's essential to teach in small groups. Group assignments should be based on what you've discovered through your spelling assessments, so that students of similar spelling abilities can be taught at the same time.Be aware that some students' reading and their spelling abilities may be quite different. Don't base spelling assessments on students' ability to read.
Have other students engage in word-related activities at their seats, or participate in literacy activities in the classroom's centers, will help you manage the other students while working with small groups.
Having an assistant or a classroom volunteer can be helpful to managing the small groups of students.

, You'll need to find the time to assess and teach spelling to your first graders. This can be difficult to manage, because it requires individualization to the child's learning ability. Plan ahead to include spelling instruction every day, multiple times per day.Consider creating inclusion of spelling words in different areas of study.
Invest a little time every day in independent word work and individual or small group instruction.

, Teaching sight words, words that the student is likely to encounter often, helps the first grader with spelling. Post familiar words around the classroom. Teach students to consider why the word is spelled as it is. Teach the rules behind the spelling.For example, teach the reason for the silent e, and how it affects the sound of the word. Adding an e to a simple 3-letter word usually makes the vowel long, rather than short.
Teach sight words that don't usually fit the standard first-grade curriculum, if you find the students' using these words frequently. Post these words around your classroom, and refer to them when they naturally arise in other teaching. These sight words might include: because, are, again, said, friend, were.

, Students will be more motivated to learn to spell if they understand its importance. A first-grader must be taught the connection between reading words and proper spelling. By teaching students to recognize the power spelling has over understanding, you'll help them transfer their spelling knowledge into other activities of their life.Group activities can have multiple fill-in-the-blank opportunities. Mad Libs is a great activity for teaching spelling.
Teacher scaffolding can help support beginning learners. Reminding the student what she already knows, strategies she might try to complete a spelling word, and providing hints and encouragement all support a first grader with spelling.

, When you're helping your first graders, say each word you want them to spell slowly. Teach your first graders to listen for the sounds they hear (initial sound, middle sound, final sound). Help them identify any part they might know, e.g., br in brought.Encourage students to notice how words come together to make a larger word. For example, putting fun and silly together to make funny. Students might enjoy clapping the syllables, then writing letters for each syllable.
Help the students identify different spellings of rhyming words, such as space and place, or here and there.
Students need lots of opportunities to try the correct spelling to see if it looks right. Provide resources around the classroom - dictionaries, calendars, charts, word walls, etc.

, Writing and spelling are two different academic areas. Having students write, without worrying about their spelling, will help them become more confident writers and spellers.Provide opportunities for students to write about things that are important to them: football games, video games, school outings, or pets are popular topics.
These learning opportunities are found throughout the students' day. Make games out of writing about new topics.

, The more a child is exposed to written words, the more likely he is to internalize the spelling of the word. If you're working on particular spelling words, point them out in books, magazines and online. Highlight with a marker to emphasize that the word he's learning is also found in the ""real world"" if possible.Students may enjoy ""proofreading"" for spelling mistakes.
First graders may appreciate reading the same stories over and over again. If this is the case, take advantage of this repetition to highlight different words found within the same story.

Insert the text box.",How to Make a Leaflet," When you sit down to make a leaflet, you need to know about your topic. When you’re researching your topic, think about the most important key points your reader must have in order to understand your message. Know what resources you have available. For example, if your topic is fun at the swimming pool, have a spots in your leaflet for swimming safety, fun games to play, and information on any waterslides.


Plan your leaflet by keeping a rough draft on folded paper. Fill it out as a mockup to keep your brain moving creatively. The rough draft can be used to help work the layout and organization.;
, When building a leaflet, it must have a title. The title should be brief and informative, but also catch the reader’s attention and invite them to read more.If you’re stuck on a title, try finishing your leaflet and adding a title last. A title may come to you after you know more about the topic. For example, the swimming pool leaflet may suit a title such as “Fun in the Pool” or “Field Trips to the Pool”.

, An overview is a brief but clear opening that clearly states the objective of the leaflet. Create an introduction that is concise and creative. If necessary, use bullet points to keep your objective from having too much text., When creating a leaflet your text will print off quite small and congested. Avoid readability problems by keeping your text at a minimum size of at least 12 point text in a clear font, such as Arial. Avoid whimsical and unclear fonts and stick to short and simple paragraphs, with plenty of space between.Headings should stand out from the rest of the text consistently. For example, if you choose to bold a headline, bold all of them. Another option is to underline all headers.Avoid crazy use of colors. Keep the colors contrasted from the white paper but avoid using several colors at once. This gives an overwhelming look and is difficult to read., Leaflets should be organized and kept simple. Use plain English and avoid slang or overly complicated sentences. To keep your sentences simple, try reading them aloud to yourself. If you’re finding that you struggle over words, your sentences may be too complex or difficult to understand. Avoid jargon and abbreviations., When building your leaflet, keep relevant information flowing steady and logically. If possible, avoid repeating information. For example, when writing about a day at the pool, keep all information regarding safety together. In a new section, talk about games such as Marco Polo. When writing about the games, try avoiding repetition of the importance of life jackets and pool safety., Once you have all your information typed up, proofread and check for grammar, spelling and formatting errors. This works best if you let your information sit for a few hours and check back. If you reread it too soon, you will find yourself easily skipping over errors. If time permits, ask a close friend or relative to proofread on your behalf., Open your Microsoft Word from your computer. In the standard toolbar, you want to click “New Blank Document”. Don’t forget to immediately begin saving to prevent any lost content.Though the process may slightly vary, this will also work in other word processors such as OpenOffice, LibreOffice, AbiWord or Microsoft Wordpad.

, To set up the proper leaflet orientations, click into the “File” menu. From there, click “Page Setup” and “Margins”. Margins should be set to 0.5”. Assuming you want a traditional leaflet, you will also need to change the page orientation. This is done by going to “Orientation” within “Page Setup” and clicking “Landscape.”, A leaflet will have a column on each page. To insert columns, click on “Format” from the upper toolbar. Choose “Columns”. Under the “Presets” tab, change the number to three. Under “Width and Spacing” you will need to edit the space to twice of the margins (1.0”). The spacing is the gutter in between the columns. If you’d like your columns to be less wide, increase the width., In order to see where the lines are visualized, click “Line between” under the “Presets” tab within “Columns”. This will give a thin line to show the boundaries between each column. This will help in the planning and structuring of your leaflet.If you wish to remove these lines after completion but before printing, simply uncheck the box again., If you don’t like the leaflet you’ve made, you can download one built by Microsoft. Do this by clicking “File”, then “New”. From here, select “Brochures and Booklets”, then “Brochures”. An extensive library of brochures, including tri-fold brochures will come up., Once you’ve selected a picture, you need to know how to access it. For example, the path may be “My Computer”, “My Documents”, “Downloads”, followed by the picture name “Myleafletpicture.jpg”., To find fill effects, select the “Page Layout” tab. From here you’ll need to enter the “Page Background” group. Then select “Page Color”. From this menu you should see “Fill Effects”., Once you’ve arrived to the “Fill Effects”, you can “Select Picture”. Now you’ll need the path to find your pictures. Once you found it, click “Insert” and “Okay”. This will insert the picture as a background into your leaflet as a whole., Before adding a text box, directly click into whichever column you wish to put the box into. You will need to do this individually for each column, back and front, that you wish to put text into., To insert a textbox, you must first select the “Insert” tab. From here, you can select “Text Group”., After you’ve selected “Text Group” choose the option for “Simple Text Box”. The text box should now appear within your column. From here, you can drag and manipulate the box to fit your needs. You can also resize it.These text boxes will work for both headers and content. To keep all text in the same location, it is recommended that you do separate text boxes for both. "

Know the signs of the precommunicative writing stage.,
Learn about the semiphonetic stage of writing.,
Know about the phonetic spelling stage.,
Learn more about the transitional spelling stage.",How to Help First Graders With Spelling Words2," A first grade child may be still at the precommunicative stage of writing, which means that he only has a rough idea of the alphabet. Your first grader may recognize different letters of the alphabet, but be unaware of words as a visual construct. Spaces between words may not be noticed.For children in this stage, continue to teach alphabet shapes and expose the child to written words through reading aloud with him.
Never attempt to correct the spelling of a child at this stage of writing.

, By first grade, some children will be at the semiphonetic stage of reading. A this stage, the child is making a connection between the sound of the word and the sound of a letter or two within the word. He may dramatically abbreviate the word, such as using T or D for dog.The word that the child may attempt to spell first may be his name, or the M for Mom or D for Dad.
Children's ability to segment, or separate, the distinct sounds of a word may be still emerging.
Encourage a child to write often, no matter how difficult the word may be to read. Don't worry about spelling at this stage, but provide help if the child is open.

, This is a common stage for first graders, a stage of spelling that assumes basic knowledge of the alphabet and understand that words and sounds are connected. A speller at this stage may use ""invented"" spelling patterns based on the sound of the word.Children at this level will be more interested in learning correct spelling. Provide models of correctly spelled words, and start to encourage them to think about how to spell words for themselves. This is a wonderful stage to start to help a child with spelling.Examples of invented spellings might be kam for came, wel for will, fes for fish, etc.
Another thing you might notice is that the child starts to recognize beginning patterns in words, noticing rhymes and similar sounds.

, A few first graders might already be at the transitional stage of spelling. At this stage, the student will have emerging reading skills and recognize many words. They begin to understand that sounds are represented by letter combinations, and that words can be made plural or altered in other ways by suffixes and prefixes.Being patient with mistakes at this stage is essential. The words might actually be more difficult to understand than with a phonetic speller, but the child's spelling mistakes are based in inadequate understanding of spelling patterns. Continue to teach the patterns that make for good spelling.
Teach the child how to laugh at spelling inconsistencies as are so often found in the English language. Reminders of appropriate spelling can also be taught at this stage, such as ""I before E, except after C, unless it's an A as in neighbor or weigh.""

Ask your shipping service about their international customs policies.",How to Ship Air Freight," Air freight is generally the quickest method of freighting goods, but that also means that is often the most expensive. Considering the urgency of your shipments, where it needs to arrive, and what your budget is will help you decide if air freighting is right for your shipment.

A general rule is the quicker the shipment the more expensive it will be.;
, Most airlines also offer cargo freighting services where you pay an additional fee to air freight a package in the cargo hold of the plane. Airline shipping is particularly convenient if you plan on travelling with your shipment as not all airline shipping services offer residential deliveries and pickups.Contact your airline and ask about their cargo freighting methods, costs, and customs policies. Ask questions like “I’m shipping a package that weighs around 300 lbs., will I be able to freight in my flight’s cargo?”, “How many packages can I ship on my flight specifically?”, “What are the plane’s weight and size restrictions?”, There are a variety of carriers and freight services available both in the U.S. and internationally. Most of these carriers, like UPS, USPS, FedEx, and DHL, offer global web-based support. Research and compare various carriers to decide which carrier offers services that are best for your shipment.Look for the differences in price points and methods between carriers. Most global carriers will provide you with a variety of options, from next day priority air freighting to standard air freighting.
Most carrier websites will also allow you to get a rough quote on the cost and time of your shipment. However, you’ll need to know the dimensions, weight, and shipping method to get an accurate quote.

, Weigh the items you plan on shipping by using a scale. This can be done at your chosen shipping service, like UPS or DHL, or can be done at home on a bathroom scale. Place your item on the scale and write down its exact weight. Some carriers only ask for whole numbers when asking for the package weight. In this case, round your package’s weight up to the nearest whole number. For example, if your package is 18.5 pounds it should be rounded to 19 pounds.


If your item is too large to view the scale you may have to weigh it at one of your shipping carrier’s stores. Alternatively, you can weigh yourself, hold the package and step onto your scale, and subtract your weight from the combined weight to get an estimate of how much your package weighs.

, Measure your shipment to determine its width, height, and length in inches. Use a tape measure to measure your shipments dimensions and have an estimate of its size. Once you have a good estimate you how large your shipment is you will be able to find the right package or box for it.


If the item you are shipping is not squared or rectangular, measure the largest points of its length, width, and height to determine what box you’ll need.

, Select a box based on the type of object you are shipping. There are many different types of shipping packages and boxes, many of which are specialized for specific items. Consult your shipping service to inquire about recommendations for packages based on the item your shipping and ask if you can purchase that box from them.Some shipping services will pack your boxes for you. Although, many would prefer you pack them yourself.
Be sure to add extra padding for fragile materials, like foam, packing peanuts, and bubble wrap.

, Once you have received your quote and chosen your shipping service you may bring your package to one of your shipping service’s stores. An employee will assist you in finalizing your weight and dimensions and will begin go over rates, values, and methods.

If your package is being picked up in a residential area, be sure to print your shipping label and adhere it to your package. Make sure that all fees are paid, values declared, and insurances taken before having your package picked up for shipping.

, Declaring your package’s value will allow your shipping service to determine how liable they will be for your package. You may also choose to take out the maximum declared value, but that often comes with an associated fee. There is no set rubric for declaring your package’s value, as some packages might have sentimental value while other may be expensive. Use your own discretion to determine how much you think your package is worth.Every shipping service is different. Ask your shipping service what their liabilities are, what maximum value can be declared, and what range of value they recommend shipping without insurance.
Ask your shipping service questions like, “What is the maximum value I can declare for a package?”, “What are your fees for declaring maximum value?”, or “What value range do you recommend for the items I am shipping?”

, Although not required, purchasing shipping insurance for your package will ensure your shipping service’s liability for damaged, lost, or misplaced goods. Most carriers have limits and exclusions in place, but a general rule for global air freighting is an insurance policy cover $500,000 per shipment for approved commodities. Get in touch with your shipping service to find out if your shipment qualifies for insurance and what policy they recommend.Ask your shipping service questions, like “I would like to insure my package, what additional coverage does your insurance provide?”, “How much should my insurance policy cover in relationship to my declared value?”, “How much does an insurance policy cost and what are it’s terms and conditions?”

, Each shipping service offers different shipping methods, but most will offer a wide variety of times for air freighting. Choose your shipping method based on cost calculations as well as time constraints. Most shipping services will offer at least a few options including priority or next day shipping, standard or economy shipping, and cargo or oversized package shipping.Ask your shipping service questions about which shipping method you should choose, like “Is my package oversized?”, “How long does your standard or economy shipping take?”, or “When can you guarantee my package’s arrival?”

, If you are shipping internationally than you will likely need to fill out extra paperwork. Consult your shipping service about export and import declarations, customs policies, and air waybills. Most global shipping services and airlines have representatives that can provide you with all necessary paperwork.Import and export customs policies vary by country to country. Your shipping service will likely be familiar with the customs policies of your country and will have information available regarding the policies of the countries you may be shipping to.
Cargo air waybills are indexical tracking documents used in airline air freighting only.

The first thing to remember when packing a parcel is the journey that the parcel will take.,
A standard courier network is similar to the baggage handling set up at an airport.

,
Once your parcel has been collected by the driver, it will be taken to the depot, where it will be unloaded on to a conveyor.

If your parcel is unable to withstand being turned over or dropped from the height of 90 centimeter (35.4 in) without sustaining any damage then you probably shouldn't send it using a Parcel Courier, but have it sent using a direct driver who will collect and take your parcel directly to the delivery address.

,
Another thing to take into account is the destination of your parcel, as a parcel transported by air services will need to allow for expansion of any bubble products such as bubble wrap or air pockets.

",How to Pack a Parcel for Delivery," The box will need to be big enough for your item to fit into with a generous gap all the way around. Use a new box, as second hand boxes may result in damage to your item, due to the box being weakened during use.


Cardboard boxes come in two main types, single or double walled. Boxes of 30 centimeter (11.8 in) squared or greater should be doubled walled, also boxes taking items heavier than 5kg should also be doubled walled.

,, If at this point you feel that your item may sustain damage during its transit, you may wish to double box your item.


Double boxing is the process of placing your box into a larger box separated by packing material (such as loose fill) between the two boxes. The larger box is then closed up and sealed including edges by high quality tape.

,, Some of the carrier companies require you to print and attached bar coded label whereas others will require you to address the parcel for them to then attach a bar code. In either case, it is best that you place at least two copies of the bar coded label or delivery address on your parcel.

, If you are sending your parcel via a standard courier (Parcelforce or DHL), the parcel will be sent through their network of hubs and depots and will not be picked up and taken directly to its destination.;

If you refrigerate the strawberries for more than a day, they will not be fresh by the time they arrive at their destination.Before you proceed with preparing to ship the strawberries, check that the chocolate strawberries are in good shape and that they’re fully hardened. If any seem to be already spoiling, throw them away and start over with less-ripe berries.;
, To preserve the strawberries, you should place each one in its own protective wrapping. To do this, you should use cellophane wrap, as it will mold to the shape of each strawberry.Take a strawberry and then wrap a piece of cellophane around it.


If you want the strawberries to look more decorated, consider tying each with a bow or piece of ribbon.

, You’ll need a container with a lid that will close completely, to prevent the strawberries from spilling out. The container will also need to be firm and sturdy enough to withstand being jostled while it’s shipped. Plan to use either a plastic Tupperware container or a small cardboard box.


Look for plastic Tupperware at your local grocery store. If you’d rather ship the strawberries in a small cardboard box, these may be available at a grocery store as well.
Avoid shipping the chocolate-covered strawberries in glass, which could shatter while being moved.

, The strawberries need to be placed with at least an inch of space between each of the berries inside the container, since you don’t want the individual fruits to butt into each other and smear the chocolate. Divide them in rows in the container.


In order to prevent the strawberries from touching, you may also want to individually wrap the strawberries. A cooking-supply store may sell small paper cups; barring this, you could put each strawberry in a separate paper muffin cup.

, This should happen before you place the strawberries into a larger shipping box. Close the container completely, since you do not want any air to leak into it. If you are packing many strawberries, then you should purchase and fill several containers.


Do not try to cram lots of strawberries into a single container, as they can become deformed and the chocolate will smear.

, This will keep the strawberries chilled for as long as possible by preventing warmth outside the box from getting in. Insulated boxes may be available for purchase at a grocery store or camping-supply store. You can also mail the strawberries in a small, hard-bodied cooler. Look for a cooler made of Styrofoam, as this will weigh less and therefore cost less to ship., If you cannot find an insulated box available for purchase, you could line a regular cardboard box with frozen gel ice packs in order to insulate the strawberries.These will keep the chocolate from melting. You can purchase gel ice packs at your local supermarket or kitchen-supply store. Freeze them for at least 8 hours before packing, and surround the box containing the chocolate-covered strawberries with frozen gel ice packs (around 6-8).

, Put packing peanuts or bubble wrap in the bottom of the box.Make sure that this packaging completely surrounds the bases of the strawberry containers. This will keep the containers from hitting each other. You want to make sure that there is not empty space in the box.


Once you’ve made sure the strawberry boxes are firmly packed, layer more packing peanuts over the top, then close the box with packing tape.

, You’ll want to send them with the fastest type of delivery possible, so that the strawberries don’t spoil and the chocolate doesn’t melt. Make sure that you pick overnight, express, or one-day delivery.The longer it takes for the strawberries to be shipped, then the greater the chance will be that they will melt before they get to their destination.

, The U.S. Postal Service prohibits shipping fruit internationally, so you’ll need to ship the fruits within the United States only. Choose the fastest possible shipping option, and be aware that you’re shipping at your own risk—the USPS will not insure perishable items.As with any shipping method, send the package earlier in the week. Even with overnight shipping, it’s best to ship early in the week to ensure that your package doesn’t get stuck somewhere over the weekend., Opt for their fastest shipping option: Next Day Air or UPS Ground shipping.If you live within 450 miles of the intended destination, UPS Ground shipping may be a more economical option, as it guarantees next-day delivery within a 450-mile radius.


UPS will allow you to mail perishable items—including food—internationally, although the chocolate-covered strawberries may have melted by the time they arrive.
Do not ship the chocolate-covered strawberries shortly before a holiday, as this could result in the package being left in a shipping vehicle for an extra day., Choose their fastest overnight shipping option, likely FedEx First Overnight, or FedEx Priority Overnight.FedEx will allow you to mail perishable and home-made items internationally, but you’ll need to mark the items as such on the invoice that you fill out.Make sure that you alert the recipient in advance of when they can expect to receive the package, so that it’s not left outside for any length of time. When mailing the strawberries, you should have received a tracking number: communicate this to the gift’s recipient, so they can track the package’s progress as well.

Frost the cake with a stiff icing.,
Freeze the cake prior to shipping to set the icing and help the cake hold its shape.,
Place the wrapped cake in a pre-cooled Styrofoam cooler.,
Carefully place the cake package in a sturdy corrugated cardboard box.,
Seal the corrugated box shut with two-inch wide, pressure-sensitive plastic tape.,
Note which side of the box is up.,
Choose a shipping service that would ship the cake the same day or overnight, whenever possible.",How to Ship a Cake," If shipping cake with icing, check that the icing used is the stiff kind. Cake shipping methods usually work best with cakes that use fondant icing, since the fondant would hold its shape better even when subjected to a warm shipping trip. Shipping is not advised for cakes which are fluffy and have a lot of frosting, as this would be more likely to be messy, and the frosting would tend to melt in warmer temperatures.;
, The cool temperature will also maintain the freshness of the cake. Once you are ready to pack the cake for shipping, carefully wrap the frozen cake in plastic saran wrap from top to bottom, making sure that the plastic is wrapped firmly enough to provide ample support to the cake. After, wrap the cake in aluminum foil to maintain the cold temperature.

, Surround the cake with gel packs to help keep it cool while in transit, and Styrofoam packaging peanuts to cushion the cake and prevent too much movement. If a Styrofoam cooler is not available, you may also place the cake in a sturdy cardboard cake box. For added protection, wrap the Styrofoam cooler or cake box further in bubble wrap.

, Place Styrofoam peanuts around the cake package on all sides, as well as on the bottom of the box. Fill the box with the peanuts such that it becomes a sturdy insulation, ensuring that the cake package does not move around.

, Do not use cellophane tape or masking tape, as these may be removed easily. Apply multiple layers of tape to all the seams.

, Mark the box with “THIS SIDE UP” and with an arrow pointing up, by using stickers or by writing it with a permanent marker. Make sure to do this on each side of the box. Mark the box with “Fragile” and “Perishable” as well.

Take packaging into account.,
Weigh your item.,
Figure out postage.,
Enter your information into an online calculator.",How to Determine Shipping Costs1," The type of packaging you use affects costs. Light packaging tends to be inexpensive. Smaller boxes add about a dollar to shipping costs, while light envelopes add about 25 cents. However, using a larger box can cost up to $5. While you can't know the exact cost until being charged at the post office, these guidelines can help you determine a rough estimate.For example, if you're shipping a larger box, add an estimated $5 onto your overall shipping costs.;
, If you have a scale at home, weigh your item first. Make sure you weigh the package as you'll send it out. The weight, in addition to other information, can be entered into an online calculator to help you estimate a rough shipping cost. Jot it down and gather other information before using an online calculator.Use an online calculator associated with the shipping company you're using. If you're shipping through FedEx, for example, use a calculator on their website.

, Postage varies depending on the type of package you're sending and your state. You must use an individual online calculator catered to your state to determine a postage estimate.You enter information such as your zip code and the type of package you're sending. From there, you will get a price estimate for postage., You can find calculators online to help you determine shipping costs. Try to find a calculator through the mail carrier you're using. For example, if you're using UPS, use their online price calculator. Enter the information you gathered, such as the package weight, to get an overall cost estimate.Remember, prices may vary when you arrive at the post office.

Account for handling.,
Evaluate the cost of packaging.,
Weigh your items.,
Use a calculated weight for lightweight items and specialty shipping.,
Use a flat rate to increase sales.",How to Determine Shipping Costs2," If you have workers handling your objects prior to shipping, remember to account for this when determining shipping costs. How long will it take to package the items and what do you pay your workers? To figure out handling costs, multiply how long it take your employees to package items and divide that by 60. Then, multiply that by their hourly wage. This should give you the average cost of handling per item.For example, say your employees take 15 minutes to package and send an item. Divide that by 60 to get .25. If you pay your employees $10 an hour, multiple that by .25 to get $2.50. This means your handling costs are $2.50.

, Think about what type of packaging you're using. Larger boxes can cost up to $5 to ship, while small envelopes cost only 25 cents. Lightweight boxes generally cost a dollar. Factor these costs in when figuring out your rough shipping costs for your items.Later, as you decide between a calculated or flat rate, you can decide what chunk of packaging costs you should pass on to your customers.

, If you don't already have a scale at home, buy one. Weigh your items and then use an online calculator to determine how much you'll be charged based on your carrier and the object's weight.Make sure to weigh your objects in their packaging.

, A calculated rate means you would charge customers shipping based on factors such as the product type, weight, and so on. A calculated rate has both pros and cons you should consider before adopting it.Use a calculated weight if you're selling lightweight items and/or offering different methods of delivery (i.e., standard shipping, two day shipping, overnight shipping). Lightweight items cost less to ship, so shipping costs won't add a lot to a customer's bill, and people are willing to pay more for quick services.
Calculated shipping rates have some drawback. If your shipping rates are expensive, customers may abandon their items at checkout when their shipping costs are calculated. Flat rates tend to make more sales.

, A flat rate means you charge one price for shipping, regardless of the item's weight, packaging, and so on. You should know the average shipping rate for your items. For example, if items cost around $8 to ship, a $4 flat rate shipping fee is reasonable.Flat rates reduce the likelihood consumers will abandon their items at checkout. Customers know shipping costs ahead of time and will account for these costs when making purchases.
The main drawback of a flat rate shipping fee is that you lose some profit. However, as flat rates generally generate more sales, the extra money may makeup for this.

Review a website's shipping and handling policies.,
Pay attention to different prices based on speed.,
See if shipping rates vary based on item type.",How to Determine Shipping Costs3," The best way to figure out how much shipping will cost is to review a store's guidelines. The company website should explain whether the shipping rates are flat or calculated so you can get a sense of how much you'll be paying in shipping.


Some stores may provide an online calculator so you can determine your potential shipping costs prior to placing your order.

, Many stores charge an extra fee for faster deliveries. While something standard shipping may be free or only come with a small charge, some stores may charge a hefty fee for two day or overnight shipping., Shipping rates often vary depending on the type of object you're ordering. When reviewing a store's policies, see if shipping rates vary by type. Expensive, breakable objects, such as electronics, may come with extra fees.This is especially important when ordering from large retail sites, such as Amazon, that sell a wide variety of objects.

Measure the longest side of the package.,
Measure the width of the package.,
Measure the height of the package.,
Double the width and height measurements.,
Add the doubled measurements together.,
Calculate the combined length and girth.,
Note the final measurements.",How to Measure the Length x Width x Height of Shipping Boxes1," Determine which side of the box is longest, then measure the full length of this side from one end to the other using a measuring stick.


Round this measurement off to the nearest inch (2.5 cm).
This measurement is the length of your package.;
, The width of your box is the shorter side of the bottom or top face (or the open side) of the box. Measure the full distance of this side from one end to the other using a measuring stick.


Round this measurement off to the nearest inch (2.5 cm), as well.
Even if you mix up the height and width measurements, the final calculation should not be thrown off. The only side you absolutely must identify accurately is the length.

, Use a measuring stick to measure the standing side of the box from one end to the other. This is your height measurement.


The height should be the only side previously unmeasured at this point.
Round the measurement to the nearest inch (2.5 cm).

, Multiply the width by two. Multiply the height by two, as well.


Neither of these calculations have a separate term, but you'll need to know them for your final girth calculation.
Do not double the length measurement.
For example, if you have a box with a length of 12 inches (30.5 cm), a width of 4 inches (10 cm), and a height of 6 inches (15.25 cm), you would only need to double the width and height:

Doubled width: 4 * 2 = 8 inches (20 cm)
Doubled height: 6 * 12 = 12 inches (30.5 cm)



, Add the doubled height and doubled width measurements together. The combined sum equals the girth of the box.


The girth is essentially the total distance around the thickest part of the box.In the previous example, the doubled width was 8 inches (20 cm) and the doubled height was 12 inches (30.5 cm). As such, the girth would be found by adding these two calculated measurements together:

Girth: 8 + 12 = 20 inches (50.5 cm)



, When shipping ground packages, you may need to know the overall size of the package. This can be found by adding the length and girth measurements together.


In the previous example, the girth of the package was 20 inches (50.5 cm) and the length was 12 inches (30.5 cm). To find the overall package size, you need to add these two measurements together:

Size: 20 + 12 = 32 inches (80.5 cm).



, You should have all the necessary measurements needed to ship your box at this point. Keep a note of each separate measurement so that you'll be able to provide the shipping service with the exact information required.


You might be asked for:

Separate length, width, and height measurements (L; W; H)
Length and girth measurements (L; 2W + 2H)
Total package size (L + 2W + 2H)

Measure the longest side of the package.,
Measure the widest part of the package width.,
Measure the deepest part of the package height.,
Treat the package as a rectangular box.",How to Measure the Length x Width x Height of Shipping Boxes2," Determine which side of the package is longest. This will be used as the length measurement.


Measure the longest distance from one end to the other using a measuring stick. Only measure along the outer edge if the outer edge is the longest point. If the longest distance lies somewhere in between the outer edges of the package, you must measure there instead.
Round the measurement to the nearest 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Set the package down so that the length runs parallel to the table or floor. The other (shorter) parallel side is the width.


Identify the longest distance along this width. It might be at one of the outer edges of the package, but it may lie somewhere in between the outer edges.
Measure this widest portion of the package width using a measuring stick. Round this measurement to the nearest 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Identify the remaining unmeasured side. It should run perpendicular to the floor or table. This side is the height of the package.


Look for the tallest point of the package. Measure from this point down to floor or table, where the bottom of the package rests. Do not measure along the outer edge of the height unless that outer edge is the tallest one.
Use a measuring stick and round off your measurement to the nearest 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, To calculate the girth or overall size of the box, apply the same method you would use when calculating the measurements of a regular rectangular box.When asked for separate length, width, and height measurements, provide the measurements you just took as they are.
When asked for length and girth measurements, provide the length measurement you just took as it is. For the girth, double both the width and height measurements, then add the two doubled values together.

Example: Length = 6 inches (15 cm); Width = 2 inches (5 cm); Height = 4 inches (10 cm)
Girth = (2 * 2 inches ) + (2 * 4 inches ) = 4 inches (10 cm) + 8 inches (20 cm) = 12 inches (30 cm)


When asked for the total package measurement, add the girth and length together.

Example: Girth = 12 inches (30 cm); Length = 6 inches (15 cm)
Total size = 12 inches (30 cm) + 6 inches (15 cm) = 18 inches (45 cm)

"
Measure the length, width, and height.,
Calculate the volume.,
Divide the volume by 166.,
Take the actual weight.,
Compare the dimensional weight to the actual weight.",How to Measure the Length x Width x Height of Shipping Boxes3," Use a measuring stick to measure all three sides of the package. Round these measurements to the nearest 1 inch.


When measuring dimensional weight, it doesn't matter which side you label as the length, which you label as the width, and which you label as the height. You only need to make sure that all three sides are properly measured.
For each side, use a measuring stick to measure from one edge to the opposite edge. Write each measurement down separately and round each one to the nearest 1 inch.
Note that these dimensional weight calculations can only be used with imperial units of measurement. The calculations will not work for metric measurements. (To use the formulas below with the metric system, replace 166 with 5000.)

, Calculate the volume of the package by multiplying the length, width, and height together.


For example, if you want to ship a package with a length of 12 inches, width of 8 inches, and height of 4 inches, you would calculate the volume by multiplying all three measurements together:

Volume = 12 inches * 8 inches * 4 inches = 384 cubic inches



, For shipments within the United States or Puerto Rico, divide the volume of the package by 166. For international shipments, divide the volume by 139.For a package with a volume of 384 cubic inches

Domestic dimensional weight = 384 cubic inches / 166 = 2.31
International dimensional weight = 384 cubic inches / 139 = 2.76



, Use a postal scale to measure the true weight of the package in pounds.


If you do not own a postal scale, you will need to have the weight of the package measured at the shipping office.

, If the dimensional weight is greater than the actual weight, the shipping service may need to charge a greater amount than the base fee indicated for your package dimensions.


Dimensional weight is only an estimate, not a precise measurement.
When a package is light or moderately heavy based on its volume, the price of shipping will usually be based on dimensional weight, length, width, and volume. Abnormally heavy packages will need to be priced based on actual weight.

Record every delivery transaction.",How to Get a Liquor Delivery Service License," States that allow delivery of alcoholic beverages to private homes regulate delivery licenses through the same licensing board that regulates the sale of alcohol generally.You first need to find out if the state licensing board allows home delivery in your state. Some states have passed laws specifically allowing it.
In other states, home delivery is neither forbidden by law or explicitly permitted by law. Where your state's law doesn't address home delivery, licensing boards have different approaches.
In many such states, home delivery is permitted under the same regulations as retail sales are permitted. This means customers must pay for the alcohol on site and have it delivered at a later time.;
, In most states that have passed laws that deal specifically with liquor delivery services, you must have a retail license to sell alcoholic beverages to consumers for consumption elsewhere. If you don't already have a retail license, you'll have to get one before you can start a liquor delivery service.Determine whether you intend to deliver spirits, beer, wine, or all of the above. Some states require different retail licenses for the sale of different types of alcoholic beverages.
Many states require separate licenses for selling spirits, and these licenses may be allocated.
This means that although typically you can get a license to sell beer and wine provided you meet the basic license requirements, there may be a lottery for a set number of licenses to sell spirits.
If you have questions about which type of license you need, you can ask someone who works at the state licensing board, or review the information on the board's website.

, Each state has an application form that you must complete to get a retail license to sell alcoholic beverages. You will have to provide information about yourself and any other business owners, as well as your business and its location.The application form itself will require you to provide information about your business, yourself, and any other owners of the business.
You'll have to identify the location of your business, and may have to get certification that you don't violate any zoning or other local ordinances governing the location of retail establishments that sell alcoholic beverages.
In many states all owners of the business must get fingerprinted and pass a criminal background check before a license will be issued.
In addition to the application form, there typically are a number of other documents you must provide to get a new retail license to sell alcoholic beverages. The state licensing board should have a checklist you can follow to make sure you've gathered all required documents.
Typically other documents you must submit are related to the owners of your business, including copies of identification, fingerprint cards, or background check information.
Double-check everything on your application before you get ready to submit it. Errors or missing information could result in your application being delayed or rejected.

, Some states may require you to sign your completed application in the presence of a notary public. Make copies of your signed application and all other required documents before submitting them to your state licensing board so you have copies for your records.You must pay a fee to apply for a retail license to sell alcoholic beverages. This fee varies widely among states, but typically is at least $100.
Some states allow you to fill out and submit your applications online, paying your licensing fees with a credit or debit card.
If you have to submit a paper application, you may want to take it into the local licensing office yourself or pay extra for a tracking option when you mail it, so you can verify it got to the right place.

, Once your application is processed, you should receive your official license within a few weeks provided you meet all the requirements of your state. Once you get your license, you can sell alcoholic beverages as well as deliver them to customers – provided home delivery is allowed in your state.Expect it to take several weeks, if not a couple of months, for your application to be processed once it is received by the licensing board.

, In many states that allow home delivery of alcoholic beverages, the customer must make payment in full at your location in advance of the delivery, rather than paying the delivery person when their order is delivered.In some states, the customer must come to the store in person and purchase the alcoholic beverages they want delivered in a face-to-face transaction.
Other states allow customer orders over the internet or by telephone, as long as they are processed in-store just as a normal in-person transaction would be.
Typically alcoholic beverages must be purchased in advance – the customer cannot pay the delivery driver on receipt of the delivery, using any method of payment.
Check with your state licensing board to make sure you've set up appropriate methods of payment and identification of the customer that comply with your state's regulations. These rules differ significantly from state to state in regard to home delivery of alcoholic beverages.

, Typically, you can deliver orders to customers during the normal retail hours of your business. However, the days of the week and times you are permitted to deliver alcoholic beverages to customers may be further restricted by your state's law.For example, some states do not allow the delivery of alcoholic beverages after dark, even if your physical store can remain open late into the evening.
In states where customers are required to make their purchase in person for later delivery, you may be allowed to deliver even on days such as Sunday when you can't open your store.
In addition to state regulations, choosing your delivery times also is a matter of personal preference.
Set times that suit the needs of your business while also taking into consideration the safety of your employees who will be making the deliveries.

, Most states require that those who deliver alcoholic beverages for you be over the age of 21. They also may have to meet other state requirements relative to licensing retail sales clerks.In addition, your delivery drivers must have driver's licenses that are in good standing. Your state may require them to have a driver's license from the state where your store is located rather than an out-of-state license.
Typically, if someone is legally permitted to work in your store, they also are permitted to make deliveries. Any registration or license required for retail employees of liquor stores also is required for employees who deliver alcoholic beverages.

, Many states that allow home delivery of alcoholic beverages place restrictions either on the size of the individual orders or on the percentage of your business that is made up by your home-delivery service.Home delivery of alcoholic beverages is limited to products for personal consumption, not for resale.
Some states limit the amount that can be purchased at once by an individual consumer for that reason – essentially, the law assumes that if someone is purchasing several cases of liquor, they intend to sell some of it.
The amount of alcoholic beverages you are permitted to deliver to customer's homes may depend on the type of establishment you have.
For example, bars in Arizona also may deliver alcoholic beverages to private residences within the state, but those sales cannot exceed 30 percent of their total sales. Liquor stores, however, do not have this restriction.

, Any vehicles that are used by your business to deliver alcoholic beverages to customers' homes must follow your state's regulations for business vehicles.Your drivers should have the appropriate registration, licensing, and insurance documents in their vehicles at all times when they are delivering alcoholic beverages for your business.
Check with your state's licensing board regarding ownership of vehicles used to deliver alcohol. Some states must require drivers to use vehicles owned by the business rather than their personal vehicles.
If your drivers are allowed to use their personal vehicles, find out if there are additional insurance requirements for people using their personal vehicles for business purposes, and make sure your drivers are aware of those requirements.
For vehicles owned by your business, keep the required registration and insurance documents inside the car, and make sure all employees who drive the vehicle are listed on your insurance.
Keep copies of vehicle registration and insurance documents with your business records.

, In many states, the alcohol control board that regulates the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages provides forms that can be used to legally record all delivery transactions.If a form is available for you to use and record all required information, it may be a good idea to use it even if the regulations allow you to record your sales another way.
By using the official form, you can be certain that you have all the information required. Since inspectors will be familiar with the form, they'll be able to easily read your records.
If you have your own record-keeping system, for example if you keep all of your records as electronic files on a computer, you may want to design a form to incorporate into that system that mimics the format on the state's form.

, Even if a specific form is not required, most states do require you to keep detailed records of every delivery transaction, including the name and address of the customer.The records you keep for home deliveries may require additional information that isn't necessary for regular in-store transactions.
Typically you must record the name and identification information for the customer, as well as the address to which the alcoholic beverages were delivered.
You also may need to include both the date and time of purchase and the date and time of delivery.
Details of the specific transaction, including the number of bottles sold and the volume of those bottles, is necessary so state inspectors can ensure you're complying with state regulations that limit the quantity of alcoholic beverages sold or delivered to individual consumers.
Records must be kept for the period of time specified by your state's law, typically at least two or three years from the transaction date.
Keep in mind that state inspectors typically have the right to inspect your premises and records at any time, and may come unannounced.

Measure the dimensions of your poster.,
Use thicker MDF to make your plaque mounting more prominent.,
Mark the cutting lines on your MDF, when necessary.,
Cut your MDF to size.,
Sand the edges smooth.",How to Plaque Mount Posters Using MDF1," You may have the option of getting your MDF board cut to size when you purchase it at a hardware store or home center. If so, you’ll need to know the length and width of your poster. Take these measurements with your tape measure.The guided example provided in the following steps assumes you’re working with a rectangular poster. If your poster is irregularly shaped, you’ll need to find the length of each individual side.;
, There will likely be many different sizes and thicknesses of MDF to choose from. Select a piece big enough to fit your entire poster and a thickness that best exhibits your poster.

Thick MDF will be much heavier. Keep this in mind when hanging your plaque mounted poster, and consider doing so from a wall stud so it doesn’t damage the wall.
You may need to look in the “Particle Board” section of your store to find MDF, as it is often considered to be a kind of particle board., If your MDF is larger than your poster, you’ll need to cut it down to size. To ensure your lines are straight and even, use your tape measure and a pencil to mark the dimensions of the poster on the MDF.Use a straight edge, like a square or level, to draw a solid line around the perimeter where you’ve marked. This will make it easier for you to cut the MDF.
Check the corners of your markings with a carpenter’s square. Each corner of a rectangular poster will form a perfect right angle, like an L-shape.

, Use a circular saw or a table saw to cut the MDF board along the new perimeter you’ve drawn. Work slowly and carefully; uneven edges are usually fairly obvious.While cutting, protect your eyes with safety glasses and your lungs with a breathing mask.
Always operate power saws with caution. These can cause serious harm or property damage if used improperly.
Though it might take longer, if you don’t have a power saw available you can always use a hand saw to get the job done.

, Run your fingers along the edge you’ve just cut. Does it feel jagged or rough? This can create bumpiness around the edges of your mounted poster. Use a medium grit sandpaper in the 60- to 100-grit range to sand the edges until they are smooth and regular.There will likely be sawdust from the sanding. This can also create bumpiness in the mounted poster. Use a vacuum with a brush attachment and a dry, lint-free rag to remove all sawdust.
Since you’re going to be covering up the MDF mounting with your poster, you don’t have to spend too much time trying to sand the edges to perfection."

Mark and cut your adhesive paper.,
Stick the adhesive paper onto a corner of the MDF.,
Press the opposite corner of the paper into place.,
Attach the remaining half of the adhesive paper.,
Smooth the poster into place on the adhesive paper.",How to Plaque Mount Posters Using MDF2," Place your clean, cut MDF board onto your adhesive paper. Follow the perimeter with your pencil to outline it onto the paper. Now you’re ready to cut the paper along the outline with a utility knife or scissors.

If you’re using a utility knife to cut the adhesive paper, be careful you don’t accidentally cut into your work surface. You may want to put something underneath when cutting, like cardboard.
It’s best to cut your paper too large than too small. Paper that’s too large can be easily trimmed down to size after being attached., Carefully remove the backing on your cut piece of adhesive paper. Line up one corner of the paper with the corresponding corner of the face-up side of the MDF and press it into place lightly.

If you’ve cut your adhesive paper correctly, it should fit the MDF board perfectly.

, Use your clean fingers to smooth the adhesive paper to the MDF from the attached corner the one opposite. Check the alignment with the edge as you go and make adjustments as necessary.

You may need to lightly pull up the paper where it has been attached to reorient it so it is properly aligned with the edges of the MDF.

, Work little by little from the attached side to the non-attached side. Use your fingers or a tool, like a roller, to press the paper smoothly into place on the MDF. There should be no bubbling or folded over parts.

Bubbles can be chased to the outer edges of the paper with your fingers or a straight edge, like a ruler.
Worst-case scenario, use a pin to create a small hole in bubbled areas. When these deflate, smooth them as best you can with your fingers or a straight edge.

, You’re finally ready to mount your poster to the MDF! Peel the remaining backing off the adhesive paper and attach your poster in the same fashion you did the adhesive paper.

Avoid storing your plaque mounted poster in direct sunlight or exposing it to heat. These can cause the glue to degrade and lose its stickiness.

Arrange newspaper under the MDF.,
Orient your poster face up on the MDF backing.,
Weigh down and cover one half of the poster.,
Fold back the unweighted side to expose the back of the poster.,
Cover all remaining MDF with newspaper.,
Apply adhesive to the poster.,
Remove all newspaper cover except the work surface cover.,
Smooth the glued half of the poster onto the MDF.,
Check for glue and remove seepage with paper towel.,
Repeat this process on the unglued half of the poster.",How to Plaque Mount Posters Using MDF3," This will prevent spray adhesive from getting on your work surface. Completely cover your work surface with newspaper and lay the cut MDF atop it, roughly in the center., Your poster should fit the MDF perfectly. In the event it doesn’t, you may be able to trim the poster with scissors or a utility knife so it fits the backing.

If the cut of the MDF is way off, you may need to cut a new mounting for the poster., Take a few clean pieces of paper towel and layer them at about the middle of one half of the poster. Place a clean paperweight on the paper towel. Next you’ll need to cover this half of the poster with more newspaper.Be thorough when covering the weighted portion of the poster with newspaper. Gaps may get sprayed with adhesive and ruin the quality of the finished product.

, The paperweight should hold the weighted half in place as you do this. The pulled back half should overhang the newspaper covered weighted half., You’re going to be spraying adhesive directly onto the back of the poster, and only the back of the poster. So the MDF exposed by folding back the unweighted half of the poster will also need to be covered with newspaper., Hold the can 6 in (15.2 cm) away from the poster. Position the can of adhesive spray at about the poster’s middle. While you spray, twist your wrist back and forth so the spray passes in an S-shape to coat that half of the poster back.Spray adhesive usually has a strong, unpleasant odor. Allow some time for these fumes to dissipate before moving on., Spraying the back of your poster likely got adhesive on the newspaper covering the weighted portion of the poster and the MDF. Without getting any adhesive on your hands, remove and throw away the newspaper.Avoid touching the newspaper covering your work surface or moving the MDF after spraying adhesive. This can cause glue to spread to the MDF, which can be a pain to remove.
Glue on the side or back of the MDF won't be obvious and, in many cases, can be left to dry. If you’re dead set on removing the glue, rub it lightly with clean paper towel until it comes off.

, Use a clean piece of paper towel to press the poster onto the MDF starting from the middle and working your way to the edges. Take your time and work in small increments to prevent the formation of bubbles.Bubbles can oftentimes be chased to the edges of your poster where they’ll disappear. Use a plastic card or your clean fingers to gently smooth out uneven parts of the poster.

, When the glued half of the poster is in place, feel its surface with your clean hands. You’re looking for mis-sprayed glue that got on the poster’s topside or seeped out along the edges. Rub glue gently with clean paper towel to remove it.Glue can discolor the surface of your poster or create roughness. It’ll be easiest to remove errant glue while it’s still fresh.

, Remove the paperweight and set it off to the side. Cover the glued half of the poster with fresh newspaper and peel back the second half of the poster so it overhangs the covered glued half. Only spray adhesive on the exposed back of the poster.

Before you spray the adhesive, all areas of the poster and MDF should be covered with newspaper except the part that’s been peeled back to overhang the glued half.
Smooth the adhesive sprayed poster back to the MDF in the same way you did previously, by rubbing it in small increments with a clean piece of paper towel.
The second half of your poster will likely have more glue seep along the edges than the first."
"
Add nailhead trim around the bare edges of the MDF mounting.,
Paint bare MDF.,
Bevel the edges of the MDF mounting like crown molding.",How to Plaque Mount Posters Using MDF4," You can do this similarly to how you would add nailhead trim to upholstery, but you should avoid kinds installed with nails. Instead, use trim with adhesive backing that can be pressed into place along the bare edges of MDF.

MDF is a pretty resilient wood and, in many cases, it will cause nails to bend as they’re pounded in. If you absolutely must use nails on MDF, use a nail gun., Choose a color that complements your home color scheme or the content of the poster. When in doubt, black is a simple, elegant color that goes with most kinds of decor. Consider painting before you mount your poster to prevent paint from getting on the poster., This is the most common style for a plaque mount. Beveled edges will give your MDF a professionally finished appearance and make it even more prominent."

Take hold of a corner of unwanted background vinyl from the cut piece.,
Continue peeling off unwanted bits of vinyl from your sign.,
Transfer your vinyl to its intended sign surface.",How to Make Vinyl Signs," A software program could be included with your cutter as part of a package or sold separately.
, Create your sign using the program., 2 basic kinds of vinyl, calendared and cast, can be used for signs. Both types last well indoors.

Calendared vinyl is best for surfaces that are flat or a little curved. It can last 3 to 6 years if used outdoors.
Cast vinyl can be used on surfaces that are flat, curved, have corners or are otherwise uneven. It will usually last 7 to 9 years if left outside.

, Vinyl for making signs is sold in rolls of different lengths and widths. It should have adhesive on 1 side covered with a paper backing.,, The paper backing should still be on the vinyl when you put it in.

Adjust your cutter's feed rollers to line up with your vinyl piece's edges. Use any guide markings on the cutter to also help you feed in your vinyl.
Set the rollers down on the vinyl to keep it in place for cutting.

, Use your designing software program to send the command to the cutter.,, Pull it back to peel it off the paper backing., This process is known as ""weeding."" Use a pair of pointed weeding tweezers to pull out small, difficult-to-reach vinyl pieces, such as spaces in the centers of letters.,

Roll out enough transfer or application tape to cover your vinyl sign design. Cut off the length of tape with scissors.
Run a squeegee applicator over the tape to smooth it over your vinyl sign. Carefully pull the tape and its attached vinyl away from the vinyl's paper backing. The adhesive side of the vinyl will now be exposed.
Spray an application fluid on the background surface for your sign's vinyl if you think you may need to readjust the vinyl. The fluid will prevent the vinyl's adhesive from sticking to the surface for 20 to 30 seconds.
Place the vinyl adhesive-side down on the intended surface for the sign. Reposition it if necessary.
Press out any air bubbles between the vinyl and its surface by running the squeegee applicator over the transfer tape.
Pull off the transfer tape gently to reveal your sign. Start pulling from 1 of the tape's corners.

You can always make a few signs to represent your ideas, but it is best to choose one message per sign. Then, decide whether you want to use text and imagery to convey your message, an image or a symbol without text.If you want to say something about women’s rights to fair pay, you could write, “equal pay for equal work.”If you want to say something about human rights at a women’s march, you could write, “women’s rights are human rights.”
If you want to say something about the inequitable impacts of global climate change, you could use the term “climate justice.” To convey the urgency of the need to tackle climate change, you could write, “climate justice now.” Then, you could visually highlight this statement with a symbol, such as an image of the planet melting on an ice cream cone.;
, If you decide to use text to convey your message, compose a short, clear statement to represent your message.In terms of brevity, you are best sticking to a statement of seven words or less, since it can be hard to fit long text on a protest sign. You can say a lot in seven words!At the March on Washington in 1963, protestors held signs saying, “we demand an end to bias now.” These seven words convey the urgent need to end racial bias in America.

, You may want to convey your message with a symbol, which can be used either in place of text or alongside a written message. You could make your sign really popular by using an eye-popping and recognizable symbol, such as a peace sign!The peace sign was designed by British artist Gerald Holtom. It was originally designed for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).
The symbol for the female sex is often used in women’s marches and feminist campaigns.
The equal sign can be used to represent equality.
The fist can be used as a symbol for social justice.
Symbols that go well together can be combined.

, Protests often have popular slogans and statements that are repeated on many signs. To stand out from the crowd, you should personalize your statement!For instance, if you are a fan of a particular show or film, draw on your fan wisdom to make a political statement.
If you identify as queer, transgendered, female, working class or something else, connect your statement to this particular identity or intersection of identities.

, After composing your statement but prior to writing it on the sign, you may want to get some feedback from friends. They could give you really helpful advice. If you get critical feedback, try rewriting the message to improve whatever is missing, such as clarity, brevity, wit, force or personal resonance.If you are protesting with friends, you could also ask whether your statement goes well with the signs they will be carrying. People often read signs in relation to one another, especially when protestors stand next to one another.

, Use a pencil to draft your message on the sign. If you have images or symbols on your sign, layout the text so that there is space for images. Try to use large sized fonts so that people will be able to read it from a distance.You could design your sign in Microsoft Word or Adobe Illustrator, print it out and use the printout as a guide when writing the message on the sign.
If you have to start writing the letters really small on the edge of the sign, people are unlikely to read it.

, Start by outlining the text. Then, fill in the text with darker colors that contrast with the background color or imagery on the sign.Paint markers work great for writing text on protest signs. You can get paint markers at art supply stores.
Repeat this process on the other side of the poster board. If you are expecting your protest to receive any form of media attention, you should design a double sided sign.

, Some of the best protest signs use font colors that reinforce the message they are trying to convey. Dark colors are often used to emphasize the gravity of a message. A rainbow of colors can be used to represent diversity, such as the use of a full rainbow of colors to represent the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community and pride parades. , Consider your font or text color in relation to the background design of your poster. For instance, you may want to use black text against a white background or blue text against an orange background, as opposed to yellow text against an orange background., The writing should be reinforced by the image or symbol used on the sign and vice versa. Some of the best protest signs use imagery that supports the text written on the sign, such as the use of the symbol for female alongside a text saying ‘Women’s Day March.’, Consider using two or three colors instead of incorporating every color you can imagine. Some of the most successful protest signs use a very limited color palete, so think about which two or three colors will work best for your message and keep it simple.Artist Lorraine Schneider designed a protest sign with only yellow, orange and black. The sign included an image of a fragile flower and read ‘War is not healthy for children and other living things.’ It became famous during the Vietnam War protests., If you are feeling ambitious or are more artistically inclined, you could try mixed media or even three dimensional designs.Foamcore tends to work better for attaching three dimensional objects to the surface of a protest sign.For instance, you could attach a three dimensional globe to a foamcore poster at a climate justice protest.

, If you are in a rush, you could always download an existing poster design. Some organizations involved in the protest you are attending may have some preexisting poster designs available on their websites. You could also alter an existing poster design with your own text., Lean your sign against a wall. Walk back ten or twenty feet and see if you can read it. If you can’t read it from a distance, the text may be too small. If you can’t discern the symbols on your sign, you may want to make them larger.You could also ask a friend to hold your sign up when testing for legibility.

, Depending on the message you are trying to convey, you may want to add some decorations. Glitter, sparkles and other eye catching decorations can help to make your protest sign more attractive.

, The material for the poster board is important to consider, especially if you have to travel to the protest. The main options are foamcore, corrugated plastic and poster board. Regardless of the material chosen, you will need two boards to make the sign.Poster board is a popular and cheap option. The disadvantage is that it is easily damaged and bent, which can make your sign hard to read.
Foamcore is a sturdy option if you want to use mixed media or incorporate any three dimensional elements into your design. Foamcore is a little more expensive than poster board.
Corrugated plastic sign blanks are very sturdy and can be obtained at most hardware stores, since they are also used for real estate signs. If you use this material, you will have to attach the sides together with tape., In order to hold your sign at the protest, you will need to attach some type of handle. The main options are 3’’ by 1’’ lumber, dowel, paint sticks and easel backs. You will be securing it to the poster boards with tape, staples, nails or self-sticking glue.Easel backs are a self-sticking attachment. You can attach one on either side of the sign and fold out the tabs to use as handles. They are self-sticking so you don’t need extra adhesive. These are great for both poster board and foamcore.
Single pieces of 3’’ by 1’’ wood are often used, since you can easily staple or nail the base to a single piece of wood. You will need staples or nails to attach this type of handle to your poster boards. If you are using a heavier base like corrugated plastic, this can be a good option. However, wood is not permitted at many protests.
Dowel is sometimes used, which is a little easier to hold for long periods in comparison to 3’’ by 1’’ wood. This is a good option for corrugated plastic sign blanks. You will need staples or nails. However, wood is not permitted at many protests.

, Place one of the two poster boards on the ground. Then, place your handle in the middle of the sign. Attach the handle to the base of the sign using tape, staples or nails. Then, place the second poster board on top.


Alternately, you could just attach one poster board to the handle. You will have a one-sided protest sign.
Normally, protest signs have things written on both sides. If you are on a budget, or one of the boards is torn up, it is very simple to make a sign with only one side.

, You may want to wrap the handle with some tape to make it easier to hold for long periods of time. Wrap hockey tape or electrical tape around the handle to make it easier to hold.If you have a hard time making the handle comfortable to hold, you may benefit from a plan B. For instance, you could attach a string to the top of the sign. When you get tired of holding the handle, you can put the string around your neck."

Roll the scroll.",How to Make a Scroll1," The paper should be longer than a regular sheet of paper.It needs to wrap around enough to look like a scroll. Your paper needs to be thinner than the dowels you use, so you may have to cut some off of the edges. There are many different types of paper that can be used to make a good scroll.Two sheets of regular white paper taped together end to end
Brown paper grocery bagParchment Paper
Rice paper
Papyrus paper;
, Dowels are round rods made of wood, metal, or plastic. Scrolls are typically made using wooden dowels. Dowels come in different lengths, so you might have to cut them to the right size for your paper. You want the dowels to be about 1 to 2 inches longer than the paper. The thinner the dowel, the tighter you can wind up your scroll. You can choose the thickness of the dowel you would like to use.⅜ inch
¼ inch
½ inch
1 inch

, Decide what you want the scroll to say or display on the inside. If you don’t know what you want it to look like, some ideas are hieroglyphs, chinese characters, or a still life picture. Choose a method to apply your script or artwork to the scroll.Painting
Printing
Coloring
Calligraphy
Handwritten or drawn

, You can assemble a scroll using one dowel at the top of the paper or two dowels on the top and bottom of the paper. Use a strong glue to secure the dowels to the edges of the paper. Press firmly and hold for a few seconds to ensure the dowel is adequately attached to the paper.


Make sure the glue extends the entire length of the edge of the paper.
You can also wrap the paper around the dowel and glue it to itself. If you decide to do this method, make sure you get the paper wrapped extremely tight around the dowel so it doesn’t have room to slide around.

, Embellishments can make the scroll look authentic and give it that extra flair. There are many ways to embellish your scroll and make it unique.


Attach a ribbon to the top for hanging.
Add an ornament to the ends of each dowel, like a wooden wheel. This would be easier to do before attaching the paper onto the dowels.
Use ribbon, string, or twine to tie the scroll together after rolling.

, There are two different ways of rolling your scroll.


If you have a one dowel scroll, roll the paper around the dowel until the entire paper is rolled. Secure the paper with a ribbon, string, or twine by tying it around the scroll.
With a two dowel scroll, roll both sides of the paper around the dowels until they meet in the middle. You can also secure this type of scroll with ribbon, string, or twine.

Put your design on the fabric.,
Make your scroll hangable.",How to Make a Scroll2," Fabric scrolls are more durable than paper so they are a great option if you want your scroll to last a long time. Different fabrics convey different looks, like antique or modern, so choose one that matches your intent. Light colored fabrics with no prints or patterns work best for scrolls with artwork or script on them. Many fabrics are nice options for scroll making:Muslin
Burlap
Lightweight canvas
Cotton
Silk

, Choose thickness of the dowels you would like to use. Heavier fabrics should use a thicker dowel, and lighter fabrics can use a thinner one. You may have to cut the dowels to the width you would like your scroll, making sure they are 1 to 2 inches longer than you want the actual fabric of the scroll to be.

, Determine how wide and long you want your scroll to be. Make sure the fabric is 1 to 2 inches less wide than the dowel size. Use sharp, fabric scissors to get the best cut when cutting your fabric.

, The best way to attach the dowels to the fabric is by sewing a tight pocket in the fabric for the dowel to slip into.


Place your fabric face down.
Wrap the top edge of the fabric around one dowel, making sure the fabric extends at least ½ inch beyond the dowel.
Use a pencil to draw a light line marking where the edge of the fabric is.
Remove the dowel, and sew the edge of the fabric so that it is folded back creating a pocket. Make sure the edge is lined up with the pencil line. Hand sew the fabric for the best results
Repeat the steps with the bottom edge of the fabric
Slide the dowels into the pockets.

, The best way to get your design on the fabric is to paint it on with fabric or craft paint. Another option is to silk screen your design onto the fabric. You can also draw the design with permanent markers or even print the design with a printer.If you decide to print the design on the fabric, make sure you check to see if your printer is able to print on fabric.

, Attach ribbon, string or twine to the top of your scroll so it can hang on your wall for all to admire. You can attach it by tying the two ends around the part of the top dowel that hangs beyond the fabric. This is an excellent way to attach the ribbon because it also prevents the fabric from slipping off of the dowel.Another way to attach the string is to glue it to the top of the fabric.

Decide on making a paper or fabric scroll.,
Put your artwork on the scroll.,
Discolor with coffee or tea.,
Finish the look.,
Assemble the scroll.",How to Make a Scroll3," You can make both a paper and a fabric scroll look old and ancient. The choice depends on what you are doing with the scroll. For example, party invitations would be best as paper scrolls, but hanging art and gifts might be better as fabric scrolls.


The process of making the scroll look old should be done prior to assembling the scroll.

, Paint, draw, or print your artwork on the scroll.


When you make the paper or fabric look old, some colors of your artwork may change.
The best artwork color to use is black if you want an authentic antique look.

, Use a foam paintbrush to paint brewed black coffee or tea onto the fabric or paper. Coffee will be much darker than tea.Dip the paintbrush in the coffee or tea and gently squeeze some excess out.
Paint the coffee or tea all over. Use different stroke angles and different levels of saturation.
Try not to make it uniform. Having some areas darker than others is good for achieving an antiquated look.

, A few steps can finish the antique look on your paper or fabric.


For paper, after putting the coffee on, you can put the paper in the oven at the lowest setting for about 5 minutes, or until it is dry. You can also carefully burn the edges of the paper by holding a candle up to the edge of the paper and then blowing it out before it burns too far in. Repeat this process around the perimeter of the paper.For fabric, after the fabric has dried, cut the edges to fray them. This will only work with some types of fabric, like burlap. If you have a fabric that won’t fray, try painting extra coffee or tea around parts of the edges to make them darker.

, When the fabric or paper is completely dry, you can begin to assemble the scroll.


Attach the dowels with glue or by sewing.
Add embellishments like a hanging ribbon or wooden ornament on the dowels.
Roll the scroll or hang it on the wall.

Wax the final project.",How to Make a Sign1," The most important thing you will need is a large piece of plywood. The size of the sign all depends on how far away your customers will be when they see it. If you are far away from the road, or the main entrance into the plaza, you might want to get a larger piece of plywood. Either way, stick with one that is at least 2 by 3 feet (0.61 m × 0.91 m). Here are some other materials you will need:


Base coat. Because the wooden sign will look ""antique,"" the base coat will show through to outer coat of paint. This means that the base coat should be a different, high contrast color as compared to the outer coat of paint. Pick the color you want the base coat to be, and buy it at your local hardware store. You will want to buy acrylic paint.
Outer coat. Once more, you want a high contrast color compared to your base coat.
Electric sander
Large and small paintbrushes
Vaseline
Tape
Ballpoint pen
Minwax
Steel wool;
, You will want the piece of wood to be wide enough so that people can see the sign from far away, but thin enough so that it is easy to hang. Use a piece of sandpaper, or an electric sander, and go around the whole board. Sand the board in small circular motions, taking off the excess bumps and chips. Make sure to get the edges as well. Do this until the board is smooth to the touch., Mix your paint when you get it home. Use a medium sized brush, not a roller, to paint your board. Work in left to right motions, always working with the grain of the board. Make sure to do this outside so that the fumes from the paint don't build up. You may want to use a pair of gloves as well. Wear an old t-shirt when you paint so you don't mess up your nice clothes., You want the base color to show through after you paint the top coat. Adding Vaseline will make it very easy to remove chips off the top coat. After the bottom coat dries, apply the Vaseline wherever you want to, but focus on edges and sides. Don't put on large smear marks, but merely 1-2 inch long marks that are skinny.Make sure to leave the vaseline on the board as you begin to paint the next coat.

, This coat should be in sharp contrast to the bottom coat. For instance, use a green top coat, and a red bottom coat. Buy the paint at your local hardware store and mix it at home. Use a medium sized brush and paint from left to right. It's okay if some of the Vaseline smears as you paint on the coat. Do this outside so that the fumes from the paint don't build up. Wear some gloves when you paint, as well as an old t-shirt., Use a word processing program such as Microsoft Word, or Google Docs. Set the orientation to ""landscape"" and adjust the font size accordingly, depending on the size of your sign. Print out the sheets of paper on your home printer. Place them over the top of the board to see if the size is correct. You may have to reprint the letters using a different size and font.If you are artistically inclined, you can paint the letters on by hand.

, Tape the printed out lettered sheets onto the board using blue painter's tape. Make sure that the design is centered the way you like. Use a ballpoint pen and trace over the letters. Press down with some pressure, so the design transfers onto the board. Once you are done tracing, remove the papers and throw them away., Use an acrylic paint and go over the outline you just created. You can paint inside of the letters as well, using a small paint brush. This would also be a great time to add any miscellaneous designs you want, like vines, swirls, or different shapes. You will want to use a color that is different from both the base and top coats. White is the best option if your other two coats are darker. If the bottom coats are lighter, use black, or dark brown., Take a piece of sandpaper or steel wool, and gently brush over the top of the board. Do this after the paint from all three coats are dry. You do not want to press too hard, otherwise you could wind up taking too much of the top coat off. With the Vaseline underneath, the paint will come off very easily. Focus on the areas you remember putting the Vaseline at., In order to keep your sign safe from weather conditions, you will need to wax it. Use a furniture wax like Minwax, or any other brand that you find at your local hardware store. After you open the can, take a medium sized brush and dip it in, taking small amounts of wax at a time. Work from left to right, using small strokes, always in line with the grain of the wood. Make sure to get the sides and edges, as well as the front.After the wax dries, you may want to add another coat, depending on how well you coated the board the first time.
Every year or so consider applying another layer of wax to keep your board safe.

Don’t give up.",How to Make Lost Pet Signs," As rushed and panicked as you might feel during a lost pet search, it is important to take the time to find a recent, high-resolution, colored photograph of your pet. If possible, choose a picture that clearly shows your pet’s most defining markings and features.If the picture is not already digitized, be sure to get it scanned, saved, and loaded onto your computer.
If you don’t have access to a personal scanner, take the original to a local printing shop (like Kinko’s or FedEx) or a major pharmacy with photo scanning services (like Walmart, CVS, or Shopper’s).;
, Try to pin down the approximate date, time, and location of when and where your pet was last seen.


Make note of what your pet was wearing, such as a collar or bandana, at the time it disappeared.
Finally, create a shorthand list of information that includes your pet’s name, age, breed, gender (including spay/neuter status), size/weight, color, and markings, along with your contact information.

, You may also want to call the microchip company to alert customer service of your pet’s “lost” status., Have your pet’s photograph and your quick list of information ready if you are able to file a lost pet report. This will jump-start your search, as you begin designing your sign.

, It's best to use a plain text, like Times New Roman or Arial, in bolded black to help ensure that your poster is easy to read and understand.


There are a number of free “lost pet” templates you can find and download using the search terms, “lost pet sign,” on Google. Some websites will create a sign for you – all you have to do is enter your pet’s information., In big, bold, text at the top of the sign, write “LOST” followed by the type of pet you are searching for, such as “LOST DOG” or “LOST CAT.”

, Using the template as a guide, enlarge and center the photo. For the name, use the same font style and size as the heading.
, Add your pet’s logistical information along with any extra physical or personality descriptions you feel are important to your pet’s identification. This information should be in a slightly smaller font size than that of the heading.


Be sure to include a description of features that are not noticeable in the photograph.
Consider a description like this: “Mac is a very friendly, 2-year-old, neutered, Jack Russell/Yorkie Terrier mix with a white and brown face. He has a white body with a big brown spot on his back. He is approximately 12 pounds and was last seen on March 3, 2017 at 3pm in his family’s backyard on Elm Street in Plymouth, Michigan. He was wearing a blue collar and he may come to his name, ‘Mac,’ when called. His microchip ID# is H2DRSTYL.

, Place this information below your pet's physical description. Enlarge, bold-face, and center your number and/or email address, so that they catch attention.


For example: “Please help me locate my best friend. He is dearly missed. If you have found or sighted Mac, please call or email Paul Starr at: 999-999-9999 OR macsdad@wikihow.com (centered). Any information is helpful, thank you.”
Some people feel uncomfortable providing a phone number on a public poster, but email can be slow or delayed and not everyone has an email account. Although it may be hassle, you can always change your phone number, once your lost pet is retrieved.

, Rewards are not necessary, but they do provide incentive for a swift reunion, especially if you think your pet may have been stolen. Of course, it is impossible to put monetary value on your pet, so try to configure a reasonable reward based on your personal budget and what you can comfortably offer.


If theft is a real concern and your pet is a purebred or highly popularized mix-breed, you may need to offer a larger amount of money, in order to entice return.
Your “REWARD” label should always be listed in large, bold, black letters to catch attention.

, They should feature your name, phone number, and/or email. Don’t forget to pre-cut the strips before posting the fliers.

, It is important to create a sign free of typos and misinformation. A missing pet is a highly stressful and emotional situation, so you may want to ask a family member or close friend to double-check your sign.

, To protect your original formatting and to ensure that your information remains intact, it is best to save your poster as a PDF file.


For fast, high quality printing at an affordable price, you may want to use the services of local mainstream printing companies, like Kinko’s or FedEx stores, especially if your home printer does not have high volume printing capacity.
White or eye-catching, neon-colored paper is usually the best paper choice for your sign.
If you plan to post your sign outdoors, consider getting some of the posters laminated to protect against the weather.

, Places should include pet-friendly organizations, like the pet shelters and veterinarian offices you contacted in Part 1. Pet shops, coffee shops, library lobbies, grocery stores, diners, and dog parks near the vicinity of where your pet was last seen are also good places to post signs.


Don’t forget to post your sign on social media, specifically on local pet-oriented Facebook pages.
Be sure to make your social media posts “public,” so that they can be viewed and shared by others.

, Family and friends are great helpers when it comes to posting signs and quickly spreading the word about your lost pet because they likely love and cherish your pet as much as you do!

, When your pet is missing, time will seem to drag on forever, but a successful search can sometimes take days, weeks, or even months. Try to remain patient, polite, persistent, and optimistic in your search. If your pet has been sighted in a new area, be sure to keep your “lost pet” signs and posts as updated as possible. "

They are usually around 12-18 inches tall and cost around eight dollars a piece. You can also use paper mache letters, but they will not withstand outside weather conditions like wood can. You will want to get all the letters of your business name, or the slogan you use. You can also get letters to create phrases, such as ""Ten Percent Off"" or ""Buy One Get One.""Here are some other materials you will need:


Acrylic paint of your choosing
Large and small paintbrushes
3-4 plastic place mats
Scissors
Spray paint primer
Silver spray paint
Electric drill
Pencil
Stringed bulb lights
Super glue
Nails
Cork board

, Buy some acrylic paint from your nearby hardware store. Stir the paint when you get home, and apply it with a medium sized brush. Go from right to left, left to right, always with the grain of the wood. Make sure you get both the front of the letters and the sides. You will want to do this outside so the fumes don't build up. Make sure you are wearing gloves and an old t-shirt as you paint.You can create a ""vintage"" look by dabbing on darker colors to the edges. Use a small piece of foam and dab it in the dark paint. Gently press and rub it around the edges of your wood.

, You will want to buy a few plastic place mats. Measure, with a ruler, every 2 inches and make a mark on the short side of the place mat. Use scissors to cut out the 2 inch wide strips, going longways. If you want to, you can take a piece of sandpaper or steel wool, and run down the edges of your plastic strips. This will smooth them out, and make them soft to the touch., This is not the step where you attach the strips to your letters. You first need to get the form of the letters. Take one strip and wrap it around one of the edges of your letters. Press firmly so that all the curves and corners form in your strip. Make a mark with a pencil where that strip ended and place that strip to the side. Grab another strip, and start about 1/2 inch before that mark. Continue until each of your strips has been formed.When you set the strips to the side, let them stay in the bended positions. Remember which strip goes where.

, You will first want to spray the plastic pieces with a spray primer. Then, once the primer is dry, paint on a black bottom layer of spray paint. Move the can left to right as you hold down the nozzle. Make sure to get the entire surface area, as well as the edges. Then get a can of silver spray paint. Hold the can as far away as possible, and lightly spray the pieces. You just want the plastic strips to get a light coating of silver spray paint.In between the primer, black, and silver coats, wait for the plastic strips to dry completely.
Do this outside so that the fumes don't build up, and so you don't get paint everywhere. You might want to wear gloves and goggles when you are spray painting.

, Decide on where, and how many, holes you want. For an 18 inch letter, you will want about 10 holes. The important thing is that the holes are equidistant from one another, and are centered along the width of the letters. Mark where you want each hole with a light pencil mark. Drill each mark, all the way through. Wipe away any excess sawdust with a soft cloth.Make sure the drill bit you use is at least the size of the largest part of the light socket. When you insert the lights later on, you want to make sure they fit into the holes.
Determine the number of holes you want by how many lights you have available. If you only have a few, do fewer holes in each letter. Remember, you will need a relatively high number of bulbs to create the effect of the marquee sign.

, Wipe down the edges of your letters with a clean cloth. Put a consistent strip of super glue on one section of a letter. Take the respective plastic strip and press it to the letter. Wait 15 seconds before you release it. Make sure that you are applying pressure equally to the entire strip. Continue on, until all of the strips have been glued on.There will be some overlapping, depending on how much you overlapped when you originally bent the strips.
If you notice the strips are already coming off in certain areas, apply a few drops of super glue behind the loose areas. Reapply pressure for another 15 seconds.

, You will want to buy at least two sets of globe string lights, available at most local hardware, and arts and crafts stores. Take the lightbulbs out, leaving just the string of sockets. Insert them from the back, starting with your first letter. As you are inserting each socket, apply a small amount of duct tape, or electrical tape, to the back of each socket. This will keep the sockets from popping out.When you run out of one line of sockets, simply attach the next line and continue on.
Once you have finished putting in the sockets, go ahead and attach the bulbs on the front side of your sign. This will give your sockets some extra security as well.

, You can use a peg board, a cork board, or just a regular piece of wood. Lay your letters onto the board to determine where you will need nails. Insert them into the peg/cork boards, or hammer them into the piece of wood. Now just plug in your socket lines, hang your sign up, and it's ready to go."

Take the document to a local printer.",How to Make a Sign3," Measure the distance from which your audience will be viewing your sign. Go to certain spots where people pass by, and notice how much you can see from that distance. Scout out other business signs in the nearby area to see how large they are making their signs. If you are a store far away from the road, you might want to make the sign larger, and vice versa. Make the text and any graphics on your sign large enough people can read them from a distance., In order to make a vinyl sign, you will need to have a word processor, like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. You will want to change the orientation of the document to ""landscape."" If your word processor has specific functions as a sign maker, you can use that as well. There are also numerous websites online which have programs specifically designed for making signs.Remember that you will not be able to print these signs at home. So, if you use an online website to create your design, you will have to save it to your computer.
Make sure to buy a USB flash drive. That way when you have the design saved to your computer, you can transfer it to the USB and take it in to your nearest printing business.

, Sans-serif fonts are good choices, such as Helvetica, Arial or Verdana. They are clear fonts that don't incorporate extra curves or decorative aspects to the letters. Some sign makers incorporate several fonts into their signs. That's a good idea as long as you use the fonts to emphasize specific points or copy on the sign. It is not advised to use more than three fonts on your sign. In order to break up your text, feel free to include italics, bold and underlines in your copy., When light and dark colors are used next to each other, it creates an attention-drawing image that not only is pleasing to the eye, but is also easy to read. For instance, white and black is the most obvious light/dark color combination, but other combinations include orange/blue, gray/red or cream/dark green. While using contrasting colors for your sign, attempt to stay true to your organization's logo., Use action verbs within your phrases and headlines. Your copy should direct the reader or tell the reader what to do. Examples are ""Come see us!"" or ""Buy now!"" If you are attempting to target a younger audience, use slang, or shorter words. Adult audiences prefer larger words and a more sophisticated vocabulary., Remember that viewers read your sign from top to bottom. The most important information should be toward the top of your sign in order for your reader to absorb it. If words are randomly placed throughout the sign, it may be hard for your audience to read it. The name of your business should also be included in the message. In case your audience can't make it into the store, you want them to know what to search for online., Do this for a specific reason. Don't just interject them for fun or because you like them. They should help fill in space, tell something about your business or product, and help viewers understand your message. For example, if you are a flower shop, include vines to underline words, and place flowers within some of your letters. If you have a business logo, this would be the time to add it in. Remember, the simpler the better. You do not want to clutter your sign with pictures.

, Tell them how to get to your location or how to contact you (email, phone number, etc.) You might also want to include, in smaller print, the hours your business is open. An arrow also helps lead your potential customers in the appropriate direction. If this sign winds up being miles away from the actual store, include the number of miles it will take to get there., Go to ""File"" and click ""Save."" Plug in your flash drive to the USB port on your computer. You then want to go to your list of files on your computer, and find the saved document. Click and drag it over to where it says the name of your flash drive. Simply let go, and the file will download onto your flash drive. Click ""Eject"" and then safely remove the flash drive from the USB port., Big name companies like FedEx and UPS offer large scale printing services. You may also have someone you know who has a large scale printer that you can use. Give them the flash drive, let them know the dimensions of your sign, and they will print it for you."

Add audio and video files if appropriate.,
Assemble a rough draft of your poster.,
Store your poster safely.,
Consider having a professional printing service create your poster.,
Make a ""Back in 5 Minutes"" sign that can hang next to your poster.,
Bring any additional reference materials you may need.",How to Make a Scientific Poster," Scientific papers may have lengthy titles. Shorten yours so that it adequately conveys what your research is about and your experimental method but takes up no more than 2 lines at the top of your poster.


If you can, make your title ""catchy"" so it will attract interest from passersby, but don't try to make it funny.;
, Place your research in the context of previous work, then introduce an interesting hypothesis.


Keep your introduction to under 200 words so it can be read quickly. You can add a photograph or other visual aid to make it more interesting and eye-catching.
Don't clutter your introduction with definitions, background information or anything else that will only bog down the narrative and cause passersby to lose interest.

, Briefly, describe your method, taking no more than 200 words and using illustrations if they're helpful. Flow charts are especially good for this section.


Leave off abstracts. The content of poster should create a visual abstract of your scientific experiment instead of being a copy of your report.Know your audience. Just as you would when you write a paper, make the information included on your poster will give the appropriate depth of information. It should be understandable even to a reader that is not specialized in the same particular field., Do this with 2 brief paragraphs of text and a clearly labeled table so passersby can understand your results at a glance. Most will skip the other sections and just study your results, so take extra care with this section.


In the first paragraph, state whether your experiment worked or not.
In the second paragraph, analyze your results in terms of your hypothesis.

, In about 200 words, tell the reader why your research was important and relevant, both to the field of study and the real world.


Remind the reader of your result and whether your initial hypothesis was supported.
Try to convince your reader that your results are conclusive and interesting.

, Cite any journal articles you read that support your research or any research that is referenced in your study. Use the correct format prescribed for researchers in your field to note your sources.

, Don't list the titles of people who supported you, but do list what specific assistance or support they provided.


If there was any actual or potential conflict of interest or commitment regarding your research, list it in this section.

, Provide your name, email address, website if you have one, and a place where readers can download a copy of your poster.


You may want to create a handout-sized version of your poster with your information so your audience can go back to review your study later and can easily follow up with you at a later date.

, You can figure out the size you need by how much text in your report, the number of images or graphs you plan to include.If your report is under 5 pages and has less than 7 pictures or graphs a 36X48 should work. If your report has more information you can adjust your size accordingly.


Check with any poster size requirements for your event. You may have space limitations for your display, and sometimes your poster size may be restricted.
Be sure you have adequate supplies to display your poster.Usually, display stands or clips may be provided for you on site, but it is best to check ahead to make sure you bring everything your need.

, Many students try to include everything in their research paper, but this is a serious mistake. You can leave off the abstract and Large areas of text tend to dissolve into visually cramped, boring, gray spaces that are intimidating to an audience.Posters that have too much text on them will be passed over in favor of those that are easier to read.


Use columns to organize and structure your presentation in a logical manner.Clearly label any sections, graphs or images.

, If you know how to use Powerpoint, Keynote or design programs like Photoshop, you can make some stunning visual aids that can combine your text and graphics into a professional looking display.


Once you've created all your sections and illustrations, transfer the files to portable document format (PDF) so you can be certain how they will look when printed.
Use either PC or Mac platform for everything so you don't run into compatibility problems when moving files between the two.

, Check your graphs, charts and other illustrations to make sure a reader can make out the details at that distance. Take another couple steps back. Your poster title should be readable from 10 feet (3 m) away.


Use a large font for all text. Paragraph text should be between 18-24 pt. font.You can use a different font style for titles to help distinguish them, but otherwise, you should keep the font consistent.Use color to attract the eyes of your audience. 2-3 colors can help your various titles to stand out. Avoid adding too many, though, so it doesn't become overwhelming.
Avoid using 3D illustrations unless it's absolutely necessary. If you do use 3D illustrations, print stereoscopic versions on the poster and provide readers with 3D glasses.
Don't settle for poor-quality images. Go to the trouble of finding image files that will still look sharp when blown up to place on your photo. You may have to take your own digital photos.

, There are a number of ways to do this, from using the devices found inside recordable greeting cards to attaching your personal media player to your poster.


You can place a quick response (QR) code on your poster that readers with smart phones and similar devices can scan to access a website that will show photographs, play sound files or display other media on their devices.

, Evaluate how the information is organized and if the poster is visually appealing.


Ask for feedback from fellow students and teachers. Use the feedback to create the final version.

, You may want to purchase a cardboard tube to store and protect your poster until your presentation. You don't want all your hard work to go to waste.


If you don't want to purchase a container, consider rolling the poster up and wrapping a rubber band loosely around each end to keep it closed until your presentation.

, You can use a local printing service or find one online that specializes in creating scientific posters.


If you are traveling to a scientific gathering, you can have a printing service create your poster and have it waiting for you when you arrive. Conference organizers often make agreements with printing services to make and deliver posters as a courtesy to students.

, For many events, a presenter should be present to answer client questions or give additional information as needed. It's a good idea to have a sign on hand in case you need to step away to get a drink or use the restroom. This can help reduce the chance you miss any interested visitors.

, A good poster may still not include every bit of relevant information. You should be prepared to answer any questions with all your available information. Bring note cards that you can refer to in a pinch. You may also want to get a binder to carry along any other information that might be requested.

Write an eye-catching headline.,
Make the most relevant information largest.,
Use bulleted lists to convey a series of information.,
Include a call to action near the bottom of the poster.",How to Make a Poster That Stands Out1," If your poster will be among a sea of others, it should say something that will draw people in. Come up with a funny or interesting headline and make it a focal point of the poster. If your headline makes people laugh, they will want to look closer and see what the poster is all about.The headline should be large and might be a different color than the rest of the text to make it distinct.
A catchy title might be something like “What part of the chicken does the nugget come from?” It’s not a completely original question, but it’s enough to interest people.;
, List all of the information the poster needs to cover, and rank how important each piece of information is. Details about an event, the topic of a research paper, or the primary services that a business offers are vital pieces of information for a poster to include. Make these points large and easy to read.Posters serve many functions, so there’s not an exact rule for what is most important. Decide on the reason for the poster and convey that reason as the largest part of the poster.
Don’t use too many sizes of text. Two to four sizes will convey the various ranks of the content. Headlines and titles should be largest, specific event details should be second largest, and extra info should be smallest.

, Your poster needs to get across all of the important information in an organized manner. Information like a list of items to bring to an event, materials used for an experiment, or non-profit organizations that a business supports fit perfectly into a bulleted list.Use the standard round or square bullet, or make the bullet a small icon that relates to the event. For music events, use notes or guitars. For a science fair poster, use beakers or microscopes.
Put the most important information at the top of the list and less important information further down the list.
Don’t go overboard with the number of bullets. Five or less is usually a good number, depending on the information. If more than five bullets are necessary, then don’t use the bullet format.

, After people see all of the important information the poster needs to convey, direct them to an action they should take. This could be to come out to a concert, call a business, or donate to the charity described. Giving viewers a specific action to take tells them what to do after seeing the poster.A poster presenting research could offer a few questions for further investigation or direct people to other similar research if they are interested in learning more about the topic.

",How to Make a Poster2," Making a poster by hand can be a lot of fun, and there are no real rules to follow. We'll show you a couple things that will help your poster look great.

, When you are creating a poster by hand, there's no real limit to how big it can be.

, A little bit down from the top, draw a line across the paper. This will be where you'll put your title. Do the same a little bit up from the bottom. This is where you'll put information about things you want people to do next: a number to call, a date for an event, or a ""call to action"" like ""Buy our cookies!""

, Using your pencil, lightly draw the words in the heading.


For example, if you're doing a poster for Earth Day, you might put something like that at the top.
By drawing out the letters with light pencil first, you'll be able to adjust so that the size is right. If it's too big or too small, erase and start again. This is just a guideline, so don't worry about making it perfect.

, Do the same on the bottom—lightly draw in pencil what you want to say on the bottom, using the line as a guide.

, Whatever the primary idea of your poster is, it goes in the middle. For our Earth Day poster, we'll do a picture of earth. The same thing goes if it's a student council poster (your picture) or any other topic. You may have a collage or a single picture, so just sketch in lightly where things will go.

, Now that you have your poster all planned out, and you're sure it looks like how you want it to look, carefully draw in the letters with marker or colored pencil or crayon—however you want to add color to your text.


Remember that very light colors on a light background will be hard to read.
If you're doing a collage, cut out and glue on any pictures you will be using.

, This was a general guideline, so feel free to experiment. Most of all, have fun making your posters.

, The default layout is landscape, but since posters are usually portrait, let's go ahead and change this.

, The default layout is usually just a title and subtitle, but other options include a title with an image, a title and two images, and blank. This example uses the picture with caption layout.

, PowerPoint has ready-made themes that can be used as-is, or customized.


If you don’t like the themes available, more are available online. Note that you can also use a theme as a template and then heavily modify it.

, Click within the content boxes to add images, charts, or even drawing boxes for you to draw inside.


If you're adding a photo, browse to a saved photo on your computer and click Okay or Insert.

, Click in the appropriate box and add text. Don't forget, this is a key selling feature, so make your title catchy, big, and bold.

, Click in the appropriate box (or insert a new text box) and add text. Keep it clear and concise but convey as much of the important information as you can, including details, what, when, and where.

, Edit text, adjust the font size or spacing, change colors, sizes, or borders, etc. Print the completed poster!

Fire up the computer.,
Fire up Photoshop.,
Choose a background color.,
Add pictures or graphics.,
Choose a memorable main message.,
Add the secondary information.,
Proofread the poster.,
Put up your posters.",How to Make a Poster4," By far the easiest and most effective way to create a poster is with your computer and a graphics application such as Photoshop, which we'll use for our first example. If you don't have Photoshop, there are a number of other alternatives, including GIMP and Pixlr, both of which are free. While the steps here are specific to Photoshop, most graphics applications will have the same, or similar functionality.

, When it's fully loaded, create a new document, and use the following specifications:


Width: 8 inches (20.3 cm)
Height: 10.5 inches (26.6)
Resolution: 300pixels/inch
Color Mode: CMYK
Background Contents: White
What we've set up is a page the size of a standard letter-sized piece of paper, at 300dpi (pixels per inch) so that it will be nice and crisp when it's printed. We chose CMYK for the Color Mode, because printers are designed to use those ink colors, whereas monitors are designed to use RGB. If your graphics app does not support CMYK, don't worry—the colors you print out will not be exactly the same as on screen, but they'll still look great.
Note that if you have access to a large-format printer, like the kind you can find at most print shops like Kinkos, you don't have to stop at normal paper size. Give the print shop a call and ask them what is the maximum paper size they can print, and size your document accordingly.

, Make it bright and eye-catching, but not so bright that it will overwhelm the message. Don't worry if it doesn't work—you can always change it later. If the poster is for a particular event, you can use a color scheme to match. For example, your school colors might be maroon and gold, and gold would make a nice, bright background.

, If you're not confident of your drawing or illustrating skills, look online for images in the public domain that you can use or alter for your work.

, Place this message in large lettering that will attract attention. More detailed information can also be added in smaller lettering.


Make the poster easy to read. Consider your font color and size, and whatever you do, do not mix more than 2 or 3 different fonts together.

, Now that you're got their attention, it's time for the ""fine print,"" as they say. If there's a secondary message, make that as strong as the headline. It may be a longer phrase, so you may have to shrink the font a bit. But keep it concise. The fewer things your poster tries to convey, the stronger the message!


Notice as the text got smaller, there were fewer embellishments. At top, there is a strong yellow border. In the ""Wear a Tie Week"" section, the font is smaller, and the border is much thinner. Finally, the dates have no border or shadow at all.
Also not the spacing of the fonts: everything is centered left to right, and within their sections top to bottom. It's important to keep things aligned for a smooth, professional appearance. Of course, if that's not your goal—go crazy!

, Have your information checked by a fresh set of eyes, such as a friend or teacher. (If it’s a professional poster, find someone with expertise in the subject. It might be someone who works or volunteers in a non-government organization or public office, for example.) Be sure to spell-check the information as well.


Include an address or other contact information. If the poster is directing people to an event, be sure to include the event address. If it’s meant to be informational, include contact details (such as a phone number or an e-mail address) so that people can learn more.

, Try to find locations where lots of people will pass by but where they will not get lost in the crowd.

"
"
Leave blank space around your main design.,
Incorporate images seamlessly.,
Avoid large blocks of text.,
Choose vivid colors.",How to Make a Poster That Stands Out2," You may be tempted to fill the entire space of a poster from edge to edge, but this causes the poster to be cluttered. People are more likely to pass by a poster that looks cluttered than one that has a clean, eye-catching focus.It’s okay to make your poster elaborate, but don’t fill the entire space of the poster.

, If your poster is for a club, a store, a band, or anything else that has a recognizable logo, be sure to put it on your poster. Use images to enhance the poster but don’t let them overwhelm the poster.This principle applies to slogans, characters, or symbols as well. Anything that people would recognize as being associated with the brand.
For example, Coca-Cola has used polar bears in their branding for a long time, so if you saw a red poster with a polar bear, your mind might think Coke even if it wasn’t written on the poster.
For posters that present research you’ve done, it’s good to include a picture of yourself so people can link your name and project to your face.

, The goal of your poster is to give information quickly and effectively. Don’t hide the important details of the poster in a large text block that takes someone 30 seconds to read. Separate content into smaller chunks, or reduce the total number of words.Three separate blocks that each contain a few similar pieces of information are more effective than one large block. You can even use boxes or borders to separate these blocks of text.
It’s possible that a poster with the bare minimum of information will stand out even more because it will seem mysterious but direct.

, Use a few bright colors that go well together. Stick to just a few colors unless you have a specific purpose for using more. Too many colors will be overwhelming. Use a text color that is easy to read and make sure it contrasts well with whatever is behind it.


If you think most of the other posters around your will use black ink, make a bold choice and use a sharp blue. If the color seems hard to read, adjust the font and the font size to make it more readable.
Using a bunch of colors to depict a vivid scene is fine as long as it doesn’t take away from the message you need the poster to convey.
Borders or boxes that separate content can be a great way to use color and still keep the poster neat and ordered.

"
"
Proofread your poster carefully before calling it finished.,
Check all of your facts multiple times.,
Print your final poster and look at it for a day or more.",How to Make a Poster That Stands Out3," Once you feel that everything is designed the way you want, read through all of the text a few different times. Check for misspellings and confusing wording throughout the text. Sloppy and poorly-written content is one of the biggest ways to lose credibility with people.Leave the poster alone for a day or a few hours after you finalize the design. Then come back to it and do your proofreading. If you proofread right after you type it all up, it can blur together and cause you to miss errors.
Have a friend, colleague, roommate, or family member look at the poster and check for mistakes or confusing aspects. Second or third opinions will help you catch things you missed.
Proofreading can also include paying attention to whether everything is displayed in a way that makes it easy to read. If any important information is obscured or designed badly, people will not see it.

, Even more than proofreading, fact-checking is vital to the success of your poster. If you give the wrong date for an event, it could be detrimental. Before you finish the poster and disseminate it to the public, double or even triple check all of the factual information to ensure that it’s correct.It’s possible that you’ll be designing a poster before some of the information is finalized. So if you use any stand-in information, be sure to change it to the real information.
If you are not in charge of the event or organization the poster is for, check with a supervisor to make sure you have accurate information.
When presenting research findings, look specifically at words like is/isn’t, was/wasn’t, and other negative words. A small mistake can completely reverse what you want your findings to say.

, Once you have designed the poster the way you want it to be, print a copy and hang it somewhere you will see it multiple times throughout the day. Put yourself in the shoes of a stranger and ask yourself if the poster draws you in and makes you want to know more. If it doesn’t, then it needs more work.Printing a hardcopy as opposed to looking at the poster on the screen is important because it mimics the way people will actually see the poster. If you are drawing the poster by hand, hang up your finished draft.
Look at the poster from long distances and up close to see how the look of it changes. See how far away you can get before the primary information is no longer visible. Ask yourself if that is an acceptable distance.
Looking at the poster for a day or more helps you decide if it accomplishes what you want it to.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Slice all of the foam balls in half.,
Cut a ring for the 3” ball.,
Paint the balls according to planet.,
Use the sun to map planet locations.,
Create the orbit for each planet.,
Add an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.",How to Make a Poster of the Solar System1," To make your poster three-dimensional you will need to use Styrofoam balls to give it depth. Other materials you will need are a 5”x5”x1/2” foam sheet, glue, string, markers, tape, craft paint, a serrated knife, a silver marker/sharpie, brown construction paper, nine wooden skewers, a ruler, and a black 20” x 30” poster board.Use the following Styrofoam balls for the planets: One 5”, 4”, 3”, 2.5” and 2” balls, two 1.5” balls
Adult supervision is recommended when using the knife.
You’ll need the following paint colors: yellow, orange, red, green, light blue, and dark blue.
These materials can be purchased at any craft store or the craft department of a superstore.;
, Ask an adult for help with this step. Use the knife to cut all of the balls except one of the 1.5” balls in half. It doesn’t have to be exactly in half, close to half is fine. Rub the two halves together over a trash can to brush the crumbs away after cutting.Rubbing the knife with beeswax or candle wax before cutting will make it easier to slice.
Smash the second 1.5” ball on the table to compress it to about 1¼”, then cut it in half.

, This ring will represent Saturn’s rings. Place the 3” ball in the middle of the foam sheet and trace around it with a sharp pencil. Draw a second circle around the outside of the first circle about 1” away.Use the tip of the knife to cut out the ring. Again, have an adult help with this step.

, Stick a wooden skewer into the flat part of ball. This will make it easier to paint and let stand to dry. Paint each ball the following colors:Sun: 5” ball, yellow
Mercury: 1¼” ball, orange
Venus: 1.5” ball, blue-green
Earth: 1.5” ball, dark-blue
Mars: 1¼” ball, red
Jupiter: 4” ball, orange
Saturn: 3” ball, yellow; foam ring, orange
Uranus: 2.5” ball, light-blue
Neptune: 2” ball, dark blue

, Mark the location for the center of the sun by measuring 10” down from the top of the board and 3” in from the right side of the poster. Make a small “x” to mark the center of the sun. Place the end of the ruler at the center of the sun and make a mark along the center of the poster at the distances below for each planet. These distances mark the orbits of the planets.Mercury: 3 ½” from the sun
Venus: 4 ¾” from the sun
Earth: 5 ¾” from the sun
Mars: 7” from the sun
Jupiter: 15 ¼” from the sun
Saturn: 18 ½” from the sun
Uranus: 21” from the sun
Neptune: 25 ¾” from the sun

, Use the string as a compass to make a circular orbit with the mark for each planet. Place one end of the string in the center mark for the sun and tape it down. Put the pencil down on the mark for Mercury and wrap the string around the pencil until it is taut.With the string extended, draw a circle around the poster board with the pencil to make the orbit.
Repeat this process with each planet’s orbit, moving the pencil to each mark.
Trace a dashed line on top of the pencil with the silver marker.
Glue each planet somewhere on its orbit. Stagger the placement of each planet so they don’t overlap.

, Cut out asteroid shapes from the brown construction paper. Space out the asteroids to make a belt all along the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Glue them down and label the area “Asteroid Belt”.


Asteroids are giant rocks floating through space and can easily be drawn freehand. Any rock shape you draw can be used as an asteroid.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Know the order of the planets.,
Cut the construction paper into planet shapes.,
Draw planets on the poster.,
Add the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.,
Research and add facts about the planets.",How to Make a Poster of the Solar System2," To make a flat poster, you can either draw the planets or cut them out of construction paper and glue them down on the poster board. You will need a large poster board (white or black), colored construction paper (optional), scissors, markers, and white craft glue or a glue stick.


Metallic markers will show up really well on a black poster board. Use these for labels.

, The first step in making a solar system poster is to know how the solar system looks. Start with the sun and then add the planets in the correct order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.


You can also include dwarf planets like Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris outside of Neptune.

, Make one for every planet in the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Try to cut your planets to scale: Mercury and Mars will be the smallest; Venus and Earth are slightly larger; Uranus and Neptune are about 5 times larger than Venus/Earth; Saturn is about 12 times larger; and Jupiter is the largest, about 14 times larger.Alternatively, you can print pictures of each planet and cut those out.
Glue the planets onto the poster in their proper order.

, Instead of making cutouts of the planets, you can draw them directly onto the poster board. In order to draw the planets, it would be better to use a white poster board instead of a black poster board.


Use markers of different colors to draw each planet.
Use a geometry compass or trace circular objects of different sizes to make perfectly sized planets.

, Either draw asteroids with a brown marker or cut them out of construction paper and glue them down. The asteroid belt separates the inner and outer planets.


Add other embellishments like comets, shooting stars, or rockets.

, Find out specific information about the planets like their size, distance from the sun, number of moons, origin of the name, and any other interesting facts there may be. Type up a small blurb about each planet and paste it next to the planet.Make your poster really interesting by having flaps for people to lift up or different textures (tin foil is good for a space theme).
Facts about the planets and solar system can be found online, at the library, or in your school textbook. Ask your parents to help you search online for information.

Clear off a flat surface.,
Unroll the map or poster.,
Place a cardboard tube at one end of the item.,
Roll your map or poster opposite from the way it curls.,
Wrap rubber bands around the roll to keep it in place.,
Leave the roll alone for an hour.,
Remove the rubber bands and unroll the map or poster.",How to Flatten a Rolled Map or Poster1," A table, desk, or even a bed can be used to flatten the map or poster. Provide enough space for the item to lay flat when unrolled. Sweep off any debris before you begin. You wouldn’t want to fix a poster of your favorite musician only to see a crumb lodged in their face!
, Slide the item out of any wrapper or container. Set the roll on one side of the flat surface. Feel for the end of the map or poster on the outside of the roll. Don’t pinch the the outside border or else you’ll crease it. Roll out the item until it is spread out on the table.Usually you will need to place the item facedown. Posters for example are rolled up so the image is on the inside. You will have to unroll it and place the image side down.
If your item ever feels resistant to opening, don’t force it. Instead, try humidifying it.

, Posters are shipped through the mail in tubes that can also be used for flattening. Toilet paper rolls are smaller but still work very well. Paper towel or wrapping paper rolls also work. Align the tube in the center of one end of your item.It’s possible to try flattening without using a tube. Simply roll up the map or poster as tight as you can and bind it with rubber bands. It’s best though to use a tube so the item doesn’t get dented.
Keep in mind that you need to roll your item in the direction opposite the curl. Flip your map or poster to the correct side before placing the tube.

, Hold the end of the item tight to the tube as you begin to roll it towards the opposite side. Work slowly and gently. Start loose and tighten the roll as you go to avoid creases. Sometimes this will be enough to flatten a map or poster., Rubber bands are a good binder since they’re not likely to cause damage to your map or poster. Place one around each end of the roll. Tape can work, such as the tape often used to roll a new poster, but some tapes can lead to ugly rips.


If you’re worried about the rubber bands or tape damaging your item, lay the map or poster flat and cover it with heavy objects.

, A new poster will need to stay in this rolled up position for about an hour. More curled items may need longer. Don’t overdo it though. You don’t want your item to curl in the opposite direction!

, Take off the rubber bands, being careful not to squeeze the edges of your item. Lay the unrolled map or poster flat. Adjust it so that the side it curls towards is facing up. Your item should be in better shape. If it still curls too much, roll it up again or try flattening it with weight.

Remove the weights and check your map or poster.",How to Flatten a Rolled Map or Poster2," Find a spacious, out of the way area and clean it off first. Lay your item flat. Keep the curling side facedown. Typically maps and posters are rolled so they curl inwards and over the image. That’s the side that should be facedown., Any heavy object you have around your home is useful here. Books are always a good choice since they distribute weight evenly over a decent amount of space. Get as many as you can to cover the map or poster. Remember to make sure the objects are clean before you place them., It’ll take some time for the weight to be effective. Curling can take a day or more to correct. You’ll have to keep your map or poster in a safe spot as you weight. If you tried rolling the item previously, the curling may be fixed within a couple of hours., With any luck, the item won’t try to wrap itself into a tube again. You can safely hang your favorite heartthrob on your wall. Some maps and poster will need longer, so repeat treatment as much as needed.

Leave your item to dry for a few days.,
Take valuable or stubborn items to a paper conservator.",How to Flatten a Rolled Map or Poster3," It’s important to clean off the map or poster before humidifying. Newer items won’t have much debris and you can wipe off spots with your finger or a soft, dry cloth. Dirtier items should be treated with a soft, natural brush like those made of animal hair or feathers. Any dirt left on the item during humidification can lead to stains.Avoid using synthetic fiber brushes like nylon scrub brushes. These are too harsh to be used on delicate items.
If your item is very dirty, you may be able to have someone restore it. For example, a paper conservator may save your paper map.

, The map or poster must not be rolled up with rubber bands. Any other fastening objects, including staples and clips, should be set aside. If your item is not completely rolled, roll it up in the direction of the curl., Add about two inches (5.08 cm) of room temperature water to a large plastic tub. Make sure the container is big enough to hold a second container. A plastic storage tub or large trash can are common choices.More water will provide more moisture, which speeds up humidification. This can be risky if you don’t monitor your map or poster carefully.
Misting near the map or poster with a spray bottle is an alternative treatment that can uncurl your item quickly. However, it is very difficult to get the perfect amount of water exposure.

, The rack needs to lay flat and stay above the water. Instead of a wire rack, you may set a smaller plastic container or trash can in the water. Make sure the rack or container is secure enough to stay in place., Lay the item out on the rack or inside the smaller container. Double-check that you used room temperature water before sealing the container. Warm water can condense on the container lid and drip onto your map or poster. Keep the humidification system in a temperature-controlled room where it won’t be disturbed., Once the lid has been sealed on the plastic container, you must let the map or poster absorb moisture. This takes about four to six hours. Come back after one hour to check on the system. Make sure water isn’t dripping from the lid. Check back again after four or five hours to see how your item has changed. It should feel softer and more relaxed., Remove your item from the humidifier. Gently try to unroll it. It should not curl up at all. In case the item feels resistant and ready to tear, leave it alone. Place it back in the humidifier and let it absorb more moisture., Cotton archival paper can be ordered online or at craft stores. You may also use cotton towels or blankets. Lay one piece of cotton flat on a table. Place the uncurled map or poster on top of it. Cover it with the second piece of cotton. Now weigh down your item so it stays flat.

Try setting a wood cutting board over the cotton and topping it with a couple of heavy books. The weight can help prevent the item from curling again., The cotton should be left in place overnight. If your paper feels dry by then, great! Often it takes a few days. Continue to check on your map or poster from time to time. Whenever the cotton feels damp, replace it., Humidification is best done with maps and posters you are willing to risk. Valuable or brittle items should be taken to a professional. Search in your area for paper conservators. Museums in your area may also be able to refer you to a conservator they trust."

Make it visually appealing.,
Understand the message and audience.,
Use dark colored font.,
Ask yourself if images are helpful.,
Cite your pictures.,
Make them a good size.,
Use appropriate placement.,
Know your styles.,
KISS it.,
Make your writing the right size.,
Emphasize the most important information.,
Connect with your viewers.,
Remember the 1/3-2/3 rule.",How to Design Posters," The point of adding color to your poster is to make it visually appealing; it should draw and audience. Too much color is confusing.One or two accent colors that are eye-catching and emphasize your subject is all you need.;
, If your poster is themed use a matching color. For instance, if you’re doing a presentation about breast cancer, be sure to use the correct pink. The audience will see this and be drawn to it because it’s familiar.

, Use a poster that has a light colored background and a dark colored text. This not only saves a tremendous amount of ink, but makes it easier for your audience to read.

, You have limited space on your poster, so use the space wisely. If you’re going to use images, they should be figures, diagrams, graphics, or tables that are easy-to-read and help illustrate your ideas.Charts are a great visual aid for a poster. They are a good way to add blocks of color while adding a visual explanation of your ideas.
Clip art rarely illustrates the ideas that you’re trying to get across in posters. Choose other images to help with this.

, Make sure the pictures that you’re using are public domain. Just because you can copy them from google, doesn’t mean they’re appropriate to use. If you are going to use a picture from here, be sure to post a citation for it on your poster.

, You want your graphics to be easily read from a distance of at least 5 feet.This means they should be no smaller than 5” x 7”. You also don’t want them to take over the entire poster—your font is the important part of the poster. Create a good balance between the two.

, Don’t overlap your images over your font, but make sure they are next to any wording that helps explain them. You shouldn’t be using these just to fill a giant empty space. All of your images should have purpose.

, You should use a simple, clean and professional writing for the majority of your text. On a computer, these are your serif fonts, such as Times New Roman, or Palatino. These fonts are easier to read, especially at a smaller size. You also have the choice of san serif fonts, such as Arial, Comic Sans, or Helvetica. These fonts can be used sparingly to add visual appeal to your poster.


Mix them up. It will help differentiate your titles from your informational text—making your titles stand out more.
If you’re using your handwriting instead of computer font, mix up your writing style to add interest to your poster.

, The acronym “K.I.S.S.” stands for keep it short and simple. You don’t want your poster to be overpowered by words. If you use too many words, many people won’t bother reading it all. You want your main ideas to be portrayed on the poster, but you should be going into depth with your verbal presentation rather than with your visual aid.

, Just as your images, all of your lettering should be legible from at least 5 feet away.Title: 72-point or larger
Names/Subheadings: 48-point type
Narrative text: 24-point type or larger

, Highlight the most important aspect of your poster with a cluster of images and color. This will draw the audience’s eye to that part of the poster.

, If your viewers are a younger crowd, you would use more loud colors and different fonts than if your viewers are an older, professional group. This goes for you images as well. Use charts and graphs to explain things for a work presentation, or use creative characters to help show off safety features for a children’s toy.

, 1/3 of your poster should be white space. 2/3 of it should be text and images. This creates a balance that is aesthetically pleasing to your audience."

You may not want a mat when framing a vintage poster or a poster of a classic work of art but that is completely your choice.;
, You will want a color that can go with everything, including your room, the frame and the picture. It is usual to put a white or light colored map on top of an accent color. The accent color would be a color that matches the general tone of the poster.


There can be multiple general tones of the poster so you can choose whatever looks best to you and fits the rest of your room. It is also your choice whether you use two mats or only one.
Black and white pictures will do best with cool whites or grays, or even black.
You do not want to upstage the poster if using a mat. Choose colors that work well with a width of at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Smaller widths can easily be used for posters because they are so large to begin with. As always though it is your personal choice.
You also do not want the top mat to be lighter than the lightest color in the picture or darker than the darkest color in the picture.

, Knowing where you will put the poster will help you decide on the particular frame you should purchase because you will know the general color scheme and theme of the location.


If you do not know where it will be placed or it is a gift then that is not a problem. There are plenty of generic frames that will look good in a variety of locations.

, You will need the length and width to determine the size of the frame you must purchase. The thickness is important because many frames will only accommodate very thin posters and you should be aware of the required depth before buying.


If you are using a mat be sure to include the dimensions (width, length and thickness) of the mat when measuring.

, The extra space in the frame can allow for the decorative or protective background mat and prevent the frame from damaging the poster's edges. The frame must accommodate both the poster and mat.


Measure the dimensions of the area where you will insert the frame rather than the exterior size of the poster. If you measure only the exterior of the edges of the frame then you will have a hard time fitting the poster into the space.

, Choose a frame that has the appropriate style for the room in which it will be placed as well as your personal preferences and the particular poster. Wood frames usually have a more elegant and classy look while metal frames show a more modern or clinical look.


Some plastic frames have been finished to give the appearance of wood or metal. These plastic frames are often cheaper and lightweight, which can be useful when framing posters.
Acrylic frames can also be useful in that they might be clear, which means they won’t cover up any of the graphics., Posters are usually quite large so it is best to choose a frame that is thin to balance out the shapes. Thinner frames will also emphasize the poster, making it stand out more.


If you want to create a more dramatic or bold look then choose a standard or wider frame.

, Look for a poster frame that has higher-quality plexiglass, such as Acrylite OP-3, that is 1/8 inch (0.31 cm) thick. Although regular glass is always an option, it can break or trap moisture inside the frame, damaging the poster. Lower-quality plexiglass may not prevent the poster from yellowing over time.


Higher-quality plexiglass can also be made so that it is glare-free and is much lighter weight than glass can be, making it ideal for large frames such as for posters.
Plexiglass can also be UV-resistant, which is important if you are hanging the poster in an area that receives a lot of sunlight.
Plexiglass is more prone to scratches, even though there are scratch-resistant types., Large frames that fit posters can often be quite expensive so consider searching your local thrift stores for options. You may find frames that have pictures in them that you can remove to repurpose for your poster.


Even if the frame is not the right color, if it is wood then you can repaint it later to a color of your choice.

, It is not always necessary to use poster backing, but you may choose to use it for a more professional look. It is important that the poster backing is acid-free, to avoid quickly fading and damaging the poster. Some frames come with the backing already inside the frame.

, Making your own frame is a good option for those looking for budget options, and/or have a poster with an awkward size for framing. Making your own frame allows you to customize options without paying the expensive costs of a professional framer.This frame might not be particularly strong so it might not work with a glass piece in front.

, It is not always necessary to use a mat but it can accent certain colors in your poster and frame it nicely.


You may not want a mat when framing a vintage poster or a poster of a classic work of art but that is completely your choice.

, You will want a color that can go with everything, including your room, the frame and the picture. It is usual to put a white or light colored map on top of an accent color. The accent color would be a color that matches the general tone of the poster.


There can be multiple general tones of the poster so you can choose whatever looks best to you and fits the rest of your room. It is also your choice whether you use two mats or only one.
Black and white pictures will do best with cool whites or grays, or even black.
You do not want to upstage the poster if using a mat. Choose colors that work well with a width of at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Smaller widths can easily be used for posters because they are so large to begin with. As always though it is your personal choice.
You also do not want the top mat to be lighter than the lightest color in the picture or darker than the darkest color in the picture.

, You will need the length and width to determine the materials you must purchase. If you are using a mat be sure to include the dimensions (width, length and thickness) of the mat when measuring.

, Purchase wood trimming (moulding) from the hardware store. You will want a type of trimming that looks like a frame edge and hopefully has a ledge on one side, such as might hold a poster as a picture frame would.


You will need enough to cover the length of all four sides of your poster, plus extra if you are using a mat (the width of your mat times four) and some more (8-12 inches or 20-30 cm, depending on width of wall trimming) for the corners.
You might only find a plain moulding that has a ledge in it, but do not worry, you can always customize colors later to add some decoration.

, Mitering involves cutting the edges of the wall trimming at 45 degree angles so that they fit together to form a 90 degree angle in the corner. Measure carefully so that you make the edges the correct length.


You will want each outer edge to be as long as that side of the poster plus the width of the other side of the frame times two.
Make sure your opposing pieces on the top and bottom or left and right are equal lengths so that the frame can be squared properly.
Make allowance in the lengths for the mat width as well as the poster size.

, If you want to paint the frame then be sure to do it before putting together your frame because it can be hard to paint once assembled. Choose a color that fits your hanging location, the poster and your personal preferences and goals.

, Use wood glue to attach the pieces to each other end to end. Hold them together while drying by using clamps. Allow the frame to dry with the front side facing down, which will help later on.


There may be gaps in the wood and it may not hold together completely on its own but that is ok. The corners will be attached more securely later.

, Use metal corner pieces to attach the corner pieces. These will be L-shaped and should be the right size, not too big or too small, to fit on your corners.


Make sure the wood screws you use are not too long so that the poke out the front side of your frame. Use short screws.
Drill the screws in carefully so that the wood does not crack or become damaged.
You may wish to use a band clamp to hold the corners together but it is not necessary. A band clamp is a long piece of nylon with a clamp on one side to wrap around pieces and hold them together.

, You may have cracks showing on the front side of your frame. To fix this you can use wood putty to smooth in the gaps with a putty knife to remove excess putty. Then you will have to repaint the corners for a nice even look.

, You can find little clips as part of a framing kit or at a hardware store. You can also not purchase clips and rather staple your poster into place if the frame is wide enough. Tape can also work if you don’t mind the look.

, It is not always necessary to use glass or plexiglass over your poster but can look more professional and finished. This frame is not incredibly strong so glass might be a bit heavy, but plexiglass will work well. Have a piece of plexiglass cut to the correct size at your local hardware or framing store.


Alternatively you might find a piece as part of another picture frame at a thrift store or hobby store on sale.
Higher quality plexiglass such as Acrylite OP-3 that is 1/8 inch (0.31 cm) thick will work well. Higher-quality plexiglass can also be made so that it is glare-free and is much lighter weight than glass can be, making it ideal for large frames such as for posters, although it is more prone to scratches than glass.
Plexiglass can also be UV-resistant, which is important if you are hanging the poster in an area that receives a lot of sunlight.

, This is particularly necessary if the poster has been rolled up for a long time and will not hang straight. Peel back a few inches of the adhesive foam board’s protective film and line up the print with the edge of the board. Unroll the poster onto the board slowly, unrolling a few inches at a time and applying to the poster. Smooth out any air bubbles using a credit card or the spine of a hardcover book.


Use a pin to poke a hole in any large bubbles from behind (through the foam, not the poster). Once you let the air out, smooth it down completely.
Trim excess foam from the board using a knife and metal ruler to make crisp edges.
You can also pay for someone to apply a foam board for about $20 (depending on the area) if you would like.
Remember that a foam board will increase the thickness of your poster and can affect the frame that you choose., Remove the backboard, or whatever is currently inside the frame, if there is one. The glass or plexiglass will stay inside the frame, if there is such a piece.

, If you are using one, your mat can be placed either on top of or behind your poster. Putting the mat behind your poster is easiest, because then you will not have to cut the mat. If you choose to put the mat on top of the poster, then you may have to cut out the inner shape so that the poster can be seen inside.


It can be difficult to cut the edges of a mat accurately and without damaging the mat so you can usually have this completed at a framing store for just a few dollars.

, It is very important that your glass or plexiglass be clean on the inside where it touches the poster. Moisture will damage the poster so it is also very important for the piece to be dry.


You do not want any fingerprints or other oils on the side touching the poster.
Plexiglass is prone to scratches so be sure to clean it only with a microfiber cloth rather than paper products.

, If you are using one, then you must slide the glass or plexiglass into place first. The most important side is the one that will be touching the poster so make sure not to touch this side when putting into place.


You can always clean the other side again, so don’t worry about touching it all over when putting into place.
Hold the piece as if it is a pizza when placing into the frame.

, Adjust the poster's (and mat’s, if you have one) placement inside the frame if necessary. Make sure the edges are even and straight so that it does not look crooked or uneven.

, Attach the poster into place so that it does not shift while hanging. You can purchase small clips for this purpose from the hardware store or simply staple the poster into place from behind. If you are stapling, make sure you do it at the edge and at an angle so that it is secure and does not show from the front.

, Poster backing is not usually necessary if you have attached your poster to a foam board. However, if you have not done so or wish the picture to look more professional, then you should add poster backing to cover the back of the poster.


Make sure your poster backing is acid-free if you are using it or else it can damage the poster.

, You can either use small d-rings (which attach by screwing in) and a wire, or the zig-zag picture hanger pieces (which will be screwed on with small screws). Both of these are available from your local hardware store. Make sure to attach these to the frame, not the poster, so that they are secure and strong enough to hold your poster up.


You may need more than one picture hanger if your frame is particular large and/or heavy. Make sure there are enough to hold your picture up securely.

, Use screws or nails to insert into the wall so that you can you’re your picture on them. If you are using more than one hanging piece, then you must make sure the pieces are level on the wall so that the poster will not be hung crookedly. Adjust your poster until it looks straight and even.

Plan the content of the sign.,
Find a great image for the lawn sign.,
Consider adding a logo if it's relevant.,
Choose a good font.,
Choose a pleasing color that complements the other sign elements.,
Use a software program to design the sign, For example, Photoshop, Illustration, or Indesign.,
Find a printer who is able to print signs.,
Position the lawn sign where it will be eye-catching and appealing.,
Attach the sign to a stake.,
Ensure that nothing is blocking the line of sight to the lawn sign.,
Maintain the sign.",How to Design an Attractive Lawn Sign," Keep the text short, pithy and clear. Too much text will detract from the message you want to get across. Write your message; then spend plenty of time editing it and culling it until it's short but still gets across the point you wish to make.


If you have a slogan, this can be an eye-catching way to get people to stop and read the sign.;
, This could be any number of things but should relate directly to what the sign is about. For example, it might be the face of a real estate agent or politician, a key room in the house you're selling or a desirable item in your yard sale.


If you want to use a series of images, such as for a house and its interior, try to keep it all as one image in the same position, but use a left or right side cascading line up of smaller images alongside a large image. This can be a great way of showing off a few rooms in a house without losing the impact of the main image.

, If this sign is selling something or promoting someone from a business or political party, a logo should be added. The position and size of the loge will be determined, primarily, by the amount of text and the image size, so be prepared to play around with the design until everything looks balanced and pleasing.

, The font should be easy to read and capable of being seen from a distance. Usually black will be the best color for the lettering, although this will depend on the background color you're using.

, The background color will depend partly on the image and message. For example, if the image is very colorful, keep the background plain (perhaps solid white). If the image is simple and would look good against a bold color such as red, then perhaps that will be the best choice.

, Send this file to the sign printer. They will cue you if any changes are needed.

, Usually the sign will be done on plastic board, as this is durable and can withstand rain. However, you can also make your own sign using paper (printed from your computer and carefully pieced together) and plywood (or similar thin wood), then painting a waterproofing sealant over the top.


If using a professional printer, ring around to get the best rate.

, Stand on the curb and take a good look at the area where you plan to position the sign. Take a walk by and drive by as well, to see which positions are most likely to capture passers-by's attention. Choose the spot only after you have done this.

, The height of the stake should be such that any person targeted can see it best. If you plan for people in vehicles to see it with ease, this might be lower than if you intend for a lot of people walking to see it. Again, you'll need to judge this according to the context.

, Check that tree branches, other signs or poles, etc. are not blocking the sign once you've put it up. If they are, you'll need to shift it.

, It's easy to stick a sign in the ground and forget about it. However, for the sake of keeping the sign attractive and fresh, keep an eye on how it is faring. This includes checking for graffiti, breakage, the sign coming away from its stake, or weathering. If it needs to be replaced or updated, don't hesitate. This will avoid shabby presentation and ensure that your message portrays professionalism when it goes out to the public.

It is a great tool when done right and can encompasses irony, humor, and exaggeration to spotlight what you find wrong. Examples of satire are The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.Ridicule the shortcomings of governmental motivations, corporate motivation, or everyday individual motivation to bring about positive change. Use this powerful tool when you’re creating a poster representative of a strong social value.;
, Exaggerate characteristics through visuals or smart world play. Highlight idiosyncrasies that your audience will understand. Spoofs and caricatures are common in movies and literature.Parody is different from satire because it directly mimics something. Choose appropriate images for your poster that produce this humorous effect. For example, if you want to create a parody poster of a motivational speaker who is slightly overweight, you exaggerate his size, keeping the outfit the same.

, Use your words and images so that their meaning is different from the original meaning. Create a poster that appears to be different than the reality. There are two types of irony: verbal and situational.Verbal irony is when you say something you don’t mean. When choosing the text of the poster, verbal irony can be an effective tool. For example, below an image of someone crying in his cubicle, caption, “I love my job”.
Situational irony is when someone reacts to someone else’s misfortune, but the same misfortune is about to happen to him and he doesn’t know it yet.
Ironic expressions and situations are common in everyday life and this tool can easily be employed by juxtaposing the image of your poster with your caption or title.

, A loss of motivation can be something a person struggles with their entire life or it can be something that is jarring.


Factors that can cause an immediate loss of motivation can include physical illness, depression, alcohol, pot, drugs, or loss of friends or family. Factors that people struggle with can be complex and rooted in a number of psychological factors.

, Depression is common to many people and people who suffer from depression often report being sad, hopeless, and having no energy. Utilize imagery and captions that evoke the same emotions.


Depression is a serious mental illness so be careful if these negative emotions cause you to create these posters. Seek out professional help if this is not a fun activity.

, Alcohol and certain type of drugs provide a sense of misery and listlessness. The more these substances are a part of someone’s life, the more likely they will lack a sense of motivation.Posters that parody anti-drinking or drug posters are easy to make. For example, you can use the iconic title “Say No to Drugs” with an image of famous celebrities. The caption can read what drug they were arrested for and how much their last movie made.

, For example, your poster can highlight how drinking is the only thing that helps with depression, but in reality, it only makes things worse., It is human nature to compare yourself to others. Create a poster that highlights that instinct by creating unfair comparisons. For example, create a chart of what Bill Gates has done this year and a picture of someone drinking beer on a couch with the caption, “I’m right on track”.


Many people have sibling rivalries or have to live up to their parents’ lofty expectations. It’s natural for a parent to want their children to do better than they did. This pressure can be examined with the message of your poster.

, You can watch the video if you want, but it isn't necessary. The speaker is more amusing than he looks, so go ahead and watch it.

, Search for an image online and download onto your computer into a location that you will remember. If you have already downloaded an image onto your computer, hit “upload image” and browse your computer to find the right location of the image file and pick just the right one.


Use image editing software to create custom images that suit your message.
Depending on your intention, remember that many images have a copyright. You should not use an image without the permission or consent of the original image creator unless your poster is only for personal use. Use an image search engine to locate the usage rights of an image.
Follow the prompts to zoom in or out or change the orientation of your chosen image.

, Your title can be provocative or funny but don’t make it too long. You can utilize comedic devices like irony or exaggeration to drive home your message. Follow the prompts to choose the type of font and color from drop down menus located beneath the title area.


Make sure your font type and color allows your audience to read the title. Some images may overpower your text.

, The caption of your poster can be more detailed than your title. It can be a thought provoking statement or comedic phrase. When juxtaposed against your image correctly, it can create both a funny and powerful statement. Hit the “update text” button when you are satisfied.


Watch out for grammar, spelling, and punctuation, unless that is part of your message.
Choose the type of font and color for your text by following the prompts of the two drop down menus located beneath the caption area.

, It may seem like fun to use different fonts on your sign, but use caution. Too many fonts, for example, can make your sign seem cluttered and detract from your sign’s overall message. Stick to one or maybe two simple fonts.

,


A good rule is for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) of text, you get about 10 feet (3.0 m) of visibility. Consider at what distance you need your sign to be readable. It’s extremely important to make sure your sign can be read from the road. If a driver can’t read your sign, then they won’t become a customer.

Consider using a pattern or an image for the background.,
Choose your font.,
Decide on a color for the font.,
Know that you don't have to use a crown.",How to Make a Keep Calm Poster2," Most ""Keep Calm"" posters have the words centered. There are usually five to six lines. The first four words are on their own line. The crown is at the very top, also centered.

, The original poster was red, but you can use any color your want. Some colors might be more suitable for certain posters than others. For example, pink might be suitable for a poster that says ""Keep Calm and Go Shopping,"" while green might work better for a poster that says ""Keep Calm and Garden.""

, Most ""Keep Calm"" posters are a solid color, however, many of the newer posters have a patterned background. Keep in mind, however, that a background could make the words difficult to read. If that happens, try using a paler or a faded background instead. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you are making a patriotic poster, consider using a flag as a background.
If you are Star Wars, Star Trek, or Doctor Who themed poster, try finding a black background with stars on it.

, Most of the font used is a sans serif font, such as Ariel. The letters are straight lines, and don't have any hooks at the ends. However, some people like to use a fancier font for the last word or two.


Make sure that the font is all upper-case or capital letters.

, Most of the lettering on Keep Calm posters is white, but if you used a really pale background, or yellow, you might want to make the letters darker. You can also make the last word a different color.

, The traditional poster used a crown, but if you are making your own poster with your own phrase, you can use a different image. Whatever image you do use, however, make sure that it is a silhouette, and the same color as the font. Here's some ideas to get you started:


If you are making a super hero themed poster, consider using the super hero's logo instead. This is the exception to the same-color/silhouette rule.
If you are making a coffee themed posted, try using a coffee cup or a coffee mug.
If you are making a poster based off of a princess movie, then use the princess's crown instead.

You should be able to purchase the stencils from any craft store, but if you cannot find the right ones, you will have to make your own. Here's a list of what you will need:


Rectangular sheet of paper
Pencil
Eraser
Ruler
Stencils or Cardstock and craft knife
Acrylic paint
Foam brush
Paper plate or palette
Masking tape or painter's tape

, You can use poster paper or even construction paper. If you want a poster that has a pattern on it, then consider using scrapbooking paper. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of a well-stocked arts and crafts store. If you decide to use scrapbooking paper, however, keep in mind that you will have to cut it down to make it a rectangle.

, Use a long ruler and a pencil to draw light lines across the poster where you want the crown and letters to go. If necessary, lightly sketch out the word. This will help you place the letters later on.

, To make the stencil, print an image of a crown silhouette onto a sheet of cardstock. Use a craft knife to cut the crown out. You will be placing the paper onto your poster and painting over the crown-shaped hole.


You can also use a different shaped stencil if you don't want a crown.
The crown should be approximately one third of the width of the poster.
If you can't find cardstock, you can use any other thick sheet of paper or even cardboard. Keep in mind that if it won't go through the printer, you will have to draw the design onto it by hand, and then cut it out.

, Carefully position the crown near the top of the poster. Make sure that it is centered, then tape the edges of the stencil down onto the poster using masking tape or painters tape.


If you are using an adhesive stencil, you do not need to tape it.

, If the paint is very thick, you might get some visible brushstrokes when you paint. To keep this from happening, add a few drops of water to the paint and stir it. You want it to have a cream-like consistency.

, Dip your foam brush into the paint and tap off any excess paint onto a paper towel. Carefully tap the paint over the stencil. Avoid using too much paint, or the paint will seep under the stencil., Carefully pull off the tape, and then lift the stencil off. Be careful not to smudge the paint. You want to remove the stencil while the paint is still wet to avoid chipping it.

, Most letter stencils will come on a large sheet of paper, and there is usually one of each letter. You will have to do each letter one at a time. Position the letter where you want it to go, and paint over it. Lift the stencil, and move on to another part of the poster; make sure that the stencil sheet doesn't touch the painted letter. This will help prevent the paint from smudging.


If you cannot find any letter stencils you like, you will need to make your own. Use a word processing program to create the text, and print it out onto a sheet of cardstock. Use a craft knife to cut the letters out. If you are having troubles cutting in a straight line, use a metal ruler to help guide you., Most acrylic paints dry to the touch quickly, about 20 to 30 minutes.Each brand will be a little different, however, so you might want to check the drying times on the paint bottle you have.

, Make sure that the paint is absolutely dry before you do this, or you will risk smudging the paint.

, You can use poster or construction paper. If you want a poster that has a pattern on it, then use scrapbooking paper. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. If you choose to use scrapbooking paper, you will have to cut it down to make it a rectangle.

, Use a long ruler and a pencil to lightly sketch lines across the poster where you want the crown and letters to go. This will help you keep everything even and straight.

, Try to make it as centered as possible. The crown should be about one third of the width of the paper. Try not to press too hard with the pencil, and don't worry about making it too clean. You will be erasing the pencil later.

, If necessary, use a ruler to help you make the lines straight. Try not to make the lines too dark, or you won't be able to erase them fully.

, If the paint is very thick, you might get some visible brush strokes. Consider adding a few drops of water to it and mixing it. It should have the consistency of cream.

, If you are left-handed, start painting from the right side of the poster. If you are right-handed, start painting from the left. A flat-tipped brush will be the best for the letters, as it will give you the crispest lines. A pointy, round-tipped brush will be the best for getting into corners and creating details.


Try to use a synthetic/taklon or sable hair brush. Camel hair will be too soft, and a boar bristle brush will be too stiff.
Try to paint in many, but thin layers. This will help reduce brush strokes. If you apply the paint too thickly, you'll be more likely to get brush strokes.

, It will take about 20 to 30 minutes for most types of acrylic paint, but you might want to check the label on the bottle just to be sure.

, Make sure that the paint is completely dry first, then gently erase any visible pencil marks.

Determine the required size of your vinyl cutter.,
Assess the types of materials you'll need to cut.,
Ensure that your vinyl cutter offers adequate support and part replacement.,
Evaluate the ease of use of both the vinyl cutter and its software.",How to Buy a Vinyl Cutter," This is one of the most crucial considerations. Vinyl cutters vary widely in price based on the size of the vinyl sheets they can accept. Determining your required size means assessing the type of work you'll be doing. If you want to print mostly long banners, then a smaller machine will often be adequate. If you want to be able to accommodate customer requests for large signs, spend the money for a larger vinyl cutter.


Note that vinyl is often sold in rolls 15 inches (38.1 cm) wide or more. If you buy a vinyl cutter smaller than this, you'll have to trim the excess width from the vinyl before using it. This results in wasted material and wasted time.;
, If you will only be cutting vinyl with your vinyl cutter, then a less expensive model will generally be adequate. However, if you want to be able to cleanly cut other materials, such as foil, thick plastics, and fabrics, consider spending more for a higher-end model. Quality machines will give you precise control over the blade's pressure and location, which will result in clean, exact cuts in any material.


Note that flatbed-style vinyl cutters are generally more effective at cutting thick materials and fabrics than roll-fed machines.
If you'll need to be able to cut different materials often, make sure your vinyl cutter offers easy adjustment of the blade force. The blade force (or blade pressure) is generally measured in grams, and will need to be changed based on the thickness and density of the material being cut.

, If you only have a single vinyl cutter, your business will be held up tremendously if it malfunctions or needs a part replaced. Buying from major brands such as Roland or Graphtec will increase the availability of parts and support. Also, avoid buying used and out-of-production models, as these will be more difficult to service and maintain.


When assessing the ease of finding replacement parts, consider the cost of these parts as well. Blades, for example, must be replaced regularly. A vinyl cutter that uses very expensive replacement blades will cost you much more in the long run.
If you are buying a new vinyl cutter, make sure you understand what type of warranty is included. If you are new to working with vinyl cutters, consider purchasing an extended coverage plan if available.

, Vinyl cutters vary widely in functionality and in ease of use. In addition, vinyl cutters must be coordinating with a software program that feeds the cutting pattern to the machine. This software can also vary in usability.


When assessing the ease of use, ask yourself how skilled the operator of the vinyl cutter will be. If you will be the only one using the machine, you can generally afford to buy a more complicated, less user-friendly model. However, if the machine will be in a setting where students or other large groups of people will be operating it, it is best to make usability a priority.
Vinyl cutting software varies in price, functionality, support, and ease of use. Software that is meant to be sold to large businesses can be extremely pricey. Before purchasing this software, consider some of the open-source alternatives first.

Rectangular sheet of paper
Colored paper (letters and crown)
Pencil
Eraser
Ruler
Craft knife
Letter stickers (optional)
Glue stick
Eraser (optional)

, You can use poster paper or construction paper. If you want a poster with a pattern on it, use scrapbooking paper. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. If you decide to use scrapbooking paper, cut it down to make it a rectangle.

, Use a long ruler and a pencil to lightly draw some lines where you want everything to go. This will help you align the letters and crown.

, You can also print out the outline of a crown and some letters onto a sheet of paper. Make sure that the crown and letters are not filled in by any designs.


If you want, you can also use letter-shaped stickers to make the words. Keep in mind, however, that most stickers tend to be glossy. If you use stickers, then the words will have a different finish than the rest of your poster.

, Be sure to cut just inside the outline. Also, try hard not to nick the crown or letters, as they will be going right onto your poster.


If you find that the knife is not cutting smoothly, the dull is probably dull. Try changing the blade for a new one.

, Flip the crown over, and place it down onto a piece of scrap paper. Use a glue stick to apply a thin layer of glue over the back of the crown, then paste the crown down onto the poster. Use your fist to smooth it down.

, Stick the letter onto the poster before moving onto the next one.


You will notice the piece of scrap paper getting more and more glue marks over time. Try to avoid these marks, or your letters will become dirty.

, Try to go in the same direction while erasing—so always rub your eraser in an upwards direction, or a downwards direction. Don't rub back and forth, or you will risk dislodging the paper.

The people you live with may come from far far away. Is it just me, or does far far away sound dangerous?;
, Sharing may be a show of love, but it is also a show of poor upbringing and bad manners. People from far far away are bound to be strange; are you sure you want to use their things, or allow them to use yours? At least have your own basics, like soap, sheets, and clothes. If someone attempts to borrow these, be frank in your disapproval. If you made the effort to have your own, why shouldn’t they?

, Listen to music on ear phones, shower everyday, don’t over-indulge in cosmetics especially of the cheap variety, or those brands whose labels bear spelling mistakes. Remember, not everyone thinks roses smell wonderful (I think only girls in the movies do).

, An annoying ring tone is difficult to bear in a bus. It becomes condescending to have to deal with the menace in a hostel. Worse is when the ring tone is only a preamble to hours of useless banter. If you have a roommate, spare them the sweet nothings you whisper on the free calls. Get a room!

, Eat noxious foods where there is plenty of fresh air, and then brush your teeth and wash utensils immediately afterward. Don’t leave traces hanging around, the fumes and morsels are unbearable, not to mention breeding ground for maggots, roaches and rodents.

, Avoid keeping closets you can’t open for fear of causing deadly avalanches.

, Don’t feel obliged to bare your soul, but basic courtesy will do. You don’t know what kind of fix you may find yourself in over the period of time you will be there. Who knows, someone might save your life. But bear in mind that familiarity breeds contempt.

, By all means, don’t be a diva, but if you don’t like something, say it. Lots of rights as we know them today had to be fought for. If someone encroaches on your privacy, tell them to back off. If the management fails to give you good value for your money, bring it to their attention. Don’t be a passive, grumpy type that whispers things under their breath but never has the guts to articulate their thoughts. While realizing that hostels cannot be expected to be at par with the standards at home, it is unacceptable that they violate the basic principles of humane living. They should be judged by a standard. In fact, there is legislation that provides a certain benchmark below which service should not go. Be conversant with your rights as a resident and demand them.

, If there is a common television, don’t make everyone watch Filipino soaps. Employ the little tenets of democracy. A little courtesy goes a long way. Instead of keeping the lights on while everyone is asleep, find another room to carry out your nocturnal activities, or engineer your program to coincide with others’.

, If you shall be bringing visitors to the hostel or guesthouse, it is only fair to let the people around you know. Seek permission from people who shall be directly affected by your actions. It is very rude to bring friends for sleepovers without checking with roommates first. It is extremely contemptuous if those friends happen to be lovers. Most hostels don’t even provide pillows to muffle sounds with!

, In case of an emergency, whom shall anyone call? And if you are out late and they need to lock the gates, how shall they reach you? Obtain contacts of at least two fellow residents, in addition to caretakers and watchmen. Be especially good to the watchmen, they tend to be drunk with power. Literally.

, You aren’t home anymore; you can’t let things like money, cell phones and laptops just lie around. In the same spirit, respect others’ belongings.

, Do lots and lots of new things too, but go easy on yourself. You are young, there will be enough time to do everything later. Just follow your heart for now, and be true to your values and principles.

Get enough rest, eat well, and get some exercise.",How to Get a Strong Start at University," Many schools have an orientation before classes begin. Even if it's only a couple of days, you should make every effort to attend. It is an opportunity to meet your future classmates and to become familiar with on- and off-campus resources of all sorts. Depending on the school, it might also be the right time to sign up for your first term's classes, take placement exams, register for student housing, or take care of other administrative details. Orientation may also be the time when you begin registering for classes.

If travel costs or schedule conflicts prevent you from attending your orientation, communicate with the school to find out what you are missing and how and when you may be able to make up whatever is required.;
, If you are moving out of your parents' home to live in or near the school, you'll have a household, or at least a dorm room, to set up. Even if you're commuting, you'll need to get your textbooks, and you may need a parking permit. In any case, you'll likely need a student ID. Identify and take care of as many basic details before classes begin as you can, so you can focus on your classes when the time comes., Watch for class timing and prerequisites. If the first course in a three-course series is only offered in fall, make sure you take it in fall of the appropriate year. Counselors and advisers in your department can help you identify such courses., If you're required to take 12 units per term to be a full time student, take 12-15 your first term, not 18 or 20. Add on classes during subsequent terms as you feel you can reasonably do so. Add on reasonable extracurricular activities as you get the feel for managing your time., This can be tough to do when you're still discovering who you are, but chances are that you already generally know whether you're better at math or writing. If you're still trying to decide, choose a general direction and see if your school has overview or introductory classes to start to explore different majors. In the meantime, begin taking the general classes needed for fields such as yours. For instance, if physiology, pre-med, and nursing all require biology and chemistry, those would be good classes to take while you zero in on your specific major.

If you are thinking of changing majors, be aware of what credits will carry over, and what classes you may have to start over. Talk with a councilor or other adviser to understand how much time your intended switch will add to your academic career. There's nothing wrong with changing majors, but make sure you go in with your eyes open and change for the right reasons.

, Go to lectures. Read the syllabus. Take notes. Do your homework. Read or at least review the textbook. Ask questions. Go to office hours. Go to labs, TA sessions, and anything else the class requires or recommends., Form study groups with classmates. Make at least one acquaintance in each class and trade contact information so you can share notes if you must miss a lecture. Find out if the campus, or a club or the TA offer tutoring. Some professors and TAs will review your homework or paper with you if you bring it in ahead of the deadline.

You'll find video lectures, notes, and forums about most academic subjects online. They can be excellent supplements if something isn't making sense.

, Are you a visual learner, auditory, or kinesthetic? Do you remember things you see on flashcards, or does it seem to work better to do the homework and repeat key items to yourself? There's no one right way to study, but chances are there are better and worse ways for your study style and your chosen field., Learn what tools work best for you to manage your time., Yes, the occasional all-nighter may be needed, but it is worth the time you will spend to keep your life as balanced as possible."

Start with only the body of the release, the actual information you want known.,
Place the contact information at the top of the page.,
Bold the headline.,
Add a dateline.,
Link appropriate pages.,
Bring things to a close.,
Keep them coming back for more.,
Ensure you are using the appropriate typeface.,
Draw them in.,
Follow AP Style guidelines.",How to Format a Press Release for a University," The body should be single spaced, with an extra line between paragraphs.



 ;
, In all capital letters, write the word “CONTACT,” followed by a colon and the contact person’s name (whoever is relevant for your release). Underneath, include their telephone number and email address. These should be separated by a comma.

Telephone number should include area code and use periods (.) to separate each section of the number.

, Your university news team will only pay attention to stories they think are important and relevant, and that is most obvious in the headline.

Insert a line of blank space before and after the headline, separating it from the contact information above and the body of the release below.
Include your university’s name in the story headline, or their abbreviation. If applicable, also include the name of your specific college within the university. This way, when the story goes out to media, it is immediately obvious that the story is about your school.

, Despite what the name might imply, a dateline is the location your story takes place. It is written in all capital letters. This is written at the very beginning of the release, separated from the body only by a long hyphen (—).

The city should be spelled out completely, followed by a comma (,) and the appropriate state abbreviation. Make sure you follow AP Style for these abbreviations, and to ensure your city needs the state included (some large cities may stand alone without the state name).

, Consumers read a lot of their news online, so make your release interactive. If you reference anything within your university – a specific college, a professor, your alumni association – add a link to their website.

It is only necessary to link to the same page one time in each release, so link on first reference only. This will keep your audience engaged with the story, and give them additional resources if they have an interest.

, In a typical press release, the end is marked by three pound symbols (###). For a more updated style, and one that reiterates where the information is coming from, add a line of space after the end of the body and close with the initials of your university. This should be written all in bold, with a hyphen (-) on either side of the letters.

Include your initials and the date in the closing as well. Place your initials (in lowercase) underneath the university’s initials, separated by one blank line. You will include the date here as well, so the media knows the timeliness and immediacy of your release.
For this section, each element should be separated by a forward slash (/), including the date, with no spaces between.

, You want your reader to be engaged in the story, and to keep coming back to you and your university for more information. In order to do this, you will want to place your university’s website, or more specifically your university’s news website, at the bottom of the story, as well as any social media accounts that would be helpful to them., Check to see if your university has a style guide for things such as typeface and font size. If so, follow those instructions. If not, stick with something simple, readable and professional. Some good typeface options would be Arial, Times New Roman or Helvetica, typically in size 12 font., The lead, or first sentence, should always be attention grabbing and informative. While some of your basic information should be provided (who, what, where, when, why, how) not all of it needs included in this sentence. The most important part of the lead is grabbing the audience’s attention so they will read the rest of the release.

Use a play on words to make your first sentence pop.

, One of the most important elements of a press release is that it follows AP Style, which is the style of writing the media uses. If the original content already follows those guidelines, it creates much less work for the editor, not only at your University but also at the media outlets the release gets sent to. This is the most timely aspect of editing, as there are all sorts of little nuances that encompass AP Style."

Read the syllabus.,
Make sure email is really the best way to communicate your issue.,
Use your academic account.,
Include a meaningful subject line with your course and section details.,
Always use a greeting.,
Briefly and politely state the reason why you are emailing.,
Get to the point right away.,
If you are emailing with a problem, suggest a solution.,
Sign it with your name and your student ID number (but never your Social Security number).,
Send attachments if necessary.,
Read it over.,
If the issue is touchy or the email is long, ask someone else to proofread it, too.,
Allow adequate time for a reply.,
Once a reply has been received, acknowledge it.",How to Email a Professor," Often, the question you would like to ask has already been answered in the material the professor has provided at the beginning of class. Asking a professor to go over this again makes you look like you are not a serious student and only harms your cause.;
, Email is often much more time-consuming than an in-person conversation. It generally takes longer to compose word-processed text than to say it.


Even if the email is short and quick for you to deploy, the response for which you are asking can be time-consuming for the professor. For example, emailing a professor to ask ""what did I miss?"" is not cool. You're basically expecting the professor to take the time to write up an entire class just for you.
Don't email to ask about your grades. At least in the US, FERPA laws mean many universities have instructed professors not to send grade information via email. (Plus, grades are better discussed in person. Go to the professor's office hours or make an appointment where you can sit down together and review your work. Then the professor can show you exactly where in the assignment you fell short. Also, you are more likely to come across as interested in learning, rather than being a grade grubber just whining to get extra points.)
Whenever possible, try to have a ""live"", in-person conversation with your professor. A general rule-of-thumb is: if it's going to take your professor longer to type out a reply to your email than to say it, don't use email. Make use of the professor's office hours - you can phone and/or show up - and most likely get an immediate response. Or, if the office hours don't work for you, make an appointment to visit either by phone or in person at another time. Reserve email for short exchanges.

, Professors are deluged with emails every day, and by using your school account, you'll have a better chance of avoiding the spam filter, or of having your professor skip over your email because it's from an unknown address.

, While this is true of every email you send (that you wish to be read), it's especially important when you're attempting to communicate with somebody whose day is busy enough as it is.


If your professor does not already have a preferred method for email subjects, then a good rule is to start with your course department, number, and section (or day and time of course), and then the topic of your email. For example, ""PSYC100 Section XX: Question about data collection for project"" would be an excellent way to fill in the subject line. With your academic account and your well-titled subject, the professor knows who you are and exactly what you want, even before clicking ""Open."" This information helps the professor organize and prioritize student emails. Including the section info is especially important for professors who teach multiple sections of the same course. Do not simply write the general subject area (such as ""psychology""), because your professor is probably teaching multiple classes.
Never send a message with no subject line.

, Do not begin with ""Hey"", ""Hi"" or other informal greetings. Generally speaking, you should use ""Dear Professor Last-name."" If the instructor does not have a PhD, refer to them as ""Professor"" unless instructed otherwise. Taking a chance with ""Mrs"" ""Mr."" or ""Ms."" instead of ""Dr."" or ""Professor"" runs the risk of insult to the professor.


If your professor signs the reply with a first name, it is still best to address him or her as ""Dr. Last-name"" or ""Professor Last-name"" in an email. Do not use the professor's first name unless you have been explicitly invited to do so. You should also be sure to spell your professor's name correctly.

, Offer only as much information as is relevant to the situation and is likely to interest the professor.

,


Name the assignment or projects you are referring to instead of using pronouns or phrases, such as “this assignment”.

, (See the tip below). Be considerate, however, of how your solution might create additional work for the professor.

, Use your first and last name, and even if you know that your professor knows you by name, include your course and section information below your name. You will save her having to figure out what course and section you're talking about if she needs to look up something about the course in order to answer your question

, If your email is regarding an assignment or article, attach the document. This way your professor does not have to hunt around for it. You can also attach screenshots of any problems that you are having with online computer software.

, If you do not have spell-check on your email, then you can copy the message, paste it into a word-processing program, and run spell-check there. Consider not only the mechanics, but also what you have said. Strive for a polite tone, concise language, and clear purpose.

, Ask the person if your reader would be offended by such an email, if it were directed at him or her.


Make any changes necessary, and send to your professor.

, See tips below about how to address a professor's failure to reply. If you are sending only a piece of information (""I have the flu and will not be in class on Tuesday, but Sue will turn in my paper for me""), then the professor may not consider a reply necessary. In this case, you are done.


Leave enough time for a response. Some professors do not work on campus every day and may not have Internet access at home, so you may need to wait a few days.

, A simple ""Thank you"" may be enough. If necessary, write a more extensive email using these same guidelines to achieve a professional effect. If the case is not being adequately resolved by email, then ask for an appointment to meet in person.

Bring stationery and writing supplies.,
Pack study aids.,
Bring electronics.,
Obtain a list of required supplies for your major.,
Check for any special clothing requirements.",How to Fill Your Dorm Room With What You Need1," There are myriad school supplies you could need for your classes, especially your freshman year, since you will likely be taking a variety of general courses. Make sure to bring whatever you might need to be successful.


Generally, you’ll at least want to make sure you bring a planner, calculator, binders, notebooks, folders, flash drive, and lots of pens and highlighters.;
, One of your goals in college is most likely to perform well in your classes. To do this, bring study aids that will help you focus. While these can be different for every person, there are a few general aids that will help you be successful.


Laptop “feet” raise the bottom of your laptop so that it is in a more comfortable position to work.
An extension cord will give you the freedom to work anywhere in your room that you feel comfortable.
Just in case your roommate is not on your schedule, it is a good idea to bring a small reading light so you can continue studying while they are sleeping., Bringing the right electronics is also important. While you may have any number of small electronic gadgets, in general, you’ll want to make sure you have the following:


Laptop computer. When searching for a laptop, make sure it has all the capabilities you’ll need to complete your work, including the right operating system, enough storage, and the appropriate inputs.

For example, if you’re a business student, having Microsoft Office will be essential.
It is also important to keep size in mind. If you plan to leave it in your room, a larger laptop would be fine. However, if you plan to take it to the library or class on a regular basis, consider something small and compact.


Portable speakers are another common electronic college students should have. This will allow you to play music or re-play a lecture. Remember to bring headphones too so you can do this without disturbing your roommate.
Make sure you bring your cell phone as well. You’ll need to keep in touch with friends, family, and your classmates.
Also bring extension cords, surge protectors, and 3-2 prong adapters. This will give you the versatility to work from wherever you’re most comfortable.
Check with your college to figure out if your room is equipped with wireless internet and if there are on-campus printers you can use. If not, be sure to bring an Ethernet cable and a printer., You should be able to find a list of any special requirements for your major on your university’s website. If not, try contacting your advisor to find out any special items you might need.


For example, those studying Fine Arts will likely need a case for art supplies and their own sketch pads while Journalism majors might need a voice recorder or AP Styleguide.
In addition, review your class list and course descriptions to see if you need any special materials, like a certain software program or specialized calculator., Just like different majors may require specific supplies, they may also require specific types of clothing. Again, check your school’s website or ask an advisor to see what clothing requirements your major has.


For instance, students in the science department may be required to wear close-toed shoes on lab days and business students may need a nice suit for presentations.

Enroll in elective classes.,
Join, or start, a club.,
Join a sport.,
Attend games, lectures, and special events.,
Study abroad.,
Take advantage of opportunities.",How to Enjoy College1," Many colleges require students to take electives as a part of their curriculum. Colleges often offer unique and fun classes including wine tasting, bowling, scuba diving, and self-defense classes.To take a break from demanding classes, try taking something that you will enjoy or learn a new skill.;
, College campuses are notorious for having a club to fit just about any interest. If you have a hobby or interest, try and find a club to join. Or, if you can’t find one, create one!


Look around campus for flyers that advertise these clubs. Check high-traffic areas such as dorms, cafeterias, and/or classroom buildings.

, Sports can be a fun way to keep in shape and to meet new people. While you may or may not be able to get on the college football team, colleges often have amateur and co-ed sports clubs like hockey, soccer, or frisbee.

, Colleges may host special guest lecturers, celebrities, and/or bands. Watch your college special events page for more information on these events. Often, you can attend for free or a discount price.

, A number of colleges offer study abroad programs. Take advantage of this and visit a country you have always wanted to visit.Check with your advisor about what programs are available.
These trips can be expensive; make sure you can afford the means to go.
Some study abroad trips can fulfill credits for a specific major. Talk to your academic advisor about this option.

, Colleges offer many opportunities for professional and personal development. Keep an eye out for opportunities like:


Internships
Work placement/student work positions
Teaching assistant or research assistant positions

Pack the necessary bathroom supplies.,
Bring laundry supplies.,
Pack for your new bed.,
Pack snacks.,
Pack items to help you stay organized in a small space.,
Check the school’s recommendations.",How to Fill Your Dorm Room With What You Need2," Dorm living can be tough to get used to, especially having to use a shared bathroom. While most universities do have a communal bathroom, not all do. If you’re lucky, you might have a suite where you only share a shower with two or three other people. Check with your university to find out what your bathroom situation will be.


If you will be using a communal bathroom, pack accordingly by bringing shoes you can wear to/from (and in) the shower, a shower caddy with ample room, and a robe to wear to and from the shower.

It is a good idea to use a shower caddy that is plastic rather than fabric. A plastic caddy is much easier to clean if it gets wet.Bring towels and washcloths. Pack at least three of each so you will have clean ones to use without having to do laundry constantly.Ensure you bring all the toiletries you use on a daily basis, like shampoo, conditioner, face wash, moisturizer, razors, shaving cream, and so on. Once you get to school you may not have easy access to a store to buy anything you forgot., You will be responsible for washing all your clothes and linens at college, so you’ll need the appropriate supplies.


Pack laundry detergent, fabric softener, and stain remover. While you’ll want to have enough to last for a while, keep in mind you may be going up and down several flights of stairs to get to the laundry room. Look for smaller-sized jugs of laundry detergent and consider using dryer sheets instead of fabric softener.
Bring a drying rack for any clothes that can’t be put in the dryer. Get a rack that folds up so you can store it easily between uses.
Bring hangers for your wardrobe. While your university will probably provide a place to hang up clothes, you’ll need to bring your own hangers.
College is often the first time many people do their own laundry. If you’re new to this task, get a lesson before you leave for school., Find out the dimensions of the beds in your dormitory before buying sheets. This information should be available on your university’s website or in your orientation documents. Many schools have extra-long twin beds.


Be sure to bring at least two sets of sheets so you have a backup when one is dirty.
You may also want to bring a mattress pad for your bed, as university beds are not always super comfortable.
Also, remember to bring the rest of your bedding, like blankets, pillows, and a comforter., While you’ll most likely be eating most of your meals in the cafeteria, you’ll need to keep a few snacks in your room for in between meals.


Bring cookies, crackers, granola bars, and trail mix that you can store in small bins.
Also bring drinks for your mini-fridge, like water, soda, and juice, as well as items like string cheese and yogurt that don’t require any preparation.
You’ll likely have access to a microwave as well (although maybe not in your room) so bring items like popcorn, Easy Mac, soup, and premade dinners., Dorm rooms are known for being tiny. Therefore, to be able to fit everything you need into yours, you’ll likely need some items that are designed for maximizing storage in small spaces.


Bed lifts are great for maximizing space. Depending how much extra room you need, you can find lifts that raise your bed a few inches to a few feet.
Under-the-bed boxes are helpful for storing items you don’t use on a daily basis, like supplies for hobbies, extra shoes, or snack food.
Since you probably won’t have your own bathroom or much closet space, over-the-door hooks provide a great solution for hanging wet towels or bulky winter coats., Most universities have a list of items they recommend students bring to their dorm rooms, as well as a list of restricted items. This information should be available on the school’s website or in your orientation or housing documents.


Generally, schools do not allow students to have candles, halogen lamps, or certain electronic appliances, like space heaters or toaster ovens, because they can pose a fire hazard."

Email or call your future roommate.,
Pack a versatile wardrobe.,
Track what you use on a daily basis.,
Bring a first aid kit.,
Bring a sewing kit.",How to Fill Your Dorm Room With What You Need3," Roommates usually share the responsibility of bringing the large electronic items you’ll need to feel at home, like a mini refrigerator or television set. Dorm rooms are already small so you don’t want to have duplicate large items. Contact your roommate to decide who’s bring what.If you haven’t met your roommate yet, the university should be able to provide you their contact information.

, It’s not essential that you bring your entire closet with you, but you’ll want to have enough clothing to allow you to dress for any occasion and to go a week or so without having to do laundry. Finding the right balance can be tricky, so consider these tips when deciding what clothing to bring:


Start with about one week’s worth of basic pieces, like pants, tee shirts, and layering pieces. Once you have this packed, fill in your wardrobe with specialty items, like a bathing suit, nice dress, and business suit.
Consider whether or not you’ll be returning home on breaks. If you are able to return home on occasion, you can switch out your wardrobe between seasons. If you aren’t able to go home, however, pack what you’ll need for the entire year and plan on getting some extra storage (like those that fit under your bed) to stow away pieces you don’t need in the current season., We sometimes take for granted the items we use most in a day. Before you head off to college, take some time to track your most essential daily items. To do this, carry a notebook, or make notes in your phone, about what items you use throughout the day. After a week or so, go back through your notes and decide which of your most-used items are essential and which can be left at home.


For example, let’s say you wake up in the morning, have a cup of coffee, and then do some core exercises using a large balance ball. In this case, bringing your coffee maker (although you’ll want to bring a small one and double check they are allowed in your school’s dorm rooms) is essential. However, a large balance ball will be tough to store. Since you’ll likely have access to the school’s gym, leave the ball at home.

, Since you may not have easy access to transportation or a pharmacy within walking distance, bring a small first aid kit so you can take care of any minor medical emergencies that crop up.


Include things like band-aids, hydrogen peroxide, and Neosporin for minor cuts and scrapes.
Also bring cold and flu medicine, pain medicine, cough drops, and vitamin C to treat common colds or sore throats.
In addition, pack Pepto Bismol and Imodium for upset stomachs.#Pack a tool kit. Keeping a few basic tools around can be helpful as well. Although you won’t be allowed to put nail or screw holes in the wall, you may need these for other quick fixes, like a loose screw in your desk chair.
Include a hammer and a few nails in your kit.
Also bring a small screwdriver with several different types of heads.
A pair of pliers could prove useful as well., You may run into wardrobe malfunctions while you’re at school that can’t wait until you go home for break. Bringing a basic sewing kit will help you fix these in a pinch.


Bring a few neutral-colored spools of thread.
Include sewing needles in several different sizes.
In addition, pack a small pair of scissors.
Also throw in a few pins to keep whatever you’re sewing in place."

Know when you should use lukewarm water.,
Place the noodles in a large bowl or pot.,
Cover the noodles with lukewarm water.The water should be warm to the touch, but not yet steaming.,
Prepare the noodles for the next step.",How to Cook Rice Noodles1," If you plan on using the noodles in ""pad Thai"" or another stir-fry dish, use the lukewarm water method to partially cook the noodles so that they are somewhat soft but still hard on the inside.









This method also works well if you are adding the rice noodles to soup, but you can add rice noodles to soup without soaking or cooking them first.;
, Rice noodles are very brittle, so you need to be especially careful while handling them in their uncooked state. Otherwise, you will likely break more than a few.









Note that fresh rice noodles are soft, but most rice noodles are sold in their hard, brittle form. Fresh rice noodles do not need to be cooked or soaked in water. Instead, they are added directly to the dishes they are served in or steamed., Allow the noodles to soak for 7 to 10 minutes or until they just start separating.








, Since these noodles are only partially cooked, you will either need to transfer them to another dish immediately or store them in a way that prevents them from sticking together or drying out.









Drain the noodles. The easiest way to do so is to pass them through a colander.
Rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain once more.
Add the noodles into the stir-fry or soup if the dish is near the end of its cooking process.
If you are not ready to add the noodles to the dish yet, toss them with a small amount of sesame oil to prevent them from drying out or clumping together temporarily. Store in a sealed container at room temperature to further slow the drying process.

Know the basics.,
Prepare the pasta as normal.,
Begin tasting the pasta after about six or seven minutes.,
Continue tasting the pasta every 30 seconds to a minute.,
Drain the pasta as soon as it is done.",How to Cook Pasta Al Dente," You will be cooking pasta as normal; only the time will vary. You can follow directions on boxed pasta, or you can visit the wikiHow article.;
, Add salt to the water if desired.


Some boxes of pasta have directions for al dente. Because the directions aren't always perfect, you will have to taste the pasta as it is being cooked to know when it is al dente.

, At this point, it should still be somewhat crunchy. Remember to blow on the pasta to cool it before tasting.

, Al dente pasta will feel firm, not crunchy, when you bite down with your front teeth. You can also break a piece of pasta in half and look at the cross section—al dente pasta is mostly cooked with a small core of uncooked pasta running through the middle.

, Getting the timing right will take some practice, but eventually you'll be preparing al dente pasta like a pro!

Take the initiative.,
Get to know your roommates.",How to Enjoy College2," Going Greek is a great way to meet new people and be part of a community of like-minded individuals. These organizations often hold philanthropic events and host parties. Colleges often hold recruitment parties to help you get started in the processes of joining a group. Keep an eye out on flyers on campus or your college website for more information.

, To start a conversation with someone new, consider the following:


Sit next to a person you want to talk to.
Consider body language. If a person is open and willing to talk, s/he generally will make eye contact with you and smile. If a person does not want to talk, s/he may seem closed off and avoid eye contact.
Greet them an appropriate time, such as before or after class. Consider saying something like: “Hi, I’m Emily. It’s nice to meet you!”
Start a conversation about something you have in common. For example, in class, you might say: “Man, last week’s test was hard, wasn’t it?” or “Did you understand last night’s reading? I found it difficult.”

, Do not wait around and wait for invitations to fall into your lap. Take the initiative and invite people out to do something.


One way to do this is invite people from your class to join a study group. Once you get to know them, suggest doing something social. , If you are staying on campus in dorms, you may be forced to room with someone you do not know.

Study.,
Keep a planner.,
Get to know your professors.,
Keep a budget.",How to Enjoy College3," Not studying for college classes can cause your grades to plummet and you to be stressed out.To fully enjoy college, employ study habits to stay on track and not overwhelmed. Some good study habits include:


Keep a study schedule. Studying a little bit each day is more beneficial than cramming for a test the night before.
Take good and concise notes. You can use the Cornell notetaking method which includes dividing your notes into three sections for easier studying.
Study in a group. Not only will this help you make friends but also help you retain information by sharing notes and ideas.

, Write down important dates including due dates for tests and papers. This will help you stay organized and on track without being overwhelmed and stressed.Get in the habit of writing down your social engagements in the planner as well. This will help you visually focus and prioritize your time. For example, if you go to write “Party on Friday Night!!!” and you see you have a test on Monday, you might rethink your social strategy.

, This is beneficial to managing stress and helping out in a number of situations.Your professor can help you with material you are struggling to understand or help you if an emergency comes up. To get to know your professor:


Go to her office hours. They should be listed on a faculty website or the syllabus.
Read the syllabus. It will contain all important information including course material, test dates, and grade expectations. It will also help to answer any frequently asked questions for the course.

, If you want to enjoy a social life, it is important to have the money to do so. College is very expensive and learning to manage one’s money can be difficult. Setting a budget is essential to having fun and keeping money in the bank.To keep a budget, start a list of your income sources. Then, subtract your expenses. Start with known expenses such as rent, food, and utilities. Then, consider how much money you want to save or spend on social expenses.

Avoid alcohol and substance abuse.,
Stay alert.,
Take care of your mental health.",How to Enjoy College4," The percentage of alcohol and substance abuse is at its highest during college years. While a legal drink or two might be okay, know when you need to stop.Never take any substance and drive.

, No matter what situation you are in -- be it a party or walking around campus -- be alert to your surroundings.Watch for suspicious individuals or actions.


When walking around campus, always take well-walked routes and avoid walking around alone at night.
Check out your campus safety’s website. Often, campuses have emergency phones (they are often blue) scattered around campus for use.

, Almost half of college students reported feelings of depression or anxiety while in college.Check out your college campus resources for mental health.


Often, campuses offer free or cheap mental health care.
Talk to a trusted person (advisor, professor, resident advisor) if you are feeling down. They can help point you to helpful resources.

Know when to use boiling water.,
Place the noodles in a pot or heat-resistant bowl.,
Pour boiling water over the noodles.Unlike wheat noodles, rice noodles are not boiled in water over direct heat.,
Toss the noodles with sesame oil.",How to Cook Rice Noodles2," Boiling water can be used to partially or fully cook the noodles, but it is the only way to fully cook the noodles if you do not plan on cooking them further as part of another dish.









The boiling method works especially well if you plan on using the rice noodles in cool noodle dishes, including salads and bean dishes. Boiling the noodles is also recommended for flat rice noodles used as wrappers.

, Dry rice noodles are very brittle, so they must be handled carefully if you do not want to break them into tiny pieces.









Fresh rice noodles are not brittle, but they are not cooked with boiling water. Instead, they are usually steamed or added to recipes without being soaked first.

, Instead, they must be covered with boiling water and allowed to cook off the stove.









To fully cook the noodles, allow them to soak for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring them gently every 1 to 2 minutes to help loosen them. The noodles are done when they are completely limp. Thin, thread-like noodles may cook in less than 7 minutes, while flat rice noodles may take more than 10 minutes if they are thick.
Remove the noodles sooner if you plan on cooking them in another dish. The noodles should be pulled out once they just begin to separate if you plan on cooking them further in other hot dishes. This will only take a few minutes.
To create a chewier noodle, pre-soak the noodles in lukewarm water before cooking them in boiling water. Soak the noodles in lukewarm water until they are just barely pliable. Drain, then finish cooking in boiling water for an additional 2 minutes or until the center is chewy but not hard.

, Tossing the rice noodles with sesame oil will prevent them from clumping together or drying out, which is ideal if you plan on serving them on their own or in cold dishes.









Skip this step if you are immediately adding the rice noodles to another cooked dish.

"
"
Let the noodles sit out for a while.,
Put the rice noodles in the microwave for a few seconds.",How to Cook Rice Noodles3," If the noodles are over-soaked but not mushy or falling apart, you can dry them out somewhat by allowing them to air dry. They will not return to their fully dry state, but they will become partially dry.









Drain the rice noodles. The easiest way to do so is by pouring the contents of the bowls through a colander.
Lay the moist noodles out flat. Place them in a single layer on a large plate or platter. Allow them to dry for at least 30 minutes in a draft-free area.

, Place slightly over-soaked noodles in a microwave-safe dish and microwave for 5 to 10 seconds.









Drain the noodles by pouring them through a colander.
Place the noodles in a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 5 to 10 seconds. The resulting noodles will by chewy.

"
Serve in stir-fries.Thin, cooked rice noodles present a good alternative to standard rice for Asian-inspired stir-fries.,
Add to soup.,
Use the noodles in cold dishes.",How to Cook Rice Noodles4,"









Rice noodles are a key feature of Pad Thai, a specific type of stir-fry commonly consisting of eggs, fish sauce, red chili pepper, tamarind juice, and other protein and vegetable ingredients.
If adding the rice noodles to the stir-fry as it cooks, do so during the last few minutes and only partially cook the noodles beforehand.
If pouring the stir-fry ingredients over rice noodles after you finish cooking everything, use fully cooked noodles.
If using fresh noodles instead of dried, add them directly to the stir-fry during the last few minutes without previously soaking or cooking them.

, Rice noodles work well in Asian-inspired soups and soups belonging to other cuisine types, as well.









The best way to add rice noodles to soup is to add uncooked noodles to the broth during the last few minutes of cooking. Monitor closely to make sure that the noodles are not becoming overcooked.
You could also add partially cooked noodles to the the broth, but you should add them after the soup has already been removed from the heat and immediately prior to serving. The hot broth will be enough to finish cooking the noodles even without being over direct heat.

, Use fully-cooked rice noodles in dishes that don't require any additional cooking.









Asian-inspired vegetable salads, cold bean dishes, and cold soups are good examples.

Choose which pasta you want to cook.,
Fill a large pot 2/3 of the way with water.,
Turn the knob on the stove to high.

,
Add salt if desired.,
Wait for the water to boil.








,
Add pasta to the water and stir with a long spoon.,
Turn down the stove slightly, continue to boil the pasta, and stir every so often to prevent sticking.,
When it's been boiling for about 8-10 minutes (check the package for suggested cooking time), take a piece of the pasta out and allow it to cool.,
Bite into the pasta.,
Turn off the stove and empty the entire pot of pasta into a strainer.,
Shake out the excess water and then pour the pasta back into the pot.,
Add a tablespoon of olive oil and toss (optional).,
Cover with your favorite sauce and shake it (inside the hot pot).,
Add grated parmesan cheese, fresh parsley or basil leaves, or other garnishes as desired.








",How to Cook Pasta1," Try to pick one that suits the sauce well. It's best to use pasta that is a brand from Italy and is made of 100% durum wheat semolina.

, This will ensure that the water doesn't spill when it's boiling. Don’t under-fill the pot; this will make the pasta sticky. There should be a generous water-to-pasta ratio. To reduce your wait time, add hot water.








,, For a large pot of water, 1 or 2 tablespoons of salt should be sufficient.








,, Take care that the pasta doesn't stick to the bottom, especially when you first add it.









Since it can be hard to estimate just how much pasta you need, read the package for serving suggestions. If there aren’t any, read the Nutrition Facts for the number of servings per container and divvy up the dry noodles accordingly. If you’re cooking for two, a full package of pasta can usually make a full meal with leftovers.

, Do not cover the pot; traditional Italian pasta is cooked without a lid.








,









Alternatively, under-cook the pasta by 2-3 minutes (the outsides should be cooked while the centers should be hard), then turn off the stove, set the pot on another (cool) burner, and cover for 10-15 minutes. This will slow-cook the centers of the pasta, making them al dente instead of soggy.

, If it's too hard to bite or if you see white in the center, it needs to cook a little longer. When it's cooked all the way through but still firm, it's ready. This is referred to as al dente (“to the tooth”) in Italian.








, Tilt the pot away from yourself so you don’t get a face full of steam, which is even hotter than the boiling water.








, Be sure not to put the pot back onto the hot part of the stove, which can burn the bare pasta.








, While this will keep the noodles from sticking, it can also create a barrier between the noodle and the sauce you add, making the results less flavorful.








, See several recipes below for ideas.

;
, When you can feel the heat radiating, it’s hot enough to use.

,, Adding a pinch of oregano or Italian seasoning will infuse the oil with the herb essence. Allow it to sit for about 30 seconds depending on the temperature of the oil; the flakes will brown, but don’t allow them to smoke or turn black.








,, Since the garlic pieces are smaller than the onion, adding them later will prevent them from burning.

, If you have long, thin noodles, like spaghetti, you might need to break them in half to fit them all in the pot.


Don't add the noodles until the water has come to a rolling boil, or they'll end up getting soggy and mushy.
Add the noodles gently so you don't splash hot water back onto your skin.

, Depending on how thick the noodles are, you may need to boil them from anywhere from 5 minutes to 12. Read the instructions on your noodle package to determine the correct time.

, Pull out one noodle with a fork or slotted spoon. Taste the noodle. It should be soft enough to easily chew, but still have a bit of bite, meaning the noodle is 'al dente.' You can also try these other ways of testing whether the noodles are done:


Toss a noodle against the wall. If the noodle sticks, it's ready.
Look at the ends of the noodles. If they're white compared to the rest of the noodle, they need more time.
Hold the noodles up with a fork. If they swing easily back and forth, they're done.

, Pour the noodles into a colander to drain the water away.

, Stirring in just enough oil to finely coat the noodles keeps them from sticking together.

, Wheat and egg noodles are delicious with plain butter, olive oil, and salt and pepper. You can also use them as part of a casserole, add them to soups, or top with pasta sauce.

",How to Make Fried Noodles," Take ½ pound (220 g) of wide dried rice noodles, and use a pair of scissors to cut them into 8-inch (20-cm) sections. Cutting them shorter prevents them from being tangled together when they cook. Place the trimmed section in a large bowl.You can use egg noodles or soba noodles in place of the rice noodles if you prefer.;
, Pour enough hot water over the noodles to cover them. Allow the noodles to soak in the water for approximately 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are al dente.For the hot water, simply turn your tap on as hot as it will go and add it to the noodles.
If you soak the noodles in boiling water, they’ll take less time to soften. Usually, 3 minutes is all you need.
If you’re not using rice noodles, you may need to actually cook them before frying them. Check the package for instructions on how to prepare them.

, After the noodles are finished soaking, drain them well in a colander. Next, rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process. Place the noodles in a bowl and add a few drops of oil to keep them from sticking together before tossing them gently.You can use vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil to keep the noodles from sticking together.
If you’re worried about the noodles sticking together even with the oil, you can spread them out on a large baking sheet or tray so they aren’t tangled together., In a small bowl, mix ½ pound (220 g) of ground meat or shrimp, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of Shaoxing wine, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of potato starch, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Stir until all of the ingredients are well combined.For the meat in the dish, you can use ground beef, pork, chicken, or turkey, depending on your preference.
If you don’t have Shaoxing wine, you can use Japanese sake or dry sherry in its place.
The potato starch help keeps the meat tender during cooking. If you’re using a meat that’s higher in fat, such as beef, pork, or turkey, you can omit the potato starch if you want.

, In a separate small bowl, combine ¼ cup (59 ml) of chicken stock, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of dark soy sauce, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of sugar, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Stir until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.The dark soy sauce adds color to the finished dish. You can replace it with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of light soy sauce if you don’t have any on hand. The noodles will be lighter in color, but the taste will be the same.
If you don’t want to use sugar, you can replace it with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of oyster sauce or hoisin sauce.

, Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of peanut oil to a large wok or nonstick skillet. Turn the heat to high, and allow the oil to heat for approximately 3 minutes, or until hot.You can replace the peanut oil with grapeseed, safflower or vegetable oil if you prefer., Once the oil in the pan is hot, add 1 clove of garlic that’s been minced, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of grated ginger, and all of the white parts from 6 green onions that have been chopped into long slices and separated into the white and green portions. Keep the burner on high heat, and allow the mixture to cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until it begins to sizzle.You can customize the flavorings however you like. Feel free to omit the garlic, add extra onion, or incorporate chilis or additional flavorings.

, When the pan is sizzling, stir in the ground meat mixture. Allow it to cook on high heat until the outside is surface is slightly charred but the meat isn’t completely cooked through, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., After the meat is charred on the outside, stir 2 cups (470 g) of chopped mustard greens and the green portion of the 6 green onions into the pan. With the heat on high, let the mixture cook for approximately 30 seconds.You can add other vegetables and greens to the dish. Bok choy, edamame, broccoli, baby corn, and carrots are just some of the other options to consider. Just be aware that mustard greens and green onions cook more quickly than the other options, so you may need to give the stir fry longer to cook if you’re using extra veggies., After the greens and onion have cooked for a moment, pour the sauce that you made earlier into the pan. Stir the mixture a few times, and then add the rice noodles.Toss all of the ingredients several times or until all of the liquid is absorbed.The easiest way to toss the noodles and other ingredients is with a pair of tongs.

, When the dish is well mixed, remove the pan from the burner. It’s important to taste the noodles at this point to see if they’re the right texture. They should be soft but firm.If the noodles feel tough, place the pan back on the burner and add 3 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) of chicken stock or water to the mixture. Keep tossing the noodles and other ingredients until all of the liquid is absorbed.

, When the noodles are the right texture, divide them between two bowls. Eat while the dish is still hot.For garnish, you can top the noodles with some sesame seeds or chopped roasted peanuts.

, Most orzo comes packaged in one-pound boxes, so use half the box.

, You will want to lightly brown the pasta to give it a nutty flavor. This will take 2-5 minutes, depending on the heat. If it starts getting too dark too fast, take it off the stove. You want it to be toasted—not burnt.

If you're using an ice cream maker, freeze the bowl.,
Whisk the eggs together in a bowl.,
Gradually whisk in the sugar.,
Whisk in the Nutella.,
Add cream and milk.,
Assemble the ice cream maker.,
Run the ice cream maker with the liquid mixture inside.,
Serve immediately for a soft texture.,
Transfer to freezer for a firmer texture.",How to Make Nutella Ice Cream1," Ice cream makers come in lots of different shapes and sizes, but they almost always have a large, removable bowl that can be removed. Put this bowl in a plastic bag, then put the bag in the freezer for about 10 to 24 hours until it is completely frozen. The bag helps prevent freezer burn.This is important because there is a layer of liquid coolant between the inner and outer surfaces of the bowl. Letting it freeze completely ensures the bowl will stay cold as you make the ice cream (since you can't run the machine in the freezer).;
, Use both the whites and the yolks. Beat them with the whisk for about two minutes. Stop when you reach a uniform pale yellow color and a light, fluffy texture.

, Add a little at a time over about one minute as you whisk continuously. When the sugar is distributed evenly, you can proceed.

, Use a spatula as needed to get all of the Nutella out of the measuring cup. Continue whisking until the spread is blended evenly with the egg mixture.


If Nutella gets stuck to the whisk, use a fork or spatula to pull it off.

, Add each of these a little at a time, whisking as you go. Stir to combine evenly.


After this, put your mixture in the fridge while you proceed through the next step. You want your ingredients as cold as possible when you make your ice cream.

, For most models, this just means taking the bowl out of the freezer and putting it in the machine. You may also need to attach the stirring paddle to the machine or make other connections — consult the ice cream maker's directions for specifics.You shouldn't waste time here — you want to finish before the bowl starts to warm up. A wasted minute or two won't hurt you, but you'll want to move on as quickly as possible.

, Add your chilled ingredients to the mixing bowl, shut the lid (if your machine has one), and turn the machine on. The mixing paddle will begin to turn, churning the liquid ingredients.


Now, let the machine run for 20-30 minutes without interrupting.

, After 20-30 minutes, check on your ice cream. By this point, it should have gained a semi-solid consistency. If you want soft serve-style ice cream, you can serve it as soon as the ingredients reach a smooth, soft texture. Turn off the machine and spoon into cones or bowls and enjoy.

, If you want a more traditional ice cream, transfer the soft serve to an airtight container and store it in the freezer until firm (usually about eight hours).If you've recently finished a carton of store-bought ice cream, you can just rinse and dry the container and use it to store your ice cream.

Prepare the liquid ingredients from the recipe above.,
Fill the large bowl with ice and rock salt.,
Press the smaller bowl into the ice.,
Mix the liquid ingredients in the inner bowl.,
Transfer the entire thing into the freezer.,
Mix again briefly.,
For firmer ice cream, freeze as normal.",How to Make Nutella Ice Cream2," Making ice cream without the help of an ice cream maker is a little trickier, but the good news is that you don't need to change the main recipe at all. Mix the eggs, sugar, Nutella, cream, and milk according to the directions in the section above. When you have a smooth mixture, transfer it to the fridge to chill while you ready your makeshift ice cream maker.

, You want to add about enough ice to fill the bowl halfway to the top. Chopped ice is best here — the smaller the pieces of ice are, the more evenly they will cool the ice cream. Add the rock salt and stir to combine.


At this point, clear enough space in your freezer so that the large bowl can fit in it.
The rock salt is important because it lowers the temperature of the water past its normal freezing point, making the bowl colder than it would be with just ice. It also makes the ice melt slightly slower, though you should still work quickly so you can get the ice cream as cold as possible., Try to nestle the bowl into the ice so that it is almost buried up to the brim. This will get it as cold as possible.

, Carefully pour your ice cream mix from earlier into the smaller, inner bowl. Use a hand mixer set to medium-low to mix the ingredients at a steady pace or simply beat by hand with a whisk. Mix for 10 minutes without stopping.You can cover the inner bowl with a towel to prevent splashing while you mix.
Take care that no ice or salt water make their way into the inner bowl — this can ruin the taste.

, After 10 minutes of mixing, the ingredients probably still won't look like actual ice cream yet. This is OK. Carefully cover the inner bowl with a towel. Place the large bowl (with the small bowl still inside) in the freezer. Chill for 45 minutes.

, After cooling, scrape the surface of the ice cream with a fork or spoon. It should be semi-solid but soft (like pudding).Mix with the whisk or hand mixer again for another 5 minutes. This should leave you with something that resembles soft-serve ice cream.

, The ice cream is ready to eat as soon as you think it has a solid-enough texture. If you want firm, traditional ice cream, just transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and let it cool in the fridge for 8 hours or so (as specified in the section above).

Top with hazelnuts.,
Serve with cookies.,
Make an affogato by pouring espresso over the ice cream.,
Build a sundae with your favorite ice creams and toppings.",How to Make Nutella Ice Cream3," Nuts are great for adding a crunchy texture to your favorite ice cream dishes. Hazelnuts are a natural choice for pairing with Nutella ice cream. Shelled and chopped hazelnuts are excellent sprinkled over a bowl of ice cream, but this isn't your only option. For instance, you can use a few whole hazelnuts as a tasteful garnish.


While no ice cream dessert is going to be outright good for you, hazelnuts themselves have several health benefits like high fiber and folate content., Crisp cookies make the perfect companion for rich, smooth ice cream. Crisp wafer cookies work well — flavors like chocolate and vanilla are natural choices. Other good ideas include:


Biscotti
Round ""straw"" cookies (Pirouettes, etc.)
Chocolate sandwich cookies (Oreos, etc.)
Nilla Wafers

, The hazelnut flavor of Nutella pairs excellently with coffee, so this Italian espresso dessert is a special treat. To make an affogato, put a scoop or two of Nutella ice cream in a mug, then make a shot of hot espresso. Pour the espresso over the ice cream and eat immediately for a delicious mix of flavors and temperatures.


For added presentation, you can also try topping the ice cream in the mug with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and so on — it's up to you.

, Nutella makes a good centerpiece ingredient in decadent ice cream sundaes. This is your chance to get creative — there are dozens of delicious toppings that can make good choices here. Just a few are below:


Whipped cream
Caramel
Chocolate sauce
Fruit
Chopped nuts

Prepare your ice cream maker.,
Mix the milk and cream.,
Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla extract.,
Place the bowl in the fridge.,
Crush some Oreo cookies.,
Pour the ice cream mixture into the mixer bowl.,
Mix the ice cream.,
Add the cookies and continue mixing.,
Place the ice cream into a container.",How to Make Oreo Ice Cream1," Read and follow the instructions on your ice cream maker. Depending on the type of ice cream maker you have, you will need to prepare it in different ways, and some of these ways will require more time than others. Preparing your ice cream maker early will ensure that everything is ready for when the time comes to churn your ice cream. For example:


Some ice cream makers will require you to add salt and ice into the drum, while others will require you to freeze the mixing bowl in the freezer for several hours.
Some ice cream makers are hand-cranked, while others are electric and need to be plugged into an outlet.;
, In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk. Stir slightly to combine the two liquids.

, Add ¾ cups of sugar and ¼ teaspoon of salt to the milk and cream mixture. Stir with a spoon or whisk until the sugar is dissolved. You should not see any grains of salt or sugar. This may take several minutes.At the very end, add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of vanilla extract and stir until you achieve an even color.

, Once your ingredients are all combined, place the bowl into the fridge to keep it cool while you prepare the cookies and ice cream maker.

, In order to have Oreo ice cream, you will need to add some Oreo cookie chunks. You will need to crush enough Oreos to fill about 1 cup. You can crush or crumble your cookies in various ways:


Put some cookies into a blender or food processor and blend them for a few seconds. If you want finer pieces, keep blending the cookies for a few more seconds.
Chop up whole cookies into smaller pieces with a knife.
Place the cookies into a large, resealable bag, and smash them by hitting them with a mallet, or going over them with a rolling pin.
Crumble the cookies with your fingers.

, Locate the mixer bowl of your ice cream maker and fill it with your mixture. Do not fill the bowl all the way with your mixture, as the ice cream will expand as it freezes. Instead, fill the mixer bowl about half-way.If necessary, store the left-over ice cream mixture in the fridge.

, Follow the instructions on your ice cream maker, as each ice cream maker is different. Some require you to turn the crank manually by hand, while others will mix the ice cream for you. This can take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours.


If you do not have an ice cream maker, simply pour your mixture into a shallow, freezer-safe container and place it into the freezer. Stir your mixture every 30 minutes, and place it back into the freezer. Repeat this 4-5 times or until the ice cream is frozen., Just before the ice cream is finished, add the Oreo cookies, and continue mixing the ice cream.

, Once the ice cream is mixed and frozen, you can place it into a freezer-safe container. If you have any left-over ice cream mixture, you can add it to the mixer bowl and make more ice cream.

Crumble up some Oreo cookies.,
Add the cookies into your ice cream.",How to Make Oreo Ice Cream2," You will need two different sized bags: a small, pint-sized bag and a large, gallon-sized bag. The small bag will be used to hold the ice cream mixture, while the large bag will be used to hold the ice and salt. You need to be able to seal and reseal the bags.


If worried about making a mess, you can put the small bag inside of small bag. You can also put the large bag inside of another, similar-sized bag. This adds extra protection and helps prevent any liquid from seeping out and getting over your hands.

, Pour ½ cup of half-and-half or heavy cream into a small resealable bag. Add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sugar and ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract.


If you want your ice cream to be less sweet, use less sugar and vanilla flavor.
You can keep your bag stable by placing it into a small bowl, and then adding in the ingredients., Once all of your ingredients are inside the small bag, reseal it. Make sure that there is as little air as possible left in the bag once you seal it.You can do this by sealing the bag close part way, squeezing out the excess air through the small space left, and then sealing the bag the rest of the way.


If you are concerned about making a mess, you can put the bag inside of another, similar-sized bag once you have sealed it. Seal this second bag as well.

, Add 3 cups of ice and 1/3 cup of salt into your gallon-sized bag, and mix it up. The bag should be part-way filled with ice. If the bag is all the way full, then use less ice; you want there to be enough room for the smaller bag to fit inside.


Any type of salt will work, but larger salt crystals will work better., Move aside some of the ice cubes in the big bag, and wedge the small bag in between them. You want the small bag to be surrounded by ice. Once the small bag is sitting snugly inside, seal the big bag.


If you are concerned about liquid leaking out and making a mess, you can put the ice-and-salt bag inside another bag.
If the bag is too cold for you to hold, you can wrap it in a towel or wear gloves., Once the small bag is inside the larger bag, and both bags are tightly sealed, shake and knead the bag. Do this for about 10 to 15 minutes., Once the ice cream mixture feels solid, you can remove the smaller bag and discard the ice-and-salt bag. Your ice cream is almost finished.

, If your Oreo cookies are not crushed or crumbled, you will need to do so now. The crushed pieces can be as large or as small as you want them to be. They can even be a combination of large and small pieces.Overall, the pieces should be no larger than your thumbnail. You can crush or crumble your cookies in various ways:


Add some Oreo cookies into blender or food processor and blend them until you get the texture you want.
Use a knife to chop up some Oreo cookies into smaller pieces.
Place the cookies into a large, resealable bag, and smash them with a mallet or rolling pin.
Use your fingers to crumble the cookies. You will end up with mostly large chunks.

, Using a spoon or spatula, fold your crumbled cookies into the ice cream. You can use as many or as few cookies as you want.

",How to Make Oreo Ice Cream3," Pour 2 cups of cold heavy cream or whipping cream into a large bowl and mix it using an electric mixer. Blend it for about 3 minutes, or until peaks form and the cream is stiff.


If you do not have an electric mixer, you can use a food processor with a whisk attachment.

, Stir in 1 can (or 14 ounces) of cold, sweetened condensed milk into your whipped cream. If you wish to add some vanilla flavoring, you can add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir it until you achieve a uniform color.

, You will need about ⅔ cups of crushed Oreo cookies. The crushed pieces can be as large or as small as you want them to be, but overall, pieces should be no larger than your thumbnail. You can even have a combination of large and small pieces.Consider crushing the cookies in smaller batches of 5-10 cookies at a time, as opposed to all at once. You can crush or crumble your cookies in various ways:


Place some cookies into a blender or food processor and blend them for a few seconds. You can get some finely-ground up cookies.
Chop up whole cookies into smaller pieces with a knife. This will give you some larger and smaller chunks.
Place the cookies into a large, resealable bag, and smash them by hitting them with a mallet, or going over them with a rolling pin.
Crumble the cookies with your fingers. This will leave you with mostly large chunks.

, Using a spatula, fold the crumbled cookies into the mixture.Keep folding and stirring until the cookie bits are spread throughout the mixture. You want an even consistency.

, Transfer the mixture into a freezer-safe container and put it into the freezer. Let it freeze for at least 6 hours.,"

Test your recipe.",How to Write a Recipe," A recipe is a set of steps that lead to a delicious end. In a way, it's a gift from you to the people who read it. If you're writing down a recipe you've made so many times you could cook it in the dark, take a step back and think about the best way to present it to other people. Who will your readers be, and what is their cooking style? Your intended audience should influence the way you write your recipe.If you're writing down a family recipe to make sure it's never forgotten, authenticity will be important to you and your readers. You'll need exact ingredients and measurements so that people in future generations will be able to recreate Grandma's biscuits or Uncle Benny's chili and taste a piece of family history.
If your recipe will have a public readership, tradition is less important than taste and accessibility. Make sure your readers will be able to find the ingredients you list, and ensure the final outcome will be tasty enough to make it worthwhile for your readers.
Consider the skill level of your readers, too. Decide if there are ways you can make the recipe easier to follow for beginner cooks. If there's no getting around complicated cooking techniques, write the steps out as clearly as possible.

, Set out all the ingredients required to make your recipe. You may need to cook the recipe more than once to make tweaks, so make sure you have plenty of each ingredient. Don't forget to measure out water, ice, and other ingredients you might be inclined to leave out.

, Get out all the pots, pans, spatulas, whisks, and any other equipment needed to make the dish. If you normally use specialized equipment, like an electric mixer, determine whether people without the equipment can make the recipe by hand. You may want to provide alternate options and ideas to make the recipe as accessible as possible.

, Imagine that you're making the recipe for the first time, and make the recipe the way you want your readers to make it. Start with the prep work, preheat the oven or stove, and build the recipe using raw ingredients. As you work, pay attention to the measurements and techniques you use, and the order in which you incorporate the ingredients.


Take notes on what you're doing. Write down measurements for each ingredient. Describe each step of the process using common cooking and baking terminology. Be sure to record each and every step - you can edit later if you need to.
Consider taking photos. Colorful step-by-step photos can draw readers in and provide helpful information on complicated techniques. Try taking pictures of each step as you go, or have someone else take pictures while you work. Even if you don't include step-by-step photos, you may want to have at least one picture of the finished dish.

, For each ingredient, write exactly how much you used. List all the measurements in a consistent format - either imperial or metric (or both, if you'd like).Use consistent abbreviations for measurements. For example, tsp. or tbs for teaspoon or tablespoon.
If an ingredient doesn't have a numerical measurement, capitalize it. For example, Olive oil.

, It's standard to list ingredients in order of use so that it's easy for the reader to keep track of which ingredients have been used.

, For example, if you're writing a recipe on baking a cake, all the dry ingredients will probably be sifted together at once. Since you can't list them in order of usage, list them in order of volume: 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and so on., In many cases you may need to use one ingredient in several different steps in the recipe. For example, you may cream butter with sugar to make coffee cake batter, then use butter again later to make a crumb topping. For instances like these, list the total amount of butter followed by the word ""divided"" - as in, 6 tablespoons butter, divided.

, If the recipe has two or more separate components, like pie crust and pie filling, divide the ingredient list into two or more sections. Title each section appropriately. Write For the filling, For the crust, and so on.

, Unless a specific product is absolutely necessary to make your recipe turn out correctly, try to list generic, raw ingredients instead of name brand products. For example, instead of writing 2 cups Angelsoft flour write 2 cups cake flour., In order to make the method section of your recipe less wordy, you can include simple techniques like chopping, mincing, and melting as part of the ingredient list. List the ingredient measurement first, followed by the technique. Here are a few examples:


1 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons shallots, minced
1 1/2 cups bell pepper, finely chopped
2 apples, peeled and sliced

, Equipment can make or break a recipe, so be very specific about the size, shape and composition of the supplies needed to cook a dish. For example, write Use a 9-inch pie pan or In a large cast iron skillet or frying pan, to direct your readers as carefully as possible.


Let readers know if one type of equipment can be substituted for another. For example, a blender might do in the absence of a food processor.
You may want to include a list of special equipment needed - a double boiler, kitchen twine, a baking stone, and so on.

, Break it down into simple steps and describe each technique using common cooking or baking terminology. Long, complicated steps should be separated into their own paragraphs to make the method easier to follow. Don't use too many adjectives or provide too much information - just the minimum needed for the recipe to turn out right. Here are a few examples:


Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the shallots and onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute longer.
Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda and salt.

, If the recipe calls for the use of an oven, be sure to write exactly what temperature to preheat it to. For stovetop cooking instructions, use common terms like ""medium high"" and ""medium low"" to indicate how hot the pan should be.


Temperatures can also be described through techniques. For example, write simmer on medium low to indicate that a soup shouldn't be at a rolling boil.
Indicate how long the food should cook. Write Bake for 20 - 25 minutes or Cover and let simmer for 1 1/2 hours.

, Since everyone's oven and stove are a little different, it's helpful to add hints about how the food should look, feel and smell at various steps. Here are a few examples:


Bake until the cheese is bubbly, about 15 minutes.
Bake until the top is brown and crisp.
Simmer until the flavors have melded.
Cook until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Cook until the quiche filling is just set.
Cook until the salmon's flesh is opaque and firm.

, Recipes with multiple complicated techniques need a method section that is broken down into separate paragraphs. Each paragraph should encompass a complete part of the recipe. In a pie recipe, for example, separate the method for making the crust from the method for making the filling.

, The last part of the method should indicate how to complete the dish, whether that means letting it cool for 10 minutes before slicing or garnishing with chopped cilantro. Describe how the final dish should look and taste so your readers will know what to expect.

, A descriptive title will help attract people to your recipe and set it apart from the thousands of variations out there. There's no need to get too descriptive - your recipe will speak for itself once it's cooked! Just come up with a title that sounds appetizing and appealing, with a personal twist if you're so inclined. A few examples:


Tricia's Cocoa Brownies
Sweet and Sour Chicken Soup
Crunchy Salty Oatmeal Cookies
Uncle Pete's Famous Clam Chowder

, If your recipe has a special history, consider including a short introduction so readers will know how much heart and soul has gone into its creation. Write about who first cooked the recipe, tweaks that have been made over the years, or anecdotes about times people in your family have enjoyed it.

, Add any extra information that readers should know when they're cooking the recipe. Here are a few things you might want to include:


List how many servings the recipe provides.
Write how long the recipe takes to make, including prep and cooking time.
Include serving suggestions, such as optional garnishes or other dishes that pair well with the recipe (e.g. ""Top with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream"" or ""Serve with slices of crusty baguette.""
Include ingredient substitutions to account for dietary restrictions (e.g. ""Cashews may be substituted for walnuts"" or ""Use tofu instead of chicken to make the dish vegetarian"").
Give sufficient warnings about any problems which may occur during the cooking. An example of this might be Do not open the oven door while baking, or your cake may fall, or Do not let the oil get too hot on the stove.

, When you're writing your recipe, compose it in a way that makes it easy to read. If you wish, sprinkle photos throughout to make instructions even easier to follow. The standard information order in recipes is as follows:


Title
Introduction (optional)
Ingredient list
Method
Number of servings
Cooking/prep time

, Once your recipe is complete, cook it again to test it. You might also want to share it with someone else who has never made it before. See if the recipe as you wrote it turns out ""just right."" If it is too sour, sweet, salty, spicy, or otherwise fails the taste test, consider what you might do to correct the problem, then begin the process over again.


Guessing an adjustment, either in ingredients, cooking times, or temperatures does not always yield success. This is the reason ""Test kitchens"" are operated like laboratories, and results are carefully documented and repeated.

Roma tomatoes, which are a dense, fleshy, and meaty tomato variety, are particularly good candidates for drying. They tend to dry more quickly than some other varieties of tomato.
For drying, select tomatoes that are ripe, but not over-ripe. Super-juicy tomatoes are difficult to process and dry because they've got so much liquid in them. Try to get tomatoes at their peak of ripeness.;
, If you're not a fan of tomato skins, a quick extra step can give you delicious dried tomatoes without the skins. To prepare the skins for blanching, cut a small X into the skin to make removing the skin easier.


Prepare a medium pot of boiling water and quickly blanch the tomatoes by dunking them into the water for no more than 30 or 45 seconds.






Plunge the tomatoes quickly into a bowl of icy water to drop their temperature quickly. This process should essentially cook the tomato skin so it slips off easily, without affecting the texture of the tomato much. Since you're drying it anyway, it works easily.






Peel or slip the skin off. It should come off quite easily from the incision you've made. If you don't get it all, don't worry.







, Depending on the size of your tomatoes, you can simply halve them or cut them into quarters, if you've got bigger tomatoes and want smaller dried bits. While they look big at this point, removing the moisture from the tomatoes shrinks them considerably. A half tomato isn't much bigger than a small prune after you dehydrate it.

, Cut out the white part where the stem meets the tomato and remove any discolored parts of the tomato.


If you want to, you can remove the seeds. Roma tomatoes typically don't have many seeds to remove, which--again--makes them a good candidate for this process.

, You want to spread them evenly so the drying process will be consistent across your batch. Don't clump the tomatoes in a big pile, but spread them in an even layer across the drying rack or the sheet pan you're using, depending on your preferred method of drying.

, You can use whatever seasonings you'd like to use to gives a touch of flavor to your dried tomatoes, but a small amount of salt and pepper is typical. Remember that the tomatoes will shrink considerably when you cook them, intensifying the flavors you add, so don't add too much salt to the tomatoes. For a whole batch of tomatoes, a teaspoon or two is probably safe, given your taste.


Basil and oregano are also common additions to dried tomatoes. Use either the fresh or dried varieties for your batch.






You can highlight and intensify the sweetness of a variety of tomato by adding a small amount of sugar. Drying some varieties can make them slightly bitter, so adding a few pinches of sugar to dried tomatoes can ensure that they stay nice and sweet like the fresh variety.







, The easiest way to dry tomatoes is by using a food dehydrator. Most models will even have a tomato setting, which will set the machine at an ideal temperature for drying your tomatoes.


Follow the instructions for your particular dehydrator and check the tomatoes periodically to make sure you haven't shriveled them into cat chews.

, Set the oven to the lowest possible temperature that you've got. It's easy to overdo it if you're using the oven, so only use the oven to dry your tomatoes if you've got a setting somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 F (65 C).


Use cookie sheets or baking trays to dry the tomatoes. It'll take anywhere between 12 and 24 hours to complete the drying process, and you'll probably want to check them periodically to make sure you're not burning or cooking them.






Flip the tomatoes halfway to ensure that both sides of the tomatoes are dried evenly. If you've got an uneven oven, shift them around some to make sure that they dry consistently.







, If you live in a place that gets particularly hot at the time of year you've got a big crop of tomatoes, you can use the soaring temperatures in your car to do some extra duty and give you delicious dried tomatoes that involve no energy whatsoever.


Spread the tomatoes on a cookie sheet, season them, and place them on the dashboard after parking your car in a spot that will optimize the amount of sun it gets. Cover the tomatoes with a cheesecloth or paper towel to avoid collecting dust or bugs, and bring the tomatoes in overnight when it gets cold. It might take longer (more like 48 hours) but you won't be using any energy to do it.Sun-drying your tomatoes is an always popular technique as well.

, Tomatoes are done when they still have some bend in them and a deep red, leathery texture. It should be more like a raisin than a dried pepper, with a slightly sticky or tacky feeling about them., One popular way to store dried tomatoes is packed tightly in extra-virgin olive oil in a bowl or jar. Pack a mason jar or a regular bowl with the tomatoes and fill in the cracks with some tasty olive oil. Keep these in the refrigerator for several months.Add chopped garlic or other flavors like hot peppers or rosemary to give some extra bite to the tomatoes.







, If you've dried the tomatoes well, they should keep well in ziplock bags on the shelf or in the fridge for several months. Pack them about half full in storage bags and squeeze as much of the air out as possible to ensure the longest shelf life.


You can also keep them in airtight containers or jars the same way. They should be fine on the shelf from 6 months to a year.







, While there's not much purpose in freezing the tomatoes after you've dried them, it's an option if you've got a full shelf and an empty freezer. Keep them in airtight bags and freeze them for as long as you want.

Assess how many people you need to feed and how far the leftover sauce or chilli will go.,

It is up to you how much of anything you use depending on how many people you need to feed. Each portion will be two thirds leftover based and one third sweet potato, kumara or potato mash so work out how many you can cater for on that basis.;
, If you need to make the Bolognese sauce, chilli or similar go further (feed more people) you can use tinned chilli beans, Ratatouille, tinned baked beans, a jar of tomato or capsicum pepper based pasta sauce, tinned tomatoes, tinned chilli, some of all of these or anything else you think will taste good and have in stock or need to use up.

, The final dish will be baked in the oven. You can mix your leftovers with the additions in an oven proof dish that you can serve the completed dish in or a separate bowl. If you mix the leftovers and additions together in a bowl, you will need to transfer the mixture into an oven proof dish. The mixture should fill two thirds of the oven proof dish.

, Kumara is highly recommended here! Use ordinary potatoes if you prefer or if you have some that you need to use up. If you have mashed potatoes to use up, even better, use them up! If in doubt, add more kumara or potato, too much is easier to manage than not enough.

, The smaller you chop them, the faster they cook, putting the lid on the pan will help too. If in doubt, slightly over cooked is better than under cooked.

, Pour the water out of the pan but keep the kumara or potatoes in.

, You can add butter or a butter substitute to the mash. Add no more than a standard portion per person if you aren't a confident cook, add as much butter or butter substitute as you like if you've made mash successfully before. Kumara is tasty with or without butter. Ordinary potatoes can be a little bland without any butter. Add salt and pepper to taste. You can add whole egg, egg yolks, milk, cream, spring onions, cooked finely chopped white onions, grated or shredded cheese to the mash if desired.

, Essentially, you're making a pie. The mash is the topping. Spread the mash evenly over the ""pie filling"". Add grated or shredded cheese on top if desired. For an attractive finish, run the tines of a fork over the mash.

, The oven should be heated to a medium heat. The topping will brown slightly. When the filling is piping hot, you can take your creation out of then oven and serve it.

, You can add bread, vegetables, corn chips and dip on the side / as an accompaniment if you want to.

"
Cut the tomato in half.,
Open up the tomato.,
Scoop out the seeds.",How to Seed Tomatoes1," On a cutting board, turn the tomato sideways, so that the top is facing to the right or left. Cut down the middle of the tomato towards the board. If you think of the tomato as the Earth with the North Pole being the top of the tomato, you'll be cutting through the Equator., Place the tomato cut-side up on the cutting board. You should be able to see that the tomato is basically divided into four even sections with seeds and gel in between each section. You're trying to keep the flesh that's dividing up the seeds., Find a small spoon, such as a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon. It should be smaller than a regular spoon. Scoop out the seeds, being gentle with the flesh. If you want, you can place the seeds in a strainer over a bowl to drain out the juice for later use.The nice part about this method is you can now stuff the tomato halves with something, such as goat cheese.

"
"
Slice the tomato in half.,
Open the tomato up.,
Squeeze the tomatoes.",How to Seed Tomatoes2," Like the previous method, you start by turning the tomato on its side. Your cutting the tomato in half, but through the side rather than down the top. You'll end up with the top of the tomato being one half and the bottom of the tomato being the other half., Once again, you need to pull the tomato apart to reveal the center and the seeds. While you'll see a division among the seeds, you probably won't be able to keep as much of the flesh with this method. However, it's a quick method to remove seeds., Over a strainer and a bowl, squeeze the seeds out of the tomato. Simply hold the tomato with the skin in your hand and the cut side over the bowl. As you squeeze, you'll release much of the seeds in the middle. You may smash the tomatoes up a bit with this method, so if you want a pretty presentation, try another method."
"
Cut the tomato up.,
Cut the bit of flesh at the top of each tomato.,
Slice or scoop the seeds away.",How to Seed Tomatoes3," Start by cutting the tomato into quarters. Start from the top, slicing down towards the bottom. You'll end up with two haves. Slice each half into two pieces. Now you have quarters of the tomato that you can easily remove the seeds from., The seeds are held on to the top of the tomato by a bit of flesh. You can slice through it, going down towards the bottom. It only takes a little cut to get through it, but be careful of your fingers when cutting it. Use a tiny knife or spoon for this purpose., Now that the flesh is cut, you can simply remove the seeds. Run a knife under them, or use a spoon to scoop them out. You can place them in a strainer over a bowl, so that you can retain the juices for another part of the recipe."
"
Bring a pot of water to boil.,
Blanch the tomatoes.,
Place them in a bowl of ice water.,
Peel off the skin.,
Pull out the seeds.",How to Seed Tomatoes4," The easiest way to peel a tomato is to blanch it, which just means it spends a short time in boiling water. If you're peeling and seeding your tomatoes, you need to remove the skins before you remove the seeds so you don't make a mess and lose half the tomato., Start by making an ""X"" on the bottom with the knife. Then, you can either add the tomatoes to the pot or pour boiling water over the tomatoes in a heat-safe boil.If you add the tomatoes to the pot, use a slotted spoon to add them in so you don't splash hot water. Once they have been in there for 15 to 30 seconds, move them out.Work in small batches, as you want to get them out of the water quickly.
You'll know the tomatoes are ready to come out because the skins will start to wrinkle.

, Once the tomatoes come out of the boiling water, they need to immediately go in a bowl of ice water. The ice water stops the cooking process, so you end up with tomatoes that are easy to peel but that haven't been cooked yet., Once the tomatoes have cooled (it shouldn't take very long), pull them out of the water one-by-one, peeling them as you go. Since they've been blanched, all you'll really need is your fingers to pull off the peel.It should come right off. If it doesn't, you need to blanch the tomato a bit longer.

, Cut into the top of the tomato. You can simply use your fingers for this process, though you may also use a spoon. Scrap out the seeds and gel part of the tomato. If you're making a sauce, scrap the seeds into a strainer over the bowl. That way, you can use the juice in your sauce."
"
Remove the seeds from the gel.,
Spread the seeds out to dry.,
Let them dry.,
Save them for later.",How to Seed Tomatoes5," The gel can harbor bacteria when you're trying to save tomato seeds. Therefore, it's best remove the seeds from the gel before saving the seeds. The easiest way is to pick the seed out of the gel with the tip of a butter knife before moving on to drying.Another option is allowing the seeds to ferment. Basically, you just let the seeds sit on the counter somewhere in their own juices for a day or so. Place them in a strainer, and the gel should wash off. You may need to rinse them more than once. Don't save any seeds that float.The fermentation method will generally allow you to keep seeds longer, up to 5 years, but you can use the knife method to keep seeds for a year or two.

, Leave the seeds on a paper plate, part of a paper towel, or a coffee filter. They need to be spaced an inch or two apart. In fact, you can even plant the paper towels or coffee filters next spring, as they are biodegradable.It's best to only use the paper plate for the fermentation method, as then the seeds don't need as much help drying.

, The seeds can take up to a week or two to dry. They should be crackly when the are dry. That is, if you try to fold one, it should crack not bend. Make sure they aren't in the sun. Just keep them in a corner of your house at room temperature.If your area is particularly humid, it may take them longer to dry.

, Once the seeds are dry, you can place them in an airtight container or even an envelope. If you used coffee filters or paper towels, just fold them up with the seeds, and put them in the container. With the paper plates, you can dump the seeds into the container. Make sure to label it with the tomato variety and the date of when you saved them seeds.Store the seeds in a cool, dry place.

Serve your fish sticks.",How to Make Healthier Fish Sticks," Make sure to cut off any skin that may be on the fish first. Once this is done, begin to slice the fish into thin, even strips. A simple way to make finger-sized sticks is to cut the fish into strips about one inch (2.5 cm) wide then cut across them to make them about three inches (7.6 cm) wide.White fish, including cod, halibut, and tilapia, are commonly used for fish sticks and are available, healthy options.;
, For this recipe, you’ll need three bowls. They all need to be wide enough to fit one piece of cut fish at a time. Start by filling the first bowl with ½ cup (120 mL) all-purpose or whole wheat flour.While some fish sticks are made without flour, the flour helps the breading stick.

, In your second bowl, crack open two eggs. Add a tablespoon of lemon juice, then stir the mixture with a whisk or spoon until the eggs are beaten.

, Retrieve the third fresh bowl. Add ½ cup (120 mL) dried breadcrumbs, ¼ cup (60 mL) grated parmesan cheese, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon paprika, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. Mix the ingredients together with a spoon or other implement.Change the breading ingredients to achieve your personal taste. For example, you can remove the cheese, substitute in lemon-pepper seasoning, or use a packaged seafood seasoning.

, Before you begin working with the fish, prepare a tray to contain the breaded pieces. Use a stick of butter or butter-flavored cooking spray to lubricate the pan so the fish doesn’t stick. Coat generously.If you want to avoid butter, try spraying a little olive oil cooking spray on the breaded fish. With a spray, you control how much oil you use and won’t add much fat to the recipe.

, Take one strip only. Put it in the bowl, then roll it around so that all the sides are evenly coated with flour., Once the piece of fish is coated with flour, move it to the egg bowl and repeat the process. Place it in the bowl and roll it around until the entire piece is coated with the egg mixture., Move the floured, egged strip to the bowl containing the breading ingredients. Like with the other stations, press the fish into the breading. Move it around until all sides are coated.

, Lubricate the pan with butter or cooking spray if you haven’t yet. Lay the coated stick on the pan, then repeat the above steps with more of your fish strips. Move the finished ones to the pan, laying them so they don’t touch.

, Set your oven to a temperature between 400 and 450 degrees F (204-232 degrees C). Depending on the strength of your oven and the size of your fish sticks, cooking time will vary., Leave the tray to sit in the oven for 10-15 minutes. The longer you leave the sticks in, the more golden and solidified the breading will be. When the fish is opaque, flaky, and cooked through, it is done cooking.


You can also fry the fish in oil on a stovetop, but the oil makes it less healthy than baking.

, Once the fish looks cooked and the breading browned to your preference, the sticks are ready to eat. They can be dipped in a ketchup, tartar sauce, or a homemade sauce. Leftover sticks can be sealed in foil or a plastic bag and stored for up to four days."

Place them on a baking sheet and use a ladle to scoop gumbo into each ramekin., Take the defrosted puff pastry sheet and lay it on a floured counter. Use a rolling pin to roll it out. The puff pastry should be rolled big enough, so you can cut pieces of pastry that are larger than the size of the ramekins. You can use a knife to cut out circles or use a large circular cookie cutter to cut the three pieces.You'll want the pastry to hang over the sides of the ramekins a little.

, Crack one large egg into a small prep bowl and add 1 tablespoon of water. Whisk the mixture together with a fork. Dip a pastry brush into the egg wash and brush the sides of the ramekins with the wash. Set the puff pastry circles on the ramekins and brush the puff pastry with the egg wash.The egg wash will help the puff pastry stick to the ramekins and will help the pastry brown as it bakes.

, Cut a few small slits in the top of each puff pastry top. Put the baking sheet with the ramekins in your preheated oven. Bake the pot pies for 30 to 35 minutes. The puff pastry should turn golden brown and you may see some of the filling bubble up through the slits.Let the pot pies cool for 5 to 10 minutes before you serve them.

Choose fresh oysters.,
Have the right supplies on hand.,
Understand oyster anatomy.",How to Shuck Oysters1," Oysters should still be alive when you shuck them; if they've already expired, they aren't safe to eat. Pick oysters with the following properties:


Closed shells. If an oyster's shell is open, it's likely that it's already dead. Lightly tap the shell, just in case; if it immediately shuts, the oyster is still alive and fine to eat.
A fresh sea smell. Fresh oysters smell both sweet and salty, like the air next to the sea. If an oyster smells fishy or ""off,"" it's probably not fresh.
A heavy feel. Place the oyster in your palm. If has a nice heavy weight, that means it's still full of seawater and was probably harvested quite recently. If it's unexpectedly light, the seawater has dried up, and it's no longer fresh.;
, Besides a nice sack of fresh oysters, you'll need the following supplies:

A stiff-bristed brush
Heavy gloves






An oyster knife, or another knife with a heavy blade that won't snap
A bed of ice for keeping the oysters fresh until serving







, Before you start shucking, take a close look at an oyster so that you know the right way to handle it while shucking.

The hinge is the muscle that connects the top and bottom shells at the pointy end of the oyster.






Opposite from the hinge is the rounded front of the oyster.






The top of the oyster is the flatter shell.






The bottom shell is cup-shaped.







"
"
Put on the gloves.,
Scrub the oysters clean.,
Grasp an oyster in one hand, cup-side down.,
Insert the oyster knife into the hinge.,
Run the blade along the top of the shell.,
Open the oyster.,
Serve the oysters.",How to Shuck Oysters2," Oyster shells are sharp, and you'll definitely cut yourself if you aren't wearing a pair of tough rubber or canvas gloves when you're shucking them. Don't forego this simple safety measure.

, Use the stiff-bristled brush to scrub the ocean grit from the oysters.


Rinse the scrubbed oysters in cool running water.
As you handle each one, make doubly sure the oysters are alive and fresh.

, The curved side of the oyster should be against the palm of your hand. The point, or hinge, should be facing toward you.

, Point it down into the cup of the oyster. Use a twisting motion to separate the top and bottom shells. You should feel the hinge pop when you twist the knife.

, Work the blade as close to the top of the shell as possible, and run it from the hinge around to the other side of the oyster. Continue using a twisting motion to separate the top and bottom shells.


The shell will be very tightly closed, so be careful not to let the knife slip as you do this.
Do your best not to break the shell into pieces. A few stray bits may get inside, but the shell should stay mostly intact.
Don't tip the shell from side to side or turn it over, or the delicious juices inside will pour out.

, When the top and bottom shells are separated, open the oyster, taking care to hold it level. Run the knife along the top shell to separate any remaining meat.


Check the oyster for shells or grit.
If you wish, carefully separate the oyster meat from the bottom shell, so you or your guest won't have to do so before eating the oyster. Place it back in the bottom shell before serving.

, Place shucked oysters on a bed of ice, still swimming in their juices.

,,, Cut those pieces into smaller fillets, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or 1 1/2 inch (3.8 cm) thick.

,, Brine recipes can vary widely based on preference. You can add different spices to the brine or to the fish before smoking it.


A basic brine for 5 pounds (2.25 kg) of sturgeon is 1/2 gallon (2 liters) of water, 3/4 cup (230 g) of salt, 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of coarse ground black pepper, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of onion powder.

,,


Pieces an inch (2.5 cm) or thicker should sit in the brine for 8 to 12 hours. Thinner slices should take 6 to 8 hours. The longer fish are brine, the heavier their cure.
Do not pack the sturgeon fillets too tightly together or the brine won't soak into each piece.

,,


A low-speed fan can help the drying process.

,,


Typical woods used to smoke fish are hickory, oak, apple, maple, birch, beech or alder.

Stir everything together until they are evenly combined. This will create a sweet-tasting crust. If you have a different crust recipe that you prefer to use, you can try that one instead.
, Start by adding 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of butter into the flour mixture, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of butter. The dough will be crumbly, which is fine., Start with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water, knead the dough a little, then add the second tablespoon (15 milliliters)., Towards the end of the chilling period, you can start preheating your oven to 350°F (177°C). This way, by the time you are done rolling, cutting, and forming the crusts, the oven will be the right temperature for baking., Cut the dough in half first; this will make it more manageable. Roll out one of the halves to ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) thick. Save the other half for later., The circles need to be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) bigger than the mason jar lids. You can use a glass or bowl that is the right size, or you can set the lid down on the dough, and cut ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) around it with a paring knife., Take a wide-mouth, two-part Mason jar lid. Pop out the bottom part and flip it over. Place it back into the ring, so that the rubbery part is on the outside and the metal part is on the inside. Do this for all six lids, then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper., Place the circles into the lids first. Use your fingers to gently form them against the inside walls of the lids. When you are done, pierce the bottom of each crust 1 to 2 times with a fork.This will help the bottom stay flat when you bake it and prevent it from bubbling., Preheat the oven first, then bake the crusts for 2 to 3 minutes. Take them out of the oven, and allow them to cool. Don't worry if they look under-baked; you will finish baking them later with the filling., Stir them together with a rubber spatula until they are all mixed together.You can also use your own filling instead. In this case, prepare the filling according to your recipe., This allows the fruits to release their juices and the flavors to blend together. After a few minutes, give the filling another stir., Each pie gets about 1 to 3 tablespoons of filling. Avoid overfilling your pies, however, or they will burst while baking., You will be using this batch of dough to make the upper crust for your pies., These circles will be going right on top of the pies, so they need to be the same size. If you know how to create a lattice crust, you can create one instead., Gently place the cut circles on top of each pie. Use your fingers to pinch the edge of the upper crust against the edge of the baked crust., These are the vent holes and will allow the steam to escape during backing. For a nicer touch, have all three slits point towards the center, like a start or three-petal flower., Beat the egg in a cup with a fork or mini whisk. Use a pastry brush to coat the top of each pie with the beaten egg. Add a sprinkle of raw, chunky sugar over each pie before the egg wash dries.This is not absolutely necessary, but it will give your pies a nice touch.

, They are ready when they turn golden and the filling starts to bubble., Run a knife around the inside edge of the lid, then push the bottom of the lid upward. Slide the pie off of the lid, and onto a serving tray."

Purchase dried marrowfat peas.,
Cover the dried peas with water the night before.,
Add bicarbonate of soda (optional).,
Soak overnight.,
Rinse the peas.,
Bring to a boil.,
Season to taste.,
Simmer until soft.,
Serve warm.",How to Make Mushy Peas1," These are large, starchy peas left to dry on the vine before harvesting.A British food purist would say this is the only true ingredient for mushy peas, but it can be tough to find outside of the British Isles, Middle East, and Japan.Elsewhere, look for marrowfat peas in British import stores and international markets.


Marrowfat peas may be labeled with the variety name Maro or medullare.If you can't find marrowfat peas, use whole dried soup peas, or follow the recipe for fresh or frozen peas instead.;
, The night before you plan to make mushy peas, put 8 oz (225g) dried peas in a large pot. Cover with roughly three times their volume of cold water.Not all peas are sold pre-cleaned. Pour out the water and rinse if you see any dirt, rocks, or other materials., A teaspoon (5 mL) of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) helps soften the peas and keep them green, although they may still end up on the grey side compared to the bright, artificial color found in tins and pubs. Unfortunately, the soda will also break down some of the vitamins found in peas, so skip this step if appearance isn't important to you.


Some marrowfat peas are sold with a tablet of bicarbonate of soda for this purpose.
The bicarbonate of soda also reduces the sugars that cause flatulence, but only by a small amount., Leave the peas in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours if possible, and preferably 16.If you're on a shorter schedule, you can cut corners with these faster but less reliable methods:


8 hour soak: Add 1½ tbsp (22mL) salt to help break down the peas and soak in the fridge.(The idea that salt makes legumes tougher is a myth.)
1 hour soak: bring the pot of peas to a boil. Remove from heat after 2 minutes, cover, and leave on the counter., Strain out the soaking water and rinse the peas thoroughly. Some cooks and food scientists prefer to cook in the same water for flavor and nutrients, but there's a chance this contributes to gas., Return the peas to the pot and add just enough fresh water to cover them. Cover and bring to a boil.

, Try ½ tsp (2.5 mL) each of sugar and salt, or adjust to taste. Go easy on the salt if you plan to serve it with a salty dish such as fish and chips or meat pie.

, Remove the lid and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the peas turn into a soft mush with some individual peas still visible, about 1½ hours.Feel free to remove the peas from heat early if you prefer a less mushy texture.


You can add small amount of water if the peas start to dry out while they're still chewy. Once finished, though, the peas should be mostly dry.
Stir occasionally to prevent the peas sticking to the bottom. Be gentle to avoid smashing the peas., In Britain, mushy peas are often served as a side next to a pub meal, or as a street fair snack with a meat pie. Eat it plain, stir in butter, or season with mint sauce.


Store leftovers in the fridge for 24 hours, or freeze indefinitely."

Eat immediately.",How to Make Mushy Peas2," In unfortunate areas where marrowfat peas are hard to find, you can make do with fresh or frozen peas instead. Just avoid ""petite"" peas, which won't keep their texture in the mash. The popular English peas or garden peas are a fine choice, though they won't have the same taste as the traditional mush.Frozen peas often have more flavor than supermarket ""fresh"" peas.The older English peas get, the less sweet and more starchy they become — although this isn't necessarily a bad thing for mushy peas., Rinse the peas in a colander. Discard any brown or wrinkled peas.

, Put the peas in a steamer basket above ½ inch (1.25cm) of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the peas are soft and their skins are well wrinkled. This takes about ten minutes for fresh peas.Frozen peas will cook faster, perhaps in as little as five minutes.If you don't have a steamer basket, boil fresh peas for five minutes or frozen peas for three.You'll lose some flavor with this method.

, While not traditional, these American additions make for a much richer side dish. Melt 1 tbsp. (14g) of butter, then combine with the peas along with 1 tbsp. (15 mL) heavy cream, plus salt and pepper to taste.For a lighter and somewhat more traditional flavor, skip the cream and add a squeeze of lemon juice and a sprig of finely chopped mint.If you want to go haute cuisine, you could also add browned scallions, bacon, or any ingredients you might add to split pea soup.

, Using a potato masher, fork, or immersion blender, break up the peas until they form a mash. Don't go too far: you should still see pea skins and partially intact peas.

, Serve the mushy peas as an accompaniment to fish and chips or another British-inspired meal. Leftovers can be stored in the fridge and reheated for several days.

Then, trim about half an inch from the top of each artichoke.Make sure to use a sharp knife. Artichoke are somewhat tough before they're cooked., Artichokes have leaves that circle the stem. The tips of these are sharp and pointy, so they should not be eaten. Before microwaving your artichoke, use a pair of scissors or kitchen shears to snip the pointed tip off each leaf., Lemon will help the artichoke from browning during cooking. Cut a lemon in half and rub down the full surface of the artichoke. Pay special attention to the trimmed edges. These tend to brown the easiest., Get a glass microwave-safe dish big enough to contain all your artichokes. Place your artichokes in the dish with the stem-end up in the dish.If you don't have a glass dish, another microwave-wave safe dish big enough to hold your artichokes should be sufficient.

Combine the raisins and liquid in a saucepan.Place the raisins inside a small saucepan.,
Boil the mixture.,
Let stand for 5 minutes.,
Drain the raisins.,
Use as desired.",How to Plump Raisins1," Pour water into the saucepan as well, using just enough to completely cover the raisins.


Water works well as a default option, but for something more flavorful, experiment with other liquids. For instance, consider trying grape juice, orange juice, or another fruit juice. For more mature palettes, consider a little diluted wine or rum.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove over high heat. Heat it until the liquid starts to boil, then immediately remove the saucepan from the heat source.

, Cover the saucepan with an appropriately sized lid and set it aside in a room temperature spot. Allow the raisins to soak in the hot liquid for a full 5 minutes.

, Pour any excess liquid out of the pan or remove the raisins from the pan using a slotted spoon. Regardless of how you accomplish it, you simply need to remove the plumped raisins from the liquid.


You could drain the liquid by pouring the contents of the pan through a small colander. Alternatively, place the lid on the pan, leaving a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) gap between the pan and the lid on one side. Pour the liquid out through this gap, carefully preventing the raisins from slipping through.
If you need the raisins to be somewhat dry after you plump them up, spread them out onto a couple layers of clean paper towels. The paper towels should absorb some of the excess liquid.

, The raisins should be plump and ready to enjoy at this point.

Arrange the raisins in a microwave-safe dish.,
Sprinkle the raisins with water.,
Microwave for 30 to 60 seconds.,
Let stand.,
Use the raisins.",How to Plump Raisins2," Place the raisins in a microwave-safe plate or bowl, spreading them out so that they lie flat in a single layer.


The raisins need to be in a single layer instead of being stacked on top of each other. Keeping the raisins in a single layer will ensure that they absorb the water more evenly during the heating process.

, For every 1 cup (250 ml) of raisins used, pour 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water over the dried fruit.Spread the water out as evenly as possible.

, Cover the dish and microwave the raisins on high until the raisins appear to absorb the water.


If the container has its own lid, verify that it is also microwave-safe before using it. For any dish that does not have its own microwave-safe lid, consider covering the container loosely with plastic wrap or a paper towel.
Keep the dish slightly vented on one side to prevent pressure from building up inside.
Note that the liquid will not be completely absorbed when you pull the dish out of the microwave. The raisins should begin to look plump, but the rest of the absorption will occur upon standing.

, Stir the heated raisins and replace the cover. Let them stand out at room temperature for 2 to 3 minutes after that.


If you would prefer the raisins to be somewhat dry, pat them gently with paper towels after they have had a chance to absorb the liquid and cool down.

Water is the most common option used with this method, but you can experiment with other liquids for a more flavorful alternative. Grape juice enhances the raisins with their natural flavor, but other fruit juices, like orange juice or apple juice, can add greater depth and complexity. Alcohol, like wine or rum, could also be used.
Instead of a traditional kettle, you could heat the water with an electric kettle or small saucepan, if preferred.

, Place the raisins in a small bowl and pour the boiling water on top, making sure that the dried fruit remains fully submerged.

,, Remove the raisins using a slotted spoon or pour them through a small colander to separate them from the liquid.


It might be a wise idea to drain the excess liquid from the surface of the raisins by spreading them out onto clean paper towels. Gently pat them dry with additional paper towels to dry them even more thoroughly, if desired.

, The raisins should be plump, juicy, and soft at this point. You can eat them like this or use them in a recipe that would benefit from plumped raisins.

Even though this method is labeled as a ""cold soak,"" the water and alcohol should actually be at room temperature. Do not chill them before use.
This method is referred to as a “cold soak” simply because no heat is used.
Note that you must use some form of alcohol for this method if you want it to be as affective as possible. Wine is not the only alcoholic option you could use, though. For something a little less sweet, consider using rum, instead.

, Pour the raisins into the bowl with the diluted alcohol, making sure that they are completely submerged in the liquid.

, Allow the raisins to soak in the mixture for a full 30 minutes without disruption.


Make sure that the raisins are soaking the mixture at room temperature. Do not chill them or heat them during this time.

, Remove the raisins from the alcohol using a slotted spoon. They should be notably plumper by this point. Squeeze them gently with your fingers to remove any excess liquid, if desired.


If you don't have a slotted spoon handy, you could pour the contents of the dish through a small colander, instead. Discard the liquid and reserve the raisins.
Consider draining the excess surface moisture off the raisins by blotting them with clean paper towels or allowing them to sit out on clean paper towels for a few minutes.

Wash and trim the beets.,
Boil the beets.,
Drain the beets and remove the skin.,
Cut the beets on a cutting board.,
Make the pickling brine.,
Pour the cooled brine over the beets in the jar.,
Let the beets pickle in the refrigerator for at least one week.",How to Pickle Beets1," Fresh beets often have bits of dirt on them, so use a vegetable brush if necessary to scrub it away. On a cutting board, remove the greens and stems using a sharp knife.


When you're choosing beets, make sure they're firm and unbruised. Beets that are soft to the touch or discolored are not fresh enough to pickle. Make sure to use high-quality fresh beets.
If your beets came with the greens attached, you can save them and cook them up for a tasty green treat. Beet greens are delicious chopped and sauteed in butter or olive oil.;
, It's necessary to cook them before you pickle them, and the most common way to do so is boiling. Place the beets in a medium-sized pot with water. Bring it to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer. Cover the pot and allow to cook for 25-30 minutes.There is another way to cook the beets: you can roast them. This will result in a slightly different final texture and flavor. Wrap them in aluminum foil and roast at 350 °F (177 °C) for about an hour, until the beets are cooked through., The beets should be tender to the touch, and the skin should come off easily using your hands. You may want to let them cool for a few minutes before handling.

, It's common to slice beets for pickling, but you could also cut them into quarters or bite-sized pieces. Whole beets will take longer to completely pickle than sliced beets. When you're finished, place beets into one or more large jars.


Glass mason jars are the best storage containers for pickled beets, since the glass won't react with the pickling brine.
Do not use a metal or plastic container, since these materials could react with the pickling brine and taint the beets.

, Add the vinegar, water, sugar, and garlic to a small pot. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Allow the mixture to cook for five minutes, then remove it from heat and allow it to cool completely.

, You should have enough to completely cover the beets. Cover the jar and place it in the refrigerator.

, Stir the mixture occasionally so the brine touches all edges of the beets. Pickled beets can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three months.

Transfer the fries to the baking sheet.,
Bake the fries until they are lightly browned.,
Serve the fries warm.",How to Make Rutabaga Fries1," To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the fries when they’re ready, set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully. Next, use a piece of parchment paper to line a large baking sheet for the fries.You can substitute foil for the parchment paper if you prefer.
It’s important not to place the rutabaga fries directly on the baking sheet, though, because the edges will burn more quickly.;
, For the fries, you’ll need a large rutabaga. Use a vegetable peeler to take off the skin, and then use a sharp knife to cut the rutabaga into strips that are approximately ½-inch (13-mm) thick.The exterior of some rutabagas are coated with wax to lock in the moisture. If yours has a waxy film, it may be easier to use a knife to peel it.

, After you’ve cut the rutabaga into slices, place the fries in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil, and mix well so all of the fries are coated.If 1 tablespoon isn’t enough to coat all of the fries, drizzle in a little more until they’re all covered.

, When the fries are coated with the olive oil, add ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of pepper, ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of lemon juice to the bowl. Toss all of the ingredients so the rutabaga fries are evenly seasoned.You can add whatever whatever seasonings that you like to the fries. Garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and dried oregano are tasty options.

, Once the rutabaga fries are seasoned, use tongs or a clean hand to place them on the lined baking sheet. Make sure that they are in a single layer so they’ll cook evenly., Place the baking sheet with the fries in the preheated oven. Allow them to cook for approximately 30 minutes, or until the fries are a light brown color.To ensure that the rutabaga fries cook evenly, turn them over every 10 minutes.

, When the rutabaga fries are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow the fries to cool for 3 to 5 minutes, and then transfer them to a platter or dish. Serve them while they are still warm.You can pair the rutabaga fries with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ketchup, garlic aioli, or ranch dressing.

When you're finished, set the canning supplies on a clean dishcloth until you're ready to fill up the jars.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions to heat up your canner in preparation for canning beets. You can use either a plain open water bath canner or a pressure canner., After scrubbing and trimming off the green part, put the beets in a large pot and cover them with water. Boil the beets for 30 minutes, until the skins start to come off on their own. Let the beets cool before peeling them.

, Slicing them into small pieces will allow you to pack more beets into your canning jars, and the seasonings will penetrate the pieces more easily., Using the method for making traditional pickled beets, mix up the vinegar, water, sugar, and garlic to a large pot. Bring the ingredients to a full, rolling boil.

, Carefully put them in the boiling brine and cook them for 5 minutes. Make sure the mixture is boiling before you pour it into the jars.

, Fill each jar to within 1/2-inch of the top. It's important to leave a little headspace so that the jars don't pop open in storage from the pressure. Put the lids on the jar and screw the rings on until they're snug, but not too tight.

, Operate the canner according to the manufacturer's instructions. The standard processing time for beets is 30 minutes, but this can differ depending on what type of canner you're using as well as your altitude.

, Lift them out of the canner using a jar lifter and let them rest on the counter until they come to room temperature.

, If the jars were properly canned, the lids should be sucked down. Remove the rings from the jars without removing the lids to be sure they are properly suctioned in place. If the jars were properly canned, place them in a cool, dark pantry for storage. They have a shelf life of about one year if kept in cool, dark conditions.


If the lids pop off when you remove the rings, the canning was not properly done. You can still eat the beets if you place the jar in the refrigerator right away, but you won't be able to store the jars for a year with the other properly canned beets.

Next, line two large baking sheets with parchment paper so the fries won’t stick.If you prefer, you can line the baking sheets with silicone baking mats.

, The fries require one large rutabaga. Remove the skin with a vegetable peeler, and cut it into long, thin strips as you would with a potato French fries.Instead of one large rutabaga, you can use a couple of smaller ones.
You can cut the fries to any thickness that you like, but a ½-inch (13-mm) thick is the usual size.

, Place the rutabaga in a large bowl. Add 1 ½ tablespoons (22 ½ ml) of olive oil, 3 sprigs of fresh, chopped rosemary, 2 minced garlic cloves, ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of garlic powder, ¼ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of salt, and ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of freshly ground black pepper. Mix well so the fries are evenly coated with the seasonings.If you prefer a stronger garlic flavor, you can add more cloves of fresh garlic.

, Once all of the rutabaga fries are coated with the seasonings, arrange them on the lined baking sheets. Spread half of the fries on one of the sheets and the other half on the other sheet so all of the fries are in single layer.If you don’t have two baking sheets, you can bake the rutabaga fries in two batches.

, When the fries are on the baking sheets, place them in the oven. Allow the fries to bake for about 30 to 40 minutes or until they are crispy.Be sure to turn the fries every 10 minutes so they don’t burn.

, When the fries are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Sprinkle a little more salt over them if desired, and transfer to a plate to serve.The fries pair well with simple ketchup or creamy dipping sauces, such as a parmesan aioli.

Serve the fries while still warm.",How to Make Rutabaga Fries3," Prepare the oven for baking the fries by setting the temperature to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius) and allowing it to fully preheat. Next, line two baking sheets with foil.You can substitute parchment paper for the foil if you prefer.

, You’ll need a large rutabaga to make the fries. Take off its skin with a vegetable peeler or knife, and use a sharp knife to cut the vegetable into strips in your desired length and thickness.It’s best if the fries aren’t larger than ½-inch (13-mm) thick.

, Transfer the fries to a bowl, and add 1 ½ tablespoons (22 ½ ml) of olive oil, ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of garlic salt, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of smoked paprika, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of cayenne pepper, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground red chipotle. Toss the fries with the seasonings to ensure that they’re evenly coated.You can adjust the amount of each seasoning to suit your taste and make the fries as spicy or smoky as you like. For spicier fries, add more cayenne pepper and ground chipotle. For a smokier fries, add more paprika.

, When the fries are seasoned, place them on the lined baking sheets. Divide them evenly between the two sheets so all of the fries are arranged in a single layer., Place the cookie sheets in the preheated oven. Let the fries bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until they are crispy.The fries can burn quickly, so when you reach the 30 minute mark of baking, check them every 5 minutes to see if they’re done.

, When the fries are done, remove the baking sheets from the oven. Allow the rutabaga fries to cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a platter while still warm for serving.Because the fries are spicy, they pair best with a creamy dipping sauce, such a ranch dressing.

Use a cheese grater or similar device.,
Try using a food processor.",How to Mince Vegetables," Wash your own hands in warm, soapy water for about 20 seconds. Then, rinse your vegetables under the faucet, gently rubbing as needed to remove any stuck on dirt.








You may need to use a vegetable brush on tougher vegetables, like squash, to get out stuck on dirt and debris.;
, Things like onions, potatoes, and garlic should usually be peeled prior to cooking. You can simply peel off the skin of onion or garlic, but things like potatoes and squash require a vegetable peeler.








When peeling an onion, you may accidentally peel off the top layer when removing the skin. You can still use an onion after peeling off the top layer, so do not worry if this happens.
Not all vegetables require peeling prior to cooking. Consult your recipe to see if you need to peel your vegetables first.

, Cut off any ends with leaves or stems. Then, cut the vegetables in half length-wise. This will make it easier to dice them prior to mincing.







, Hold the vegetables with bent fingers as you cut, keeping your fingers just behind the knife. This allows for greater control while cutting. Cut the vegetables length-wise, keeping the slices about half an inch to a quarter of an inch apart. When you're done, you should have several thin slices of vegetables.







, Take the perpendicular slices you just made and place the vegetables on a cutting board. Keep them close together when lining them up, but be sure to avoid any overlap.







, Take your knife and cut along the vegetable slices cross-wise. Make a series of cuts, each one about a quarter of an inch apart, running down the lines of vegetables. When you're done, you will be left with small blocks of diced veggies.







, Some overlap here is okay, as mincing is a less precise process than dicing. Your pile should be small and compact. You can either use your knife or hands to push the vegetables together.








If you use your hands to push your veggies together, wash your hands first.

, Start at one end of your pile. Place the palm of your hand on the dull side of the knife. Use your palm and the hand holding the knife to rock the knife back and forth, following the natural curl of the blade. Move the knife across the pile of veggies gradually, continuing this gentle, rocking motion as you go.







, Continue with the same basic motions, moving the knife back and forth across your vegetables. The goal is to get the vegetable pieces as small as possible. Once you notice some of the veggies forming a paste-like liquid, stop. This is a sign that the vegetables are adequately minced as they're starting to lose form. Minced vegetables should be mostly solid.








Times vary depending on the type of vegetable you're mincing. Softer vegetables, like garlic, will mince faster than sturdier vegetables like potatoes.

, Minced garlic is commonly called for in recipes. A garlic press is a device used to mince garlic quickly. You simply peel the garlic, place it in the press, and squeeze the press closed to mince. Garlic presses are cheap and can be purchased at most grocery stores.







, A cheese grater, or a similar device, speeds up the mincing process. You simply run the vegetables over the grater after peeling them. They should break apart in tiny, delicate piecesIf a grater is not the best choice for delicate vegetables, like garlic, as will cause them to form a paste.

, You can run vegetables through a food processor to mince them quickly. You can do so after dicing the vegetables into small, bite-sized chunks. If an actual food processor is out of your budget, buy a mini-food processor."

Wait as long as the instructions recommend.",How to Make Wine from a Kit," Look for an all-inclusive kit, containing all the additives you'll need, pre-measured (so you don't have to buy and measure them yourself). You can get a kit that is composed solely of pure juice, or a kit that comes with concentrated juice. The pure-juice kit requires no additional water, but is typically more expensive and needs to be refrigerated.
, Before making your wine, have all your equipment ready to go. Timing is critical. Read the instructions that came with your kit carefully, so you know what you'll need to do and when. The remainder of these instructions will give an overview; the exact process will vary from kit to kit., There is a difference in ""Sanitizing"" and just washing your equipment. The kit you buy should come with a sanitizing agent. Prepare and use it per the instructions on the package., Mix well. Draw a sample and take a hydrometer reading., The yeast should come pre-measured, but in case you're measuring your own, remember that you can't really add too much yeast, but you can add too little (which leads to bacterial spoilage).,, When it is as low as the instructions require (e.g. 1.020) it's time to rack the wine. The lower your fermenting temperature, the longer it will take to reach this stage. Test daily.,

Clean and sanitize siphon rod and hose, hydrometer and test jar, wine thief, carboy, bung and airlock. Rinse well.

,, It should be lower than before (the instructions should specify what specific gravity you're looking for). Make sure you get the same measurement for two days in a row (ensuring stability) before racking, or else the wine might not clear properly., E.g. ""Dissolve contents of package(s) #2 (metabisulphite) and package(s) #3 (sorbite) in ½ cup of cool water. Add to carboy and stir very vigorously for 2 minutes to disperse the stabilisers and drive off CO2. Again, be sure to stir up the yeast sediment from the bottom of the carboy."",, Wait for the wine to reach the desired specific gravity and clarity, then rack again...and again...as instructed. You may need to add sulphite powder during this phase., It will help make the wine ready to drink sooner and will make the wine stabler. Many homebrew shops loan or rent filtration units; ask the retailer how to use it., Clean and sanitise the needed number of wine bottles, siphon rod, hose and siphon filler. Rinse well. Siphon your wine into the bottles and seal with a good quality cork. After corking, store bottles in a dark, cool, temperature-stable place, standing upright for three to ten days. Then lay down all bottles. After a day or two, check the bottles and re-cork any you find leaking., Be patient! Usually you need to wait 2-3 months before even tasting the wine, but you can let it age for a year or longer for the flavor to improve."

Avoid peeling your fruit.,
Wash with water.,
Fully chew your food to release nutrients.,
Have fruit first thing in the morning.,
Pair fruit with meat.,
Note the best way to eat fruit.",How to Maximize the Benefits of Eating Fruit1," If you want to maximize the benefits of eating fruit, leave the peel on (unless it's inedible) to get more fiber and antioxidants than you would if you discarded the rind or peel before you ate it.Colorful skins often have the most concentrated amounts of nutrients in the fruit, meaning sometimes the peel is more healthy for you than the fruit itself.
The antioxidants in apple peels may help prevent cancer.Apple peels also are a good source of pectin, a type of fiber that helps control blood sugar and can decrease your cholesterol.;
, You should always wash your fruit before you eat it, especially if you're planning on eating the peel. However, it isn't necessary to use soap or special fruit washes to do it — rinsing under lukewarm water is sufficient.Plain water typically is enough to remove any dirt on the skin, as well as any pesticide residues that may be present.
Some fruits, such as apples and tomatoes, have waxier skins. The wax is harmless and you don't need to worry about scrubbing it off before you eat.

, Chewing your fruits break down rigid plant cell walls, opening up the nutrients for your body and allowing you to absorb more nutrients.Cutting and mashing fruits has the same effect, but make sure you use a sharp knife and eat them soon after. A dull knife may lead to electrolyte leakage, and you risk loss of flavor, texture, and nutrients if you cute the fruit and don't eat it right away., To maximize the benefits of eating fruit, eat it for breakfast. Eating fruit on an empty stomach is a great way to get nutrients and fiber to start your day.For example, you might include blueberries in a bowl of oatmeal, or slice up some strawberries or bananas on top of your cold cereal.
A fruit smoothie can be a faster option if you don't have a lot of time in the morning to sit down and eat breakfast.
If you want a bagel or toast, you can spread fruit on top. However, you should check the labels of any fruit spread carefully and make sure there isn't any added sugar.

, Your body better absorbs iron (from meat and non-meat sources alike) when it is consumed along with vitamin C, which both helps release the mineral and blocks other compounds in food that inhibit iron absorption.Using citrus fruits to glaze meat is a great way to tenderize your meat and help you absorb the iron. Examples include lemon or orange chicken and orange glazed pork chops.

, While most fruits are best consumed raw, cooking certain fruits actually increases their nutritional value. For instance, heating tomatoes increases the bioavailability of lycopene, and beta carotene."
"
Try to include fruit with every meal.,
Keep fruit handy.,
Eat fruit before or during exercise.,
Have dried fruit around for snacking.,
Bake fruit.",How to Maximize the Benefits of Eating Fruit2," The natural sugar in fruit is better for you than having a sugary dessert, so you may want to try having a piece of fruit after your main meal instead of a piece of cake or pie.You also can include fruit in side dishes, or use fruit spreads for dipping. Citrus fruits work well as glazes, or in salad dressings.
Many fruits, such as apples and pears, work well mixed in stir fries with meat and vegetables. Don't forget that some foods you may consider vegetables, such as tomatoes, peppers, and avocados, are actually fruits., If you keep the fruits you buy out in the open where you can see them, you'll be more likely to simply grab a piece of fruit when you're hungry rather than hunting through the fridge or pantry for something else.Since most fruit should be stored at room temperature anyway, it makes more sense to have a bowl on the kitchen counter rather than hiding it away.
Use a larger bowl and keep a variety of different fruits available, so you can pick something that suits your taste and the time you have to eat. Check the bowl regularly to make sure the fruit isn't going bad.

, You may have seen athletes eating fruit on the sidelines of a game, or before practice. Fruit contains healthy carbohydrates that are easy to digest, so you won't feel weighed down while exercising.Bananas also are rich in potassium, a nutrient that can help prevent muscle cramps when exercising.
An apple or a banana 10 minutes or so before exercising will give you the fuel your body needs for maximum performance.

, While fresh, raw fruit is the best way to eat fruit if you want to maximize the nutritional benefits, dried fruit can be just as nutritious. Include dried fruit in trail mixes or energy bars.Dried fruit also can be a good option if fresh fruit isn't available in your location year-round. Ideally, you want the fruit you eat to be in season, and dried fruit can work well during the winter months.
When snacking on dried fruit, keep serving sizes in mind. Only a few pieces of dried fruit can equal a recommended serving of fruit, even though the pieces are so small.

, Though heating most fruits can decrease their nutritional value, if you're trying to increase the amount of fruit in your diet, baking may be an enticing way to do so. Cut up fruits like peaches, nectarines, and apricots and place them in a pan. Cover the pan with foil and bake at 350°F (176.7°C) for 45 minutes, or until the fruit is soft and syrupy. Add 1/2 cup of the baked fruit to plain oatmeal, plain yogurt, or any other plain foods that you want to naturally sweeten."
"
Focus on color.,
Go for whole fruits over juices.,
Store your fruit properly.,
Eat fresh fruits in season.,
Read labels on canned or frozen fruit carefully.",How to Maximize the Benefits of Eating Fruit3," The outside color of a fruit (or of its peel) can give you a good indication of the nutrients that particular fruit provides. When trying to consume a variety of fruits, try to buy those with different colored peels or rinds to maximize the benefits.Red fruits, such as tomatoes and cherries, are high in vitamins A and C.
Orange fruits, such as oranges and peaches, provide you with a healthy boost of vitamin A, potassium, iron, and zinc.
Yellow fruits, such as bananas and pineapples, are good sources of folic acid. Bananas also are an excellent source of potassium.
Blue or purple fruits, such as blueberries and eggplant, provide antioxidants as well as Vitamin C.

, Generally, you get the most nutritional value from fruit by eating the whole thing rather than just drinking the juice. Additionally, commercial fruit juices often come with added sugar or other preservatives.Juice can be a good source of many vitamins as well, but you shouldn't use it as a substitute for eating whole fruits. Drink no more than 4 ounces per day.
If you do buy commercial juices in the grocery store, check the labels carefully to make sure there is no added sugar or other chemicals. Organic juices typically are good choices.

, For all fruits except berries, heat and light degrade their nutritional content. Store your fruit in a cool, dry place, or at room temperature out in the open. However, make sure they're away from direct sunlight.The exception to the direct sunlight rule is if you are trying to ripen the fruit. For example, putting tomatoes in the windowsill will make them turn red if they were picked too soon.
If you cut your fruit ahead of time, store it in an airtight container with a squeeze of lemon juice to keep it from going bad.
Avoid putting any fruit, including tomatoes, in the refrigerator. They may not be as flavorful and won't fully ripen.

, The most nutritious fruits typically are those bought during their harvesting season — fresh off the tree or vine. While your local grocery store may have all kinds of fruit available year-round, these are grown on industrial farms out of season, and aren't as nutritious as those grown seasonally.Your local farmer's market is a good source of fresh fruits in season. You also might try specialty grocery stores such as organic grocery stores.
While it isn't necessary that all the fruit you eat be grown locally (and in some areas this may be impossible), locally grown fruit typically is more nutritious because it wasn't picked early and shipped long distances. Once fruit is picked, it is separated from its nutrient source and can't gain any more nutrients.

, While canned and frozen fruit can be just as nutritious as fresh fruit, there may be added chemicals, preservatives, or sugar that negates any health benefits from eating them.For example, if you buy fruit cups, buy the ones that are packed in water or in their own juice — not those packed in syrup.
Make sure there aren't other ingredients that add fat and calories, such as creamy sauces.

Spice up the flavor potential of vegetables you're preparing with marinades or other seasonings to make them more enjoyable.


A marinade is a seasoned sauce that vegetables, meat or even tofu can be put in to add a lot of flavor to a meal. Marinades need to have a little salt, fat and acid to help the vegetables soak up the sauce.However, several hours will most likely result in a mushy, water-logged veggie.A marinade is typically a ratio of one part acid, one part oil, and two parts aromatics (like herbs or garlic).
Vegetables work well with a little olive or canola oil, vinegar or citrus juice and salt. Outside of that you can add whatever herbs or spices you'd like. Marinate vegetables for at least 30 minutes to an hour.
Try a marinade made for 2 cups of vegetables with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary, 1 teaspoon of salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.;
, A good way to cook vegetables that imparts a lot of great flavor is by grilling them. Whether you're using an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan, this high heat cooking method makes may vegetables much tastier.


Grilling uses a very hot surface to cook vegetables. When vegetables touch the hot grill, it sears and chars that side of the vegetable. This caramelization is what gives grilled foods a smoky, charred flavor.
In addition to giving veggies that wonderful charred flavor, grilling also is a healthy way to cook. It requires little added fat, the vegetables retain more of their vitamins and minerals and it keeps vegetables from getting overly water-logged.To grill vegetables, spray vegetables or grill with a little cooking spray or olive oil. Place vegetables on preheated grill and cook until there are char or grill marks on one side of the vegetable. Flip and cook just a few moments more or until you're desired level of doneness.

, Another great cooking method for vegetables is roasting. Like grilling, this cooking method adds a lot of flavor to vegetables without having to add lot of added fat or other seasonings.


Roasting is a high heat cooking method. The hot air of the oven heats and cooks the vegetables thoroughly. It also helps promote the browning and caramelization of vegetables which results in a crispy outer crust.Roasting vegetables is great way to improve the flavor profile of many different vegetables - especially more bitter tasting vegetables. The caramelization makes vegetables more sweet in flavor and brings out the natural sweetness of already sweet vegetables (like carrots or beets).To roast vegetables, preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Chop your vegetables into equal-sized pieces and toss with olive oil, salt, pepper and any other desired seasonings. Roast until vegetables are golden brown and tender.

, Blanching is a great technique to use if you're sensitive to the textures of many vegetables. Sometimes, mushy or overly steamed vegetables are not appealing and have little flavor.Blanching is a great cooking technique to preserve texture - however it doesn't add any flavor to vegetables. Blanched vegetables are great to use in a variety of recipes and can result in a less bitter vegetable.
Blanching is similar to boiling in the sense that you cook vegetables in a large pot of boiling water. However, with blanching, the vegetables are only cooked for about 30 seconds to 1 minute and then submerged in iced water to preserve color and texture.
Once you've blanched your veggies, you can toss them into salads, eat them cold with a dip or add them to stir-fries.

, Although not the healthiest cooking method, frying does impart a lot of great flavor and texture to many, many foods. Occasionally frying vegetables is a great way to make them tastier.


Frying requires you to cook vegetables in oil at a very high temperature. You can either completely submerge the vegetables in the oil (deep-frying) or in a little bit of oil (pan-frying). Either way causes vegetables to get a crunchy, crispy crust on the outside.Dipping vegetables in a light batter or breading can intensify the crispiness on the outside. You can do beer-battered or a tempura batter if you'd like.
After frying vegetables, it's important to allow them to drain well on a wire rack or paper towels to avoid excess oil. This can make them soggy and oily which is not very tasty., They're cute, they're little and more people are likely to eat vegetables that are considered ""baby vegetables.""If you're not a fan of veggies, try to find mini versions of these nutrient-packed foods.


Many grocery stores and markets now sell smaller, baby vegetables. These are great for those people who don't the like a bitter or strong taste to their vegetables. Baby vegetables are naturally a little sweeter.
As a plant grows and matures, the flavor of the vegetables also grows and can intensify (especially with more bitter vegetables). This can make mature vegetables a little bit harder to stomach.
In addition, baby vegetables are a little easier and quicker to cook due to their small size and thinner skins.
Common baby vegetables you can find include: carrots, zucchini, artichokes, green beans, turnips and brussels sprouts.

, Every vegetable has its own unique flavor profile. Some are naturally sweet, some have spicy note to them and some are a little more bitter in flavor. Many times, these bitter or strong flavored vegetables can be off-putting. Stick with more mild flavors so you can enjoy more vegetables.


Many vegetables have a natural bitter flavor to them. Items like kale, radicchio, brussels sprouts and broccoli have a slight bitter and off-putting flavor. This is a natural compound in plants that many scientist believe is a form of protection.If you are particularly sensitive to bitter flavors, which some people are, try to avoid eating those vegetables that have a more intense bitter flavor.
These vegetables can include: broccoli, dark greens, eggplant, green bell peppers, brussels sprouts and cabbage. Many times, specific cooking techniques (like roasting) can make these vegetables less bitter.

, Unlike naturally bitter tasting vegetables, some are actually quite sweet in flavor. In addition, others lack a lot of flavor in general. Both are great if you want to enjoy vegetables.


If you're overly sensitive you may want to choose sweeter, less intensely flavored vegetables. These won't offend your palate as much and you may enjoy them more.
Try vegetables like: red and yellow bell peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, butternut squash, green beans, zucchini or yellow squash, peas, beets and lettuces like iceberg or romaine.

, It's important to store each vegetable appropriately so you can maintain it's freshness and flavor. Some vegetables will become more bitter or get mushy the longer they're stored or if they're stored next to other items.


For starters, do not store vegetables near fruit. Some fruit, like apples, produce ethylene gas which causes rapid ripening of vegetables (and other fruits).Keep your fruits and vegetables stored in different drawers in your refrigerator.
The flavors of your vegetables can become more bitter and intense if they are stored next to fruits that cause rapid ripening.
In addition, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower ripen very quickly in the presence of ethylene gas and can become limp, mushy and yellow in color.Tomatoes are a vegetable that you should never store in the refrigerator. They will become mushy, mealy and have little flavor. Store on the counter and out of the sun.

, An easy and fun way to eat your veggies is by serving them alongside a great dressing or dip - like ranch or blue cheese dressing. Using blanched veggies takes away that raw, bitter flavor associated with raw vegetables and makes this classic taste much better.


Bring a large point of water to a boil. While you're waiting, set out another large bowl and fill it with cold water and a lot of ice cubes.
Once water is boiling, toss in your vegetables. Make sure they're evenly cut so they're all about the same size. If you're doing multiple types of vegetables, blanch each vegetable separately as different veggies cook at different rates.
Cook vegetables for only 30 seconds to a minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and immediately plunge into the ice water until they are completely cool.
Drain from the ice water and pat try. Serve along side your favorite dip or toss them into a salad.

, Roasted vegetables are such a tasty way to get in a serving or two of vegetables. Take advantage of cold weather produce, by roasting up potatoes, rutabagas, turnips, carrots or onions.


Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. While you're oven is preheating, slice your root vegetables into equal sized pieces.
Toss your root vegetables with a little bit of canola oil (enough to lightly coat every piece), salt, pepper and an Italian herb blend. Mix together until each piece of vegetable has oil and seasonings.
Roast at 425 degrees for 30-45 minutes or until vegetables are golden brown and fork tender. These are great on their own, but also great to throw into a salad or alongside scrambled eggs in the morning.

, Many people really enjoy eating traditional or even sweet potato fries. But another vegetable you can make into a crispy and tasty treat is a zucchini.


To pan fry your zucchini fries, heat a heavy bottom skillet or pot over high heat. Fill with a little bit of canola or peanut oil. The oil should come up about halfway on the sides of the zucchini fries.
As the oil heats, slice up your zucchini. You can make little zucchini ""coins"" or cut the zucchini into a more traditional french fry size.
Dip zucchini into your favorite frying batter or coat it in a little egg wash and bread crumbs.
Gently place your coated zucchini fries into the hot oil. Cook for a minute or so on each side or until the zucchini is golden brown all over. Drain your zucchini fries on some paper towels or a wire rack to keep them from getting too soggy from the excess oil.
Serve your zucchini fries with marinara sauce or any other favorite sauce. You can also use this recipe to make yellow squash or avocado fries as well.

, Pizza is a favorite among many people. In addition, it's a great place to add (and hide) vegetables. When veggies are paired with cheese and slightly sweet marinara sauce, their flavor improves and you may find them more enjoyable.


To make a pizza at home, start by buying a pre-made pizza crust. Follow the directions on the package for what temperature to bake the pizza on and for how long.
Top the pizza crust with your favorite marinara sauce and cheese. Then add the veggies. Make sure to slice vegetables very, very thinly so they cook through in the short amount of time the pizza is baking.
Great vegetables to add to pizza include: onions, mushrooms, peppers, olives, broccoli and drained frozen spinach.
Bake your pizza until the crust is fully cooked and golden brown and the cheese is melted on top.

, It's a classic and a favorite to many, but steamed vegetables drizzled with cheese sauce is a great way to get some extra flavor into your steamed vegetables.Broccoli and cauliflower are great vegetables to lightly steam or blanch. Cook them until they're soft enough for your likeness. Blanching is better if you like your veggies a little more crisp.
When the vegetables are still warm, toss with your favorite cheese sauce. You may choose to purchase a pre-made sauce or make your own from scratch. Tossing them while they're still warm helps distribute the sauce more evenly over every piece.
You can also saute dark greens like spinach over the stove and toss with a little feta cheese or cream cheese for a rich and cheesy cream of spinach side dish.

Fill an insulated cooler with water and ice.,
Add ice to and drain water from the cooler regularly.,
Remove the gills and stomachs as soon as you can.,
Clean the fish within 24 hours of catching it.",How to Store Fresh Fish1," If you are a fisherman, you need to start thinking about flavor preservation and storage temperature as soon as you get the fish into your boat. You have two options for maximum freshness. First, you can keep the fish alive in a live tank well onboard your boat and deal with the rest when you get back to shore.


The second option is to immediately kill the fish and put it into an insulated bin filled with a little water and a lot of ice.Make sure to buy an insulated cooler with a drain plug.;
, The fish needs to stay as cold as possible while in the cooler. Open the drain plug on the insulated cooler open so that melted ice water slowly and continuously drains out, making room for new ice. Do not allow dead fish to sit in melted ice water, because this will spoil the taste.If possible, use shaved ice in the cooler. Position the fish down into the ice in the same position which they swim, bellies down.
Surround their bodies completely with ice., Cleaning the fish as soon as possible will preserve the most flavor. However, if you’re out for a day of fishing, you probably won’t be able to clean the fish right away. You can hold off on fully cleaning the fish for a few hours (as long as they’re kept on ice) but you need to remove the gills and stomach cavities from the fish as soon as you possibly can.Their gills and stomachs contain waste, and you need to remove that quickly to avoid spoiling the flavor of the meat.
Removing these parts also allows you to pack the empty cavities with ice, so you can keep the fish even colder.

, As long as they remain in a chilly bin and on frequently replenished ice, you can store whole fish for up to one day before cleaning them and still maintain flavor and freshness. Keep the stomach and gill areas packed with shaved ice. Be sure to keep them positioned upright, in the same position in which they would swim. This will allow the fish to easily drain any excess fluid out of the cavities.Cover the fish with more ice and close the cooler.The fish won’t be slimy when you take them out to clean them, because they’ve been kept on well-drained and frequently replenished ice. This makes them easier to handle.
There won’t be a strong or unpleasant fishy odor when you take them out to clean them. Cutting and slicing the meat will be easier, too.

"
"
Rinse the freshly cleaned fish under cold water.,
Wrap the meat tightly in wax paper, plastic wrap or aluminum foil.,
Place the wrapped fish on ice.The key to storing fresh fish is keeping the meat on ice and as cold as possible until you are ready to cook it.,
Put the cooler into your refrigerator and store for up to two days.Situate an empty bin beneath the cooler and open the drain plug to allow melted ice to run out of the cooler.",How to Store Fresh Fish2," Before putting fish in the refrigerator, give the cleaned pieces a good rinsing to make sure there are no remaining scales or other detritus. Use the coldest water your faucet will produce. Never rinse a fresh fish in lukewarm or hot water. After rinsing, gently pat the pieces dry with a paper towel or a clean cloth., Once you have the fish all wrapped up, seal the ends tightly so that the meat isn’t exposed to air. Oxygen can contribute to spoilage, especially in fatty fish like salmon or mackerel.You also don’t want any ice to get in the packaging.


Never allow fresh fish meat to directly touch or sit in the ice. Always wrap the fish in something first, to protect it.
If you’ve brought home store-bought fresh fish, keep the meat in its original wrapper., After wrapping the meat, place the bundles back into an ice-filled insulated cooler. Once you’ve nestled the wrapped pieces into the ice, fill a few plastic baggies loosely with more shaved ice and seal them tightly to ensure there will be no leakage.


You want there to be one to two inches of ice in the baggies.
Place these ice baggies on top of the fish.Close the lid of the cooler tightly.

, The bin will catch the run-off. You will need to empty this bin periodically. Make sure the melted water is flowing freely out of the drain plug. Even though the fish is wrapped, you still do not want it sitting in water.The ice baggies need to be replenished daily.Large pieces of fish will store better than small pieces in the refrigerator.
Lean fish (panfish, bass, walleye, flounder, sole, red fish, catfish, cod) will hold up better in the refrigerator than fatty fish (trout, salmon, herring, tuna, mackerel, carp, Chilean sea bass).

"
"
Place the cleaned fish into freezer-safe plastic baggies.,
Freeze the fresh fish in a solid block of ice.,
Consume the frozen fish within twelve months.",How to Store Fresh Fish3," Before you seal them closed, make sure you press out all of the air from the baggies, or at least as much as you can. Oxygen can lead to loss of flavor and faster spoilage. Once the bags are air-free, seal them tightly so that no air is able to get into them.


To be safe, it’s best to wrap the plastic baggies first in aluminum foil and then in moisture-proof freezer paper before placing them into your freezer., This is an alternate way to safely freeze fresh fish without having to seal the pieces in plastic baggies. Place the fish meat directly into a clean, freezer-safe refrigerator container. Fill the container up with water until the water is just covering the fish. Place the container into the freezer.


The frozen block of ice surrounding the fish will prevent oxygen from reaching the flesh., As long as you’ve prepared the fish well in air-tight baggies before storing them in the freezer, most frozen fish will be good for up to twelve months. For the absolute best taste and freshness, consume the fish within the first three months. Keep in mind that lean fish will have a longer shelf life than fatty fish.When you’re ready to cook the fish, thaw the meat by placing it into your refrigerator overnight.
Never thaw fish in a microwave or by setting it out at room temperature.

, Wash 1 3/4 pounds (600 g) of rhubarb. Ensure that you wash away any dirt near the ends of the stalks. Take a large chef's knife and carefully cut off and discard the ends of the stalks. Cut the stalks into 3/4-inch thick pieces.You should end up with about 6 cups of chopped rhubarb.

, Place the chopped strawberries and chopped rhubarb into a large mixing bowl. Measure out and add the remaining filling ingredients to the bowl. You'll need:1 1/2 cups (300 g) of granulated sugar
1/4 cup (27.5 g) of cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon of finely grated orange zest, plus 1 tablespoon of orange juice
1/4 teaspoon of salt

, Take a large spoon and toss the sugar, cornstarch, juice, and salt in with the strawberries and rhubarb. The strawberries and rhubarb should be completely coated in the sugary mixture. Let the filling sit for about 30 minutes while you prepare the rest of the pie. You'll notice the mixture becomes syrupy the longer it sits.You can now bake the strawberry rhubarb filling in a pie or tart or use it in another dessert recipe.

, Place all of the dry ingredients along with the shortening and butter in a large mixing bowl. Use a pastry blender or a fork to combine the flour with the fats. Continue cutting in the butter and shortening until the dry ingredients become crumbly or sandy. You'll need:2 cups (240 g) of all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling out the dough
1/2 cup (55 g) of cake flour
1 tablespoon of sifted powdered sugar
1/2 cup (190 g) of butter-flavored shortening
1/4 cup (55 g) of salted butter
1 pinch of salt

, Crack one egg into a small mixing bowl and add 2 teaspoons of vinegar. Whisk the egg and vinegar to completely break up the yolk. Whisk in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of ice cold water. Pour this mixture over the dry ingredients and stir it together just to combine the dough.Avoid stirring the dough too much or you'll risk overworking the dough. This will make the pastry tough.
Ensure that the water you use is completely ice cold or the pastry won't be tender and flaky.

, Use your hands to form the dough into a ball and divide it in half. Roll and flatten the pieces of dough into 2 disks. Wrap each disk tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate it. Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes.Chilling the dough relaxes the gluten so the pastry will be tender.

, Turn on the oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C). Sprinkle some flour on your counter and place one chilled disk of dough on it. Use a rolling pin to evenly roll the pie crust out. For a 9-inch pie, you should roll an 11-inch circle. Place the rolled dough in the bottom of your pie plate.You should have dough sticking up and over the side of the pie plate. Don't cut or crimp it until you've added the top layer of pastry.

, Scoop your unbaked strawberry rhubarb filling into the pie plate. Cut 3 tablespoons of butter into small pieces and place them all over the filling.The butter will give the strawberry rhubarb pie a rich flavor.

, Sprinkle flour over your counter or workspace and roll out the second disk of chilled dough. Roll the dough out to a 10 or 11-inch circle and place it over the filling. Pinch or crimp the edges of the dough to seal the top and bottom layers of pie crust. Cut a few slits in the top of the crust. Dip a pastry brush in one beaten egg and spread it over the top crust. Sprinkle the top of the pie with 1 tablespoon of coarse sugar.If you want a lighter crust, use an egg-white wash instead of using one whole beaten egg.

, Cover the edges of the pie with a pie guard or wrap foil around the edges. Put the pie in the preheated oven and bake it for 15 minutes. Then turn down the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake it for another 45 to 50 minutes. The crust should turn golden brown and the filling may bubble up through the top of the crust.If you live at high altitude, you may need to bake the pie at 450 degrees F (232 C) and 400 degrees F (204 C).
Let the pie cool a little before you serve it. This will help it set up and thicken a little.

, Lightly beat the egg in a separate bowl. Pour it into the crust mixture and use a spoon to fold it in until it is just incorporated. Don't overmix, or the dough will turn out too dense.

, Use your hands to shape it into a ball. Place the ball on a sheet of plastic wrap, and fold the edges over it.

, Press down on the ball with the heels of your hands to flatten the dough into a disc.

,, Remove the dough from the refrigerator, take it out of the plastic wrap, and place it on a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large circular shape that will fit over a 9-inch pie dish. Drape the crust over the dish and trim the edges. Use your fingers to crimp the dough over the edges of the dish to hold it in place.


If you'd like, use a fork to make decorative notches around the rim of the pie crust.
Take care not to tear a hole in the pie crust. If you accidentally tear one, use a little extra dough to patch it up.

, Cover the crust with plastic wrap and place the pie plate in the freezer to firm up for at least 30 minutes.

, Beat the eggs lightly in a separate bowl, then add them to the filling mixture. Whisk until the eggs are fully blended with the rest of the filling (if you tried leaving the eggs out, the filling would not firm up when cooled).

, Place the pie crust on a baking sheet. Pour the filling into the crust. Use a spatula to spread it evenly.

, Place the pie in the oven (still heated to 350 degrees) and bake it until the filling edges are set, about 50 to 60 minutes (if you had not precooked the pecans, crust and filling then it could take longer). Check it frequently to make sure the crust doesn't burn.


You can cover the edge area of the crust by making and laying a ring of aluminum foil on top of the edge of the crust to prevent it from burning while the filling cooks.
Jiggle the pie to test if it's done. If the filling is still too runny, it needs more time. If it moves just a little, it's ready.

, Let it cool on the counter for about 10 minutes (to serve very warm) or an hour or two to serve cooled. Slice the pie and distribute it onto plates. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Crush 22 Oreo cookies into a fine crumble.,
Melt ¼ cup (55 grams) of butter, and let it cool enough to handle.,
Combine the melted butter and crushed cookies in a bowl.,
Place the mixture into a 9 inch (22.86 centimeters) wide pie pan.,
Spread the mixture across the bottom and sides of the pan.,
Place the pie pan into the fridge, and wait at least 1 hour.",How to Make Mud Pie1," The easiest and quickest way to do this would be in a food processor fitted with metal blades. If you don't have a food processor, simply place the cookies into a plastic, resealable bag, and whack them with a rolling pin. When you are done, there should be no large chunks left.


If you can't find Oreo cookies, try another type of chocolate sandwich cookie.;
, You can melt the butter in a dish in the microwave, or in a small saucepan on the stove.

, Keep stirring until the butter and cookies are evenly mixed together. You can use a spoon or a rubber spatula to do this.

, The pie pan can be made out of metal or glass. Most bakers find that glass pie pans heat more evenly than metal ones.

, You can do this using your hands, the back of a spoon, or a rubber spatula. Make sure to press down firmly, or the crust won't hold together very well.


If you don't want to get your hands dirty, cover the crust mixture with plastic wrap first.

, During this time, the melted butter will harden, an make your crust more solid.

Combine the peppermint mixture and gelatin.,
Add more whipping cream to the filling.,
Fill the pie shell.,
Make the garnish.",How to Make Peppermint Pie1," Set the oven to 350 F (177 C). To make this recipe, you will also need:

Sealable plastic bag
Rolling pin or hammer
Small and medium bowls
Electric beaters
Small saucepan
Stirring spoon
Nine-inch pie plate
Food processor;
, To make the cookie-based pie shell, you first need to make cookie crumbs. Pulse the cookies until they become fine crumbs. Make sure there aren't any large chunks left.

Instead of chocolate sandwich cookies, you can use any crunchy cookie, including graham crackers, wafer cookies, or even shortbread cookies.If you don’t have a food processor, place the cookies inside a sealable plastic bag and gently crush them up with a rolling pin or hammer.

, Continue pulsing the food processor and add the melted butter to the cookie crumbs. Process until the butter has been fully incorporated.

When the cookies and butter have been combined, press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate. Use your fingers to pack the mixture down into the bottom and up against the sides of the pie plate to form a pie shell., You only want the crust to bake for seven or eight minutes, which is just long enough to set the pie shell into its form. When it’s done, remove it from the oven and allow the pie shell to cool to room temperature without removing it from the pie plate.Make sure the pie shell is completely cool before adding any filling, otherwise the filling will melt or become runny.

, The peppermint candies for the pie must be crushed into smaller pieces. Place all the peppermint candies in the sealable plastic bag. Place the bag on a hard, flat surface, and with a rolling pin or hammer, crush the candies into small fragments.


Be careful not to roll or hit the candies too much, or they will turn to candy dust.

, Fill a small bowl with the cold water and sprinkle in the gelatin. This will soften the gelatin and make it easier to incorporate into the filling mixture. Set the bowl aside.As an alternative, you can also use a box of unsweetened vanilla pudding mix in place of the gelatin. This is a vegetarian option that will make the filling softer, but it won’t set like the gelatin filling. To do this, whisk the pudding mix into the water and set it aside., Pour ½ cup (120 ml) of the whipping cream into a small saucepan and heat it over low heat. Add 1 cup of the crushed peppermint candies. Continue heating the mixture until the peppermint candies have melted.

When the candies have melted, remove the saucepan from the heat.
You can substitute evaporated milk for this portion of whipping cream, which will slightly reduce the overall fat content of the filling., Pour the gelatin into the hot peppermint mixture and stir to combine. Add ½ teaspoon (3 ml) of the peppermint extract and stir again. Set it aside.

You want the peppermint mixture to cool to room temperature, but don’t let it sit any longer, or the gelatin will set.

, In a medium bowl, use the electric beaters to beat 1½ cups (360 ml) of whipping cream. Beat until the cream forms stiff peaks.

Fold in the peppermint mixture by gently stirring it into the whipping cream. Stir until the two are almost fully combined, but there's still a marbled effect with the pink peppermint mixture and the white whipping cream.

, Spoon the filling into the pie crust and spread it around so it evenly. For an extra crunchy and minty kick, coat the bottom of the pie shell with a layer of crushed peppermint candies before adding the

filling.Place the pie in the refrigerator to chill and set for about two hours.

, In a medium bowl, combine the confectioner’s sugar and the remaining 1 cup (240 ml) of whipping cream and ½ teaspoon (3 ml) of peppermint extract. Beat until the whipping cream forms stiff peaks.Before serving, garnish the top with additional whipped cream and crushed peppermints."

Crush the Oreo cookies into crumbs.,
Melt butter and add it to the crumbs.,
Press crust into a pie pan.,
Bake until set.,
Let cool before adding filling.",How to Make Peanut Butter Pie1," An easy way to do this is to simply pulse them in a food processor. You can also add the Oreos (or your preferred chocolate sandwich cookies) to a sturdy plastic bag, then smash them with a rolling pin or the bottom of a pan. Don't remove the white filling from the cookies before you crush them — the recipe accounts for it.


As noted above, you'll want to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F for this recipe.
You want the crumbs to be quite fine for this recipe.No noticeable chunks of solid cookie should remain.
If you're making a graham cracker crust, just pulse the graham crackers and sugar together to make fine crumbs. The rest of the recipe is the same.;
, Butter helps the crumbs stick together while also giving the crust a richer taste and a more satisfying texture. Melt the butter in a separate bowl in the microwave, then pour it over the crumbs and stir with a fork to combine.


If the crust isn't sticking to itself after mixing, feel free to melt more butter and add it in one tablespoon increments. You may need to do this if you used extra cookies.

, Spoon the crumb mixture into the center of a greased pie pan. Spread it around the bottom and sides of the pan. Use the edge of a measuring cup or glass to press the crust into the pan, spreading it evenly.

, Set the crust (without any filling) in the oven for about 5-7 minutes. After, take the crust out and check for firm, ""done"" texture.

, This is important — the crust should be room temperature before you add the filling. If it's not, it can affect the texture of the filling. If you need, you can let it cool in the fridge to speed the process up.


When the crust is cool, you can add the filling and proceed as normal, following the instructions above.

, Place the cookies and butter into a food processor and pulse until the cookies become fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs into the pie plate and pack them into the bottom and sides of the plate to make a pie shell.

Bake for seven to eight minutes at 350 F (177 C) to allow the shell to set.
Remove the pie crust from the oven and let it cool completely before filling it.
If you don’t have a food processor, place the cookies in a sealable plastic bag and crush them with a hammer.

, Place the candies in a plastic bag and use the hammer or a rolling pin to crush them into small pieces.

, Add the cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk to a medium bowl. Mix with the beaters until the mixture is fully incorporated and smooth., Gently fold the whipped topping and peppermint candies into the cream cheese and milk mixture. Stir just to combine.Avoid stirring too much, or the whipped topping will lose its air and become runny.

, Pour the mixture into the pie shell and use a spoon to spread it around evenly. Refrigerate for several hours, until the filling becomes firm., Add the chocolate chips and heavy cream to the top portion of a double boiler. Fill the bottom of the double boiler with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate chips have melted.

When the chips are melted, stir in the corn syrup. Refrigerate the ganache until it has cooled and thickened slightly.
Before serving the pie, spoon the ganache into the center of the pie and spread it around in a circle, leaving at least an inch of pie filling showing all around the edge."

Combine peanut butter with cream cheese and sugar.,
Add whipped topping.,
Pour into pie crust.,
Refrigerate until firm before serving.",How to Make Peanut Butter Pie2," In a large bowl, beat these ingredients together until smooth and even. This should take just a few minutes with an electric mixer set to medium.



Note: If you're making your own pie crust, you'll want to set the oven to 350 degrees F (177 C) now to give it time to preheat. If you bought a prepared crust, you won't need the oven.

, Gradually mix in all three cups of the whipped topping. Fold it into the mixture with a spatula, then stir briefly to combine.

, Carefully spoon the filling mixture you've just made into your pie crust. When you've transferred all of the filling, use a spatula to get it flat and level with the upper edge of the crust.


At this point, you can also add whatever toppings you wish over the filling. See the ""Suggested Toppings"" section below for a few good ideas.

, Place the filled pie in a safe spot in the refrigerator. Keep the pie in the fridge until it is well-set. Depending on the temperature of your fridge, this can take from 1-3 hours. When in doubt, you can always let the pie chill overnight to be sure.When the filling is firm, the pie is ready to eat! Serve the dessert on its own or with the toppings suggested below.
If you bought a pie crust that came with a plastic cover, you can use this to protect the pie. If it didn't, you don't need to cover it, but a tented piece of foil will also work.

Sprinkle chopped peanuts on the pie for flavor and texture.,
Add a thin layer of chocolate over the filling.,
Sprinkle confectioner's sugar as a garnish.,
Decorate with cut-up peanut butter cups.,
Top with whipped cream.",How to Make Peanut Butter Pie3," If you like your peanut butter with a little crunch, adding bits of peanuts over the pie is a good choice. Salted peanuts are especially tasty — having a hint of salt in the recipe is the perfect way to complement its natural sweetness.

, Pouring melted chocolate over the pie and letting it set will give you a layer of solid chocolate over the soft filling. It's almost like making one giant peanut butter cup. See below for directions:


Break good-quality chocolate into small chunks with a mallet or the back of a knife.
Add the chocolate to a double boiler and gradually melt. Alternatively, microwave in 30 second increments, stirring often.
When the chocolate is completely melted, let it cool slightly for a minute or two. Then, spoon it over the filled pie, carefully spreading it with a spatula as needed until even. Cool in the refrigerator as normal.

, A light dusting of confectioner's sugar adds just a touch of sweetness. It's also great for presentation, especially when paired with the dark tones of the chocolate crust above.

, Reese's and other peanut butter cup candies are the perfect topping for peanut butter pie. There are several ways to incorporate them. For instance, you can try roughly chopping them and sprinkling them over the filling for a rustic topping. If you have more time, you can also arrange the pieces in intricate designs — perfect for desserts that you really want to make a strong impression.

, If you have leftover whipped topping from the pie filling, carefully spreading over the pie once it's set to give it another layer of flavor (plus added volume). Spray-can whipped cream also works well.


Try drizzling a little chocolate fudge or caramel over the pie when you're done with the whipped cream — it shows up well against the whiteness of the topping.

Set the frozen spinach on the stove.,
Reheat the spinach slowly.,
Drain the hot spinach.",How to Prepare Frozen Spinach1," First, place a large frying pan over low or medium low heat. The pan should be large enough to easily accommodate all of the frozen spinach. Once the pan has warmed up, add the frozen spinach to the pan. The spinach will hiss slightly and release some steam.


If the spinach releases a large amount of steam or makes loud cracking sounds, your pan is too hot. Reduce the heat.;
, Stir the block of frozen spinach around the pan until it becomes tender. Once tender, use your cooking utensil to break the block into smaller chunks. As the spinach warms up, continue breaking apart the spinach to help it reheat faster. The whole process will take about four to six minutes. Your spinach will be done thawing when it’s limp and very warm to the touch.


Don’t worry if there’s a lot of liquid in the pan. You will drain this away later.
Avoid overcooking the spinach. Burned spinach has a very distinct flavor.

, Place a heat-proof colander into a clean sink. Pour the reheated spinach into the colander. As it drains, use a large spoon to press out as much of the liquid as possible.If you want to reserve the cooking juices, place the colander into a large bowl or casserole dish before draining the spinach.

Place the diced apples into a mixing bowl along with 4 tablespoons of brown sugar, 4 tablespoons of white sugar, 2 tablespoons of flour, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.If you want the apple pieces even smaller, consider grating the apples using a box or cheese grater.;
, For a spiced pumpkin pie mixture, combine traditional pumpkin pie ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Use a whisk to stir together:1 1/2 cups (425 g) of pumpkin puree
1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar
3 tablespoons of melted butter
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon of vanilla
1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of ginger
1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon of salt

, If you'd like a rich chocolate filling with a pecan crunch, combine 1/2 cup (150 g) of dark corn syrup, 1/2 cup (100 g) of packed brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 2 beaten eggs in a medium mixing bowl. Stir in 2/3 cup (100 g) of chopped pecans and 2/3 cup (115 g) of miniature semisweet chocolate chips.While you could use regular-sized chocolate chips, mini chocolate chips are easier to handle when you're assembling the pie pops.

, If you're using frozen pie dough, thaw it according to the manufacturer's directions. The dough should be easy to handle. Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and lay the pastry down. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C).You can roll the dough into any shape since you'll be cutting it out. For example, you can roll the dough into a rectangle, if it's easier.

, Use 2 to 3-inch (5 to 7.5-cm) cookie cutters to cut out the rolled pie dough. Form the scraps together so you can re-roll and cut more shapes with the dough. Lay parchment paper on two baking sheets and place half of the cutouts on the sheets.You can use any shape of cookie cutter that you like. Keep in mind that detailed shapes (like frilled stars) may be difficult to seal which could cause the filling to leak out.

, Place one lollipop stick on each cutout on your baking sheets. You should have 24 cutouts and 24 lollipop sticks. Ensure that the stick is halfway across the cutout and press down just a little. Depending on which filling you use, place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of the cutouts.Don't spread the filling across the entire cutout or it will be difficult to seal the pastry lid.

, Use the 24 remaining pastry cutouts on your work surface as lids for the mini pie pops. If you'd like to make a decorative window, just use a miniature cookie cutter to cut the center out of each lid. Discard the tiny pastry shape and set the cutout lid over a filled cutout on your baking sheet. Gently press around the edges to seal the lids.You can use an extra lollipop stick or the tines of a fork to press into the edges. This will make a decorative border along the edges.

, Separate one egg so you have the egg white in a small dish. You can discard the yolk or save it for another recipe. Dip a pastry brush into the egg white and brush it over each mini pie pop. Sprinkle the tops with a little demerara or coarse sugar.You can also use colored or decorative sugars for a bright touch.

, Put the mini pie pops in the preheated oven and bake them for 10 to 14 minutes. They should turn golden and crisp around the edges. Don't worry if the filling oozes out a little. This might just make them stick to the parchment a little.Let the pops cool completely before you handle or serve them. The filling will be very hot, so use caution.

Place the remaining cookies on top to create sandwiches.,
Store the cream pies in an airtight container.",How to Make Oatmeal Cream Pies," To ensure that the oven is hot enough when you’re ready to bake the cookies, it’s important to preheat it. Set the oven to 375 degrees (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Most ovens will usually beep or flash a light to alert you.;
, For the cookies, you’ll need 1 to 2 large cookie sheets. Line the sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent the cookies from sticking during baking. Set them aside until you’re ready to bake the cookies.You can get away with using only one cookie sheet, but you will likely need to bake multiple batches of cookies.
If you don’t have parchment paper or silicone baking mats, you can grease your cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray or butter.

, Use a handheld or stand mixer to combine 1 ¼ cups (284 g) of softened, unsalted butter, 1 cup (200 g) of packed dark brown sugar, and 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar in a large bowl. Blend the ingredients on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy.If you don’t have a handheld or stand mixer, you can mix the butter and sugars together by hand. It will take a little more time and effort, though, so you may want to allow the butter to soften longer to make the process easier.

, When the butter and sugars are creamed together, add 1 large egg, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of pure vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of dark molasses to the bowl. Continue mixing the ingredients on medium until they’re fully combined, and then set the mixture aside for a moment.As you add the egg, vanilla, and molasses, scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary to ensure that the ingredients are all well mixed.

, In a medium bowl, mix 1 ½ cups (180 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (3 g ) of salt, and ¾ teaspoon (2 g) of ground cinnamon together with a wooden spoon. When the ingredients are fully blended, add 3 cups (249 g) of uncooked, quick-cooking oats and stir until they’re fully incorporated.You can also mix in ¼ teaspoon (.5 g) of ground cloves with the cinnamon if you want to add some extra spice to the cookies.
Make sure that you use quick-cooking oats for the cookies, not whole-rolled oats.

, When you’ve completely mixed the dry ingredients, begin to add them little by little to the wet ingredients on a low speed. The cookie batter will be extremely thick, so you will probably need to mix it by hand several times after using the electric mixer to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined., When the cookie batter is completely mixed, use a large cookie scoop to drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Each ball of dough should measure approximately 2 tablespoons (30 g).The cookies spread while baking, so make sure to place them at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart on the cookie sheet.

, Place the cookie sheet(s) in the preheated oven, and allow the cookies to bake until the edges become lightly golden. In most cases, that will take approximately 10 minutes., Once the cookies have golden brown edges, remove them from the oven. Let them cool on the baking sheets for 3 to 4 minutes before transferring them to a wire cooling rack. Allow them to cool completely, which should take approximately 15 minutes.It’s important to ensure that the cookies are completely cool before you begin assembling the oatmeal cream pies. If they are still warm, the cream filling may melt.

, Add ¾ cup (170 g) softened unsalted butter to a large bowl, and use a handheld or stand mixer to beat the butter on medium-high for approximately 5 minutes. You want the butter to lighten in color and become fluffy so the cream will be light and smooth., Once the butter is light and fluffy, turn your mixer speed to low and gradually add 2 ½ cups (313 g) of confectioners’ sugar. Mix the ingredients until the sugar is fully incorporated.Confectioners’ sugar is also known as powdered sugar or icing sugar.

, When the confectioners’ sugar is completely blended with the butter, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream with the mixer still set at a low speed. Blend the mixture until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can substitute half-and-half or whole milk for the heavy cream, but the cream filling will probably not be as creamy.

, When the ingredients are all fully incorporated, turn the mixer’s speed back up to medium-high. Beat the cream filling for 3 to 5 more minutes, or until it has a light, fluffy consistency.If the cream filling is too stiff or thick, you can add in more heavy cream. Mix it in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) at a time until you reach the proper consistency.

, When the filling is ready, arrange half of the cookies so they’re upside down. Use a knife or spoon to spread 1 to 1 ½ tablespoons of the cream filling across the cookies.The amount of filling that you should add depends on the size of the cookie. You want to spread the filling nearly all the way to the edges, so a larger cookie requires more cream.

, After you’ve spread the cream filling over the cookies, use the other half of the cookies to create the pies. Press them down over the filling rightside up to create sandwiches.It’s okay if some of the filling is squeezed out the edges when you press the cookies together.

, If you’re not eating the oatmeal cream pies right away, place them in an airtight container. You can leave them out at room temperature for up to two days, or place them in refrigerator for up to 5 days.If you’re storing the cream pies in the refrigerator, be sure to leave them out at room temperature for an hour or so before eating.

Create a vinaigrette.,
Whip up a marinade.,
Concoct a syrup.,
Mix together a barbecue sauce.",How to Use Frozen Fruit1," A basic vinaigrette is a mix of acid and fat. For example, one part vinegar or lemon juice, and three to four parts olive oil. To make a fruit vinaigrette, thaw some frozen fruit and puree it in a blender. Then add the mixture to your chosen acidic liquid. For pulpier fruits or ones with seeds, you may want to strain the puree before putting it into the sauce.Try raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries for a vinaigrette that pairs well with any type of lettuce.;
, Similar to a vinaigrette, most marinades will require you to puree the frozen fruit before you add it. However, you can add the fruit to any marinade you like. A fruitier sauce pairs especially well with chicken or pork. Try mixing the fruit puree with olive oil, lemon or lime juice, Dijon Mustard, and an herb like basil.Blackberries and raspberries work well for a little added sweetness.

, Place a cup of frozen fruit into a small saucepan with a little bit of orange juice or water and cornstarch. Turn up the heat until the mixture begins to bubble, then turn it down to a simmer. Stir the sauce continuously until it thickens. If using water, try adding a ½ cup of sugar to make it sweeter. You can also wait for the sugar water to thicken before adding fruit at the end and mixing it.Blueberries are the most common for fruit syrups. However, try blackberries, cherries, and raspberries as well.

, For a subtle fruity flavor that can smooth out the intensity of spicier sauces, try adding some frozen fruit to your standard BBQ sauce. Simmer the fruit with a little bit of ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and cumin.

Tightly wrap the avocado in plastic wrap.,
Refrigerate until ripe.",How to Tell if an Avocado Is Ripe," No two avocado varieties are the same. There will be slight differences in size, color, and shape depending on the variety. The appearance of a ripe avocado will vary based on the avocado you are selecting.Check with the grocer or seller if the avocado variety is not clearly marked.
Also note the firmness of a ripe avocado remains essentially the same regardless of the specific variety.
The differences between varieties, as well as the possible differences between specific fruits within the same variety, cause appearance to be a less-than-foolproof method of determining ripeness. Still, these signs are helpful to know since they are often your first indication about how ripe an avocado is.;
, Different varieties are more commonly harvested during different parts of the season. If you are picking out avocados in September and are given the option between a variety harvested in early fall and one harvested in late fall, the variety harvested in early fall is more likely to be ripe.


Bacon avocados are usually available from late fall into the spring and are considered to be a mid-winter variety.
Fuerte avocados are also harvested from late fall through spring.
Gwen avocados are most commonly harvested during fall and winter.
Hass and Lamb Hass avocados are harvested year-round.
Pinkerton avocados are available from early winter through spring.
Reed avocados are available throughout summer and early fall.
Zutano avocados mature between the beginning of September through early winter.

, Before an avocado can be ripe, it must be mature. Within each variety, a mature avocado will usually fall within a certain size range and shape.


Bacon avocados are medium in size, ranging from 6 to 12 oz (170 to 340 g). They are oval.
Fuerte avocados are medium to large when mature, ranging anywhere from 5 to 14 oz (142 to 397 g). They are oblong in appearance than bacon avocados but are still slightly pear shaped.
Gwen avocados can be medium to large, running from 6 to 15 oz (170 to 425 g). They are plump, stout ovals.
Hass avocados can be medium to large, ranging from 5 to 12 oz (142 to 340 g). They are also oval.
Lamb Hass avocados are large, ranging in size from 11.75 to 18.75 oz (333 to 532 g). They are pear-shaped and symmetrical.
Pinkerton avocados are long and pear-shaped. They weigh between 8 and 18 oz (227 and 510 g).
Reed avocados are medium to small, ranging from 8 to 18 oz (227 to 510 g). They are the roundest variety available.
Zutano avocados are medium to large, usually weighing between 6 and 14 oz (170 and 397 g). They are skinny and pear shaped.

, The color of the outer peel will be dark with most varieties, but each variety be subtly different.


Bacon avocados and Fuerte avocados have smooth, thin green skin.
Gwen avocados have a dull, pliable, and pebbly green skin when ripe.
Hass avocados and Lamb Hass avocados have the most distinctive color. A ripe Hass avocado will be deep green to purple when ripe. A black avocado will likely be overripe, though, just as if a vibrant green avocado is likely to be under ripe.
Like Hass avocados, Pinkerton avocados deepen in color as it ripens. A ripe Pinkerton avocado will usually be a deep green.
Reed avocados keep their vibrant green coloring even when ripe. The skin is usually thick with mild pebbling.
Zutano avocados have thin, yellow-green skin when ripe.

, Dark blemishes can be a sign of bruises or overripe spots.


In general, you should check for even coloring and even texture. Any avocado that is uneven in either regard either has gone bad or has been damaged. Either way, the quality of the fruit will have gone down.

, Do not grab the avocado with your fingertips. Instead, you should hold the fruit directly in the palm of your hand.


If you press on the fruit with your fingertips or thumb, you might cause bruising.An unripe avocado is too hard to bruise, but a ripe avocado is not. By holding it with your palm, you spread out the pressure, thereby minimizing it and reducing the risk of bruising.

, Use your palm and the base of your fingers to apply gently, even pressure to the avocado.


When you press the avocado, if it is ripe, it should yield to a minimal amount of pressure. The skin should “give” slightly but should not remain indented.
If the avocado feels mushy, it has become overripe.
If the avocado feels firm, it is still under ripe.

, Turn the fruit a quarter of a rotation and squeeze again, once more using the palm of your hand and the base of your fingers to apply gentle pressure.


It is possible the first place you press could be bruised, giving the impression the avocado is ripe or overripe as a result. To verify that this is not the case, squeeze the avocado in different locations and compare the firmness of the fruit. A ripe avocado without bruises will have an even softness.

, Place the avocado near your ear and lightly shake it a few times to determine if there is any rattling going on inside.


If the flesh feels soft and you are worried that it might be overripe instead of merely being ripe, shaking the avocado is a good way to check without cutting it open.
The inner pit will pull away from the inside of the flesh once the fruit becomes overripe. As a result, the fruit will rattle once you shake it. If you hear a rattling noise when you shake an avocado, odds are, the fruit has already become overripe., Pinch the stem between your index, thumb, and quickly pluck it out.


You will have no difficulty plucking out the stem of a ripe avocado.
If the avocado is still unripe, you might not be able to remove the stem without cutting it. Do not use a knife or other tool to cut the stem off. If you cannot pluck the stem off with your fingers, then the avocado is not yet ripe and ready to eat.

, If the stem does twist off, you must look for the trademark green flesh of the avocado beneath it.If the avocado is a light yellow or brown, the flesh is still under ripe.
If the avocado beneath the stem is a dark brown, the avocado may already be overripe.

, If you cut into an avocado thinking that it was ripe only to discover otherwise, you might be able to save it, especially if the avocado is nearly ripe but not there.


Note that you might not be successful, however. Refrigeration slows the ripening process, so you might have a hard time getting an avocado to ripen in the refrigerator. That said, refrigeration is necessary to prevent spoilage after the fruit has been cut open.

, Use a pastry brush to apply about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of lemon juice or lime juice to the exposed flesh of your cut avocado.


When you cut the avocado open, you break apart the cellular walls of the flesh and trigger oxidation. The best way to slow oxidation is to apply an acidic agent to the flesh.

, Fit the halves back together as accurately as possible.


Another way to slow oxidation is to minimize the amount of exposed flesh. By fitting the halves back together, you cover the flesh of both sides as much as possible.

, Wrap several layers of plastic wrap around the avocado to create an airtight seal.


The airtight seal limits the amount of oxygen the flesh will be exposed to, which, as a result, slows down the oxidation process.
You could also use an airtight container, airtight resealable plastic bag, or vacuum sealed plastic bag.

, Since the avocado has already been cut open, you will need to store it in the refrigerator as it finishes ripening to prevent the fruit from going bad.


The avocado should ripen within a few days. If it begins to turn soft or brown, however, you might need to throw it away.

Preheat the oven.,
Prepare the baking sheet.,
Toast the coconut.,
Store the toasted coconut.",How to Toast Coconut1," Turn on the oven and preheat it to 350°F/176°C or 325°F/163ºC.There can be some slight variation in the temperature of the oven, depending on how quickly or slowly you wish to toast the coconut.


Since coconut browns rather quickly, a slower cooking process with a lower temperature (325°F/163ºC or 300°F/149ºC) is suggested. But, if you are toasting freshly grated coconut, preheat the oven to 350°F/176°C.Because the coconut will be damp since it's fresh, it may need to toast a bit longer to completely dry out all the pieces.
Alternatively, you can also toast coconut in a toaster oven. Simply preheat the toaster oven to 325°F or 163ºC.;
, Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread out a thin layer of about ½ a cup of shredded, flaked, or powdered coconut.Keep that in mind that sweetened coconut will toast faster than unsweetened coconut.The finer the pieces of coconut, the faster they will toast.
If you’re toasting your coconut in a toaster oven, line the baking sheet with parchment paper and spread out a thin layer of about ½ a cup of shredded, flaked, or powdered coconut., Put the baking sheet into the preheated oven. Bake for approximately 5-10 minutes at 350°F/180ºC.If you have the oven set at a lower temperature, it could take approximately 20 minutes to toast all of the coconut.If you are toasting fresh coconut, it could take approximately 12-18 minutes to completely toast.Keep your eye on the coconut as it toasts. After about five minutes, stir the coconut and look for any pieces that are golden brown. Remove any golden brown pieces of coconut and continue to toast the rest for a few more minutes.


If you’re toasting your coconut in a toaster oven, at 325°F or 163ºC, it should take approximately 4-7 for finely shredded, unsweetened coconut to toast, approximately 7-12 minutes for large flaked unsweetened coconut to toast, and approximately 7-10 minutes for normally shredded, sweetened coconut to toast.Continue to check on the coconut and stir it every couple of minutes.
Do not let the coconut become too dark. A light, golden brown coloring indicates that the coconut is adequately toasted.

, Remove the coconut from the oven and pour it onto some parchment paper or into a bowl. You can either use the toasted coconut right away after it cools, or store it in an airtight container for up to four days until you’re ready to use it."

Eat bananas to improve your skin health.",How to Understand the Health Benefits of Eating Bananas," There are many types of bananas available, which vary in color, size, and shape. The most common type is the yellow banana, which is green when unripe. Many important nutrients are given below:

Potassium: 9% of the RDI.
Vitamin B6: 33% of the RDI.
Vitamin C: 11% of the RDI.
Magnesium: 8% of the RDI.
Copper: 10% of the RDI.
Manganese: 14% of the RDI.
Net carbs: 24 grams.
Fiber: 3.1 grams.
Protein: 1.3 grams.
Fat: 0.4 grams.;
, Bananas are rich in a fiber called pectin. Unripe bananas contain resistant starch. Both pectin and resistant starch may moderate blood sugar levels after meals and reduce appetite by slowing stomach emptying. It means if you wish to eat two bananas with an empty stomach, you'll lose weight. However, bananas still contain a lot of fructose (the natural sugar found in fruit), which won't help diabetics., A medium-sized banana contains about 3 grams of non-soluble fiber. Bananas are fairly rich in fiber and resistant starch, which may feed healthy gut bacteria and help protect against colon cancer., Eating more fiber from fruits and vegetables has repeatedly been linked with lower body weight and weight loss, particularly bananas. By eating plenty of bananas, vegetables, and other fruits, you will notice major overall health improvements., Bananas contain potassium, which is a mineral that is essential for proper heart health, kidney health, and blood pressure control. Most people's diets are lacking in potassium. Most people are selling their kidney because of some solid reasons, but that is not advisable., Bananas contain many essential, digestible proteins and sugars that help our body recover. Avoid eating too many, as this will cause your blood sugar to rise fairly rapidly., It contains many keratin-building amino acids that help keep your skin soft and supple. You can also make a puree out of it and apply it dermally.

Mix one tablespoon of honey, one tablespoon of lemon juice, and one mashed banana and apply it to your skin.
Avoid applying near your eyes, nose, mouth, and internal areas, and any other orifices. In one week, you'll see noticeable improvements. Use it regularly.

Add some flavor before serving.",How to Steam Green Beans1," Rinse the beans first using cool water. Pat them dry, then trim or snap off both of the pointed ends.;
, For extra flavor, add a little bit of salt. For a sharper flavor, add a few minced garlic cloves to the water. Depending on how many beans you are steaming, you will only need one to three cloves.If you do not own a steamer basket, reduce the amount of water to ½ to one inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters).

, The bottom of the steamer basket should not be touching the water. If it touches the water, you have added too much; pour out a little bit of the water. If you do not have a steamer basket, omit this step.

, Wait for the water to boil.

, Cover the lid and reduce the heat to low so that the water will simmer.

, After about four minutes, pull one of the beans out and taste it. The beans are ready when they are bright green and somewhat crunchy. If the beans are too hard, then cook them for another one to two minutes.


If you are planning to stir fry the beans later, cook them for only two minutes.

, If you are using a steamer basket, simply lift the basket out of the pot and shake it over a sink to dislodge any excess water. If you are not using a steamer basket, pour the beans into a strainer over the sink. The strainer will catch the beans and drain the excess water.

, The beans will continue cooking after you have taken them out, which can lead to a dull color and mushy texture. To keep this from happening, fill a large bowl with cold water and add a few ice cubes to it. Transfer the beans into the icy water. After a few seconds, take them out.


Try placing the beans into a strainer first. This way, all you have to do is dunk the strainer into the water, then lift it out.
This process is known as ""shocking.""

, Return the beans to the saucepan. Add your desired seasonings, and stir to evenly distribute. If you are adding butter, wait for the butter to melt; you may have to turn the heat up again. Once the seasoning is evenly distributed, transfer the beans to a serving dish. Here are some combinations to get you started:


Try salt and butter.You can also use garlic salt instead of regular salt for a more intense flavor.
Try sea salt, dill, and some butter for something more herby.
Try salt, freshly-ground black pepper, and some butter for something spicier.

Do not wash the collard greens.,
Place the collard greens in an air-tight plastic bag.,
Refrigerate the collard greens.,
Wash before preparing.",How to Store Collard Greens1," If you plan on using your collard greens within the next week, don't wash them before refrigeration. Introducing water to the greens can promote decay, cutting the length of their freshness down dramatically.

If you are concerned that your greens are too dirty to store in your refrigerator, know that they will be stored in an air-tight bag. Any dirt and grit will not get onto the surfaces in your fridge.;
, Most greens should be stored in plastic bags and collard greens are no exception. Put the greens in a big plastic bag, as the greens themselves are very large. Be sure to push out as much air as you can before sealing.Collard greens that are not put into a plastic bag, but are put into the refrigerator, will become wilted very quickly. Like other vegetables, uncovered collard greens get dehydrated. This causes them to go limp.If you don't have a plastic bag that seals closed, wrap the greens in a damp paper towel. Then place the greens in an unsealed plastic bag. This should keep the greens crisp for several days., Put the bag of collard greens in the crisper of your refrigerator. Keep them there until you are ready to use them. They should be used within 5 to 7 days of storage.The amount of time your collard greens stay fresh will vary. It depends on the freshness of the collard greens to begin with and the quality of your refrigerator's chilling. Check on the collard greens daily to make sure that they are still suitable for eating.
Spoiled collard greens will get soft, wilt, become slimy, or get discolored. They may also start to smell bad.

, Once you have decided to use your greens, take them out of the fridge and wash them thoroughly. Collard greens are known to be relatively dirty and gritty. Take the time to soak the greens in fresh water and make sure that each leaf is clean.If you don't have a bowl or kitchen sink that can be used for cleaning the greens, wash each leaf under running water.

Avoid asparagus with discolored parts or bruises.
Frozen asparagus can also be steamed, but the texture won't be quite like steamed fresh asparagus.;
, Asparagus usually comes in bundles of 14 to 18 spears. If you are cooking for multiple people, plan on having 3 to 5 spears per serving.Fresh asparagus will keep in the fridge for 3 to 4 days.If a recipe calls for 1 pound (450 grams) of asparagus, you will need 12 to 15 large spears, or 16 to 20 small spears., Run the asparagus under cool water and use your fingers to remove any dirt or debris. Focus on the tips, where dirt is most likely to be caught.

, Start peeling the asparagus about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) from the bottom.This is not necessary on thin stalks, but thick, woody stalks might need to be peeled. Not doing this may result in tough, fibrous asparagus.

, Hold the asparagus at each end and bend it. It will snap right where the woody part begins. This is usually around the bottom third. Discard the hard, woody, bottom part., This may help reduce the cooking time. It will also make it easier to eat.

""Square off"" your cucumber (optional).",How to Slice a Cucumber1," When selecting cucumbers, always choose firm darker colored cucumbers with no wrinkles or spongy spots. Some cucumbers at the store are waxed to prevent them from spoiling when they are out of season. The skins contain vitamin A, so try to buy unwaxed cucumbers, whose skin you can eat.


If you have purchased waxed cucumbers, make sure to peel them and discard the skin.;
, Run unwaxed cucumbers under cold water and lightly scrub them. Washing fresh produce is important to remove various types of bacteria such as e.coli, salmonella, or Staphylococcus aureus.


The FDArecommends washing produce with a large amount of cold or warm tap water and using a scrub brush on tougher skinned produce when you are planning to eat the skin.

, Slice off the hard disks on either side of the cucumber and discard. them. You don't want to eat this part.

, Cucumber seeds consist mostly of water, so they can make your salad soggy or add unwanted moisture to your cooked dish. Decide if you want the seeds or not.


You may find it easier to slice your cucumber if you have scooped the seeds out.

, The skin of cucumbers is slightly tough and a little bitter, but it's perfectly fine to eat. If you prefer not to eat the skin, use a vegetable peeler to slice the skin off in shallow strips long ways all over the cucumber.

, Squaring off your cucumber is a method used in more complicated slicing and required you to cut off the rounded edges of your cucumber to create flat surfaces all around. Squaring off your cucumber before slicing will allow you to achieve uniform cuts that will cook evenly, and look for appealing and professional in your dish.


Start with one edge of your cucumber and cut off the rounded side. Move to remaining sides of your cucumber until you have cut off each rounded side and are left with a rectangular shaped piece with four pointed edges and flat surfaces.

, The beans will keep cooking even after you have finished steaming them. This can lead to a dull color and mushy texture. To prevent this, fill a large bowl with cold water and add a some ice cubes. Put the beans into the icy water, and take them out after a few seconds. This is known as ""shocking.""


Try placing the beans into a strainer first. This way, all you have to do is dip the strainer into the water, then take it out.

, Place the green beans back into their microwavable bowl, and add your desired seasoning. Stir everything together, then transfer the beans to a serving bowl. If you are using butter, you may have to microwave the beans for a few seconds to help the butter melt. Here are some seasoning ideas to get you started:


Try salt and butter for a classic flavor. For a stronger flavor, use garlic salt instead of regular salt.
If you'd like something more mellow, try sea salt, dill, and some butter.
For a hint of spice, try salt, freshly-ground black pepper, and some butter.

Wash the collard greens.,
Cut up the collard greens.,
Blanch the collard greens.,
Put the collard greens in an air-tight container in the freezer.,
Use within 10 to 12 months.",How to Store Collard Greens2," If you are going to store your collard greens in the freezer, you should wash them thoroughly before storage. Soak the leaves in a bowl or sink full of water or wash in running water. Make sure all grit and dirt is removed from the leaves before proceeding.Collard greens that are stored in the freezer are cooked slightly and will have a softer consistency when defrosted. This would make washing once defrosted impossible.

, Separate the stems from the leaves. This will allow you to cut the stems into smaller pieces that will cook faster. Cut the leaf portion into whatever shape you want. Many people like to cut them into strips.You could keep the collard green leaves whole but that would make them hard to handle when blanching and packaging them for the freezer.

, Put the greens, stems and leaves, into boiling water for three minutes.The goal is to cook the greens slightly, while keeping their bright green color and not cooking them completely.After the two minutes of cooking, put the greens straight into an ice water bath for a minute or two. This will stop the cooking immediately.
Blanching the vegetables will stop enzyme action that can cause decay. This causes loss of color and flavor.Blanching also cleans the surface of the greens really well, assuring that all dirt and organisms are removed.

, Dry off any excess moisture and then put the blanched leaves into an air-tight container. This could be a plastic container or a freezer bag, whatever you have on hand.Write the date on the package so you can track how long you have it. Then place the container into your freezer.

The more air you can get out of the packaging, the better.

, Collard greens that are stored in the freezer can be used for a long time. They usually stay good for between 10 and 12 months, after which they should be thrown out.

Collard greens that have been defrosted and then refrozen several times will stay fresh for less time. This usually happens due to a faulty freezer. One sign that your collard greens may have undergone this freezing and defrosting is excessive freezer burn. However, all foods that are frozen for long enough will develop freezer burn eventually."

This is where dirt and grit tend to collect. You will also want to remove the scales using a vegetable peeler. When the asparagus is clean and de-scaled, hold it by each end and bend it. It will snap right where the wood and tender parts meet. Toss the hard, woody part and keep the tender part. For more details on preparing asparagus, see the section on preparing, above.


Consider cutting the asparagus into smaller, bite-sized pieces.

, Make sure that the dish is large enough to fit the asparagus., Start laying the asparagus stalks down side by side until the entire bottom is covered. Lay down more asparagus on top of the first layer. Keep doing this until you have 2 or 3 layers of asparagus., Run your finger around the rim of the dish to seal it. Be sure to tuck the wrap under the dish.

, This is very important. If you don't do this, the steam will get trapped inside the plastic and cause it to pop. The plastic wrap may also melt over the asparagus.

, Check on the asparagus after about 2 and a half minutes to check for doneness. The asparagus is done when it turns bright green.

, Be careful while doing this so that the steam doesn't burn you. Consider using a fork or a pair of tongs to lift the plastic wrap off. Serve the asparagus immediately.

Lay the cucumber horizontally onto your cutting board.,
Hold your knife properly.,
Make careful cuts.,
Slice your cucumber into whatever size and shape you desire.",How to Slice a Cucumber2," There are many different ways to slice your cucumber for basic everyday slicing. Create cucumber medallions by slicing through the length of the cucumber to create cucumber medallions.

, Grip your knife handle with your middle, ring, and pinkie finger on the knife handle and your thumb and forefinger on the sides of the blade to steady your cut.Hold on to the cucumber with your opposite hand. Grip it lightly with your fingertips curled into it.

, Start with the knife handle up and the knife point resting on the cucumber in the place where you want to make your first cut. Push the knife forward and down into each cut.

, You can make cucumber sticks for a vegetable platter or chop up small pieces and toss them in a salad.

Enjoy!",How to Slice a Cucumber3," Grip your knife handle with your middle, ring, and pinkie finger on the handle and your thumb and forefinger on the sides of the blade to steady your cut.Hold on to the cucumber with your opposite hand. Grip it lightly with your fingertips curled into it.

, Try to slice each piece evenly and aim for a thickness of 1-2mm (1/16in). This will leave you with thin rectangular cuts. Begin each cut with the knife handle up and the tip down into the cucumber. Push the blade forward as you push it down to create your cuts.


Your hand position should allow the side of the knife blade to gently rest against the knuckles of your other hand as you hold the cucumber. Making this cut with confidence takes practice. If you are nervous, grip your cucumber further back from your knife blade.

, Take each thin slice and repeat the same technique.Aim for dimensions of about 2mm X 2mm X 4cm (1/16in X 1/16in X 2in)., The Batonnet method is a variation of the Julienne cut which produces thicker pieces.


Simply cut your pieces into 6 cm (2.5 inch) long pieces, then cut each of those pieces into 6mm (1/4th) thick slices. Stack those slices, then cut them lengthwise into 6mm (1/4th) wide sticks., Julienne cut cucumbers work great in a salad, on a vegetable platter, or rolled into a sushi roll.

Slice and dice with the paysanne cut.,
Spiral cut your cucumbers.,
Enjoy!",How to Slice a Cucumber4," Instead of slicing cucumber medallions, you can dice your cucumber by cutting it in half longways, and then cutting it in half longways again. Line the halves up horizontally on your cutting board and slice through the length of your cucumber to dice it.

, Dicing your cucumbers adds just one step to the Julienne cut you have already done. Take your julienne cuts and bunch them up with your hand. Then cut the julienne into equally shaped dice. That's it!


Aim for dimensions of about 2mm X 2mm X 2mm (1/16 in X 1/16 in X 1/16 in).
You can also dice your cucumbers into thicker pieces if you prefer.

, If you'd like to produce cubes, you can use what’s called the Medium dice to cut your Batonnet pieces.Hold each piece and cut cubes of about 6mm X 6mm X 6mm (1/4 in X 1/4 in X 1/4 in)


Aim to get your pieces as even as possible.

, If you would like smaller thinner cubes, slice each cube into about 12mm X 12mm X 3mm (1/2 in X 1/2 in X 1/8 in) squares from one side of the cube to the other., Use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler (recommended if you don't have experience in spiral cutting cucumbers) and begin peeling at one side in a circular motion. You should be creating a very thin peel. Continue until you have reached the end of your cucumber.


Be careful with the knife or vegetable peeler, always cut away from your hands and fingers.
Try to keep the shaving intact, but it's okay if it breaks off too.
If you'd like, you can use a knife or apple corer to take the seeds out before you begin peeling.
Spiral cut cucumbers are a fun way to garnish a salad. You can even dress spiral cut cucumbers with a light dressing and a little bit of pepper for a creative salad. Put spiral cut cucumbers on a sandwich or burger for a twist.

Grate vegetables into your meals.,
Add pureed vegetables to your food.,
Add vegetables to your baked goods.,
Stir vegetables into ground meats.,
Add chopped greens to your grains.,
Use vegetables as sauces or dressings.",How to Sneak Vegetables Into Meals1," If you're used to cooking for picky eaters that scoop the vegetables out of their food, try grating the vegetables. Grated vegetables are hard to spot and they blend in easily to most dishes. Try grating carrots, zucchini, broccoli, or beets.For example, you can mix grated carrots into meatloaf for extra flavor and moisture. You could also stir grated zucchini into pasta or casseroles.;
, Steam or roast any vegetables until they're soft. Place the cooked vegetables in a food processor or blender and blend them until they're completely smooth. You can stir these vegetable purees into sauces, mashed potatoes, soup, or pastas.For example, puree cauliflower, winter squash, or roasted red peppers and add them to your favorite casserole.

, Many vegetables add moisture, flavor, and nutrients to baked goods. Since grated and pureed vegetables blend into the baked goods, no one will realize that they're also getting a serving of vegetables. You can usually add 1/2 cup of grated or pureed vegetables to most baked goods.Try adding pumpkin puree, butternut squash puree, or grated carrots or zucchini to muffins, quick breads or pancakes.

, You can easily grate or shred vegetables to stir into ground meats that you'll stir fry or cook into a sauce. If you can't easily grate or shred the veggie, try pureeing it before stirring it into the meat. For example, you can puree onion and stir it into meatballs.


Pureed spinach (fresh or frozen) can easily be mixed into meat for meatloaf. To hide the color of the green spinach, use it with ground beef instead of ground chicken or turkey.

, If you usually serve a grain or a starch with your meals, start stirring in chopped vegetables. Try to keep the vegetables small so they combine with the grain or starch. This will also keep people from noticing and picking them out.For example, you could stir chopped spinach into brown rice or quinoa.

, Mash or puree vegetables to use as sauces or dressings. Stir in vegetable stock until the purees are thin and easy to pour over foods. Roasted red peppers, butternut squash and carrots make flavorful and slightly sweet sauces. To make a quick salad dressing, simply mash avocado and thin it with olive oil and lemon juice. To use your vegetable sauces or dressings, drizzle them over:Mashed vegetables
Meats
Fish
Salads

Swap out some of the fruit in your smoothies.,
Use sweet potatoes instead of baking potatoes for baked fries.,
Replace pasta noodles with vegetables.,
Replace some of your pizza sauce with pumpkin puree.,
Make vegetables more appealing.",How to Sneak Vegetables Into Meals2," If you frequently cook meals that heavily rely on meat (like chili, sloppy joes, or hamburgers), consider replacing some of the meat with mushrooms. Chop the mushrooms very fine and add them to the recipe along with the meat.For extra flavor, try sauteeing the chopped mushrooms over medium heat until they release their liquid.

, Puree black beans, navy beans or chickpeas (garbanzo beans) along with a little olive oil until you get a spreadable consistency. You can dip crackers, tortillas, or other vegetables (like carrot or celery sticks) into the bean dip.Try seasoning the bean dip with cumin, paprika, lemon juice, chili powder, or harissa for extra flavor.

, Instead of making an all-fruit smoothie which can be high in sugar, include veggies for added nutrients. Try using a ratio of 60% fruit and 40% vegetables. The flavor of the fruit will also help hide the taste of mild vegetables. Great vegetables to blend include:Spinach
Kale
Avocado
Parsley
Cucumber

, Russet or baking potatoes are commonly used to make baked fries and mashed potatoes. However, they're high in calories and don't offer as many nutrients as sweet potatoes do. Simply replace sweet potatoes when roasting or baking potatoes or fries. They'll have a slightly sweet flavor that works well with rich meat.You may want to make mashed sweet potatoes instead of traditional mashed potatoes. They'll have more flavor and color.

, Whether you're making macaroni and cheese or fettuccine alfredo, you can sneak vegetables by using them instead of pasta. For example, cook and scoop out spaghetti squash. Or use a spiralizer or mandolin to finely slice or cut the vegetables into noodle shapes or ribbons. You can use:Zucchini
Kohlrabi
Beets
Broccoli
Carrots
Sweet potato

, Making homemade pizza is a great way to hide vegetables. Keep the vegetable pieces small and cover them with the layer of cheese to completely hide them. You can also swap out some of the pizza sauce with a little pumpkin puree to get additional health benefits.For even more vegetables in your pizza, grate up some fresh cauliflower and blend it into the flour for your crust. No one will even realize they're eating another vegetable.

, If you're tired of the classic celery stick and peanut butter dip, dress it up to make it more interesting. Try dipping carrot, celery, or jicama sticks into almond or cashew butter. Then drizzle the snack with a little honey or agave.For a sweet and spicy vegetable snack, sprinkle a little chili powder or squirt a little hot sauce over the nut butter.

Season vegetables when they come off the grill.",How to Season Grilled Vegetables," All vegetables can be cooked on the grill, but those with lower water content will do best.


Try corn, zucchini, potatoes, peppers, squash, mushrooms, artichokes and asparagus. Use vegetables that are seasonal and can be purchased fresh at grocery stores and farmers markets.;
, Toss your vegetables with salt, pepper and oil before you grill them. You can add layers of other seasonings once you have these staples on the vegetables.


Spread out your vegetables on a plate or a baking sheet. Drizzle oil over them and sprinkle salt and pepper to taste. Mix them by hand or with a pair of tongs until they are evenly coated.

, You may have cookbooks or cooking magazines that have recipes for grilled vegetables. They will recommend seasonings such as thyme, rosemary, garlic, parsley, lemon, and cayenne pepper.


Find recipes on general food sites such as Epicurious and specialty sites for vegetarians (Savvy Vegetarian and Vegetarian Times) and grilling (Grilling.com).

, If you would rather go your own way than follow a recipe, use whatever you have in your herb garden or spice rack.


Try oregano, dill, balsamic vinegar, fresh basil and blends of southwest or Mediterranean spices.

, Soak your vegetables in a liquid marinade before putting them on the grill. Soy sauce and barbecue sauce are good to try to you could coat your vegetables in salad dressing before grilling.

, Instead of grilling vegetables directly on the grill, wrap them in foil with all the seasonings you want to include.


Take advantage of the foil pouch method if your vegetables stick to the grill, or if you would prefer to have them keep their natural shape and moisture. Some people also use grill baskets. The basket holds sliced vegetables on the heat while keeping them from sticking to the grill or falling through the grill rack.

, After tasting what you have grilled, sprinkle some parmesan cheese, and add a little salt, pepper or other herbs and spices to achieve the taste you want.


Use dipping sauces as well. Kids might enjoy dipping grilled pepper strips into ranch dressing, or you could dip grilled asparagus into sour cream and chives.

, There are various herbs that go really well with carrots. These include:


For some additional flavor, it's great to add rosemary. This brings out the earthy flavor in the carrots.
Parsley is a wonderful partner for carrots. This is an umbelliferous, relative of the carrot and helps to intensify the flavor. Cumin, coriander and dill are other plant relatives that match well with carrots.
Anise is a great addition to carrots. Star anise brings out a fresh, woody flavor in carrots.
Add cardamom to make carrot desserts, such as Indian carrot halwa or halwa dessert.

, If the carrots are fresh, bring out their sweetness by adding some of the following suggestions.


Carrots go well with orange, either for savory or sweet dishes. They help to increase the sweetness in a pleasant way. Other citrus, such as lemon, can enhance the carrot flavors too.

;
, These need to be cooked in their own dish to achieve crispiness:









Prepare the turnips. Choose smaller sized turnips and peel them. They can be roasted whole or cut into chunks if preferred.
Roll the peeled turnips or chunks of turnips in olive oil.
Add them to the roasting/baking dish and place in the oven.
Bake in a moderate oven until tender. They should be turned once or twice during the roasting. Small turnips roast in about 25 minutes, while larger chunks can take another 5 minutes.

, In this method, prepare large chunks of turnips. Simply add them to an already roasting piece of meat or poultry to roast in the juices. These chunks should be added about an hour before the estimated finish time for the roast.









Turnip chunks can also be mixed in with other vegetables being roasted, such as potatoes, carrots, swedes, etc.

Cook the green beans with bacon for rich flavor.",How to Sauté Green Beans," Fill a large saucepan about half full with water, estimating the amount needed to fully cover the full batch of green beans. Set the saucepan on your stove over medium-high to high heat, and let it reach a rolling boil.


Do not add the green beans before the water reaches a boil since doing so would cause the green beans to overcook.
If desired, you can add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt to the boiling water. Doing so may help enhance the flavor of the green beans, but it will also add more sodium to the dish, so you can opt to leave it out if desired.;
, As the saucepan of water boils, fill a separate large bowl with water and several handfuls of ice. You’ll need this ice water to quickly stop the cooking process later on, so it must be prepared before you begin blanching the green beans.

, Add the green beans to the pot of boiling water. Wait for the water to resume boiling, then set your timer and allow the green beans to boil for about three minutes.


When ready, your green beans should turn brighter in color, and spear easily with a fork., Using a slotted spoon, transfer the green beans from the boiling water to the bowl of ice water. Keep them in the ice water for three minutes, or until completely cooled. This prevents the green beans from continuing to cook after being removed from boiling water.


This process, known as blanching, is a recommended cooking practice for vegetables that removes bacteria, and stops enzyme actions that result in loss of vitamins, flavor, color and texture.You may opt to skip blanching if you’re in a hurry, but blanching is strongly recommended. Skipping the blanching process may result in a loss of some nutritional value and taste.

, This allows the green beans to drain of water before sautéeing. Failing to drain the water can result in a soggy final product.Note that blanched green beans can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to two days, but when possible, you should move directly into the sauteeing process from the blanching process to ensure the best flavor and texture.

, Pour the oil into a large skillet and set it on the stove over medium heat. Allow it to heat for about one minute, waiting no longer than three minutes.


Minimizing the amount of heating time for the oil should prevent the oil from burning and releasing toxins.
If using you’re using a nonstick skillet, you must add oil to the pan before preheating to extend the life of the nonstick coating. If using another type of skillet, you may either preheat the pan first for about five minutes and add the oil after, or preheat the oil and the pan simultaneously as done with a nonstick skillet; the choice is less crucial here, so do whichever cooking practice feels more comfortable.

, Add the minced garlic to the hot oil and cook for approximately 30 seconds, stirring occasionally. This enhances the garlic’s flavor while also cooking off its strong rawness.As a general guideline, the garlic is ready once the color deepens slightly and the aroma becomes more appetizing.
Be careful when working with garlic. It burns quickly if left unattended, which will ruin the taste of the dish. It's best to start over with fresh oil and fresh garlic if the first batch burns before you can cook the green beans.

, Add the green beans to the skillet and stir frequently for three to five minutes, or until heated through.Check for doneness. Green beans cook at different rates based on size and age. Undercooked green beans tend to be rubbery, while overcooked green beans tend to look and taste mushy. Your sauteed green beans are done when flavor is robust and you can bite through the beans with no resistance.Once finished, remove the green beans from the heat to prevent them from overcooking.

, Toss the green beans with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, to taste, or add other seasonings as desired.Enjoy the green beans immediately for maximum flavor.


If cooking the green beans ahead of time, drain any excess oil on clean paper towels, then refrigerate the green beans in an airtight container until ready to serve. You can keep cooked green beans for up to four days., For an easy way to liven up sauteed green beans, you can try adding other dried herbs or spices to the dish when you would usually add plain salt and pepper. When experimenting with flavor, start small--about 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of any spice or 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of any dried herb--toss to coat, taste test, and add more as desired.


Popular herbs for green beans include basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, and tarragon. If you’d like to stick with only one herb, try rosemary; if you’d prefer an herb blend, basil, oregano, and thyme often work well together.
For a spicier dish, consider cumin, chili powder, or curry. For something deep yet mild, consider celery seed or nutmeg.You should also keep the other dishes of your meal in mind when choosing spices, and pair the seasonings added to your green beans accordingly. For instance, if you’re serving the green beans with chicken flavored with rosemary, adding a little rosemary to the green beans can help tie the meal together.

, Use about 1/4 cup (60 ml) unsalted slivered almonds, pine nuts, or walnuts.Toast the nuts in the oil after the garlic but before the green beans, stirring and cooking for about three minutes or until they smell stronger and get deeper in color. Add the green beans and continue cooking as usual.If you don't like the taste of toasted nuts but still want to try this option, you can also add the nuts to the dish alongside the salt and pepper.You may also choose to omit the garlic when using nuts if desired.

, For an easy dressing, whisk together 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of balsamic vinegar with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil. Add the dressing to the green beans after sauteeing them, tossing to coat well.You can either allow it to warm up in the pan for another minute or let the dressing remain at room temperature by serving the green beans immediately after.
For another variation, consider mixing 1 Tbsp (15 ml) balsamic vinegar with 1 tsp (5 ml) of honey.Add the dressing to the pan during the last minute or two of sauteing, stirring well to coat.

, Bacon is a classic way to dress up green beans. Cook 4 to 6 pieces of bacon before cooking the green beans; let it cool, then tear or cut it into small pieces. Cook the green beans as usual, then sprinkle the finished green beans with the bacon before serving.You can saute the green beans in the bacon grease for a stronger bacon flavor, or drain the bacon grease and stick with olive oil for a healthier variation.

Ripen the mango in a paper bag or newspaper.,
Submerge the mango in a bowl of uncooked rice or popcorn kernels.,
Set the unripe mango on the kitchen counter at room temperature.,
Smell the mango for the most reliable results.,
Squeeze the mango gently after you've sniffed.,
Don't rely on colour to judge the ripeness of a mango.,
Don't be scared away by a few black spots on the surface of the mango skin.,
Place the whole mango in the refrigerator when it has ripened.,
Peel and chop the ripe mango if desired.",How to Ripen Mangoes," Leave the bag of mangos on the kitchen counter overnight and check for ripeness in the morning. Mangos wrapped in a paper bag will release ethylene, which is an odourless gas that speeds up the ripening process.Remove and use the mango when it gives off a fruity scent and yields to soft pressure, usually about a day (or less).


Alternatively, you could try ripening the mangoes by covering them with onions and hay in a warm place; this method of ripening was used for ages in India.
When wrapping mangos in a paper bag or newspaper, be sure not to close the bag completely. Some air and gas needs to escape or mold and mildew might start to form.Add an apple or banana to the bag to speed up the ripening even more. Adding more ethylene-emitting fruits will increase the ethylene in the bag, giving you an even juicier mango all the quicker.;
, This old wives trick hails from India, where industrious moms hid unripe mangos in bags of uncooked rice to speed up the ripening. In Mexico, the trick is much the same, except with uncooked popcorn kernels instead of rice. The ingredients are different, but the process and the results are the same: Instead of waiting three days for your mangos to ripen au naturel, they should be ripe within a day or two, maybe even less.


The reason behind the ripening here is the same as the paper bag method: Rice or popcorn helps trap ethylene gas around the mango, resulting in a much faster ripening process.
In fact, this method is so effective that you sometimes risk overripening the mango. Check every 6 or 12 hours for doneness. As long as you don't forget the mango inside the bowl of rice, you should have a wonderfully ripe mango at your disposal.

, You only need time and patience for this method. Mangos, like other fruits, may take several days to ripen, but this is the most natural way of getting your mango plump, juicy, and ready to eat. Use the mango when it is soft to the touch and has a strong fruity smell.

, Sniff the stem end of the mango. If it has a heavy, fruity, almost musky odour, it is ripe. It you're struggling to find an aroma, chances are your mango isn't quite there yet.

, Press the mango gently. If it is soft and gives slightly, it is ripe. A ripe mango feels similar to a ripe peach or ripe avocado. If the mango feels firm and unyielding, it is still unripe.

, Although most ripe mangos will also feature rich reds and burnt yellows more than soft greens, ripe mangos are not always red and yellow.So forget the look of mangos when determining ripeness. Instead, use smell and softness as your guide.

, Some people are scared away by mangos that have a few splotchy, black blemishes on them. These blemishes usually indicate the beginning of the end for mangos. While mangos are notoriously susceptible to spoilage, black blotches don't necessarily mean the mango is bad. In fact, it may mean the mango has more sugar content.If the black spots are especially soft, cut the mango open and look for translucent fruit. This is a sign of spoilage, and these mangos should be thrown away.
Use your senses if the mango in question has a few black spots: If it doesn't give too much, has a pleasant smell, and the skin is otherwise taut and richly-coloured, give the mango a go.

, No wrap or container is necessary to store the mango in the refrigerator. Keeping the mango in the refrigerator will slow down the speed at which the mango continues to ripen. Keep a whole ripe mango in the refrigerator for as long as five days.


Never store a mango in the refrigerator before it has ripened. Like all tropical fruits, mangos should not be stored in the fridge before they are ripe, as their fruit might be damaged by the cold temperature and the refrigeration will halt the ripening process.

, Place the chopped, ripe mango into an airtight container. Keep the container in the refrigerator for a few days. Keep chopped mango in an airtight container in the freezer for as long as 6 months.

Note that pears are usually picked unripe.",How to Ripen Pears1," The rationale behind this is that they do not ripen well when left on the tree and are better stored in a cool place to ripen.In fact, the ripening stage is fairly narrow and a pear can ripen and spoil all within a matter of a few hours!








If you purchase pears that have been picked when mature (or picked them yourself), they need to be eaten straight away.;
"
"
Hasten the ripening of pears in one of the following ways:









Remove from the refrigerator and leave the pears at room temperature (between 65ºF/18.3ºC and 75ºF/23.8ºC).They'll ripen quickly away from cool storage, in about 1-7 days.,
Know your pear.",How to Ripen Pears2," Note that the longer a pear has spent in cool storage, the faster it will ripen when placed at room temperature.Place in a brown paper bag with a ripe banana or apple, to take advantage of the ethylene given off by these fruits (it's a fruit ripening chemical).Be very careful though, as the pear may peak and deteriorate before you check back (in which case, go see below for uses of overripe pears). Alternatively, simply situate the pears near a bunch of bananas. Be ready to eat the pears quickly.

, If you know the type of pear you have, your ripening process at room temperature can be really specific, as follows:








Bartlett pears: 4 to 5 days
Bosc and Comice pears: 5 to 7 days
Anjou pears: 7 to 10 days.

"
"
Check the stem flesh.",How to Ripen Pears3," As already noted, a pear passes through its perfect stage of ripeness fairly quickly, once reached. A pear is ripe and ready to eat when you can feel a softening of the flesh at the end of the stem and the skin gives slightly to your touch.







"
"
Keep the pears in the refrigerator.",How to Ripen Pears4," This will delay ripening.








"
"
Cook with overripe pears.,
Stew overripe pears.",How to Ripen Pears5," Simply peel them and chop them up to add them to a pie, cake or other baked good able to hold fruit. The sweetness of the pears means you can add less sugar to the recipe too.









Here are some recipes to try: Chocolate pear cake, vegan pear cake and pear pie.

, Overripe pears are best stewed, as they may fall apart and not keep the lovely pear shape required for poaching. However, they will still taste great and with the addition of some berry fruits or apples, this makes for a delicious dessert. Finish by topping with yogurt or cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon or nutmeg.

Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).,
Wash your asparagus.,
Trim your asparagus to remove the woody ends of the stalks.,
Dry the asparagus if necessary.",How to Roast Asparagus1," While the oven is warming up, you can get to work on the veggies.
, You may want to pick out the thinnest stalks now and save them for a different recipe -- the thinner the stalk, the flimsier they get while roasting. Thicker stalks are best for this cooking method.







, You can cut off the 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of the asparagus with a knife or snap off the ends with your fingers. When you snap off the ends, the woody part breaks off, leaving only the part of the tender asparagus spear.









Some people prefer the stalks of asparagus peeled, but others find this step unnecessary. If you're a peeler, peel away.

, You don't want the asparagus being steamed! Any extra water isn't necessary for roasting -- it's all about dry heat. Pat the asparagus with a paper towel or roll them in a clean dishcloth.

Line a rimmed cookie sheet with aluminum foil.,
Roll the asparagus spears in olive oil to coat them.,
Arrange the asparagus spears in a single layer on the pan.,
Sprinkle the asparagus spears with salt and pepper, and other seasonings to taste.,
Place the pan of asparagus spears in the preheated oven.",How to Roast Asparagus2," If you don't have a cookie sheet, a baking dish will also work. If you use a baking dish, don't worry about using aluminum foil.









Aluminum foil also keeps you from worrying about clean up and lets you concentrate on the impending deliciousness in front of you. Double win.

, Use 1 to 2 tbsp. (15 to 30 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil to start. If it's not enough, add more until they each get a thin coating.









Do this in the pan! No point in dirtying another dish. When you drizzle on the olive oil, just roll them around with a fork. Try to get the olive oil evenly disbursed throughout.

, You want them to roast as evenly as possible. If they're bunched on top of each other, they'll cook at different rates.








, If you have kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, even better. The fresher your seasonings, the more the taste will come alive.









Minced garlic is also a welcome addition to any roasted asparagus plate. If you like the taste of garlic, add in a few finely chopped cloves.

, Cook the spears for 8 to 10 minutes. If you're working with thick spears or a hefty load, you may need more time. Keep an eye on it and issue a taste test at around 10 minutes.









It's best to place the pan of asparagus on the middle rack. The heat circulates most evenly at the center of the oven.
Halfway through the cooking time, turn the asparagus with a fork or by shaking the pan.
Some recipes call for as long as 25 minutes in the oven.It all depends on the width and number of your stalks.

"
"
Take them out of the oven.,
Add garnishes.,
Serve roasted asparagus spears warm or at room temperature.",How to Roast Asparagus3," Asparagus spears are done when the stalks are pliable, but not completely soft. Place the roasted asparagus spears on a serving platter.








, Sprinkle the roasted asparagus spears with finely grated Parmesan cheese or toss them with lemon juice if desired. Place lemon slices on top for presentation, if available.









Another tasty alternative is balsamic vinaigrette. If you haven't tried it, experiment. It gives it a subtly tangy flavor.

, The beauty of this veggie is that it's good cold, too! Save the leftovers for tomorrow and snack on 'em straight outta the fridge.









Store the asparagus in an airtight container. They'll keep for a day or two. Combine them with other recipes, too -- asparagus matches well with a number of flavors.

Choose fresh, ripe vegetables.,
Wash the vegetables.,
Peel the vegetables if necessary.,
Cut the vegetables into thin slices.",How to Puree Vegetables1," The most flavorful and nutritious purees are made with the freshest vegetables that are at the peak of ripeness. Choose vegetables with firm flesh and bright color. Avoid vegetables with bruising or soft spots.


While frozen or canned vegetables can be used to create purees, they won't have the same nutritional value and flavor as purees made with fresh vegetables.
Any type of vegetable can be pureed (though it's harder to get a smooth puree with stringy greens). Try carrots, sweet potatoes, white potatoes, green beans, broccoli squash, and any other vegetable with flesh that becomes soft when cooked.;
, Make sure to rinse away all traces of dirt by running the vegetables under a stream of cold water. You may want to use a vegetable cleanser if you're pureeing vegetables that were treated with pesticides.

, Cut both the top and bottom ends off of your vegetables with a knife, and remove any places with bruising. Use a paring knife or a vegetable peeler to remove tough peels from sweet potatoes, white potatoes, carrots, squash, and other vegetables with peels., Cutting the vegetables into slices instead of chunks will mean less cooking time, and your puree will come out smoother.

"
"
Boil a few inches of water in a large saucepan.,
Steam the vegetables for 15 to 20 minutes.,
Transfer the cooked vegetables to a large bowl.",How to Puree Vegetables2," There's no need to fill it up; you just need a few inches of water in order to steam the vegetables. Two to four cups of water will be sufficient, depending on the size of the pan you're using.


Steaming vegetables is the best way to preserve their nutrient content. Boiling vegetables is another option for softening them, but boiling has been found to destroy some of the nutrients.

, Fill the steamer basket with your vegetable slices and put the basket inside the saucepan. Cover the saucepan to begin steaming your vegetables. Avoid crowding the steamer basket with too many vegetables; you may have to do it in batches. After 15 to 20 minutes, the vegetables should be completely soft.


If you don't have a steamer basket, place the vegetable slices into the boiling water. Boil them for 15 minutes or until they feel tender when pierced with a fork. Be careful not to crowd the pan.

, Remove the vegetables from the steamer basket or saucepan using a slotted spoon or a stainless steel mesh strainer and place them in a bowl. Continue steaming batches of vegetables until all of your vegetables are softened and ready to puree.

"
"
Use a food processor or blender.,
Try a food mill.,
Use an immersion blender with a little water.",How to Puree Vegetables3," Scoop approximately 1 cup of cooked vegetables from the bowl and place them inside the blender or food processor. Puree the vegetables in batches, adding a little water as necessary to achieve a smooth texture.For best results, try not to puree more than 1 cup of softened vegetables at a time.
Scrape the puree out of your food processor or blender and put it into a separate container. Store the puree for later use or use it in a recipe according to the instructions.

, A food mill is a large metal perforated bowl fitted with a blade. As you crank the handle, the softened vegetables are smashed and pushed through a strainer and come out in pureed form.You don’t have to peel the vegetables for this method since the food mill will naturally separate the flesh from the skin. You’ll have a chance later on in the process to discard the skins and seeds.


Place a large bowl on your countertop. You will need this bowl to catch the puree as it comes out of the food mill.
Place 1 cup of softened vegetables into the mill.
Turn the handle in a clockwise direction with your dominant hand as you hold onto the contraption with your non-dominant hand. The pureed vegetable flesh will be pushed through the strainer into your bowl.

, An immersion blender, or hand-held blender, can be used to puree the vegetables right in the bowl or the pot you cooked them in if you add a little water. Place the immersion blender into your bowl of vegetables so that the blade is about 1” beneath the top layer of vegetables. Turn the blender on and guide the blender through the vegetable pieces in a circular motion. Continue blending until all of the pieces are pureed.


If you raise the blade above the level of the vegetables, then the blade will spatter vegetable pieces and make a mess. Turn the blender off while it is still beneath the surface of the puree to prevent spattering.
When the blade has stopped spinning, lift it out of the puree and set it aside.

"
"
Season the puree if desired.,
Refrigerate vegetable puree for up to a week.,
Freeze vegetable puree for several months.,
Finished.

",How to Puree Vegetables4," If the puree is to be used as baby food, you may not want to add seasonings. For kids and adults, however, vegetable purees taste delicious with seasonings. Try a pinch of salt and pepper and a pat of butter or a few spoonfuls of cream. This will enrich the flavor of the vegetables and help create a smoother texture.

, Spoon the puree into airtight containers (such as sterilized glass jars) and store in the refrigerator until use, for up to a week. You may want to label the jars with the type of food and date., Spoon the puree into freezer-safe containers, making sure to remove as much air as possible. Freeze the puree for several months.

, Using a fruit or vegetable peeler, glide the blade away from you along the raised edges. The skin should slide off easily.

, Do this by using a paring knife to slice along the concave creases of the fruit. Be careful to avoid cutting completely through the fruit. The slices will separate easily once you have sliced into all the creases., Holding one slice with both hands, gently move your thumbs in opposite directions. The slice should easily come apart into two pieces.


You will find the seed packet along the edge facing you.
Gently pull the packet out from the top down.
Repeat this process with the remaining slices., First, spray the slices with cold water. Then, soak them in distilled water for about two minutes. Soap, detergent, and other cleaners are toxic if swallowed and should be avoided--especially on sliced fruit!, This can be done in a blender on the ""purée"" setting. If you are using a food processor, use the lower setting. Stop the blender or food processor when the mixture has become smooth but still thick. Do not let it liquefy too much.

, Store the trays in the freezer. Allow the purée to freeze for at least 24 hours.

, Write ""Star Fruit"" and the date on the outside of the bag. Tropical fruits tend to keep for about three months in the freezer., Use a low setting until you get the desired texture. For chunky jam, set the food processor or blender to a ""chop"" setting. If you prefer a smoother texture, set the food processor or blender to a ""purée"" setting.

, In a saucepan, simmer the mixture over a low heat. Watch it closely until it begins to sizzle. Stir regularly to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.

Allow the beetroot to pickle for at least a week before opening.",How to Preserve Beetroot," You may use mason jars with lids and rings or recycled glass jars that previously held tomato sauce or other food items. If you're using used jars, scrub out the jars with soapy water and a scrub brush to remove all food particles, or run them through the dishwasher. Sterilize the jars, lids, and any utensils you're using in the following way:Place them in a large pot and fill it with cold water.
Bring the water to a boil and boil for 10 minutes.
Remove them with clean tongs and allow them to dry on a clean towel.;
, Ideally, beetroot will have been harvested about one month prior to preserving it. This gives the vegetable time to cure and finish ripening, resulting in the best flavor. Look for beetroot that's firm with no visible bruises or soft spot.


Though ripe beetroot is best, since preserved beetroot gains flavor from the pickling liquid, you can use beets that are on the older side or aren't quite ripe yet.

, Fresh beetroot is often caked with dirt. Take a vegetable brush and scrub it on all dies to remove the grit. Rinse thoroughly under cold running water. If you find blemishes under the dirt, slice them off with a paring knife., Slice off the greens with a sharp paring knife. Beetroot greens are tasty in their own right. Consider stewing them up after you're finished preserving your beetroot.

, Place it in a large pot and cover with water. Sprinkle a teaspoon or so of salt into the water, then turn the heat up and bring it to a boil. Boil the beetroot until you can easily stick one with a knife, about 30 minutes. Then remove the pot from heat and drain the water.

If you have beetroot of varying sizes, place the larger vegetables in the water first. Let them boil for about five minutes before adding the remaining beets. This will ensure that the largest beets cook all the way through and the smaller ones don't overcook.

, When the beetroot is cool enough to touch, simply slide off the peels with your fingers. After boiling, it the beetroot peels should easily slip off. Help them along with a knife if necessary. Discard the peels when you're finished.

, Many choose to pickle beetroot in discs suitable for sandwiches, but you can cut the beetroot into any shape you'd like. Cutting the beetroot into smaller pieces allows you to pack more into the jars.

, Do this while the beetroot is hot so that the liquid will also be hot when the beetroot is ready. Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for two minutes.

, Distribute it evenly among the jars you have set out. Pack in the beetroot to within a few inches of the tops of the jars.

, Pour it over the beetroot to within half inch of the top of each jar. It's important to leave a bit of headspace at the top of the jar to prevent too much pressure from accumulating there. Place the lids on the jars and tighten them.


If you see air bubbles in the jars, tap the bottoms of the jars lightly against the counter top to make them float to the top and pop.

, Set them on the counter and let them cool overnight before storing.

, During this time the pickling liquid will penetrate the beetroot to add flavor and change the texture. You may enjoy the beetroot at any time after one week has passed.


Beetroot preserved this way will keep up to three months in a cool, dark place.
Once you open a jar, store it in the refrigerator.

Although you don't need to butter or grease the sheets, you may want to lay down foil for easier clean up.Since many fall vegetables take a while to roast, use heavy baking sheets so the heat is distributed evenly. This way, your pan won't warp or pop once you've placed it in the hot oven.;
, Wash your fall vegetables before you peel them. Take a sharp kitchen knife with a large blade (like a chef's knife) and carefully cut all the vegetables into cubes. The cubes should all be similar in size, about an inch to 1 1/4 inch. Avoid dicing the vegetables. If the vegetables are too small, they're more likely to shrink and burn as they roast. You'll need to peel and chop:1 pound (450 g) of carrots
1 pound (453 g) of parsnips
1 large (230 g) sweet potato
1 small butternut squash (about 2 pounds or 900 g) with the seeds removed

, Spread the cut vegetables on the two baking sheets. The vegetables should be mixed and they need to be in a single layer so they roast evenly. Drizzle 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the two sheets of vegetables. Sprinkle the vegetables with 1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper. Toss the vegetables to coat them.You can easily halve this recipe by using half of the ingredients and roasting enough vegetables to fill one of the baking sheets.

, Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake the vegetables for 25 to 35 minutes. To make sure that all the sides are evenly roasted, turn the vegetables with a spatula halfway through the cooking time. The fall vegetables will be done when the're all tender and golden brown.Sprinkle the roasted vegetables with 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley before serving.

Try roasting carrots or parsnips.,
Consider roasting squash.,
Roast brussels sprouts halves.,
Try roasting beets in foil.,
Roast crispy potatoes.",How to Roast Fall Vegetables2," Wash and cut carrots or parsnips into sticks or chunks. Bring a pot of water to boil and add the vegetables.

You don't have to peel the carrots before roasting them.

, You can either roast an entire fall squash (like butternut, acorn, or kabocha) whole or cut into pieces. To roast one whole, place the whole squash on a sheet and bake it at 400 degrees F (204 C) for one hour or until it's tender. To roast pieces, cut the squash in half and slice or cut it into smaller pieces. Toss the pieces with olive oil and spread them on a baking sheet. Roast the squash for about 30 minutes.You can scoop out and discard the seeds after roasting a whole squash. You could also save them and roast them separately.

, Cut brussels sprouts in half and place them in a large mixing boil. Drizzle them with olive oil and any seasoning you're using. Spread the brussels sprouts on a baking sheet and roast them in a 500 degree F (260 C) oven for about 20 minutes.The brussels sprouts will appear dark brown and will be tender if you poke them with a fork or knife.

, The easiest way to roast beets is to drizzle whole unpeeled beets with foil and place them on a square of aluminum foil. Fold the aluminum foil into a packet so the beets are sealed. Set the packet on a baking sheet and roast the beets in foil in a 375 degree F (190 C) oven for 1 hour. Remove the beets and let them rest for 30 minutes before opening the foil pack.To remove the skins, simply run the roasted and cooled beets under cold water. The skins should just slip off.

, For potatoes that are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, wash and cut the potatoes into pieces. Bring a pot of water to boil and add the potatoes. Let the potatoes boil for 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes and transfer them to a bowl. Toss them with olive oil and any seasoning you're using. Spread the potatoes onto a baking sheet and roast them at 500 degrees F (260 C) for 35 to 40 minutes.To ensure even baking, you can use a metal spatula to flip the potatoes halfway through the cooking time.

Look for avocados that are semi-soft in the store.,
Slice your avocado length-wise, once you're ready to use it.,
Cut it in half.,
Use citrus.,
Wrap the guacamole right against the surface area and press.,
Store in the refrigerator to the get longest shelf life from the product.",How to Prevent Avocados from Browning," They will be able to be cut open and used that day. If you're planning not to use them right away buy firmer avocados and let them sit on your counter for a few days to ripen up. If they are ripening too quickly, refrigerate them.;
, Roll your knife around it to get two halves. If you're only going to use half of the avocado don't take the seed out. This will prevent less air coming in contact with that side of the avocado. Less air means less browning since it has less surface area to react. Use the half that doesn't have the pit.

, Use saran wrap right against the avocado. This is the best way to prevent browning. With fewer air pockets, the avocado browns slower.

, If you're planning to use both sides of the avocado, remove the seed. Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of lemon or lime juice. Lowering the pH on the surface deactivates the enzymes and the air won't react with a low pH.





, Once wrapped, either store in a tight fit container or wrap again to prevent an extra layer to prevent browning.


, The longer the exposed avocado is left out the quicker it will brown. They will generally last around 3-4 days in the refrigerator."

Choose a healthy Swiss chard.,
Choose from a variety of Swiss chard.,
Wash the chard.,
Decide whether to separate the chard or leave it whole.",How to Prepare and Cook Swiss Chard1," To choose your Swiss chard, you should look for leaves that are bright and bushy, not browned, wilted, or damaged. The stems of Swiss Chard are delicate so you should look for stems that are firm and unbruised. Though there are a variety of Swiss chard forms, any type of shard should look healthy, full, buoyant, and not wilted or droopy., There are several varieties of Swiss chard. Their ribs, which are the parts of the stems that extend up into the leaves, can be red, white, or yellow. The varieties have different tastes, so experiment to find which kind you prefer. Swiss chard with red ribs is often a little sweeter, with less bitter undertone than Swiss chard with white ribs. All the varieties of chard can be prepared the same way, but they can have a different flavor.

The ribs of different varieties of Swiss chard are different widths. Some people prefer the ribs of the Swiss chard and some like the leaves best. If you prefer the ribs, choose Swiss chard with wide ribs. If you like the leaves best, choose Swiss chard with thinner ribs.

, Before you cook the chard, you'll need to wash it. The first thing you should do is wash it well, by rinsing it in a sink full of cold water. You can even drain the water and repeat, unless the chard is free of dirt. If you got the chard at a farmers' market, it will be extra fresh and more likely to have dirt on it, so wash thoroughly. Don't wash the chard until right before you're going to cook it, or it will wilt., Small leaves of Swiss chard can be left whole or added to salad, and larger leaves with thin ribs can also be left whole for cooking. But if you're cooking Swiss chard with thick ribs, then you should separate the ribs from the leaves by tearing the leaves away from the ribs, because the ribs will need to cook for a few more minutes since they are tougher than the leaves."

, Place a metal stovetop steamer basket on your stove over medium-high heat. Pour about two inches of water into the steamer reservoir and bring the water to a boil.


Read the manufacturer instructions before using a stovetop basket steamer. Some steamers have specific limitations on heat and water levels.
Stovetop basket steamers can be bought at most grocery stores and baking supply stores.

, Add the beets to the basket. Cover the basket with the lid and steam the beets for about 45 minutes. Check the water level periodically and add more if needed. Check for doneness by spearing the beetroot with a fork. The fork should slide into the root easily.


Steaming beetroots is faster than baking beetroots. However, steaming is less healthy as nutrients are lost to the water., Use a damp, clean dishtowel to rub the beetroot skin off the beetroot sections.Rinse the beetroot sections under cold water and place in a bowl. Next, drizzle the beetroot with olive oil and toss it with salt and pepper. These beetroot sections can be served as a side dish or added to a salad.

, Wash your turnips in cool water, making sure all the dirt is removed from the skin. Lop off the green tops. If you have baby turnips, there's no need to peel them, but mature turnips have a thick skin that is easily peeled using a potato peeler. , Use a paring knife to cut them into 1-inch pieces.

Peel the pears.,
Prepare the syrup.,
Poach the pears.,
Check the pears are soft by sticking a knife into them gently.,
Spoon the poached pears into a serving bowl.,
Add a topping or side of your choice.",How to Poach Pears1," Slice in half and de-seed. You can use a melon baller or just a spoon to scoop out the seeds. You can also quarter the pears instead of halving them if you prefer. You can really use any type of pear you like, though some pears are better than others for poaching because they tend to keep their shape better instead of falling apart. Pears that are great for poaching include Beurre Bosc pears, Conference pears, Tiny Seckel pears, and Winter Nellis. Pears like the Anjou, Comice, or Bartlett tend to fall apart when you poach them.






;
, Bring a pan of water to the boil, then add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and 2 drops of vanilla essence. Heat until the mixture is warm and all of the sugar is dissolved in the water. For additional flavor, you can add any of the following: 1/2 cinnamon stick, 1 tsp. whole cloves, 1 lemon quarter, black peppercorns, 1-2 star anise, and 3-4 slices ginger.









If you prefer, you can add 1/2 a cup of honey instead of sugar for a thicker flavor.
If you'd like more flavor in the syrup, you can make the water mixture half water and half white wine, or 1/4 water and 3/4 red wine.

, Carefully spoon the pear halves into the boiling water and leave to poach for 15-20 minutes. Keep your liquid boiling on low, so the pears are simmering as they cook. You don't want them to fall apart in the water. For an extra precaution, you can cut a piece of parchment paper with a large hole in the center to help keep the pears from floating up and poaching unevenly. Make sure to keep the poaches submerged in the liquid.








, You can also use a fork instead. If you stick the fork in the pears and they easily slide off, then they are ready. Leave to poach for a little longer if they feel too hard. Once the pears are done, you can add 1/4 cup of sour cherries, cranberries, or raisins to the liquid.








, You can pour some of the syrup over the pears, or even reduce it (by boiling it for an additional 10-15 minutes to thicken it) first and then pour it over the pears. Let them cool in their liquid for at least 10 minutes.








, You can also serve the pears with cream, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate sauce, chocolate ice cream, fresh raspberries, blackberries, or blueberries, a spoonful of crème fraîche, or even next to gingerbread or a spice cake.

Use a sharp knife to cut each fig down the center about three-quarters of the way. You should be able to pull the sides of the fig apart. Do this for all of the figs and put them on a rimmed baking sheet while you make the filling.Some broilers have a LO or HI temperature option. Try using the HI setting when you broil the figs. You may need to adjust the temperature to prevent the bacon from burning.

, Have 3 ounces (85 g) of goat cheese setting out until it gets to room temperature. Put it in a small mixing bowl along with the rest of the filling ingredients. Use a rubber spatula to completely combine the ingredients. You'll need to add:1 tablespoon of pesto
1 tablespoon of lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon zest
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

, Use a small teaspoon to scoop out some of the pesto goat cheese filling and place it in the middle of each sliced fig. Take 12 slices of bacon and cut them in half crosswise, so you have 24 short pieces of bacon. Wrap one piece of bacon around each stuffed fig and stick a toothpick in it, so it won't come apart. Put each wrapped fig back on the baking sheet.Ensure that you put the figs seam-side down on the baking sheet. This way, the filling is less likely to ooze out as the figs broil.

, Place the baking sheet under the preheated broiler. Broil the figs for 4 to 5 minutes so that the bacon cooks and crisps up. Carefully remove the sheet from under the broiler and use tongs to turn the figs over. Return the sheet to the broiler and finish broiling the figs for another 4 to 5 minutes. The bacon should be completely cooked before you serve the figs.You'll need to wear oven mitts when removing the baking sheet from the broiler.

If you add hot walnuts to the cheese, it may melt.

, Use a small spoon or teaspoon and scoop a bit of the goat cheese walnut filling. Gently push the filling into each sliced fig. You may need to use your index finger to scrape the filling off of the spoon.Avoid over stuffing the figs, because this will make them harder to eat and you may run out of filling.

, Measure out 4 tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar into a small mixing bowl. Use a small whisk or fork to vigorously stir together the syrup. The honey should dissolve in the vinegar. Slowly drizzle it over the stuffed figs and serve them immediately.Try to use high-quality honey and balsamic vinegar. Since there are few ingredients in this stuffed fig recipe, you can really taste the honey and vinegar.

After the sugar is equally dispersed in the fruit, taste your fruit.
If the fruit does not feel sweet enough, add an additional teaspoon at a time until your fruit reaches your desired level of sweetness.

, Place your pan over medium heat and add two tablespoons of water. Check the pan every few minutes as your fruit cooks.

Continue cooking.,
Stir in the vanilla extract.,
Strain the pudding.,
Chill before serving.",How to Make Vanilla Pudding1," In a medium saucepan, combine 2 cups (500 ml) of milk with the full amount of sugar and salt. Set the pan on the stove over medium-low heat.Nearly any variety of milk should work for this recipe, including whole, low-fat, and non-fat dairy milk. To make a vegan version, consider using soy milk or almond milk.
As the milk mixture heats up, you should occasionally stir it together with a whisk. Keep an eye on this saucepan; the milk should eventually bubble, but it should not be brought to a full boil.;
, Pour the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of milk into a separate small bowl. Sprinkle the cornstarch over it, then whisk well to combine.


Continue whisking the mixture until the cornstarch fully dissolves and leaves behind no lumps. If there are lumps in the cornstarch slurry, there will be lumps in your pudding.

, Gradually pour the cornstarch slurry into the saucepan of steaming milk, whisking well to fully incorporate it.


Note that the sugar and salt should already be fully dissolved before you add the cornstarch slurry. If you can't tell whether or not the grains have dissolved, wait until milk in the saucepan begins to steam and bubble around the edges of the saucepan.

, Reduce the heat to low and cooking the pudding, stirring occasionally, for about 2 minutes or until it thickens.


Cornstarch requires and adequate amount of heat before it releases its thickening qualities. You need to continue stirring the pudding as it cooks, however, to prevent the cornstarch from forming lumps.
When ready, the pudding should be thick enough to coat the back of metal spoon without immediately running off., Remove the saucepan of pudding from the heat. Pour in the vanilla extract, then stir well to mix it in.

, If you suspect that any lumps may have formed while making the pudding, pour it through a strainer and into a medium or large bowl.


This step won't always be necessary since it's quite possible to prepare vanilla pudding without cooking any lumps into it. If you feel confident about creating a smooth pudding, or if you don't mind a few lumps, you can pass this step and continue directly to the next.

, Pour the pudding into four individual serving dishes. Chill the dishes in a refrigerator for 1 or 2 hours, or until cool. Enjoy.


If you prefer room temperature pudding, you can place the saucepan or full bowl of pudding into a larger bowl filled halfway with water and ice, working carefully to avoid introducing excess water into the pudding. Chill it for 30 minutes or so in this ice bath, then serve in individual dishes once the pudding becomes lukewarm.Skin may form over the surface of the pudding as it cools down. To prevent this, consider pressing a sheet of plastic wrap over the surface of the pudding before chilling it in the refrigerator or ice bath.

",How to Make Vanilla Pudding2," Combine 2 cups (500 ml) of milk with the full amount of salt, sugar, and vanilla bean seeds in a medium saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring frequently.To maximize the richness of this pudding, use whole milk. Other varieties of milk will also work, however, including low-fat dairy milk, non-fat dairy milk, almond milk, and soy milk.
If you are using an actual vanilla bean for this recipe, split it open and scrape the seeds directly into the mixture during this step. If you are using vanilla extract, though, do not add it now; add it alongside the butter during a later step.

, In a separate small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch with the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of milk.


Continue whisking until the cornstarch dissolves and the slurry seems smooth. If there are any lumps in the cornstarch slurry, those lumps will end up getting into the pudding, too.

, Place the egg yolks in the cornstarch slurry and lightly beat them into the slurry using the whisk.


Use only the separated egg yolks and not the full eggs.
If you choose to use liquid egg yolks instead of freshly separated yolks, measure out 2 Tbsp (30 ml)and beat them into the cornstarch slurry as usual.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat once the milk begins to boil. Slowly pour the cornstarch slurry into the saucepan, whisking well and continuously to combine.


Since the cornstarch slurry has egg yolk in it, you need to work carefully so that the egg yolk does not over-coagulate and curdle. Adding the egg yolk slowly, thoroughly whisking as you add it, and keeping the entire mixture away from direct heat should help prevent curdling.
As you whisk in the cornstarch slurry, the pudding should already start thickening.

, Return the saucepan to the stove and reduce the heat to low. Bring it to a gentle simmer and cook the pudding for another minute or two after that point.Stir frequently as the pudding continues cooking to prevent skin or lumps from forming.
This step should cook the egg yolks and cornstarch, causing the pudding to thicken up further. When ready, the pudding should be thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon without running off.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat again. Add the butter to the pudding, mixing well to incorporate it.If using vanilla extract instead of an actual vanilla bean, add the vanilla extract to the pudding during this step, as well.

, If the pudding seems lumpy, you can push it through a strainer to catch and remove any lumps. Collect the smooth pudding in a medium to large bowl placed beneath the strainer.


This step can get messy and it isn't always necessary. If you don't think there are any lumps in your pudding, or if you don't mind biting into a few, consider skipping it.

, Cover the pudding with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 2 hours, or until it feels cool. Spoon it into individual serving dishes and enjoy.


Note that you could also enjoy this pudding warm or at room temperature if desired. It should be thick enough even prior to refrigeration.

, The blossom end is the end with the small brown circle on it. The end has an enzyme that can make your pickles softer, and therefore a bit more soggy., The more you cut or slice the cucumbers, the thinner the pieces will be, and the less crunchy they'll be as a result. If you want truly crunchy pickles, you can just slice a cucumber a few times, so that they'll retain their original shape more. If you use whole pickles, they'll have even more of a kick than the spears., You need the salt to draw the water out of the cucumbers and to preserve the pickles for longer. If you're trying to manage your diet, you can skimp on the sugars or other ingredients a bit, but stick to the necessary amount of salt or you'll be disappointed in your pickles.

Serve pickled raisins with your favorite dishes.",How to Make Pickled Raisins," Before you fire up the stove, have all of the necessary ingredients portioned and set aside. Measure out the spices carefully to ensure that you achieve just the right balance of flavors. Feel free to adjust the amounts of each seasoning to taste.If you’re using fresh spices that you’d prefer to toast yourself, such as mustard seed or anise, do this in the empty saucepan prior to including the other spices.Pickled raisins only take minutes to stew, and can be prepared in a single piece of cookware.;
, Add 2 cups of white vinegar, 1 cup of apple cider vinegar and 1 cup of red wine vinegar. A combination of vinegars will add complexity to the finished flavor. Stir the mixture of vinegar and spices thoroughly.The addition of sugar will help cut some of the acidity of the vinegar and salt.
You can also use honey, agave nectar or simple syrup in place of regular granulated sugar., Turn on the cooktop and set it to medium-high heat. Keep stirring the mixture as it heats up. Once it begins to churn slightly throughout the center, let it boil for 2-3 minutes. This will give the spices a chance to infuse into the liquid.Since dehydrated raisins are absorbent, they should only be added to pre-simmered liquid in order to take in the most seasoning.
Keep the boil under control. The temperature shouldn’t be hot enough for the liquid to slosh, spatter or bubble over.

, Turn down the cooktop to medium-low heat. The constant boiling should be reduced to a slight bubbling around the edges. This will be the ideal temperature for hot pickling. Allow the liquid to rest for another few minutes before adding the raisins.Due to their high sugar content, cooking the raisins at too intense a heat can cause them to break down.

, Dump in all of the raisins at once and stir them until they’re completely covered with liquid. Partially cover the saucepan, leaving one one edge exposed to ventilate heat.


Depending on their density, some of the raisins may float on the top of the saucepan and some may sink to the bottom. Frequent stirring will help circulate them and the pickling spices.
Don’t add more raisins than can comfortably fit in the liquid-filled saucepan. If you want to make more raisins, do it later in a separate batch.

, Set a timer and allow the raisins to stew. As they cook, they’ll begin to absorb the pickling liquid, blowing up to a fat, round, juicy size. Stir the raisins every couple of minutes. This will ensure that the temperature remains even and keep air moving through the liquid.Keep an eye on the raisins as they cook. They may not need the entire 10 minute interval to get done.
You may notice the pickling liquid disappearing as the raisins cook. This is due to both the liquid absorbing into the raisins and evaporating from the intense heat., Set the saucepan aside on an unlit cooktop. Don’t remove the raisins just yet—they’ll continue to suck in the pickling liquid and grow more plump as they sit. Once the liquid has cooled to just over room temperature, the raisins can be served, canned or thrown in the refrigerator for storage.The raisins may begin bursting and disintegrating when overcooked. Be sure to remove them from the heat source before this happens.
Leave whole spices like bay leaves, cloves and star anise in the pickling liquid so they can continue giving off flavor., Transfer the raisins to a large airtight container before refrigerating. Be sure to include an ample amount of the pickling juices. The raisins should stay fresh for up to two weeks when kept cool, but will be best if enjoyed within a few days.A mason jar or Tupperware container of average size will work best for preventing spoilage.
Prepare pickled raisins in small batches to keep them from going bad.

, After cooking off your pickled raisins, pour them into 8 or 12 ounce mason jars, then submerge the jars in a deep pot full of boiling water. The hot water will help seal the jars, which can then be stored away for months or even years.Use oven mitts, tongs and a jar lifter to protect yourself from intense heat while canning.Be sure to refrigerate canned pickled raisins after opening them.

, Tailor the flavor of your pickled raisins for various dishes and palettes. For sweeter raisins, use one bay leaf, whole cloves, allspice berries, and a dash of dried anise. If you’d prefer your raisins to have more of a piquant kick, try spices like ginger, white peppercorns, mustard seed and red pepper flakes.Sweet and spicy raisins can be used in a wide variety of savory dishes as well as sweeter recipes and confections.

, The complex sweetness and tang of the raisins is perfectly suited for plating alongside hearty entrees like braised pork shoulder or curried lamb. More intensely spiced versions of the preserved treat can be incorporated into a bold bread pudding, or even used as a topper to balance the bitterness of a kale or arugula salad.Substitute ordinary raisins for the pickled variety in dishes that could use a little extra zest.
Blend pickled raisins and cook them into a unique jam, compote or chutney."

Allow the filling to cook for about a minute or until it’s warmed through.You can tell when the filling is sufficiently warm when the sauce starts to bubble.
It’s a good idea to taste the mixture to see if it needs more hoisin sauce before removing it from the pan. Add up to 2 tablespoons (32 g) more depending on your taste.

, Take 2 small heads of lettuce, and use a paring knife to cut off the root at the bottom of the heads. To separate the leaves, you can use the knife or your hands depending on how firm the lettuce is.You can use any type of lettuce that you like for these wraps, such as iceberg or romaine. However, lettuces with sturdy, broad leaves, such as bibb and butter, typically work best.

, After you’ve all leaves off the heads of lettuce, fill a large bowl with water and swish the lettuce through it. Let the leaves sit in the water for a minute or so to dislodge any dirt or grit. Next, transfer the leaves to a salad spinner and spin the lettuce until it’s dry.Depending on how large a bowl you have, you may have to wash the lettuce in batches.
If you don’t have a salad spinner, lay the lettuce out on paper towel and blot the leave with another sheet of paper towel until dry.

, Once the lettuce leaves are washed and dry, you can fill the wraps. Place a generous spoonful of the ground chicken and vegetable filling in the center of a leaf. Wrap the leaf around it and eat.If you are serving the lettuce wraps to your family or guests, pile the lettuce on a plate, place the filling in a bowl, and give everyone a spoon so they can assemble their own wraps.

Use tongs to turn the peppers every 3-4 minutes.,
Remove the peppers once they are evenly blackened and soft.",How to Make Homemade Roasted Peppers1," If you set the broiler on, know that you'll have to watch the peppers vigilantly to ensure they don't overcook. The oven, at 500, will cook a bit more slowly and evenly, and is the best way to go., You can also drizzle a small amount of oil out on the sheet if you do not have cooking spray.

, They don't have to be very separated, but they need enough room that you can flip them as they cook. The object is to burn the skin on the peppers so you can peel it off, but you want to make sure all the sides are well crisped.


You can cut the peppers in half and remove seeds before cooking. Some believe this detracts from the flavor, others note it makes the work much easier later. It is your call!, You want to keep the peppers moving. If you're using the broiler, make sure you turn it even more frequently -- ever 3-5 minutes -- to ensure they don't burn completely., They should have bits of color poking through, not so charred that they resemble coals. But the skin should be relatively well colored and hot. When the peppers have turned black almost all over, remove them from the oven.

, If you're only roasting 1-2 peppers, this is the way to go, as you can directly roast them without heating the whole oven. The most common way to do this is a grill, but you can even use your stove-top range if you want.



If using your stove-top: wrap the peppers in 2 layers of aluminum foil. Peppers ""weep"" as they roast, and you don't want these juices on your stove. This mess won't be a problem on a grill., If you're using the stovetop method, you can simply rest the peppers on the grate that normally holds your pots and pans on the stove. For the grill, toss the pepper right on the grate above the flame.

, You'll want to make sure everything cooks evenly, and the whole pepper blisters nicely and evenly. Make sure you keep the peppers moving, keeping an eye on the charring.


For the foil-wrapped peppers, use the tongs to feel the sides soften. You'll notice the side on direct heat gets noticeably squishier.

, Again, you can choose how long to keep the peppers on depending on your tastes, but almost all of the skin needs to be blackened and blistered. For the stovetop, remove the peppers once they entire thing feels soft and pliable under the tongs."

But don't neglect the steaming -- it is essential for removing the tough, charred skin from the peppers. The two most common methods of steaming are:


Cover on a cutting board with a glass bowl
Place in a paper bag and roll it tightly shut.

, Don't try and speed this process up by chilling the peppers. Let them naturally steam and you'll have a much easier time removing the skins.

, Just start peeling. Don't worry about getting everything, as bits and pieces of charred skin will leave a nice, subtle smokey flavor to the peppers. Get as much off as you can or desire.


Rinsing the peppers off in cold water can help remove the skins, but some cooks feel it subtracts some of the flavor., Cut the pepper in half and unfold it as if it was a book. Using a spoon or simply shaking it out, remove the seeds and cut out the stem. Your peppers are now ready to eat!, You can always store the peppers as bigger chunks, but strips are far easier to eat and use. Strips also allow flavors or seasonings to better coat the peppers.

, If you want something a little simpler, a little olive oil and salt will perfectly enhance the flavors of your peppers without overpowering their natural flavor.

, The peppers can stay like this without going bad for 3-5 days, but any longer than this and you should consider canning them.

Place the asparagus into a shallow dish to coat with olive oil.,
Add a dash of salt and pepper right before putting the spears on the grill.,
Grill about 5-10 minutes, turning them once or twice.,
Remove when the thickest spears are easily pierced with a fork.",How to Make Grilled Asparagus1," You want bigger stalks with deep-green or slightly purple tips for the grill. While you can use the extra thin spears, they tend to either overcook in order to get crispy or undercook to avoid drying out. A firm stalk is essential.


Check the bottoms of the spears. The should be even and slightly green. If they are all white and cracked or dried out then you should get a fresher pack.;
, Never throw food on a cold grill. You want the grates to be piping hot, which will get the outsides of the veggies well browned and delicious. Be sure the scrape the grill clean with a wire brush as it heats so the food cooks cleanly.


You only need the burners that the asparagus will be directly over to be on.

, Clean the asparagus with vegetable cleaner, or wash them under water. You should cut away any of the white at the bottom, leaving even, green spears.


If using your hands, bend the stalk near the bottom. It should naturally break right about where you would cut it off.
Optionally, use a peeler to remove about half the skin for less-tough spears. Note, however, that this only works for thicker asparagus.

, You don't want them to be dripping wet, but they should have a nice sheen of oil. Oil holds heat much more evenly than plan asparagus, leading to better cooking and grill marks.


One pound of asparagus needs about four tablespoons of olive oil., Salt enhances and brings out flavor, but it also removes moisture. By waiting until you're just about ready to grill the asparagus you get all the taste benefits of salt without the tough, rubbery, or dry side-effects.

, Make sure you place them perpendicular to the grill grates to avoid losing any of them to the flames. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the spears, but you should roll them around every minute or so to ensure they cook easily.


Very thin asparagus may only take 3-5 minutes, so move quickly. If you have a grill pan, it may be easiest to cook in this so you don't loose any spears.

, This is the easiest test to make sure they are tender. If your fork easily slides into the stalk, then they are ready to eat.

Store the peppers.",How to Make Macedonian Ajvar," You must have enough time and patience to go through all the steps.
, It's recommended that you make it either mild or hot, just because spicier is better and you are dealing with a bunch of red peppers after all, so it would make sense rather than to make it sweet.

It's all a matter of preference. If you want hot peppers, look for red hot peppers. If you want sweet peppers, look for sweet.
For the mild flavor, if you are fortunate enough to find that kind of pepper, then good! If not, you may have to mix up hot and sweet peppers together to get that milder flavor.

, Depending in what type of climate you are surrounded by, you can either grill the peppers outside or cook them on a stove in your kitchen. There is no specific time while preparing these peppers, just sitting on top of them and watching their skin turn black and ready to peel. This is when you know they are ready. While cooking, flip the peppers carefully so there is char on all sides., After all the cooking is done and you can see that the red peppers skins are black, immediately put these peppers in a container or plastic bag and tightly seal it. The reason doing so is to help keep the steam away from the skin of the peppers.

When the peppers are cooled down, take them out of the bag or container and set them down on a kitchen table where they are ready to be peeled down.
Carefully peel the unwanted black skin off the red peppers, then remove and discard the stem and seeds.

, If you do not own a grinder, chop them up. If you make big batches of this, chopping all of it up would be a big hassle, so your better choice is a grinder or processor.

If you have a bigger batch, you may want to let the red peppers drain overnight. The purpose of draining is to remove as much excess and moisture from the peppers.

, Add vegetable oil, salt and any other type of spice you would like to mix it up with, if you choose to do so., If you have a bigger batch, it will require more time., This means that the moisture is completely gone and it has reduced to somewhat of a paste. At this point, the red peppers should be a dark red color., Have plenty of sterilized canning jars prepared ahead.

Smaller jars are best.

, Put the lid on and allow it to cool down. You will hear a pinging noise; when this happens, it means that they are sealed tightly., You have created possibly one of the best dishes you have ever made."

Top with a squeeze of lemon juice or balsamic vinegar for a fresh burst of flavor.,

Toss with a hard, salty cheese right off they come of the grill, like a Parmesan.,
Toss in some fresh herbs, like thyme, for a new flavor after they leave the grill.",How to Make Grilled Asparagus2," The best cooks understand how to use acids to their advantage, as a spritz of common cooking acids give foods depth and punch. For asparagus, the two most common acids are lemon and balsamic vinegar, which match the meaty, sweet, and somewhat savory flavor of a well-grilled asparagus.


Don't add the lemon juice until you're just about ready to serve. If serving cold or room temperature, add the acid at the very end., You can play with whatever you'd like, but the following recipe will great a well-balanced, spicy, and slightly Asian-inspired asparagus. Simply add this with the olive oil and then cook like normal. As soon as they come off the grill, toss with sesame seeds:

, You could use Asiago, Romano, or any other strongly-flavored cheese. If you do, plan to go a little lighter on the salt in the preparation stage -- only using a pinch along with some black pepper to even the flavors out., European herbs, like rosemary and thyme, go well, especially with lemon. You only need about a half teaspoon, tossed in with the stalks right after the asparagus comes off the heat. Serve immediately."

Find a bowl that’s large enough to hold ½ pound (227 g) of green beans and fill it with cold water and some ice.Make sure to place the bowl close to the stove so you can quickly place the green beans in it after you’ve finished cooking them.;
, Add 2 cups (473 ml) of low-sodium chicken broth to a large saucepan. Heat the broth on the stove over high heat until it comes to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.You can use homemade chicken broth in place of a store-bought version if you prefer.

, Once the broth comes to a boil, place the ½ pound (227 g) of trimmed green beans into the pan. Let the beans cook until they are tender, which should take approximately 5 minutes.If the pan seems like it might boil over, lower the heat slightly to reduce the boil.

, When the beans are cooked, use a slotted spoon to lift them out of the boiling water. Immediately, place them in the bowl of ice water to stop the beans from cooking., Allow the beans to cool completely in the ice water, which should take 10 to 15 minutes. When they’re cooled, drain them in a colander and gently pat dry with a clean towel.When the green beans are dry, place them in a bowl and set them aside for the moment.

, Add a large egg and ½ cup (118 g) of milk to a shallow bowl. Whisk the two together until they’re completely blended.It’s best to use whole or at least 2% milk in the batter.

, Place a second shallow bowl beside the egg and milk mixture. Fill it with ½ cup (50 g) of instant flour.Instant flour is a finely milled flour that helps give the green bean fries’ coating a flakier texture.
If you don’t have instant flour, you can substitute all-purpose flour.

, In a third shallow bowl, combine the remaining ½ cup (50 g) of instant flour, 1 cup (90 g) of breadcrumbs, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of onion powder, 1 teaspoon (⅓ g) of garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Stir the ingredients together with a fork so they’re well blended.You can use plain or seasoned breadcrumbs depending on your preference.
You can add other spices or seasonings to the breadcrumb mixture if you like. Paprika and chili powder are some options to consider.

, To have a place to set the green beans down once they are coated in the batter, place a baking sheet beside the stove. Line it with parchment paper so the beans won’t stick to it.You can substitute silicone baking mat for the parchment paper.

, When you’re ready to start coating the green bean fries, place the beans in the bowl with the plain flour. Mix the beans with the flour until they are fully coated.Make sure to shake off the excess flour from the green beans so you don’t get clumps when you add the rest of the coating.

, Once the green beans are coated with flour, dunk them in the egg mixture. Next, toss them in the breadcrumb mixture until they are well coated.Allow the excess egg mixture to drip off the green beans before coating them with the breadcrumbs.

, After the green bean fries are coated, place them on the lined baking sheet. If you plan to fry the beans, cover the cookie sheet with plastic wrap and chill them in the freezer until the coating is set, which should take approximately 30 minutes.If you plan to bake the green bean fries, you don’t need to chill them. You can go right to cooking them.

, Fill a deep, heavy-bottomed pot with 3-inches (8-cm) of peanut oil. Heat the oil on the stove over medium until a deep fry thermometer registers 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).You can substitute vegetable oil for the peanut oil if you prefer.
If you don’t have a deep fry thermometer, you can use a candy thermometer.
Be careful when heating the oil. If it gets too hot, it can splatter and burn the skin.

, Once the oil reaches the right temperature, add the green bean fries to the pot in batches. Allow the green bean fries to cook until they are golden brown, which should take 1 to 2 minutes.Use a wooden spoon to gently move the beans around as they’re frying to ensure that they cook evenly.

, When the fries are finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to carefully remove them from the oil. Transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb some of the excess oil., When the green bean fries are drained, place them on a serving platter. Pair them with ranch dressing or your favorite dipping sauce, and serve while they are still warm.Simple ketchup also works well with green bean fries, as do spicier dipping sauces, such as sriracha mayonnaise.

, To ensure that the oven is warm enough to bake the green bean fries, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully preheat., Place the baking sheet with the fries in the heated oven. Allow the fries to cook until they are crispy and golden brown, which should take 15 to 20 minutes.Halfway through the cooking time, turn the fries over to ensure that they bake evenly.

, When the fries are finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Place them on a large platter or plate, and serve while they are still warm.Any leftover baked green bean fries can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 4 days.

Spoon the pudding into cups and garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon.,
Let the pudding cool for a few minutes before serving.",How to Make Rice Pudding1," You can use leftover rice from the night before, or you can make it fresh. If you wish to make it fresh, do the following:


Fill a saucepan with ½ cup (115 grams) of dry rice (preferably medium-grain) and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.
Bring the water and rice to a boil over medium-high heat.
Cover the saucepan, and reduce the heat to low.
Simmer the rice over low heat for 15 minutes.
Fluff the rice up with a fork. Leave it in the saucepan.;
, Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pot, especially if you made the rice fresh. This will help dislodge any rice that got stuck to the bottom of the pan.

, Stir the rice often so that it doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pot. The rice pudding is done when it becomes thick, like porridge., Keep stirring until it is evenly combined. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pot from time to time as well. Sometimes, rice gets glued to the bottom of the pot, and this will knock those grains loose.

, Using a ladle, scoop the pudding into individual bowls. Garnish each with a sprinkle or cinnamon, if desired.

, Serve the pudding while it is still hot. If you'd like a more refreshing treat, let the pudding cool down to room temperature first, then chill it in the fridge until it becomes cold to your liking.


If you are chilling the pudding in the fridge, press a sheet of plastic wrap against the surface of the pudding. This will prevent a skin from forming on top. Peel the plastic wrap away before serving the pudding."

, Pour the orange juice into a small saucepan, then bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Let it cook for 5 minutes., Don't worry if the ingredients don't come together right away. This will give you a basic glaze. If you'd like to step things up a bit, try some of the following:If you'd like extra flavor, add ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon of ground allspice.
If you don't have any brown sugar, try ¼ cup (90 grams) of maple syrup instead.
For a richer glaze, increase the butter to 4 tablespoons (55 grams).

, The butter will melt first, then the sugar will start to dissolve. Eventually, the glaze will start to thicken. If it is not thick enough for you, stir in 2 teaspoons of cornstarch.

, You can stir the carrots up with a rubber spatula, or you can cover the saucepan with a lid and shake it. This will coat the carrots in the glaze.

Use this method to make a cold American pudding.,
Decide whether to use cornstarch or egg yolks.,
Mix together sugar, salt, and cornstarch.,
Slowly whisk in the milk.,
Beat the egg yolks in a separate bowl.,
Heat slowly until simmering, then add chocolate.,
Continue to heat, depending on the recipe.,
Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.,
Chill until ready to eat.",How to Make Pudding1," Pudding is still consumed in many varieties across the Commonwealth, but people in the United States have simplified the term to mean a cold, custard-like dessert. This recipe is streamlined to be as simple as possible without sacrificing deliciousness, but there are dozens of alternate methods out there if you decide to explore variations in texture or flavor.


This recipe can be made with or without melted chocolate. If you decide to skip the chocolate you may wish to up the vanilla extract to 2 tsp (10 mL) for a stronger flavor.
This pudding will take at least an hour to chill and thicken. Allowing at least four hours is recommended if you plan on serving it as dessert, as individual variation can cause some puddings to take longer.;
, You only need one of these ingredients to thicken the pudding. Cornstarch is easy to use, and a great option for beginner or time-pressed chefs. Egg yolks are finicky and can ruin a pudding if overcooked, but will provide a richer texture. Both methods are described in this section.

, Use a saucepan, but leave it off the heat for now. Combine ½ cup (100 g) sugar and ⅛ tsp (a small pinch) salt. If you are using cornstarch, mix in ¼ cup (30 g) of this as well. Use a whisk if you have one, since it will be useful in the next step.


While cornstarch is sold as ""cornflour"" outside the U.S., do not confuse it with actual flour made from corn! You're looking for pure starch, an almost tasteless, white powder., Pour in about ¼ cup (60 mL) of the milk in a thin stream to avoid forming lumps, whisking it in with the dry ingredients. Once the mixture has no lumps, pour in the remaining 2 ¾ cups (660 mL) milk and whisk until smooth.If you have a food processor, you can pulse this mixture until smooth instead., If you are using two egg yolks, separate them from the egg whites, then beat for 30–60 seconds in a separate, large bowl.


Remember, there is no need for egg yolks if using cornstarch.

, Heat the mixture over medium-low heat on the stove top. Stir and scrape the sides occasionally, to avoid forming a skin or burning the milk. After approximately ten minutes, the mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of your stirring spoon. If you want to add 6 ounces (170 g) chocolate, do so and continue to heat and stir until smooth.Otherwise, just continue to the next step.

, This step varies depending on which thickener you are using:



If using cornstarch, continue to heat and stir until boiling. Reduce heat and simmer for two or three minutes or until slightly thickened, then remove from heat.If using egg yolk, remove the milk from heat once thickened, then add it in a very thin stream to the egg mixture, whisking constantly. If you add too much of the hot mixture, or stop stirring, the egg will cook — and no one wants scrambled eggs in their dessert. Once all the ingredients are combined, return them to the saucepan and heat until thick, but do not allow to boil., 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract will add a nice flavor, whether or not you are using chocolate. Stir it in well, as the stirring will also prevent skin from forming while the mixture is still hot.

, Spoon the pudding into a large bowl or individual custard ramekins, or simply leave it in the saucepan. Refrigerate for one to three hours before eating, or until thick. Keep it in the refrigerator until ready to eat.


Optionally, stretch plastic wrap over the surface to prevent a skin from forming."

Chill and flip before serving.",How to Make Pudding2," The British Isles are the world capitol of pudding recipes, and hundreds of these have become popular dishes across former British territories. While the section on other pudding recipes contains links to many of these, this method covers a classic, easy to make dessert: the summer pudding.


This pudding is best when chilled for at least four to six hours, although it can be eaten earlier.

, This bread will be used to create a dome shape for the pudding. Cut the slices into ""wonky rectangles"" with one end wider than the other to make this easier. A few triangular pieces the same length as the rectangles will also be useful.


You may also cut a large circle of bread out to serve as the base of the domed pudding, but you can use spare wedges instead.

, You'll want slightly stale white bread for this recipe, as this will soak up the fruit juice faster. If you're cursed by a breadbox full of freshly baked loaves, toast the slices in a 350ºF (175ºC) oven for 15–20 minutes or until dry and slightly brown., Wash and dry the berries, and defrost frozen berries before using. Once the berries are ready, add ¾ cup (175g) golden caster sugar and 3 tbsp (45 mL) water to a saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted and boils for approximately 60 seconds.Golden caster sugar is ideal for this recipe, but is not widely available outside the UK and some Commonwealth countries. Superfine sugar is the best substitute.

, Add the 2 lb 12 oz (1¼ kg) berries to the saucepan. Heating them will bring out the juices that will soak into the bread. You only need to cook this for another two or three minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.


If using strawberries, you can optionally keep these at room temperature and add later to preserve their firm texture.Remove stems from currants before using.

, Blackcurrant liqueur adds a rich flavor, if you don't mind making your pudding alcoholic.Stir in ¼ cup (60 mL) for a strong flavor, or less if you prefer just a hint.

, Line a large, 1.75 quarts (1.75 liters) bowl with strong plastic wrap to make it easy to flip the pudding right-side-up later.Dip each slice of bread into the juice mixture for a few seconds, arranging them around the bowl. Alternate the rectangular and triangular slices as needed to make a relatively tight-fitting ""bowl"" of bread, with no gaps.


Cut slices into new shapes if necessary to fill gaps.

, Spoon in all the remaining juice and fruit into the bread bowl. Finish by topping with a circle of bread or a layer of bread slices, soaking them first as before.

, The flavors will mingle best if allowed to chill for several hours, or even overnight. Keep it in the refrigerator with a plate on top of the pudding, weighing down the plate with any heavy object.Before serving, flip the pudding over carefully onto a plate, grasping the cling wrap to keep it together. Remove the plastic, trim off any unsightly bread overhang, and serve plain or with cream.

Pulse the mixture until it resembles coarse sand.If you are short on time, you can use a prepared pie crust that you buy at the store. However, make sure that it is unbaked.;
, When the flour and butter mixture is the right texture, start to slowly add extremely cold water to dough. You only want to add enough water to make the dough come together, so add a teaspoon or so at a time and pulse the food processor until the dough begins to form.The water that you add should be ice cold so you may want to chill it in the refrigerator with ice cubes in it. When you add it to the flour and butter mixture, though, be careful not to add any of the ice.

, Once the dough comes together, remove it from the food processor and place it a floured work surface. With clean hands, gently shape the dough into a flat disk., When you’ve shaped the dough properly, cover it completely with plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator, and allow it to chill for at least an hour.After you’ve wrapped the dough in the plastic wrap, press it down again to ensure that it’s flat.

, After the dough has been properly chilled, remove it from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Place it on a floured surface, and use a rolling pin to roll it out until it’s approximately ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.If you don’t have a rolling pin, use a wine bottle or other heavy glass bottle to roll out the dough.

, When you’ve rolled the dough out to the proper thickness, transfer it to a pie pan. Press the dough into the pan, and use a fork to prick the bottom and sides so it doesn’t get soggy as it bakes.It helps to use your rolling pin to transfer the crust to the pie pan. Drape the rolled out dough over the pin so you can easily turn it into the pan.
You can crimp the edge of the pie crust to give it a more decorative look if you prefer. The easiest way to do it is press the tines of a fork all the way around the edge of the crust, though you can also pinch the dough with your fingers.
If you’re not going to bake your pie right away, make sure to refrigerate the crust until you’re ready to fill it and put it in the oven.
Instead of making a pie, you can use the dough to create several individual tarts.

Stir until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined and the mixture is smooth.You can use a stand mixer or a hand mixer to save time when combining the filling ingredients.

, When the sugar mixture is smooth, pour 1 16-ounce can (370 ml) of condensed milk into the filling. Mix until it’s fully combined.Make sure that you’re not using sweetened condensed milk, which has sugar added that can make the pie filling too sweet. Unsweetened condensed milk may be sold as evaporated milk.

, Once you’ve mixed the condensed milk into the filling, add 1 cup (237 ml) of dark maple syrup. Blend it into the other ingredients until the filling is completely smooth.Dark maple syrup has a rich, deep taste. You can substitute medium or amber maple syrup, which tend to have a lighter flavor, if you prefer.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the pie, it’s important to preheat it. Set your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Pay attention to your oven so you know when it’s preheated. It may flash an indicator light or beep to let you know.

, As you’re waiting for the oven to preheat, pour the pie filling into the pie crust. Use a spatula to gently smooth the filling to ensure that there are no gaps along the edges.If you’re a fan of nuts, you can sprinkle a cup (125 g) of toasted and coarsely chopped walnuts in the bottom of the pie before adding the filling., Place the pie in the preheated oven, and allow it to bake for 45 to 55 minutes. The center of the pie should be golden brown and bubbly, but firm to the touch.Don’t poke too hard at the pie to test its firmness. Touch it lightly.

, Remove the pie from the oven, and place it on a wire cooling rack. Allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting and serving the pie.You can serve the pie warm or at room temperature.
If you want to garnish the pie, consider dusting it lightly with powdered sugar.

",How to Make Kool Aid Pie," Because Kool Aid pie filling doesn’t require any baking, using a store-bought graham cracker crust that doesn’t require any baking either makes the dessert especially easy to make. You can use a 9-inch (approximately 229 mm) crust to make a single pie, or purchase a package of 6 mini 3-inch pie crusts to make individual pies.If you prefer, you can use use a premade crust made of vanilla wafer cookies instead of graham crackers for your Kool Aid pie.;
, If you want to make a sweeter crust that will balance the tartness of the filling, place 6 cups (1420 g) of a fruit flavored cereal in a plastic bag, and use a rolling pin, heavy can, or even your hands to crush it into approximately 3 cups (approximately 708 g) of fine crumbs.Fruit flavored cereal that works well for the crust include Trix, Fruit Loops, and Captain Crunch Crunch Berries.
You can also make your own graham cracker or cookie crust by crushing the cookies.

, A homemade crust must be baked in the oven to set it up, so it’s important to make sure the oven is at the right temperature. Set the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to preheat fully so it’s hot when the crust is ready.Your oven will likely alert you when it’s properly preheated. It may beep or an indicator light will turn on to let you know that it’s reached the desired temperature.

, In a large bowl, combine the crushed cereal with 1 stick (½ cup or 115 g) of butter that’s been melted and 3 tablespoons (approximately 38 g) sugar. Mix the ingredients together with a spoon until they are thoroughly combined.The mixture will be coarse and almost sandy when the ingredients are fully mixed.
Melt your butter in a heavy saucepan on the stove at medium heat, or cut it into pieces, place it in a microwave-safe bowl covered with towel paper, and microwave on medium-low (30% power) for 10 to 15 second intervals until it is melted., Once the crust ingredients are completely mixed, take a greased 8-inch springform pan and begin pressing the crumb mixture into the pan. Make sure to press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides.To make sure that the crust is tightly packed, use the bottom of a glass, measuring cup, or other flat item to press the crumb mixture into the pan.

, Once the crust is pressed into the pan, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the crust to bake for 15 to 20 minutes until it is firm and not crumbly.You can also refrigerate the crust for approximately two hours until it sets up. However, it won’t be as firm as a baked crust, so it make crumble more easily.

, When the crust is finished baking, remove it from the oven. Leaving the pan in tact, allow the crust to fully cool. That can take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes. Be sure not to remove the sides of the pan while it’s cooling.It’s extremely important to make sure that the crust is completely cooled before you add the filling. Touch it to ensure that it’s not giving off much warmth before spreading the filling inside.

, Add 1 8-ounce (225 g) container of whipped topping to a large mixing bowl, and mix with a 14-ounce (397 g) can of sweetened condensed milk. Use a whisk to blend the two together well.For a richer pie, you can replace the condensed milk with an 8-ounce package of softened cream cheese and a 13-ounce (approximately 367 g) jar of marshmallow creme.

, To add the main flavor to your pie, sprinkle a 1 packet (6 g) of Kool Aid into the whipped topping and condensed milk mixture. You can also any flavor that you like, but strawberry, cherry, and raspberry are classic options.You don’t necessarily have to add the entire packet of Kool Aid to the filling. You can add a little less if you don’t want your pie as sweet or tart.
Lemonade or Pink Lemonade Kool Aid are great flavors for a summer pie. Kool Aid comes in so many flavors that it’s easy to find one to fit any occasion.
Some Kool Aid shades, such as Lemonade, don’t have any color. You may want to add a few drops of an appropriate food coloring shade, such as yellow for Lemonade, to make your pie look bright and fun.

, Once you added the Kool Aid powder to the whipped topping and condensed milk, use the whisk to fully incorporate the Kool Aid into the filling. The mixture will change color from the whitish tone of the whipped topping and condensed milk to whatever shade the Kool Aid powder is., Once the filling is completely mixed, carefully begin spooning the mixture into the pie crust. Be gentle as you add the filling to the crust to avoid crumbling any of it. Make sure to spread it all the way to the edges so the entire crust is filled.The filling has a tendency to stick to the spoon or spatula that you’re using to spread it into the crust, so take your time adding when you’re adding it.

, The pie needs to set up before you can eat it, so you must chill it after you’ve added the filling to the crust. Cover the pie with the lid from your store-bought crust or some plastic wrap, and allow it to refrigerator for approximately 2 hours.Be sure to leave the pie in the refrigerate until you’re ready to serve it.

, Once the pie is set, you can decorate the top however you’d like. You might add some more whipped topping, or decorate it with appropriate fruit, such as sliced strawberries for a Strawberry Kool Aid pie. If you’ve made a homemade crust with cereal, you can scatter some pieces across the top. Colorful sprinkles are also a pretty addition.If you want to add fruit to your pie, you can also layer it across the bottom of the crust before you add the filling. For example, you might place some strawberry or banana slices on the bottom before pouring Strawberry Kool Aid or Tropical Fruit Kool Aid filling over it.

",How to Make Fruit Leather," Fruit leather can be made with any type of fruit you want. Choose just one fruit, or pick your favorite combination to make custom-flavored fruit leather. You need a total of 1 1/2 pounds of fruit (not including the peels). These fruits shape up into delicious leather with the perfect texture:Strawberries
Grapes
Plums
Peaches
Nectarines
Pears
Apples
Mangoes
Papayas
Kiwis
Bananas;
, It's important to wash away all traces of dirt and pesticides before you begin. Give each piece of fruit a thorough rinse under cool, running water. Let the fruit air dry or use a paper towel to pat it dry.

, If you're using a fruit with a thick peel, you'll want to remove the peel before you dehydrate the fruit. The soft fruit inside the peel will dry out to just the right texture, but a dried peel could become too chewy to eat. If you're using any of the following fruits, peel first:


Peaches
Nectarines
Pears
Apples
Mangoes
Papayas
Kiwis
Bananas

, The pieces don't have to be uniform; just small enough that you can weight them out them into your food processor. Use a sharp knife to chop the fruit, and remove any bruised areas.

, Place the fruit, the sugar and the lemon juice in your food processor. Pulse the ingredients together until you have a smooth, lump-free puree. You may need to do this in batches.If you don't want to use sugar, try substituting honey, or half sugar, half honey as an alternative. Using honey will increase the time required to fully dry the fruit leather.
If you don't have a food processor, a blender will do. Try to get the puree as smooth as possible, since lumps will hurt the texture of your fruit leather.
The lemon juice acts as a flavor enhancer and natural preservative. Add more or less to taste.

, The drying process takes longer but there's no risk of burning the fruit puree. The fruit puree prep process is the same for this method.
Or try the microwave method, which also uses the same fruit puree prep process. Instead of using the oven, simply microwave the puree on a medium setting for five minutes, or until it has thoroughly dried. You'll have to do this in batches, since the entire recipe's worth of puree won't fit in the microwave., You can also use a nonstick silicone mat. The fruit puree will stick to most other surfaces, so it's best to use a liner.If you're using a food dehydrator, line the tray with nonstick foil.
If you're using a microwave, do not use foil. Use a microwaveable nonstick mat or a microwavable nonstick tray.

, The layer should be about 1/8-inch thick, so that your fruit leather will be perfectly chewy. If it's too thick, it will be difficult to chew; too thin, and it will turn out crispy instead of chewy.

, Check on it after two and a half hours to see how it's progressing; in most cases it will still need more time. After three or so hours, it should be slightly tacky, just the right texture for fruit leather.


If the fruit puree was on the dry side (as it would be if you used apples or bananas) it might be ready sooner than four hours.
If you're using a dehydrator, it will take at least eight hours or overnight. Choose the correct setting according to the manufacturer's instructions.
If you're using the microwave, the leather should be finished in five to six minutes.
If you used a wet fruit, like strawberries or peaches, it might take longer than four hours.

, If you try to handle it while it's still hot, it will fall apart and could cause a burn. Set it on a cooling rack and wait at least twenty minutes before handling.


Check the underside of the fruit leather. If it's completely dry on both sides, it's finished. If it's still wet on the bottom, carefully flip the fruit leather over and return it to the oven for another hour or so to finish drying it out.

, This will prevent the leather from sticking to itself when you roll it up. Rolling up the fruit leather is a great way to store it for later., Use a pizza cutter or scissors to slice it into strips. Make sure you cut through the waxed paper, too. Make the strips as wide or as narrow as you'd like.

, Start at the narrow end of a strip of leather and roll it up, as you would a jelly roll. Keep going until the entire strip is rolled up with the waxed paper. Continue rolling the rest of the strips.

, The fruit leather will keep for up to a week.
