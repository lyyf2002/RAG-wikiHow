, Roll them into crumbs, using a rolling pin. You should have about 1 1/2 cups of crumbs when finished.


If you don't have a rolling pin, get creative. A can of cooking spray or a bottle of wine (or heck, a shoe) gets the job done. So does the food processor, for the record.

, Don't scorch it! You need all of it to keep your crust together.

, Blend until the texture resembles coarse meal. It should be one uniform consistency after a minute or so of mixing.


If you'd like, add the nutmeg, cinnamon, or allspice at this step. Just a generous sprinkling or two will do!

, Voila! Your homemade graham cracker pie crust. But as you probably know, you could just also buy a pre-made one from the store -- but where's the fun in that?


Try to make the crust about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) evenly all around. If the crumb mixture won't stick properly, adding a tablespoon of water to the mix will help. Make sure there are no gaps or holes in the crust!

, Then remove the crust from the oven and refrigerate until well chilled. You need the time to prepare the filling anyway.

Heat a wok or frying pan on the stove.,
Add oil to the pan, then the garlic and red pepper.,
Trim and chop the beans.,
Add the green beans and onions.,
Let cook, stirring only periodically.,
Optionally, give the beans a soy glaze.,
Add sesame oil, season, and serve.,
Add other ingredients to customize your recipe.",How to Make Fried Green Beans1," Before you do any frying, you'll want to get your pan nice and hot. Traditionally, stir fry dishes are cooked in a wok, but you can use nearly any steep-sided frying pan. Set the pan over a burner set to medium-high and allow it to heat up.


Don't add the oil yet. A common expression in stir frying is ""hot wok, cold oil."" To get the best possible texture, add the ingredients one at a time in the correct order.;
, When the pan is nearly smoking hot, add a splash of oil to the pan. Follow this with the garlic and red pepper. The garlic should start sizzling nearly as soon as it hits the pan. Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula.


Any cooking oil will work, but for best results, use an oil with a high smoke point like canola or peanut oil. Other oils can smoke and gain a bitter taste at the high temperatures used for stir frying., This isn't strictly necessary, but if you remove the stems and tough tips of each bean, they'll be easier to eat. After this, chop the beans into inch-sized segments so they cook quickly.

A quick way to trim green beans is to line them up on a cutting board, then simply run a sharp knife down the row to remove about a half inch from each tip. Repeat for the other side., Use the spoon or spatula to stir the vegetables around in the oil and seasonings. Ensure they get a good coating — this will keep them from sticking.


You can also use a tossing motion of the pan to combine the ingredients. However, because hot oil can cause dangerous burns, stick to the spoon unless you've already practiced this skill. See our article on this topic for more information.

, Once the vegetables are combined, spread them out in the pan and let them cook without stirring. This will give them a nice sear — the brown, crispy texture that's so delicious on stir fried vegetables.


After about 90 seconds, stir the vegetables and let them sear again for another 90 seconds or so.If you're not noticing your vegetables brown, turn the heat up.

, If you like the flavor of soy sauce, use this step to give your green beans a sweet soy flavor. Mix soy sauce and sugar in a small bowl as you're waiting for the beans to cook. When the beans are browned, pour the mixture into the pan. Stir to combine.


Stir actively for the first few seconds to prevent the sugar from burning. Once the beans are well-coated with the sauce, you can slow down and let the sugar caramelize to bring out a smokier, more complex flavor.

, Check the appearance and texture of the vegetables as they continue to cook. When the beans have softened somewhat and the onions have gained a brown sear, they're ready. Splash a little sesame oil into the pan along with salt and pepper (you may want to go easy on the salt if you added soy sauce). Stir once more to combine. Your beans are ready to eat!


The sesame oil is just for flavor, so don't use much — a teaspoon should do. Sesame oil also has a low smoke point, so you don't want it in the hot pan for long.The beans are ready to eat immediately, but if you let them sit in the pan (or together on a serving dish), they'll continue to cook and soften a little bit more.

, You've just learned how to make a basic vegetable stir fry, but one of the nice things about this recipe is that it's easy to get creative with it. If you add new ingredients, try to cook them in order of how long they take to cook — things that take longer to cook go first. Just a few ideas are below.


Meats (beef, chicken, or seafood) — add before the vegetables.
Ginger (powdered or fresh) — add with the vegetables.
Other vegetables (bell peppers, cooked carrots, peas, water chestnuts, etc.)
Dry seasonings (parsley, garlic/onion powder, etc.) — add with the garlic and red pepper.

Make a batter from the beer, flour, salt, and pepper.,
Heat oil in a pan on the stove.,
Trim the beans.,
Dip the beans in the batter to coat.,
Fry the battered beans.,
Let the beans drain.,
Season and serve.",How to Make Fried Green Beans2," Mix these ingredients together in a small bowl until you have a smooth, velvety batter with few lumps. You can use as much salt and pepper as you like, but if you're unsure, about 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper ought to do., Add the oil to a steep-sided pan. Use at least enough to cover the fries when they are submerged. This is called ""deep frying.""


As in the section above, you'll want to use an oil like canola or peanut oil that has a high smoke point here. Avoid olive oil.
You want the oil at about 375 degrees F (177 degrees C) when you start frying. If you have a cooking thermometer, use this. If you don't, heating at medium-high for about 5-10 minutes will usually be enough.

, As with the recipe above, it's best to remove the stems and tips of the beans before you start to cook them. Line the beans up on a cutting board and run a sharp knife down the row to trim off a half inch from either end.

If you want your final product to resemble french fries, don't shop the beans into small pieces. If you don't care, you can still do this.

, If you don't mind getting your fingers dirty, you can do this by hand — otherwise, drop the beans in and stir to coat. Remove the beans, let any excess better drip off, and transfer to a clean plate.

, At this point, the oil should be hot — you can test this by dropping some batter in and seeing if it sizzles. Use a slotted spoon or strainer to transfer the beans to the oil and submerge them. Let them fry, floating and sizzling in the oil. Stir minimally.


Fry the beans in batches, taking care not to crowd the pan or they may stick to each other.

, As soon as the beans have reached a pleasant golden-brown color and are crispy all over, they're ready to eat. Use a strainer or slotted spoon to carefully remove them from the hot oil. Let the excess oil drip off of each back of fries, then transfer them to a cooling rack over a paper towel.


If you don't have a cooling rack, you can simply pile the fries on a paper towel-lined plate, but this can eliminate the crunchy texture of the batter.

, When the beans are cool enough to eat, give them a light sprinkling with salt and pepper. Your fries are ready to eat!


If you want to ""spice up"" your recipe, this is a good time to dust the fries with your preferred dry seasonings. For example, you might try sprinkling a little Cajun seasoning or cayenne pepper over the fries to give them a little heat.

Refrigerate the coconut milk.,
Combine the cream and other ingredients.,
Transfer the mixture to sterilized jars.,
Ferment the yogurt for 24 hours.,
Refrigerate until cool.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Coconut Yogurt1," Place the cans of coconut milk in your refrigerator and let them chill overnight, or for a minimum of 8 hours.


Refrigeration helps separate the thick cream from the coconut water. Do not shake the cans of coconut milk at any time since doing so could combine these two components again.;
, Scoop out the cool, thick coconut cream and place it in a large bowl. Add the probiotics and sweetener, then whisk until well-combined and smooth.


Do not use the watery portion of the coconut milk sitting at the bottom of the can. Using it would result in very thin yogurt.
If using probiotic capsules, open the capsules and use the powder inside. You could also use 2 tsp (10 ml) probiotic powder, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) store-bought coconut yogurt, or 2 Tbsp (30 ml) fermented coconut water probiotic kefir.
Raw sugar works well as a sweetener, but you could easily use the same amount of maple sugar, raw honey, or agave. If you prefer less-sweet yogurt, you can omit the sweetener altogether.

, Pour the coconut mixture into a clean, sterilized glass jar. Tightly seal the jar with a lid.


It's important to use sterilized jars since bad bacteria will ruin the yogurt if it creeps inside. You can sterilize the jars using a dishwasher or boiling water.

, Place the sealed jars of yogurt into your oven. Leave the oven off, but turn the oven light on. Allow the yogurt to sit in the oven for 12 to 24 hours.


A closed oven with the light on will maintain a stable temperature between 105 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (40 to 43 degrees Celsius), which is ideal for the fermentation process. Do not turn the oven on since doing so will make the interior too hot, which will likely kill the probiotics.The yogurt will become thicker with a longer incubation period. You should give it a minimum of 12 hours, but 24 hours would be ideal.

, Remove the thick, fermented yogurt from the oven and transfer it to your refrigerator. Chill the yogurt for approximately 6 hours, or until it becomes thoroughly cool.


If the yogurt separates during this period, you can recombine the layers by stirring them together. You can also make the yogurt thicker by pouring off the liquid layer and using only the thickened layer beneath it.

, The coconut yogurt is now finished and ready to serve.


Refrigerate any leftover yogurt in an airtight container. Use it within two weeks.

Combine the coconut milk and thickener.,
Heat the coconut mixture.,
Let the mixture cool.,
Add the probiotics and sweetener.,
Pour the yogurt into sterilized jars.,
Ferment the yogurt for 12 to 24 hours.,
Refrigerate the yogurt.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Coconut Yogurt2," Shake the coconut milk, then open the cans and pour them into a medium saucepan. Add your thickener of choice to the coconut milk.


Unlike coconut yogurt prepared without a thickener, you'll need to use the full can of coconut milk. Thoroughly shaking the cans before opening them should help combine any separated cream and water.
If you use agar agar, sprinkle the flakes over the coconut milk without stirring them.
If you use tapioca starch, whisk 1/3 cup (80 ml) of coconut milk with the tapioca until the starch dissolves. Pour this mixture back into the rest of the coconut milk and stir to combine.

, Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Allow the coconut milk to reach a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.After the coconut milk begins simmering, you should periodically whisk the mixture to incorporate the thickener into the milk.
Continue heating the coconut milk until the agar agar fully dissolves or the tapioca fully thickens the milk.

, Remove the coconut mixture from the heat and allow it to cool to a temperature between 100 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit (38 and 46 degrees Celsius).Use a food thermometer to test the temperature of the mixture. It's crucial to let it drop adequately low. If you add the probiotics while the temperature remains too hot, the beneficial bacteria will die and the yogurt won't ferment properly.

, Sprinkle the probiotics and sweetener over the surface of the milk, then whisk well to combine.


If you use probiotic capsules, you should open the capsules and only use the powder inside. Alternatively, you could use 4 tsp (20 ml) of probiotic powder, 4 Tbsp (60 ml) store-bought coconut yogurt, or 4 Tbsp (60 ml) fermented coconut water probiotic kefir.
You can swap out the raw sugar for another sweetener, like maple syrup or agave, or omit it altogether if desired.

, Pour the coconut mixture into sterilized glass jars. Seal the jars with tight lids.


The jars must be sterilized before use; otherwise, bad bacteria could get into the mixture and spoil your yogurt. Sterilize the jars by running them through the hottest cycle of your dishwasher or by soaking them in boiling water for several minutes.

, Place the yogurt in an empty oven. Turn the oven light on, but leave the oven itself off. Allow the yogurt to ferment in this warm environment for 12 to 24 hours.


Do not turn the oven on since extremely hot temperatures can kill the probiotics. A closed oven with the light on should maintain temperatures between 105 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (40 and 43 degrees Celsius), which is ideal for the culturing period.
Allowing the coconut yogurt to sit for 24 hours will produce thicker yogurt, but most should be ready after 8 to 12 hours.

, Transfer the jars of yogurt to the refrigerator and let them chill for approximately 6 hours.


During this time, the yogurt should continue thickening and the fermentation process should cease.
If the yogurt separates, you can stir it to combine the layers. For thicker yogurt, however, strain the liquid and use only the thickened bottom layer.

, The coconut yogurt should be done and ready to eat at this time.


Any leftovers can be stored in an airtight jar or container and kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

Scoop out the solidified cream.,
Blend the ingredients together.,
Adjust as desired.,
Chill until cool.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Coconut Yogurt3," Place the cans of coconut milk in your refrigerator and allow them to sit overnight, or for at least 8 hours.Refrigeration will help separate the coconut cream from the water.
If you prefer working with fresher ingredients, you can use fresh coconut meat instead of canned coconut milk. Combine 2 cups (500 ml) fresh coconut meat with 1/2 cup (125 ml) coconut water or filtered water, blending until smooth. You can use this blend immediately; no refrigeration is required., Open the cans of coconut milk and scoop out the solidified cream sitting on top. Discard the watery portion sitting in the bottom of the can.


Do not shake the cans before opening them since doing so will combine the cream and water, resulting in watery yogurt.

, Place the solidified coconut milk in your blender or food processor. Add the lemon juice, probiotic, and salt. Blend the ingredients together until well-combined and very smooth.


Open and empty the probiotic capsules; do not add whole capsules to the blender.
If you don't have probiotic capsules, you could use 1 tsp (5 ml) probiotic powder or 1/4 cup (60 ml) coconut water probiotic kefir.

, Taste the yogurt. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid sweetener, if desired, and blend the yogurt again until the sweetener is evenly distributed.


Maple syrup, agave, coconut nectar, and natural liquid cane sugar are all good choices.
If the yogurt is too thick for your preferences, you could also add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of coconut water or purified water to thin it out.

, Transfer the yogurt to an airtight plastic container and place it in your refrigerator. Allow the yogurt to chill for approximately 2 or 3 hours.


This step isn't strictly necessary, but if you eat the yogurt immediately, it will be lukewarm and may seem less palatable.

, Remove the yogurt from the refrigerator and serve it while it's still cool.


Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container and use them within two weeks.

Pour the mixture into the pie shell.,
Garnish with whipped cream before serving.",How to Make Chocolate Pie1," To make this pie, you will need one ready-made nine-inch pie crust in a pie plate, your ingredients, as well as:


Fork
Aluminum foil
Dried beans (to weigh down the crust)
Small and large bowl
Whisk
Saucepan
Spoon;
, Preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C). Place a sheet of aluminum foil or parchment paper on top of the crust and weigh it down with pie weights or dried beans. This will ensure the pie shell keeps the right shape and doesn’t get puffy during the baking process.Bake the crust for 15 minutes, then remove the beans and the foil and cook for another five minutes. The crust is done when it has dried out and is starting to get a little brown.
Set the pie crust aside to cool while you make the filling.

, In a bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the milk.Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk it all together until there are no lumps.

, Transfer the mixture to a saucepan and heat it over medium heat, whisking frequently. Heat it for about six to eight minutes, until the mixture starts to bubble and take on the consistency of pudding.Remove the mixture from the heat immediately when it starts to thicken.

, While the mixture is still hot, add the chocolate, vanilla, and butter. Continue whisking until the chocolate is melted and all the ingredients are combined.Depending on how finely chopped the chocolate pieces were, this will only take a couple minutes.

, Use a spoon to get all the delicious chocolate filling out of the saucepan and into the shell. Spread the filling around so it’s evenly distributed in the pie shell.


If there is any leftover pie filling, dole it out into small bowls or ramekins and place them in the fridge to set as well.
Loosely cover the pie filling with a piece of plastic wrap to prevent a film from forming.Place the pie in the fridge and let it chill for at least four hours. This will give the pie time to set.

Chill your butter.,
Combine the dry ingredients and butter.,
Add the ice water.,
Chill the dough.,
Roll the dough.,
Make the pie shell.",How to Make Chocolate Pie3," To make a basic pie crust, you will need a food processor, a rolling pin, a knife to cut the butter, plastic wrap, extra flour for dusting, and a 9-inch pie plate.


You can use two forks or a pastry cutter if you don’t have a food processor., When making pastries, it’s always important to use cold butter, because this will create air pockets that make the crust light and flakey. Cut your butter into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes and chill them in the freezer for at least an hour.


The butter can be chilled or even frozen when you make pastry, and that’s why you should cut it into cubes before chilling., Pour the flour and salt into the food processor and pulse it a few times to combine them. Then add the butter and continue pulsing the mixture until you have pea-sized clumps of butter.To do this without a food processor, use the two forks simultaneously or the pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until you have pea-sized bits.

, Pour this into the mixture one tablespoon (15 ml) at a time. Continue pulsing until each tablespoon has been worked in, and then add another if necessary.


The dough is ready when it comes together and is moist but not wet., Cover a countertop or flat surface with a light dusting of flour. Break the dough into five or six smaller pieces and transfer them to the floured surface. With the heel of your hand, flatten each piece out on the counter. This process is called smearing, and it helps distribute the butter evenly.Bring the pieces back together and form the dough into a ball. Wrap it tightly with a piece of plastic wrap and transfer it to the fridge.
Chill the dough for at least one hour before using.
You can also keep the dough in the fridge for up to two days, or freeze it for later use.

, When the dough has had time to chill, remove it from the fridge and unwrap it. Flour a flat surface and transfer the dough to it. Flour the surface of your rolling pin as well.Place the rolling pin in the center of the dough ball and apply pressure as you push the rolling pin away from yourself, pushing the dough outward as you roll. Place the rolling pin back in the center of the dough, and this time apply even pressure as you pull the rolling pin toward you.
Rotate the dough one-quarter turn and repeat. Continue doing this until the dough forms a circle with a 12-inch (30-cm.) diameter.
As you roll, you can add more flour if the dough starts to stick to the counter or the rolling pin.

, Gently pick up the dough and transfer it to the pie plate. Center the dough over the plate and place it down. Gently press the dough to mold it to the pie plate.


Trim off any excess dough that’s hanging over the edge of the pie plate.
You can make the pie crust slightly more decorative by pressing the tines of a fork into the edges around the entire circumference of the pie shell.
Once you’ve molded the pastry into the pie plate, the crust is ready to cook.

Next, place a baking sheet on the center rack of the oven and allow it to heat as well.If you need to adjust the oven racks to position one in the center, do it before you preheat the oven so the rack isn’t hot when you move it.;
, Add 3 large eggs to the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Mix them on medium until the yolks and whites are fully combined.You can mix the custard for the filling with a handheld electric mixer if you prefer.
You can mix the custard for the filling by hand with a whisk, though it will take more time and effort.

, After you’ve beaten the eggs, add 1 ½ cups (300 g) of sugar to the bowl. Whisk the two together on medium until the sugar is fully incorporated., Once the eggs and sugar are mixed, pour 1 cup (237 ml) of heavy cream into the bowl. Beat the cream into the mixture on medium until it is fully incorporated.You can substitute light cream for the heavy if you prefer, but for the best consistency, don’t use milk.

, After you’ve fully combined the custard base, mix in 1 tablespoon (8 ½ g) of flour, ½ cup (113 g) of butter that’s been melted and cooled, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of almond extract, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice, and the zest from 1 lemon. Blend the ingredients on medium until they are fully incorporated.For the best results, use fresh lemon juice.

, Once all of the other ingredients are mixed, add 1 cup (75 g) of unsweetened, flaked coconut to the bowl. Use a spatula to carefully fold the coconut into the filling mixture until it is fully incorporated.While unsweetened coconut works best in the pie, you can substitute sweetened.
The finished filling mixture should be mostly smooth, with some chunks from the coconut.

, When you’ve finished mixing the pie filling, transfer it to an unbaked, deep-dish 9-inch (23-cm) pie shell. Be careful not to fill the crust all the way to the edge because the custard filling will rise as it bakes.You can use a homemade or store-bought pie crust. Just make sure that it isn’t baked before you fill it.

, After you’ve filled the pie crust, carefully place it on baking sheet on the center rack of the preheated oven. Let the pie bake for 20 minutes., When you reach the 20-minute mark, rotate the pie to ensure that it browns evenly. Allow it to bake for another 20 to 30 minutes or until the pie is lightly brown and the center no longer jiggles.You can insert a toothpick or cake tester into the center of the pie to test for doneness. The test should emerge moist but not coated in custard.

, To ensure that the pie has set enough for cutting, let it cool for at least an hour on a wire rack. When you’re ready to serve, cut it into slices and transfer to plates.Cover any leftover pie with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator. It should keep for up to 4 days.

Put the lid on and blitz the mixture 15 to 20 times, so it becomes crumbly.If you don't have a large food processor, you can place the ingredients in a mixing bowl and cut the butter in with a pastry cutter.;
, Open the pouring spout on the lid of your food processor and slowly pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of cold whole milk or heavy cream while you pulse the dough. The dough should look shaggy and soft. If there's still a lot of flour or dry ingredients in the bottom of the food processor, you can add another tablespoon of milk or cream. Divide the dough into 2 large disks and wrap each in plastic wrap. Chill them for 2 hours.You can refrigerate the dough for up to 5 days.

, Sprinkle a little flour or cocoa onto your work surface. Place one disk of chilled dough on it and roll it out until it's just a few centimeters thick. Use a 3-inch (7.5 cm) cookie cutter to cut out hand pie shapes. Re-roll the scraps and cut more hand pie shapes. Roll and cut the other disk of dough and chill the hand pie shapes while you make the filling.You can set the shapes on baking sheets.
You can use a circle cookie cutter or your favorite shape. Try heart hand pies or fluted circles.

, Coarsely chop 1 4-ounce bar (113 g) of semi-sweet chocolate and put it in a large bowl. Pour 1/2 cup (120 ml) of heavy cream into a small saucepan and heat it over medium. When the cream starts to boil, take it off the heat and pour it over the chocolate. Stir it slowly until the filling is smooth. Chill the chocolate filling for 15 minutes.If you want to make chocolate peanut butter filling, just stir in 2 tablespoons (31 g) of creamy peanut butter.
The chocolate filling will thicken as it cools.

, Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Take the chilled hand pie shapes out of the fridge and divide them among 2 baking sheets. To make the egg wash, crack one egg into a small bowl and add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk or heavy cream. Beat the mixture with a fork or small whisk.The egg wash will make the hand pies shiny and crisp on the outside. It will also help the pastry stick together, so the filling doesn't ooze out.

, Dip a pastry brush into the egg wash and brush the edges of half of the pastry shapes with the wash. Spread one spoonful of chocolate filling the pastry shapes that have the egg wash. Set one of the shapes that doesn't have egg wash over the filling and gently press down on the edges. Use a fork to crimp the edges and seal the filling in. Repeat this for all of the hand pie shapes you made.You can use a spoon or small cookie scoop to portion out the chocolate filling.

,, The edges of the hand pies will start to look a little dry, but the tops might still seem a little wet. Remove the pies from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes.Avoid over baking the hand pies, which can dry them out.

, Coarsely chop 2 ounces (57 g) of semi-sweet chocolate and put it in a small bowl with 1 teaspoon of canola or vegetable oil.

Whisk the mixture over medium heat until it thickens. This should take around 1 minute.Whisk constantly to prevent the pudding from becoming lumpy.

, Turn off the heat and stir 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter into the chocolate pudding, so it melts. Let the pudding cool for a few minutes and cover it with plastic wrap. Press the plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Chill the pudding for at least 2 hours.You can refrigerate the pudding for up to a day before making the hand pies.

, While the chocolate pudding chills, get out a large mixing bowl. Stir together 2 cups (250 g) of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add 6 tablespoons (76 g) of room temperature shortening and cut it in, so the dry ingredients become coarse and sandy.You can use your fingertips or a pastry cutter to incorporate the shortening.

, Crack one whole egg in a small prep bowl and add 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of ice water. Use a fork to beat the egg with the water and stir it into the flour mixture. The dough should start to come together into a ball.Ensure that the water is ice cold. This will keep the dough light and flaky.

, Use your fingers or a bench scraper to divide the pastry dough into 6 evenly sized balls. Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and place a ball of dough on it. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 6-inch (7.5 cm) disk. Do this for each of the dough balls.Remember to turn the dough occasionally as you roll it. This will prevent it from sticking to your work surface.

, Put the egg white in a small prep bowl and whisk it with a fork. Dip a pastry brush in the egg white and brush a 1/2-inch (12 mm) border on each disk of pastry dough. Scoop out 1/3 cup (76 g) of the chilled chocolate pudding onto the center of the disk. Fold one side of the pastry disk over the filling and onto the other side. Push down on the edges and crimp the edges with a fork, so the filling is sealed in.The pudding should be totally cold or it may warm the pastry dough, making it tough.

, Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and put the hand pies on it. Refrigerate the pies while you heat the oil. Get out a large, deep skillet. Pour in 3 cups (709 ml) of vegetable oil and turn the heat to medium-high. Check the temperature of the oil with a deep-fry thermometer. The oil is ready once it reaches 375 degrees F (190 C).Chilling the hand pies will help them crisp up as they fry.

, Once the oil is hot, carefully lower 2 hand pies into the oil. Fry them for 3 minutes and turn then occasionally. They should turn a golden brown once they've finished frying. Remove them with a slotted spoon and cool them for 15 minutes. Sprinkle them with confectioners' sugar and serve them.

Bring a large stockpot of water to boil.,
Trim the cabbage.,
Cook the cabbage until soft.,
Pull away 12 large leaves.,
Cut the thick center vein from each leaf.,
Mix the sauce ingredients together.In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce.,
Combine the ingredients for the meat filling.,
Place even amounts of filling on each cabbage leaf.,
Roll the leaf around the filling.,
Tuck the ends under.,
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).Bring out a large Dutch oven or roasting pan for the cabbage rolls.,

Serve hot.,
Arrange the cabbage rolls in your slow cooker.,
Pour the sauce over the rolls.,
Cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.Cover the slow cooker and cook the cabbage rolls until tender.,
Serve hot.",How to Make Cabbage Rolls1," Fill a large pot roughly halfway with water and bring it to a boil on the stove over high heat.


The stockpot should contain enough water to completely cover the head of cabbage. Do not overfill the pot, however, since doing so can cause the water to boil over the side.
You do not need to add any salt or oil to the water.;
, Cut away as much of the core as you can and remove any torn or ragged outer leaves.


Cut around the core at the bottom of the cabbage head using a small paring knife. Dig as much of the core out as possible. Doing this makes it easier to remove the leaves after the cabbage boils.

, Place the cabbage in the boiling water and cook for roughly 2 minutes.


Carefully dunk the cabbage in and out of the boiling water using tongs or a heat-resistant serving spoon.
Keep the cabbage core-end-up as it boils.
The leaves should soften and start to break free once the cabbage has boiled for a sufficient amount of time.

, Once the cabbage is cool enough to handle with your hands, remove 12 leaves from the outside of the cabbage, keeping them intact as much as possible.


As long as you cut away a portion of the core before boiling the cabbage, the leaves should practically fall off on their own. If this does not happen, though, you can use a fork or tongs to gently loosen the leaves.
As you pull away the leaves, do so gently so that you do not accidentally rip them.

, Use a paring knife to cut a V-shaped cut from the bottom of each leaf around the thick center rib to remove it.


Only cut out the thickest part of this center rib, located at the bottom of the stem. Do not cut too far into the leaf. If you do, wrapping the leaf around the filling will become difficult.
This is only an optional step and is not absolutely essential. If you are uncertain about how much to trim and are anxious about trimming away too much, you could simply skip this step.

, Set aside.


For a chunkier sauce, you could use an undrained 15-oz (470-ml) can of diced tomatoes and 1 cup (250 ml) of tomato sauce instead of the 15-oz (470-ml) can of tomato sauce.

, Place the ground beef, ground pork, tomato sauce, chopped onion, uncooked rice, parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika in a large mixing bowl and mix the ingredients with your hands until thoroughly combined.


Make sure that your hands are clean before you mix the filling. On a similar note, make sure that you wash your hands with warm water and soap after handling raw meat.
You could use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon instead of your hands, but it may be more difficult to combine the ingredients evenly using that technique.

, Place roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the mixture in each leaf, toward the center bottom.


If you cut away a portion of the center vein, place the filling just above the removed portion.

, Beginning from the cut end of the leaf, roll each leaf up and over the filling, tucking the leaf underneath itself to create a tight bundle.


If you cut away a portion of the center vein, overlap the cut ends before you begin rolling the leaf up. Otherwise, you may not be able to create an even roll and the filling could start to fall out.

, Fold the open ends of each leaf underneath the bundle to prevent the roll from unraveling.


The bottom of the roll should be the edge at which you stopped rolling. In other words, no seams should be visible from the “top” of the cabbage roll.
Hold each roll together with a toothpick, if necessary. If the roll comes loose or spills open, re-wrap it and secure the ends in place by spearing the roll with a toothpick.

,


A Dutch oven or roasting pan is ideal because of the size and weight of the pan, but you could also use a casserole dish or large baking dish in a pinch.

, Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly.


The sauce helps to prevent the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the pan. As such, you do not need to use aluminum foil or cooking spray.

, Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer.


The cabbage rolls will likely fit into the pan rather snugly, but that is not a problem. If anything, the snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they bake.
It is, however, important that the rolls be kept on a single layer. If not, they may not cook evenly.

, Cover the rolls as evenly as possible.


If necessary, use a spoon or spatula to spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll. Some of the sauce can also slide down into the spaces between the rolls.

, Cover the pan and bake the rolls until become tender.


Check the cabbage rolls after the first 60 minutes. If the cabbage leaves still do not feel tender, continue baking for the additional 30 minutes.
Make sure that the cover you are using is oven-safe. This is especially important if you are using a baking pan instead of a Dutch oven. If you do not have a lid, cover the pan with aluminum foil.

, The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the oven. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.


A standard serving size is two rolls per person.

, Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly.


The sauce partially prevents the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the Dutch oven. As a result, you do not need to use cooking spray.

, Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer.


The cabbage rolls will fit into the Dutch oven rather snugly. This snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they cook.
It is important, however, to keep the cabbage rolls in a single layer inside the Dutch oven. If not, they may not cook evenly.

, Cover the rolls as evenly as possible.


If necessary, spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula. Some of the sauce should also slide down into the gaps between the cabbage rolls.

, Cover the pan and cook on the lowest heat possible until the rolls become tender.


If you cook the cabbage rolls at too high a heat or for too long, the bottoms may burn and stick to the Dutch oven.

, The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the stove. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.


A standard serving size is two rolls per person.

, Place the rolls in your slow cooker, seam-side-down, packing them in tightly and in even layers.


Ideally, the cabbage rolls should be packed into a single layer. This is not always possible with a slow cooker, though, and not even essential. Since the majority of the cooking depends on the steam and heat built up inside the slow cooker as it cooks, the rolls do not need to be packed into one layer to cook evenly.

, Evenly spread the sauce out over the contents of the slow cooker.


Spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula.
Make sure that some of the sauce seeps into the cracks and crevices between the cabbage rolls. This is especially important if some of the cabbage rolls are layered on top of others.

,


Do not remove the cover from the slow cooker at any point during the cooking process.
If you are running a bit short on time, cook the cabbage rolls on High for about 4 hours.

, The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the slow cooker. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.

The more the strawberry looks like a very fat, well endowed carrot, the better! But don't worry too much, the coating will create a lot of the visual effect.


Larger strawberries provide the best effect because there is more room to imprint the carrot lines and to establish the carrot visual effect.;
, The instructions for coloring white chocolate can be found here.


To get orange, mix a few drops of red and yellow colorant together in a separate bowl, until you're happy with its ""carroty"" color.

,, Be careful not to get the color on the leaves––these must stay green. It is better to err on the side of caution and use a spatula knife or skewer to bring up the last bits of orange chocolate over the red strawberry flesh than to mark the leaves through too much dipping.

,, Usually about three evenly spaced lines will suffice to create the visual effect. Do this as follows:

Dip a wooden skewer or chopstick into the melted orange chocolate.

Carefully draw a line around the strawberry in three evenly spaced places. To do this, lay the strawberry on parchment paper and do one side, then allow to set. Once set, turn over the strawberry and do the other side, meeting at the same line ends.

Next, use canola oil to lightly grease a large baking sheet.You can substitute olive or vegetable oil for the canola oil.

, For the fries, you’ll need 1 pound (454 g) of fresh carrots. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin and then slice the carrots into ½-inch (13-mm) sticks with a sharp knife.You can cut the carrots into fries in any size that you like, but be aware that you may need to adjust the cooking time. Fries that are thicker than ½-inch (13-mm) will need to cook longer, while fries that are thinner will likely require less cooking time.

, Place the carrot sticks into a large bowl. Add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of olive oil and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt, and mix the carrots well to ensure that they’re evenly seasoned.You can add any other seasonings that you like to the fries.

If you like, you can season the Parmesan cheese. Garlic powder, dried basil, dried oregano, and/or Italian seasoning are good options.

, To coat the fries, dunk the carrot sticks into the egg mixture. Next, roll them in the Parmesan cheese so they’re evenly coated.When you’re dipping the carrot fries into the egg wash, be sure to allow the excess to drip back into the bowl so clumps don’t form when you coat them with the cheese.

, After you’ve coated the fries, transfer them to the lined baking sheet. Sprinkle them with salt and black pepper to taste.Make sure that the carrot fries are spread out in a single layer on the baking sheet.

, Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the carrot fries to bake until they are golden brown, which should take 15 to 20 minutes.Turn the fries over halfway through the cooking time to ensure that they cook evenly on both sides.

, To make the dipping sauce, add 6 tablespoons (90 g) of mayonnaise and 2 tablespoons (34 g) of chili sauce to a small bowl. Mix the two together so they are completely blended.You can use either hot or sweet chili sauce for the fry’s dipping sauce depending on your preference.

, When the carrot fries are finished baking, transfer them to a plate or platter. Sprinkle them with fresh, chopped parsley.You can omit the parsley if you prefer.

, Once the carrots are seasoned and garnished with the parsley, place the bowl with the chili mayonnaise dip beside the fries. Serve the dish while the carrot fries are still warm.If you aren’t a fan of the chili mayonnaise dip, you can substitute your favorite dipping sauce. A garlic aioli works well with the Parmesan carrot fries.

",How to Make Barbecued Green Beans and Potatoes,";
,


You need a BBQ with a flat or dished hotplate instead of the slotted grill types. If you don't have such a thing, you can use a large all metal frying pan, wok or skillet. The more non stick the pan, the better, but it should be one safe for using in a BBQ or hot oven above 220C / 428F.

, Turn the slices often to ensure they are crisp and browned evenly.

, The beans should be stir-fried through the potatoes and are tender on a BBQ in typically 2-3 minutes. Spread them evenly across the plate so the steam from the beans won't soften the potatoes and so the beans get contact with the hotplate for best flavour.

, Sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper and stir again. Close the BBQ lid and let sit for a minute so that any smoke being generated by the BBQ may flavour the beans and potatoes and allow the thyme flavours to penetrate.


Thyme and pepper burns rather easily so its best to add it after the BBQ has been turned off, so the remaining heat will keep the vegetables crispy, but not burn them.
The optional extra olives or capers should be added with the thyme to allow them to warm through and the flavours mingle.

,


The optional extras (such as Balsamic vinegar or parmesan cheese) may be sprinkled on now.

What kind of bread to use? Well, that's sort of up to you. But sourdough, French, brioche, Italian, or even sweet rolls will guarantee a delicious flavor.

, Try to get it spread as evenly as possible, because you want every bite to have a hint of buttery goodness. Mix it up in the pan a bit if need be to immerse all the pieces.

, If you're using raisins, of course! You can also use 1/2 cup of another dried fruit if raisins aren't your thing. But toasted nuts (pecans, anyone?) or even fresh fruit (like a chopped apple) are to die for, too.

, If you're looking for a twist, the zest of a lemon or orange or 1/4 cup rum or grand marnier could do the trick.


What does ""milk"" really mean? It can mean anything from soy to 2% to a mixture of milk and cream, if you're feeling extra decadent. The thicker and creamier it is, sure, the fattier it'll be, but it'll also be more scrumptious, too.

, Make sure it gets everywhere! Mix it up a bit so all sides of the bread can sop up the flavor.

, This helps the bread absorb the mixture and to coat all bread pieces. Mix it up slightly to spread the mixture evenly.


At this stage, you can opt to put the pudding in the fridge for up to an hour to give the flavor a chance to soak into the bread. However, if your stomach is rumbling now, it can be skipped.

, You'll know it's done when you insert a toothpick into it and it comes out clean. Let the bread pudding cool for 10-15 minutes. You can resist for that long, right?

, You can also top with milk or cream to make it extra gooey. Or keep reading for some extra delicious ideas!

, We briefly mentioned this up top, but bread pudding is a great base for a number of flavors. It's sweet, but not too sweet, and rich, but not too rich. Here are a few ideas to spruce up your dish:


Fresh fruit, like apples or berries
Dried fruit, like dates or figs
Pecans or walnuts, toasted and chopped
Caramel or butterscotch drizzled on top
Top it with sugar, brown sugar, or a streusel topping of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a bit of flour and butter

, Just when you thought it couldn't be any better, huh? After it comes out of the oven and while it's cooling, grab your saucepan and start making a sauce to pour over the individual servings. It's quite simple:


Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup cream, and 1/4 cup Jack Daniels in your pan. Heat over medium-low and when it reaches a light boil, take it off the heat. That's it! Drizzle over the pudding and try not to salivate.

, ...Or maybe it does get better. Heat 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 egg in a saucepan, whisking and stirring till it thickens. Then, whisk in up to 1 cup of bourbon and take off the heat. Drizzle over and enjoy!


Don't let it simmer or it might curdle! You just want it to get warm and thick.

If you want to make this in an oven: preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Fill a baking pan with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water. The pan needs to be large enough to hold your ramekins.If you want to make this in a steamer: fill the pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place the steamer on top of the pot.;
, Place the sugar in a dry pan, then melt it over medium heat. Once it melts and turns brown, add the water; the caramel will start to bubble. Swirl the pan to mix; don't stir it., Tilt the ramekins around to spread the caramel evenly across the bottom. Work quickly before the caramel hardens. You will have enough to coat two large ramekins or four small ones.

, Pour the milk into a saucepan, and cook it over medium heat, stirring frequently. Once it starts to boil, take it off the stove and set it aside to cool. Move onto the next step immediately; you still want the milk to be warm when you go to use it again.

, Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.You can do this by hand or by using an electric mixer.

, Slowly pour the milk into the egg mixture to prevent curdling, stirring as you pour. Keep whisking until everything is combined, about 1 to 2 minutes. Once everything is mixed, stir in the vanilla.

, The strainer will remove any strands of egg white and give you a smoother, silkier pudding in the end., Return to the items you have prepared at the beginning of the method.

If you are baking the pudding: place the ramekins into the water-filled pan and bake for 35 to 45 minutes on the lower rack.Make sure that the water doesn't cover the ramekins; if it does, pour some water out.
If you are using a steamer: let the water come to a boil, then insert the ramekins. Cover the steamer and simmer for 10 to 20. Remove the steamer from heat and wait 5 minutes.

, Take the ramekins out of the oven or steamer, and set them aside to cool to room temperature. Once they have cooled, chill them for at least 1 hour in the fridge; don't put hot ramekins into the fridge or you will change the interior temperature.

, Slowly lift the ramekin off the plate, leaving the pudding behind.

, Do not overlap or squish the bread slices together. You will have lots of bread left over, which you will be using for other layers.

, If you do not like sultanas, or can't find any, you can use another type of dried fruit, such as raisins.

, Make sure that you are always putting the bread down with the buttered side facing up. You last layer should be only bread—no sultanas or cinnamon.

, Pour the milk and cream into a small saucepan, then stir them together to combine them. Place the saucepan on the stove, and turn the heat up to low. Do not let the milk and cream come to a boil. While the milk and cream are heating, you can prepare your egg mixture.

, Crack the two eggs into a bowl, then add part of the sugar; save the rest of the sugar for later. Beat the eggs and sugar together with a whisk until they turn pale. The yolks and whites should be completely blended together.

, Do not pour it too quickly, or you will risk cooking the eggs. Stir everything together with a whisk while you pour. This is now your custard base.

, The strainer will catch any cooked bits of egg. Discard anything caught in the strainer.

, Make sure that you pour the custard base evenly over the bread, so that everything gets soaked. You can use as much or as little nutmeg as you'd like.

, This gives the bread enough time to soak up the custard, and for the different flavors to blend together.

, Preheat your oven to 355°F (180°C) first. Then, place the pudding into the oven, and let it bake for 30 to 40 minutes.

Lightly coat the inside of a 9 by 13 by 2-inch (22.86 by 33.02 by 5.08 centimeters) baking dish with butter.

, Cut the soft rolls into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick slices. Then, use a butter knife to spread the butter onto one side of each bread sliceYou can choose any type of small, soft, round roll. Brioche is a great choice.

, Arrange the slices in neat layers, one on top of the other. You will end up with several layers of bread. Make sure that you are setting the slices buttered-side-up in each layer.

, If you don't like raisins, or can't find then, you can also use sultanas instead; they are very in bread and butter puddings. Set the dish aside when you are done.

, Pour the milk and heavy cream into the saucepan first, then stir them together. Stir in the salt next. Cut the vanilla beans open lengthwise, then use the tip of a knife to scrape the seeds into the saucepan. Stir everything together once more with a whisk.

, Stir the milk mixture often as it is coming to a boil to prevent scorching. Once the milk is boiling, take the saucepan off the heat, and turn off the stove.

, Crack the eggs open into a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar. Beat the two together with a whisk until the yolks break and blend in with the whites. This will take about 1 minute.

, Do not pour all of the milk into the eggs all at once. Pouring a little bit of the hot milk into the eggs will allow the eggs to heat up slowly without cooking. This will give you a smoother custard base in the end., Once you have the custard base mixed together, pour it through a fine, mesh strainer into a large mixing bowl. Discard any lumps or clumps that get caught in the strainer.

, The bread will float to the top, so use a spatula or a spoon to press down on the bread until it soaks up the custard and sinks to the bottom. Be careful not to squish or break the bread.

, The water inside the larger roasting pan will surround the baking dish, and help the pudding cook more evenly.

, Carefully place the roasting pan with the pudding inside it into the oven, careful not to spill any water. Bake the pudding for 30 minutes, then use a spoon or spatula to press down any bread slices that might have floated to the top. The pudding is ready when the custard sets and puffs up; it should still be jiggle-y in the middle., Once the pudding is done, take the roasting pan out of the oven, and set it down on a wire cooling rack. Let the pudding cool a little in the roasting pan.

, In a small saucepan over low heat, combine 2 tablespoons (40 grams) of apricot jam with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water.

Freeze the grapes for at least 4 to 5 hours.,
Remove the grapes from the freezer.,
Enjoy your grapes.",How to Make Frozen Grapes," It's always a good idea to rinse any fruit before you eat it. Washing fruit helps to remove pesticides that are dangerous to your health. Place the grapes in a colander or bowl or on a plate and pat them dry with a paper towel. Give them at least 15 minutes to dry as much as they can.






;
, You can also use Tupperware or another resealable container. Spread out the grapes as much as you can so they don't touch each other. This is done so that the grapes don't stick together when they freeze. Even after draining and drying them, any excess moisture can turn the fruit into a giant fruit block.









If you want your grapes to be extra sweet, then you can sprinkle them with a bit of sugar, stevia or artificial sweetener before you put them in the freezer.
If you want to get creative, you can make ""frozen grape skewers"" by placing the grapes on a skewer or a few skewers before putting them in the fridge.

, The more grapes you have, the longer it will take to fully freeze them. You can freeze them overnight, too, but you don't want to freeze them for too long or they may lose some of their delicious flavor and texture.








, Take them out and place them in a bowl and get ready to snack away.








, If you want to be more inventive than simply eating the grapes as they are, there are a variety of ways to spruce up your ordinary frozen grapes:









Use them as ice cubes for a refreshing glass of water, or a mimosa or another alcoholic beverage.
Place them in yogurt and rice pudding to add an extra pop to your snack.
Sprinkle them with sugar for an extra-sweet treat.

",How to Shuck Clams," A clam shell that is open when you receive it or opens easily by hand is typically dead. Keep the living clams and throw away any dead clams.;
, Using a stiff brush, scrub the shell of each clam under cold, running water. This will rid the shell of any residual salt and sand.

, Though you don't have to do this, it will help loosen up the clams a bit before you try to shuck them and will make the entire process easier. Here's how you do it:Pour 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water into a large bowl.
Add 1/3 cup (78.86 ml) of salt to the gallon of water.
Stir until the salt is completely dissolved into the water.
Place all your cleaned clams in the water/salt mixture. Let the clams soak for 20 minutes.
Drain water/salt mixture.
Repeat the process of soaking your clams in a water/salt mixture 2 more times.

, Place all the clams on a tray and them put them in the refrigerator for an hour. This will help relax the clams and make it easier to open their shells.

, You'll need a thin, 3"" shucking knife that has a rounded tip that makes it ideal for shucking your clams. Don't confuse this with a pointed oyster knife, which is used differently. If you don't have one of these, make sure you use a small, sharp knife., Use a towel to hold the clam in your hand. This will protect your hand when you pry open the clam shell with a knife. If you really feel unsteady, you can also wear gloves.


Make sure the hinge of the clam shell is nestled in the area of your palm nearest your thumb. The opening of the clam should be at your fingertips. You can also press down on the clam a bit to give it some added pressure to make it easier to pry it open with the knife.







, Press into the clam, right into the muscle. Alternately, you can insert the knife at the hinge of the shell, but then you'd have to use a lot more pressure to try to break open the hinge and shuck the clam that way. You'll have to squeeze the knife between the shells to loosed the adductor muscles and the hinge of the shells.

, Continue to twist the knife until you break the seal of the clam and your knife is inside the clam shell. Don't force it too much and be careful not to cut your hand. Use the knife more as a form of leverage than force. You will use the knife to pry open the top shell of the clam.

, This will ensure that you've cut the hinge of the clam shell and are ready to open the clam. Cut the upper adductors and take off the top shell. When the clam is ready, you will hear a nice snapping sound.

, Using your fingers, pull the top shell off of the clam. Try to save the clam juice, which is a delicious part of the clam.

, Just slip the knife under the clam meat to loosen those lower adductors of the clam. Place each clam in a top shell to assemble clams on a half-shell, or prepare the clams according to a recipe. You can place the clams on ice until you're ready to eat or cook them.

Store shrimp in your refrigerator until ready to sauté.

",How to Saute Shrimp1," Fresh shrimp does not store well, and you should sauté it within 24 hours. Most grocery stores sell frozen shrimp that they have thawed, and these shrimp should be cooked within 2 to 3 days.


Look for fresh shrimp that has transparent skin and smells like salt water. Unless you are buying tiger shrimp, avoid specimens with dark rings or spots. Dark rings or spots may indicate that the shrimp is going bad.
Choose frozen shrimp that has not been peeled or deveined. It's more work to peel the shrimp yourself, but when preparing shrimp, you want to preserve the flavor. The shrimp shell encases the full flavor of the meat, so pre-prepared shrimp loses some of its taste.;
, 1 serving of shrimp consists of 4 oz. (.113 kg) to 8 oz. (.226 kg), and 1 lb. (.454 kg) of shelled fresh or frozen shrimp will become 1/2 lb. (.226 kg) of sautéed shrimp. When sautéing shrimp, you will lose some of the weight when you peel the shrimp, and the heat will cook out some of the moisture, shrinking the meat.

The best way to defrost shrimp is to place it in cold water or let it sit in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.

, Deveining a shrimp is removing the back vein. When you are preparing shrimp, it is not necessary to remove the back vein, but some cooks devein the shrimp to make it look better.


Devein your shrimp by running the point of a sharp knife or a de-veiner along the back vein.
Hold the shrimp under cold water and take the vein out.

, When sautéing shrimp, you must remove the tail and the shell.

Prepare trout to be cooked.,
Consider stuffing your trout.,
Proceed with trout prep based on your desired cooking method.,
Finished.

",How to Prepare Trout to Cook,"


Select a trout to cook that is an ideal weight of 2 to 4 lbs. (1 to 2 kg). Larger trout are breeders and should be released to maintain the trout population. It may be tempting to keep a larger fish, considering it a prize or a plentiful meal; however, the flavor of a larger trout is not as good as that of the smaller ones.
Cut off the trout's head and tail. This step is optional. Completion of it is solely preference and will not affect the cooking time or flavor of the fish. To do so, cut up from the throat across the soft area between the collarbone and the gills.
Remove the guts from the trout. Use your knife and make a cut along the underside of the fish from its anus, along the stomach to its throat. You will expose the entrails. Grab hold of them and pull them out.
Rinse the trout with clean, cold water. This will remove any blood, dirt and debris from the fish. Blood on the fish is part of what makes the trout have an overly fishy taste.
Fillet the fish. With the belly side of the fish facing upward, take your knife and cut upward along the backbone. The blade of the knife will follow the outside of the fish's ribs. Then cut down to the backbone from the top side. The cuts will be the entire length of the trout, from the gills to the tail. Repeat the filleting cuts with the meat on the other side of the backbone.
Take out any remaining bones. There should be a row of bones remaining in the center of each fillet. Slide the blade of your knife just under this row to remove the bones.;
, Stuffing your trout will increase the cook time by 10 minutes per inch of thickness. You can use a boxed stuffing mix from the store or create a stuffing recipe of your own using rice or vegetables and seasonings. Simply spoon some stuffing into the center of a fillet and fold the fish to conceal the stuffing.

,


Cook trout over a fire or on a grill. Lay out a piece of aluminum foil that is larger than your fillets. Put 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml). of butter on the foil. Place your trout on top of the butter. If the skin is still intact, lay the fish with the skin side down. Sprinkle the trout with salt and pepper. Draw up opposite sides of the foil. Press the sides together and fold them down a few turns, creating a seal along the top. Fold the ends of the foil upward. You have created a food-filled pouch to sit on top your prepared fire.
Pan fry the trout. Cover both sides of the fillets with flour. Pick each fillet up and gently shake it to remove any extra flour. Season with salt and pepper. You can also try seasonings like dill or lemon. Carefully slip the fillets into a hot frying pan prepared with a shallow depth of olive oil.
Broil your trout. Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Season your fillets and set them on the pan. Put the pan into an oven preheated to 400 degrees. You will not need to flip the fish during cooking.
Cook trout whole. Decapitate and gut the fish as described above. Then cook the fish using any of the methods mentioned. Once the meat is properly cooked, grab the backbone at the neck and pull it out and away from the trout. This will remove many of the bones and leave you with a tasty meal.

Be sure to remove the ice and let the crawfish return to room temperature before purging and cooking.

, Make sure your container has enough room to thoroughly clean them. Also make sure they won't be able to somehow crawl out.

",How to Purge Crawfish2," Take your salt box or grinder and shake it liberally over them. Regular table salt will do—this isn't intended for seasoning. The bugs should go wild with discomfort when you do this.


Salting is optional. Some cooks believe that salting may help clean the crawfish better by compelling them to essentially vomit and purge any mud and waste in their digestive system. However it also increases the risk of killing the crawfish during the purge.

, You want to try to salt the whole batch evenly.

, You can use another bucket or just fill their tub up with a hose. When this happens, the crawfish spit out the grime in their system, minimizing fishy taste and odors and reducing the size of their gritty sand vein.

, The moving water will help wash the mud off the crawfish's shells and gills.

, Try to drain the salt water completely.

, Check for any dead crawfish that float to the top—remove them and throw them away immediately.

, After giving it a stir, the water should be much less grimy than in previous rinses. If you are satisfied with the cleanliness, you are done purging.

",How to Saute Scallops,"


If you are using frozen scallops, the preferred method of defrosting is to place them in the refrigerator the night before, so they slowly defrost. Scallops cook very quickly, so you do not want to defrost them under hot water.;
,, Make sure to cover the seasonings on both sides.


If you want a crust of pepper, add generously to both the top and bottom of the scallop.
You can also season with paprika, which has a slightly sweet, smoky taste and bright coloring.
To create an easy pan-sauce and flavoring, sauté 2 crushed cloves of garlic and 1 finely minced shallot until tender before adding the scallops.

, Add 1 tbsp. (14.8 ml) of olive oil.


You can substitute 1 tbsp. (14.34 g) of clarified butter for olive oil, but not regular butter. Clarified butter is milk fat that has been heated to separate, removing the water and the butterfat. The result is a butter that has a longer shelf life and a higher smoking point. Regular salted or unsalted butter will burn when used to sauté at high heat, clarified butter will not.

, You can do this using a set of tongs, or your fingers, since the scallops have not been heated yet.


Once the scallops are placed in the pan, do not move them until they are ready to be flipped over onto the other side.

, The cooked side should be golden brown.

Serve the pie immediately.",How to Make Banana Cream Pie," If you want to save time for the next few steps, place the flour and salt into a food processor.;
, You can do this in a food processor fitted steel blades or in a medium sized bowl with a pastry blender.Do not over mix, or the dough will get too soft and mushy.

, Again, don't over mix it. The butter, shortening, salt, and flour should just come together. You want the mixture to still resemble coarse crumbs.


If you are using a food processor, you can transfer the mixture into a medium sized bowl once you mix the butter in.

, Gently toss the dough while you add the water. The dough should just barely come together. If it is too dry, add a little bit more water, until it does. Don't worry if it looks too dry; it will dampen once you put it in the fridge.

, Scoop the crumbs towards the center, and press them into the dough. Make the disk about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) thick. You will be rolling it out later, so don't worry if it looks too thick now.


If the mixture is too dry and crumbly, spritz it with some cold water.

, This will help the dough keep its disk shape. It will also trap moisture and keep it from drying it.

, This will give the flour enough time to soak up the water and become softer.,, Unwrap the dough first, then lightly flour a flat, smooth surface. Place the dough onto the surface.

, This will be big enough for a 9 inch (22.86 centimeters) pie pan. You are making the crust larger so that it can fit inside the pan.


If the dough is too hard, wait 10 to 15 minutes so that it can soften up.

, Gently press the bottom of the dough until it lays flat against the bottom of the pie pan. Run your finger around the inside edges, so that the dough fits into the corners.

, Use your finger to gently press the top edges of the dough against the rim of the pie pan. If the edges stick out beyond the rim, tuck them under each other. Do not tuck the excess dough under the rim itself.


Consider putting a fancy edge on the crust. You can do this simply by pinching the dough all around the rim, or making shallow indents with a fork.

, The tiny holes will help the dough lay flat as it bakes.

, This will help the pie crust keep its shape while you bake it. If you don't have parchment paper, you can use a sheet of aluminum foil instead. If you can't find pie weights you can use dried beans or rice., Place it into the oven and let it bake for 20 minutes. Then, take it out of the oven, pull out the parchment paper/aluminum foil and weights. Place the pie crust back into the oven and back it for another 15 to 20 minutes. It is done when it is golden brown on the bottom.

, The pie crust should be cool before you add the banana cream filling. Do not take the crust out of the pan.

, There is no need to use any heat just yet.

, Do not pour it in all at once. Instead, slowly pour it into the mixture while you stir with a whisk.


If you don't have any half-and-half, you can use heavy cream instead

, If you have not already done so, separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Discard the whites, or save them for another recipe. Stir the mixture until the yolks break.


If you have an egg separator, use that.
Another way to separate yolks from whites is to crack open an egg and pass the yolk between the two shell halves over a bowl. The whites will drain into the bowl and the yolks will stay in the shells.

, Keep stirring until everything is mixed together, and there are no streaks, swirls, or clumps.

, This will take about 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to stir constantly, and do not try to rush through it by turning the heat up. After about 5 to 10 minutes, the mixture will look a little bit like pudding that has not yet set.

, Place a fine, mesh strainer over another medium sized saucepan. Pour the mixture through the strainer and discard and lumps or curdles.

, Stir often until the mixture has cooled slightly. Your pie filling is now done and ready to use. Don't worry if it looks a little thin. You will need to refrigerate the entire pie after you put it together. This will ""set"" the filling and make it thicker.

, You want the slices to be thin, about ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) thick.


Plan on having another extra banana so that you can slice it up and use it to decorate the pie with. Do not pre-slice this ""decorating"" banana, however, or it will turn brown.

, To get the most out of your sliced bananas, place the slices down flat, one by one. Don't just dump them all in. This will give you a 2-layer pie.


If you want a 3-layer pie, fill the bottom of crust part way with the pie filling first. Spread a thin layer of sliced bananas on top of the mixture. Fill the crust the rest of the way with the remaining pie pilling.

, You may need to use a spoon or spatula to help guide the filling into the crust. Keep adding the filling until it just reaches the top of the crust.


If you run out of pie filling, don't fret. You can always top the pie off with more sliced bananas and whipped cream.

, The plastic wrap will keep the pie from forming a ""skin"" on top.

, This will give the pie filling enough time to set into a thick, pudding or custard like consistency.

, Make ""stars"" with whipped cream all around the edge of the pie. Slice up a banana, and arrange the slices in a flower shape in the center of the pie. Finish off with a swirl of whipped cream in the middle of the banana flower.


You can make the little star shapes using a piping bag filled with whipped cream and fitted with a spiky decorators tip. You can also just use the kind of whipped cream that comes i a can with a nozzle.

, The pie will still taste just as good the next day, but the bananas may turn brown."

Add room temperature water until there are at least two inches (5 cm) of water over the top of the tins.A typical tin of condensed milk contains 14 oz (1.75 cups / 400g). If using a different size, use enough cans to get at least 21 oz (2.6 cups / 600g).;
, This will caramelise the condensed milk to make a soft, brown dulce de leche or ""toffee"". Check regularly and add more water as needed. If the cans are ever exposed to air, they can overheat and explode. Boil for at least two hours, and up to three if you want to guarantee a dark, rich caramel.Technically, the milk experiences a ""Maillard reaction,"" not caramelization. An ordinary caramel sauce is not thick enough to use as a pie filling., Remove the cans with tongs and set aside away from heat. Let them cool to room temperature before opening, or the dulce de leche might squirt out messily., Set it to 180ºC (350ºF)., North American recipes usually call for a graham cracker crust, while British cooks reach for the digestive biscuits or hobnobs instead.Weigh 150g of your chosen ingredient (or count out 9 unbroken graham crackers) and combine in a zip-locked bag with 40g (⅓ cup) ground almonds and 40g (⅓ cup) ground hazelnuts.

You could also melt the chocolate and coconut oil in the microwave. Just microwave on the lowest setting for 30 seconds at a time. Stir the chips frequently until they're melted.;
, Wash 2 large apples and carefully slice them into 1/2” to 3/4” slices. Take a small knife and make a small notch at the bottom of each slice so you can easily insert the stick. Push one popsicle stick into each apple slice.To ensure that the chocolate coats and sticks to the apples, consider patting them dry with a paper towel.

, Lay a piece of waxed paper onto a large baking sheet. Spray the wax with cooking or baking spray. Pour a little of the melted chocolate onto a small rimmed plate. Dip both sides of each apple slice into the chocolate so the slice is completely coated. Set the slices on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate the apples for 5 to 10 minutes so the chocolate hardens.If you don't have waxed paper, you could also lay a silicone baking mat on the baking sheet.

, Remove the baking sheet of chilled apples from the fridge. If the caramel sauce is in a squeeze bottle, just squeeze the caramel sauce over the apple slices. If the caramel sauce is in a jar, dip a spoon in the caramel and drizzle it over the apples. You can also drizzle melted white chocolate over the apple slices for an even sweeter flavor. Chill the apple slices for another 5 minutes.To melt the white chocolate, you could microwave white chocolate chips in 30 second intervals. Or purchase a white chocolate sauce.

",How to Make Sliced Caramel Apples2," Pour 2 quarts (2 liters) of water into a large bowl and add one teaspoon of salt. Stir or whisk the saltwater until the salt dissolves. Wash four apples and core them. Slice the apples into wedges (about eight per apple).Choose an apple variety that you enjoy eating. Try Honeycrisp, Pink Lady, Granny Smith, or Jonagold.

, Immediately place the apple wedges in the bowl of saltwater so they're covered. Soak them for 5 minutes. Then you can drain the saltwater and discard it. Pat the apples dry and use them or refrigerate them for a few days.The saltwater soak prevents the apples from browning, so you can make caramel apple wedges in advance.

, Set a heavy-bottomed saucepan on the stove and add 3/4 cup (180 ml) of the heavy cream, 3/4 cup (225 g) of dark corn syrup, 1/2 cup (115 g) of unsalted butter (cut into pieces), and 1 cup of (225 g) of sugar. Stir the ingredients to combine them and heat the pan over high heat until the mixture melts and reaches 244 to 248 degrees F (117 to 120 C).To accurately check the temperature, you can attach a candy thermometer to the inside of the saucepan. Just ensure that the tip of the thermometer doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.

, Carefully dip a spoon into the caramel to see how dark the color is. The caramel should be a dark amber color. If it is, remove it from the heat (or cook it longer if it's too pale). Pour in the remaining 1/4 cup (60 ml) of heavy cream and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Hold the handle of the saucepan and swirl it to combine the ingredients.If you like a softer caramel, don't cook it the caramel soft too long. Let it get to a light brown color and remove it from the heat.

Roll out the puff pastry.,
Fold the strudel.,
Brush the strudel with an egg wash and bake it.,
Make an optional icing to drizzle on the strudel.",How to Make Shortcut Apple Strudel," Thaw one sheet of frozen puff pastry (1/2 pound or 245 g) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wash and peel 2 large, tart apples (like Granny Smith apples). Core the apples and carefully slice them as thin as you can (about 1/4"" thick). Place the apples in a mixing bowl.The puff pastry should still be cold when you work with it, so avoid thawing it to room temperature.;
, Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Add 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tablespoon of the flour, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the bowl with the apples. Use a large spoon to toss the ingredients together until they're combined.Ensure that all of the apple slices are completely covered with the flour, sugar, and cinnamon. This will help the apples cook evenly as they release juice.

, Many strudel recipes add a few tablespoons of raisins to the filling mixture. For a festive flavor, you could also use a few tablespoons of dried cranberries to the apple filling. Or if you want a slight crunch in the strudel, add 1/4 cup of sliced almonds or chopped walnuts.For a shortcut strudel that's great to serve during fall, replace the apples with Bosc pears and use dried cranberries.

, Sprinkle the last 2 tablespoons of the flour over your work surface or counter. Unfold the thawed sheet of puff pastry on the space and use a rolling pin to roll the puff pastry into a rectangle. The rectangle should measure 12x16 inches (30.5x40.5 cm).Turn the pastry frequently while you're rolling it out. This will keep it from sticking to your work surface.

, Turn the puff pastry rectangle so that the short side is closest to you. Spread the apple filling onto the pastry so that it's only the bottom half that's facing you. Leave a 1-inch edge at the bottom. Use both of your hands to pick up that edge and fold it over the filling. Roll the pastry with filling onto itself like you're rolling a jelly roll. Set the strudel on a baking sheet and tuck the ends under the strudel.The seam where you folded the pastry should be on the bottom of the strudel. This will keep any filling from leaking out as it bakes on the sheet.

, Crack one egg into a small bowl and add 1 tablespoon of water. Whisk the mixture until it's completely combined. Dip a pastry brush in the egg wash and brush it over the strudel. Use a knife to carefully cut 4 slits in the top of the strudel. Bake the strudel for 35 minutes. It should be golden brown and the filling will bubble when it's cooked.Let the strudel cool for 20 minutes before you serve it. You can dust it with 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar when it's cool or drizzle it with glaze while it's still hot.

, To add a slightly sweet finishing touch, you can mix up a quick icing. You'll need to place the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk them until they're combined. The glaze should be thin enough to drizzle on the hot strudel. Mix together:1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar
2 tablespoons of milk or cream
1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

",How to Make Mixed Berry Slab Pie," You'll need to chill 1/3 of a cup (75 g) of butter and cut it into chunks. Set it aside along with 3/4 cup (145 g) of vegetable shortening. You should also set out one cup (240 ml) of ice water (although you may end up using less). Mix together the dry ingredients in a large bowl. You'll need:3 3/4 cups (468 g) of all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons of granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons of salt;
, Add the chilled, cubed butter and shortening to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a pastry blender or fork to mix the butter and shortening into the dry mixture. The ingredients should begin to clump together and look like coarse breadcrumbs.Don't worry about overmixing the ingredients at this point. Cutting in the butter and shortening just ensures that the pastry will be evenly flaky and tender.

, Add 1 tablespoon of the ice water to the pastry ingredients and toss it together with a fork. Keep adding and stirring in the water, one tablespoon at a time until the ingredients around the sides and bottom of the bowl are moist. You should be able to form the dough into a ball without it falling apart.Avoid adding more water than you need. Too much water in the pastry dough will make it sticky and tough to roll out.

, Divide the ball of dough of dough into two balls. Use 2/3 of the dough for one ball and the remaining 1/3 for the second ball. Form each ball into disks about 1-inch thick and wrap them tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough while you make the filling.You can refrigerate the dough a few days before making the slab pie or freeze it for up to three months. Just thaw the dough in the fridge the day before you plan to roll it out.

, While fresh berries are best, you can use frozen berries in a pinch. Don't bother defrosting them. You'll need 7 cups of berries to make one slab pie. Choose a mixture of blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries.


You can also add other fruits in place of some of the berries. For example, you could make strawberry-rhubarb, peach-raspberry, or nectarine-blueberry filling.

, Place all of your mixed berry filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir them until the sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice coat all of the berries. You'll need:7 cups (1.22 kg) of fresh mixed berries
1 1/4 cup (250 g) of granulated sugar
1/4 cup (27.5 g) of cornstarch
1 tablespoon of lemon juice

, If you'd like to add a unique flavor to the mixed berry slab pie, consider adding chocolate, amaretto, or lemon-lavender. Avoid using more than one of these additions or you could overwhelm the flavor of the mixed berries. Try one of the following flavor additions:


Scatter 1 1/2 cups (250 g) of chocolate chips over the bottom layer of pastry before you spread the mixed berries on top.Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of amaretto liqueur to the filling for a slight almond flavor.Mix the zest of one lemon with 1/4 cup (50 g)of sugar and 1 tablespoon of dried lavender. Grind this together and sprinkle it over the top layer of pastry., Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C) and get out a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Sprinkle some flour over your work surface and place the large ball of pastry dough on the surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12x17-inch rectangle. Place the dough in the bottom of your jelly roll pan and press the sides against the edges of the pan.To make rolling the dough easier, you could lay down a piece of wax paper. Place the dough on the wax paper and set another piece of wax paper over the dough. Roll it out between the two sheets and lift them up to fit the dough into the pan.

, Scoop the mixed berry filling onto the pastry in the jelly roll pan. Use a spatula or spoon to spread the filling evenly over the pastry. Roll out the smaller ball of dough to make an 11x16-inch rectangle. Lay the pastry dough over the filling and crimp the edges to seal the dough.Instead of laying the pastry directly over the filling, you could use cookie cutters to stamp out pieces of pastry. Lay the pastry cutouts on top of the filling so that they overlap slightly.

, Place one egg white and 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Whisk the egg with the water to make an egg wash. Dip a pastry brush in the wash and spread it over the top of the slab pie. Cut a few slits in the top of the pastry. Bake the slab pie for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. It should turn golden brown and the filling may bubble out of the slits.For a slight crunch, you could sprinkle a few tablespoons of coarse sugar over the pastry before baking.

Sometimes quinces that look beautiful outside can have brown parts inside or they might contain a visitor (like a worm).
Often quinces are cooked whole, but by cutting them you will ensure that they cook faster and not include any parts that cannot be eaten;
, Place the cubes of quince and the sugar in a pot. Stir the fruit so that the sugar is distributed evenly. Leave to stand overnight.


Quinces release juice which will form a syrup when mixed with sugar .
The color of the quince will change because oxidation occurs. This process is normal.
It is not necessary to place them in the refrigerator.
Allow the fruit and sugar to rest for at least 5 hours.

, Cover the pot and cook over high heat until the mixture of quince and syrup starts to boil. Let it boil for 4 or 5 minutes.


After 5 minutes, reduce heat to medium and let the quinces cook for about 1 hour (larger amounts of quinces require a longer cooking time).
To prevent burning, use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture occasionally.
The quinces are ready when they are soft and bright, and their color has changed significantly (the final product can vary from reddish to honey color, depending on the quince you use).

, Let the cooked quince cool (until warm, not cold) and then liquefy in blender.

, The containers / molds should simple and fairly shallow, so it won't be difficult to unmold the paste when it sets.


Wait until the quince paste thickens and sets before unmolding.
Kept in the refrigerator, this quince paste should last for several months.

, Cut the membrillo into slices and serve with slices of cheese, biscuits or crackers , or use it to spice up your favorite sweet tarts.

You can make a basic pie crust with 1 cup (250 ml) all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup (125 ml) butter or shortening, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/4 cup (60 ml) water.Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.
Cut in the fat until coarse crumbs form.
Stir in water until you can form a ball with the dough.
Cover and chill with for 4 hours.
Roll the dough out on a floured counter and transfer it to your pie pan.;
, Your basic options include butter, shortening, lard, and a mixture of different fats.Butter pie crusts have a rich flavor, but butter is brittle when cold and softens quickly, so it can be hard to work with.
Shortening and lard make flakier crusts but tend to have a little less flavor.
Combine shortening with butter in equal amounts to combine the best of both worlds.

, You need to keep the pie crust cool throughout the entire process. If not, the butter, lard, or shortening could liquify and get absorbed by the flour instead of coating the flour, resulting in a tougher crust.

Keep the fat chilled before you make the dough.
Chill the dough for several hours after working with it.

, If you are preparing a baked pie, you do not usually need to pre-bake the crust. You will want to pre-bake a crust if you plan on pouring a no-bake filling into it, though.

Pierce the bottom of the crust with a fork in several places, preventing air pockets.
Line the crust with aluminum foil and place pie weights or dried beans inside.
Bake in a 400 degree Fahrenheit (200 degree Celsius) oven for 25 to 27 minutes, or until the entire crust turns golden brown.

, Many no-bake pies are traditionally pared with graham cracker crusts, and some baked pies use a graham crust, as well.

You can also make a crust with ginger snaps, vanilla wafer cookies, chocolate graham crackers, or any other dry cookie using the same instructions.
Combine the crumbs of 12 full-size graham crackers with 6 Tbsp (90 ml) melted butter.Press the coated crumbs into your pie dish.
Bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes in a 375 degree Fahrenheit (190 degree Celsius) oven until dry.

, A pie filling that falls into the custard family relies on eggs to create a thick, smooth texture that bakes into solid form in the oven.

The exact formula for a custard-based filling will vary from recipe to recipe, so there is no single guideline that can be provided. Common types of custard-type pies include custard pie and pumpkin pie.

, A cream pie also uses eggs, but unlike a thicker custard pie, the filling is usually prepared separately on the stove and whisked until airy.

As with custard pies, there is no single formula that can be provided for all cream pies. You will need to find and follow an exact recipe. Common cream pies include banana cream, coconut cream, and chocolate cream pies.

, Fruit fillings can be baked or unbaked, but the simplest fruit fillings are made without relying on any heat. All you need is a sweetener, a thickener, any spices you want, and the fruit of your choice.

Choose a fruit high in pectin, a natural substance that causes fruits to thicken when cooked with sugar. Popular choices include apples and blackberries. When working with fruits lower in pectin, like blueberries, cherries, and strawberries, you will need to add a thickener other than sugar.
Cornstarch and tapioca are the most popular thickeners to use for fruit fillings.
Sugar can also be added, but opt for naturally sweet fruits when possible and add 1/2 cup (125 ml) or less of sugar.
Most fruit fillings also use a few spices. Nutmeg pairs well with most berries, cinnamon is a common choice for apples, and cloves usually go with peaches and apricots.
A basic formula for fruit filling would be 4 to 6 cups (1000 to 1500 ml) chopped fruit, 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) cornstarch, 1/2 cup (125 ml) brown or white sugar, a pinch of lemon zest, a pinch of salt, 1/2 to 2 tsp (2.5 to 10 ml) spices, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) unsalted butter. Combine the ingredients and mix until thick., No-bake fillings are made from sweet fillings that do not need to be heated in order to solidify. Oftentimes, though, these fillings do need to be chilled for several hours to firm up.

Most no-bake fillings are prepared with some type of pudding, whipped topping, or combination of the two.
Consider making an ice cream filling. Ice cream fillings are especially easy since all you need to do is combine softened ice cream with your favorite mix-ins. Scoop the mixture into a graham cracker crust and freeze for several hours until the filling becomes solid enough to slice., Savory pies can be made for brunch, lunch, or dinner. They usually consist of cubed cooked meat, vegetables, and a thickened broth.

The exact recipe for a savory pie will vary depending on the types of meats and vegetables you use, but generally, you will work with roughly 2 cups (500 ml) cooked meat and 2 cups (500 ml) of chopped vegetables. You will also end up adding some form of liquid, which will be thickened with flour or another thickener upon baking.

, Some pies are left without a top layer of crust while others are covered to create a more unified, even appearance.

If you do cover the pie with another layer of crust, pinch the top layer onto the edges of the bottom layer using your fingers.
Top layers are usually used on fruit pies and savory pies but are not as common for custard or cream pies.

, Most pie crusts have some sort of decorative edge. The simplest edge is just a ruffle edge, but you do have a few other options.To create a ruffle edge, indent the edge of the crust at even intervals by pressing the tip of your index finger into the edge from the outside.
Create a scalloped edge by rolling the tip of a dinner spoon along the edge from the inside of the crust. Work at even intervals, and make sure that the scalloped cuts connect to one another.
Form a braided edge by cutting a second crust into 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) strips. Braid three of these strips at a time and press the braids along the edge of the crust.

, In addition to decorating the crust or covering the pie with a second layer of crust, you can cut decorative shapes out of additional pie crust dough to decorate the pie further.

Use small cookie cutters to cut shapes out of additional dough. Leaves are a common theme for autumn pies, for instance.
Press these shapes along the edge of the crust or onto a top layer of pie crust.

, Brushing an egg wash or melted butter over the crust can give it a deeper, richer color and make the crust glossier when done.

For a basic egg wash, lightly beat 1 egg yolk with 1 tsp (5 ml) of water. Brush this wash over the crust before baking.
To use butter, melt the butter and brush a little on before the pie bakes. Brush additional butter onto the crust as the pie bakes.

, If you want to give your pie a little sparkle and plan on using a top layer of pie crust, sprinkle granulated sugar or sanding sugar over the top of the pie crust before baking.

Usually, 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) sugar is enough.

, Meringue toppings are common on most cream pies. Meringue is made from egg whites and sugar.After you bake the pie and its filling, prepare your meringue.
Beat 3 egg white with a pinch of cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
Gradually add 1/4 cup (60 ml) white sugar to the mixture, working 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time. Continue beating until stiff peaks form.
Spread the meringue over the pie.
Bake the pie with the meringue for another 3 to 4 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) or until the meringue turns golden brown.

, If you are serving a no-bake pie, a more common topping would be whipped cream or a whipped cream substitute. You can usually use a tub of prepared whipped dessert topping, or you could make your own.

Make your own whipped cream by beating 1 cup (250 ml) heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla extract and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) confectioners sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form., Pecan pie filling is made from corn syrup, unsalted butter, sugar, eggs, and, of course, pecans., This classic is prepared with tart cooking apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar, among other ingredients., This rich pie can be prepared by mixing eggs, butter, sugar, and flour with walnuts, chocolate chips, and vanilla., Pumpkin puree needs to be mixed with eggs or evaporated milk to set it.

Store your apple puree in the refrigerator.",How to Make Apple Puree," You can use whatever kinds of apples you’d like for this recipe, although sweeter, less tart apples are typically better for baby food. Fuji and Gala apples are both sweet and cook great, and Granny Smith apples actually sweeten when you cook them.Although you’re going to be removing the peel from the apples, it’s best to wash them thoroughly first just so you start with a clean piece of fruit. After they are washed and dried, use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. If you don’t have a peeler, you can always use a knife.You can rinse your apples under water, or use a mixture of three parts water and one part vinegar. This will help to kill any bacteria on your apples.
You can use as many apples as you like for this recipe. One apple yields approximately five ounces of puree, so you can plan accordingly.;
, You don’t want to include the apple seeds and tough core in your puree. You can core your apple by using a tool made specifically for this task, which goes through the apple and removes the entire center. If you don’t have this tool, keep it simple and just use a knife.To remove the core with a knife, first cut your apple into slices. Then, grab each slice individually and trim off the tough part along the inner edge.
Your apple slices don’t need to look picture perfect. Just make sure you’ve successfully removed all of the core and seeds from the good “meat” of the apple.
Make sure you do this part slowly and carefully, to avoid cutting yourself on a sharp knife or apple coring tool.

, By chopping up your slices into small chunks, you’ll make it easier to eventually blend and mash together.Aim to cut your apple into pieces about the size of dice. Once you’ve washed, peeled, sliced, and chopped your apples, you’ve done all the prep work necessary for this recipe.

, Make sure you use a pot that is large enough to fit all of your apple chunks, enough water to cover them all, and enough extra space to allow the water to boil without spilling over. Dump all of your prepared chunks of apple into the pot, and then add enough water so that they are all submerged.You can use tap water or filtered water – whichever you prefer. Place a lid on top of your pot.

, Turn your stovetop on to medium heat. Make sure you stay close by your pot or check on its status regularly. As soon as the water begins to boil, you will be reducing the heat., After it reaches a boil, turn the heat on your stovetop down to low heat. Then, let it simmer uncovered for ten minutes. Set a timer or keep your eye on the clock to make sure you double-check them as soon as ten minutes have passed. Use a spoon to fish out an apple chunk and check it’s texture. You want the apple chunks to be soft enough that they will be mashed or blended easily.If the apples aren’t tender after ten minutes, continue checking them every five minutes until they are soft enough.
The longer your apples simmer, the more likely they are to lose precious vitamins. It’s best to remove them from the heat as soon as they are tender in order to preserve their health benefits.

, It is easiest to do this by pouring the contents of the pot into a strainer. If you don’t have a strainer, put the lid into the pot at an angle, leaving a small space for water to drain out while catching the apple chunks. Once you’ve drained all of the water from the pot, place it back down on a non-heated surface.

, If you skip this step, the apples will remain hot from the water. When they’re this hot, they will continue cooking and losing vitamins and minerals. By rinsing the apples with cool water, you will stop the cooking process and the apples will stay “as is.”, Use a potato masher to mash the tender apple chunks into the puree. If you don’t have a potato masher, you can use a large fork to do this, although you may end up with a chunkier puree. For a super smooth apple puree, feel free to put your soft apple chunks into a blender or a food processor.Many blenders have a ""puree"" setting, which is what you will use for this step. If your blender has speeds, use the fastest setting.For very young babies, you can add a bit of water to thin your puree as needed.

, This will keep it fresh for longer. When it is time to serve it to your baby, you can warm it in the microwave for a few seconds or simply serve it cold. You can also combine it with other fruit and vegetable purees to create delicious combinations.If you aren’t going to finish the puree within three days, pop it in the freezer. It can last in there for up to three months.

Consider filling the strawberries with a squirt of cream cheese or a chocolate chip.;
, You can slice your own fresh pineapple or use pineapple chunks from a can. Pineapple is a great way to add a little tart flavor to your dessert kabobs. Pineapple is a good fruit to consider grilling before or after assembling your dessert kabob.

Coconut and caramel flavors work well with pineapple.

, Choose bananas that are starting to show brown spots. Avoid bananas that have green stems (these won't be sweet enough) or have lots of brown spots (these may be too mushy). Slice the bananas into large chunks and thread them onto the skewers.

Try slicing a small banana in half lengthwise. Thread the entire half onto a kabob and then lay it flat. Add dessert ingredients on top of the banana split kabob.

, Berries are a good way to add unique sweetness and beautiful color to the dessert kabobs. Since they're small, you may want to thread 2 or 3 berries at a time onto the kabob. You could use:

Blueberries
Raspberries
Blackberries

, To make a classic strawberry shortcake dessert kabob, thread fresh strawberries and cubes of angel food cake. Since angel food cake has a mild flavor, it works with most fruits.For something a little richer, try cubes of pound cake.

, Bake a batch of your favorite brownies. You can then cut them into bite-sized pieces to slide onto the kabobs or use cookie cutters to cut out fun shapes. For example, use a star cookie cutter to make cute brownie stars for your kabobs.You can also purchase mini brownies and thread them directly onto the skewers.

, You can buy mini-cupcakes that are already frosted or just make a batch of your own. Slide a few mini-cupcakes onto the skewer alternating with fresh fruit. You can use several different flavors of cupcakes, so your guests can choose their favorite.For another bakery favorite, use donut holes in place of the mini-cupcakes. Look for chocolate covered, crunchy coated, or powdered sugar donut holes.

, If you're looking for a few inexpensive ingredients to use in your dessert kabobs, use marshmallows. You can use regular sized marshmallows or even thread miniature marshmallows. Keep in mind that marshmallows on dessert kabobs are easier to eat if they're not grilled.For a rich ingredient, use mini-cream puffs. Just defrost them according to the manufacturer's instructions and slide them onto the skewers.

, Mix up a batch of no-bake rice krispy treats or purchase them. Cut the treats into bite-sized cubes and insert them onto your dessert kebab skewers. You can also use fun cookie cutters to make shapes.Rice krispy treats work well with strawberries, bananas, and chocolate drizzle.

, If you plan on serving dessert kabobs to a small group, you may want to toss them on the grill for a few minutes. Only grill the dessert kabobs if you'll be using ingredients that would benefit from grilling. For example, you can grill:Strawberries
Pound cake
Pineapple
Bananas
Donut holes

, Make your favorite dessert sauces and place them in squeeze bottles. Once you've assembled your kabobs, gently drizzle the kabobs with the sauce. You can also purchase sauces, but you may need to thin them out with a little water in order to drizzle them. Try using:Chocolate sauce
Caramel sauce
White chocolate sauce
Raspberry sauce

, If you'd rather give your guests the option of dipping their dessert kabobs into sauces, set out several small bowls of dipping sauces. Just pay attention to which sauces (anything with dairy) will need to be refrigerated until you're ready to serve the kabobs. Set out small bowls of:Marshmallow fluff
Cream cheese dip
Flavored yogurt sauce
Lemon curd

, Once you've assembled and set out the kabobs, you may want to sprinkle them with a little garnish, especially if you're not drizzling them with a sauce. You can garnish the kabobs with your favorite sprinkles, flaked coconut, crushed nuts, or whipped cream.

Use several of these garnishes, so your guests are sure to find a dessert kabob that they'll enjoy.

Use crisp apples.,
Skin and slice your apples.,
Prevent oxidization.,
Pat your apples dry.,
Thicken your caramelized apples.",How to Make Caramelized Apples1," Make sure you select an apple that is strong enough to maintain shape as it caramelizes. Use varieties such as Braeburn, Fuji, Gala, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Jonagold, or Pink Lady. Avoid softer varieties, which may break apart during the cooking process and leave you with caramelized mush instead of apple slices., First, remove the skins. Then quarter your apples. Cut the core free from whichever quarter it clings to. Then slice the quarters into slices roughly a half-inch thick (1.2 cm.)If desired, cut the slices into cubes with half-inch sides.If you prefer even thinner slices, aim for a quarter-inch thickness.This should still be thick enough to handle without breaking them.

, Make sure your apples brown from cooking and not from exposing their flesh to the open air. If you expect a delay between slicing them and cooking them, prepare a bath of cold lemon water for the slices to soak in for 5 to 10 minutes.To make 8 ounces of lemon water, mix ½ cup lemon juice with 3 tablespoons of boiled water and then make up the difference with cold water., If you soaked your slices in a lemon-water bath, or if they appear to be excessively juicy, use a paper towel to softly soak up the moisture by gently patting them.Expect the addition of water to the hot, bubbling butter in your skillet to possibly cause the heated liquid to pop into the air. Reduce the risk of scalding yourself by minimizing the amount of added moisture the best you can.

, If you prefer your apples with a thicker syrup, use cornstarch to beef it up. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of water until the starch dissolves.

Cook the conches.",How to Prepare and Cook Conch,"


Conches should be white with pink and orange.
Do not buy conchs that appear gray.
Conches should not give off a fishy smell.;
,


If you have collected the conches yourself, you will need to remove the meat from the shell. If the conch is difficult to remove, drill a small hole in the top of the shell to break the suction and then it should be fairly easy to pull the conch out of the main opening of the shell.
Wash the conch in several changes of water.
Use only the muscle of the conches for food. The digestive gland must be removed for the meat to be safe.
Before you can cook conches, you must remove the operculum. The operculum is a shell-like covering that protects the conch and assists in locomotion. Cut it off with a knife.
If you are not using precooked conch meat, soak the conches in salty water for several hours.
Cut off any dark pieces of skin on the conchs.
Tenderize the conches by pounding it with a mallet until it is smooth and the thickness you want. This may not be necessary if you choose a longer cooking method for your conches.

,


Chemically ""cook"" raw conch in a ceviche by soaking it for a few minutes in lime juice with flavoring that you enjoy. Red onions, chile peppers and cilantro are traditional seasoning choices.
Bread the conches by dipping first in beaten egg and then in flour. Deep fry the breaded conchs until the flesh appears cooked. Cooking times will vary on the size of the pieces of conch meat you use.
Simmer conches in stews or soups for 1 hour.
Steam conches for about 5 minutes. Steamed conch is often served with vinegar.

You can also replace the milk with coconut milk, fish stock, or broth.

, Place two fillets of skinless fish in the pan with simmering milk. Each piece should be about 1/3 of a pound (150g). The milk should come about halfway up the sides of the fish. Continue to simmer the milk after you've added the fish and let it cook for 5 to 8 minutes.Try to select fillets of fish that are similar in size. This will ensure that they cook evenly.
You don't need to turn or flip the fish as it poaches. This could cause it to fall apart or overcook.

, Take a bamboo or metal skewer and insert it into the thickest part of the poached fish. The skewer should slide right in and be easy to remove. If it's hard to poke the skewer into the fish, it needs to poach a little longer. If you take a fork and gently rub it over the fish, the fish should flake.Let the fish cook for another minute and check it again. Fish cooks quickly so, check it frequently.

Select dry scallops.,
Determine if your scallops are wet or dry.,
Remove the side muscles.,
Blot the scallops.,
Heat the butter and oil.,
Add the scallops to the pan.,
Pan fry the scallops on both sides.,
Remove them from heat and serve.",How to Pan Fry Scallops," Ask at the seafood counter whether or not the scallops being sold are wet or dry. If they're wet, they've been treated with a chemical (sodium tripolyphosphate) that helps the scallops absorb moisture. Dry scallops haven't been treated so they're fresher, easier to sear, and have a sweeter, brinier taste.Avoid wet scallops since the chemical can make it hard to sear the scallops and the chemical leaves a fishy aftertaste.;
, If you're unable to talk with someone at the seafood counter and are purchasing pre-packaged scallops, you will still need to find out if the scallops are wet or dry. Most labels will clearly state if the scallops are wet or dry. But, if the label doesn't say, check the package for milky white liquid in the bottom. If you see this liquid and the scallops look opaque or really white, they're probably wet scallops.If you don't see any liquid and the scallops plump and clearer, they're most likely dry scallops.

, While some markets will remove the little flap of muscle that connects the scallop to its shell, others won't. Check over your muscles to make sure these little flaps are all removed since they can be tough. To remove the side muscle, simply pinch it and pull it away.You can throw away the side muscles or save them to make a fish stock. If you accidentally miss a side muscle, it's safe to eat.

, Take a paper towel and blot any excess moisture from the scallops. Season the scallops with a little salt before you're ready to start pan frying them. The salt can also help draw out extra moisture from the scallops.Try to get the scallops as dry as possible since this will help create a golden brown sear.

, Place the olive oil and butter in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. The butter should melt slowly. If it sizzles, turn down the heat a little. As soon as you see the butter begin to smoke, your pan is ready for the scallops.You could also use a stainless steel or cast iron skillet. Your pan should be large enough to hold all of your scallops in a single layer. Extra space will also help excess moisture cook off.

, Place the scallops in the pan starting at the edge and working in a circle. Make sure that you give them a little room when you place them in the pan. Avoid moving them once you've set them in the pan.Starting with the scallops in the edge of the pan will help them cook evenly since the scallops closer to the pan will cook faster.
If you run out of room in your pan, simply pan fry the scallops in two batches.

, Let the scallops pan fry over medium-high heat for 1 1/2 minutes. Do not turn them or move them around while they're cooking or they won't sear properly. After 1 1/2 minutes, use tongs to gently flip them over and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes undisturbed.You don't need to check the scallops for browning while they're cooking. Checking frequently can actually prevent them from developing a golden brown crust.

, After a total of 3 minutes cooking time, your scallops should be done. They should have about 1/4 inch of crust on both sides and be opaque in the center. Serve them immediately with the rest of your meal (like salad greens or pasta).If you hold the scallops on low heat while you prepare the rest of your meal, they can become tough and rubbery. This is why it's important to have other parts of your meal prepared and ready to serve.

Sterilize a glass jar.,
Separate the pen and the mantle.Hold the mantle in your non-dominant hand, then pinch the pen with the index finger and thumb of your opposite and.,
Cut away the tentacles.,
Clean the mantle.,
Slice the mantle into rings.,
Boil the water, salt, and one bay leaf.,

Store chilled.",How to Pickle Calamari," Wash each jar you plan to use with hot soap and water. Dry the jars thoroughly before proceeding.


You could towel dry the jars or allow them to air dry for about 8 hours. A better option, however, would be to dry the jars in an oven preheated to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius) for about 20 minutes. The low heat of the oven will help sterilize the jars further and will also ensure a thorough drying.






Note that the jar must be made of glass and must have a lid with an airtight seal. Never use aluminum, iron, copper, or other metals.






Make sure that the jar is large enough to hold all the prepared squid. A quart (liter) sized jar will likely work best, but one or two half-quart (half-liter) jars may work in a pinch.





;
, Gently pull the pen away from and out of the mantle.


The mantle is the large upper body of the squid, positioned just above the head. The pen is the transparent backbone inside the mantle.






When you first pinch the pen, you should feel it separate from the sides of the mantle.






As you pull the pen out of the mantle, the viscera (or organs) should come out, as well.







, Use a sharp knife and cut the tentacles off just beneath or in front of the eyes.


You will also need to squeeze the tentacles near the point of your cut to force the hard beak of the squid out.






Once the tentacles have been separated, you should throw out the beak, pen, head, and viscera.







, Strip away the membrane inside the mantle, then rinse the mantle with cold water to remove any remaining debris.


To remove the membrane, scrape the insides of the mantle with a small, sharp knife. Once the membrane has been loosened, you can peel it away with your fingers. Throw out the membrane after removing it.






Pat the rinsed mantle dry with clean paper towels.







, Use a sharp knife to cut the mantle into 3/8 inch to 1/2 inch (1 cm to 1.25 cm) wide rings.


Gather both the rings and the tentacles. Both can be pickled.







, Combine the three ingredients in a large saucepan and bring them to a boil over high heat.


You could also add other seasonings, like pepper, parsley, or rosemary. Note that these seasonings will not be packed with the squid, however, so it is best to wait until the pickling stage before adding most of your herbs and spices.






Even though other seasonings are optional, the addition of salt is crucial.







, Place the calamari rings and tentacles in the boiling water. Reduce the heat to medium and let the contents continue at a steady simmer for 5 minutes.After adding the squid, the boil will likely calm down. Allow the water to return to a rolling boil before reducing the heat and starting the timer.






You should wait until the squid looks cooked. The flesh of the calamari should look pink and feel tender when pierced with a fork.







, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a colander. Allow the squid to drain for a few minutes before continuing.


Let the excess water drip off. The squid should feel somewhat dry when you pack it in your pickling jar, but it does not need to be bone dry, so you do not need to dry it off with paper towels.






Do not rinse the calamari. Rinsing could wash off some of the salt and flavor embedded in the squid during the cooking process.







, Transfer the cooked squid rings and tentacles to your prepared jar.


The jar should be anywhere from halfway to three-quarters full. Do not pack the jar to the very top, however, since there will not be enough room for the spices and liquid if you do so.







, Place the remaining three bay leaves, black peppercorns, garlic, and oregano or rosemary in the jar. Pour the white vinegar on top.


While not strictly essential, you may want to toss the spices and squid gently inside the jar to spread the seasonings more evenly.






Pour enough vinegar over the contents of the jar to cover the squid completely. Make sure that there is at least 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.75 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar when finished, however.






White vinegar is used in this recipe, but you can experiment some with the pickling liquid. For instance, try white wine or white wine vinegar. The liquid you use must be acidic, though, so keep that in mind before you choose to experiment with another option., Slowly pour the oil on top of the contents in the jar. You should have a layer of oil that is roughly 3/4 inch (2 cm) thick.


The oil should float on top of the vinegar. It serves as another barrier against air and other contaminants.






Do not fill the jar to its brim. Always leave at least 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar, just in case the contents expand during refrigeration.






After adding the oil, place the lid on the jar. Make sure that the seal on the lid is secure and airtight.







, Place the sealed jar in your refrigerator and keep it there for a minimum of one day.For best results, allow the jar to sit in the refrigerator for a full week.


During this time, the pickling spices will marinate and flavor the calamari. The vinegar and remaining salt will be able to pickle the squid during this time, as well.






The longer you let the calamari rest, the stronger the flavor will be.







, To serve the pickled calamari, remove it from the marinade and serve it immediately. Pickled calamari tastes best cold.


There are different ways to enjoy pickled calamari. Try serving it as its own dish, with a garnish of lemon wedges and fresh parsley. You could also try pickled calamari on top of a Greek-style salad or alongside other appetizers on a cheese tray.







, Any pickled calamari you do not want to eat should be kept in its jar of pickling marinade and stored in the refrigerator.


For best results, eat the pickled calamari within 10 days after its initial marinating period. The dish may last up to one months, however.

First and foremost, if your oyster is open and doesn't close when disturbed, discard the stinker as it's dead and gone.,
Now, any heat source will open your oysters.,
Fire can be used as well, in a few different ways.,
Finished.

",How to Open Oysters With Heat,"  Dead shellfish quickly develop a toxic bacteria build-up.;
,  If you want to use boiling water, place oysters in a saucepan.  Notice that the oyster has a rounded half of it's shell and a flat half.  place the rounded half on the bottom of the pan and fill with water to a level just under the meeting point of the two shell halves.  Remove oysters, bring water to rolling boil and replace oysters carefully with long handled tongs. Cover.  It should only take 3-4 minutes for the oysters to open.

,  One technique, if you happen to be on the coast, is to build a fairly large fire and burn it until there is a good, hot coal base.  Then cover this coal base with a layer of seaweed (kelp is best).  You can then place the oysters on top and they should steam open.  Alternatively, scrape a place in the sand under the coals and place shellfish directly on the sand near the remaining coals.  A charcoal BBQ also works fine, and simply requires that you place the oysters on the grill.

Consider cutting shallow slits into the side of skin-on fish before seasoning and cooking it.,
Consider cutting large fish, such as salmon or tuna, into steaks for grilling.,
Consider cutting fish fillets into smaller pieces before pan frying them.,
Season fish fillets with oil, herbs, and spices before baking them.,
Season salmon lightly or heavily, depending on how you will serve it.,
Season tuna with olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs before baking it.",How to Prepare Fish1," If you are working with frozen fish, you might want to take it out of the freezer and let it thaw in the fridge. Do not let it thaw in the kitchen, or it may spoil., Gently massage the flesh to get rid of any watery residue or scales. Pat the fish dry, then season it with olive oil, herbs, or a marinade.

, Unlike cow, chicken, and other types of meat, fish soak up flavors quickly. Most fish only need to be marinated for 15 to 30 minutes; tuna can be marinated for up to 4 hours. Rinse your fish fillets or steaks, and pat them dry with paper towels. Soak them in your desired marinade and leave them in the fridge so that it does not spoil. Once they are done marinating, grill them.


If you are not marinating the fish, consider brushing on some olive oil along with your desired seasoning instead.

, This helps the flavors penetrate into the meat better., Chill your fish in the fridge or freezer until it is stiff. Cut the fish into ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) thick slices using a sawing motion. Trim away any belly fat or bones. If needed, peel away the skin.If you are making salmon, consider leaving the skin on. The skin will help hold it together while it grills. It comes off easily once the fish is cooked.

, Cut the fillet width-wise into four smaller pieces. This will make the fish easier to handle in the frying pan. For seasoning, try coating the fish with a mixture made from a beaten egg and water. Dip the fish into cornmeal or breadcrumbs seasoned with salt and pepper just before you toss it onto the frying pan.This is great for delicate fish, such as sole.

, Brush some oil or melted butter onto the fish; this will keep it moist. Next, add some dried herbs, such as basil, rosemary, dill, or thyme. You can also use spice blends, salt, pepper, or even minced garlic. A squirt of lemon is great for any type of fish., If you plan on serving salmon with a sauce, stick with a simple sprinkling or salt and pepper. If you don't plan on serving the salmon with a sauce (or are keeping the sauce optional) try the following seasonings:Sprinkle on some herbs, such as basil, dill, or thyme. These work great if you want to grill the salmon. Remember to brush on some olive oil before grilling it.
Add some minced garlic.
Try a seasoning blend. Look for something lemon, pepper, or herb-based, such as: garlic pepper, lemon pepper, or Italian.

, Brush some olive oil and lemon dress onto tuna and season it with salt and black pepper. For more flavor, sprinkle on some fresh herbs, such as rosemary or tarragon.Tuna works great with Asian marinates, such as teriyaki sauce.

, Try to get as close to the fish as possible. Leave the tail on for now., Run a fish scaler down the side, back, and belly of the fish. Always go against the scales, from the tail end towards the head. If you do not have a fish scaler, you can use the edge of a spoon or the back/top of a knife.As you are ""raking"" the fish, the scales will peel off. Keep raking until no more scales peel off.


Rinse the fish, if necessary, to get rid of any excess scales.
This may take a while for fish that have tiny scales.
De-scaling a fish can be messy. Consider working on top of a newspaper. This way, you can just crumple up the mess and toss it out when you are done.

, You will be cutting into the fish at a downward angle. Always cut from just behind the fin towards the head, but do not cut through the spine. These are the three cuts you will have to make:


Cut from behind the side fin down to the gills.
Flip the fish over and repeat the same cut on the other side.
Turn the fish onto its back. from the behind two underside/pectoral fins down to the throat.

, Grab the fish by the head with one hand and the body with the other. Quickly twist and snap the head off. Pull away any guts that come with it and discard them as well.

, Slip the tip of the knife into the ""vent"" or anal opening. Cut towards the head. Keep the cut shallow so that you don't pierce the guts. If you pierce them, you might taint the meat.

, Turn the fish onto its back and spread it open, like a book or hot dog bun. Pull the guts out and discard them. If you see a kidney near the backbone, use a spoon to scrape it out.

, Run the tip of your knife down the center of the fish, right where the backbone would be. This pierces the membrane and exposes the bloodline. Use a stiff-bristled brush to clean out the mess. You want to remove the bloodline because it can give the fish a bitter taste after you cook it.

, Gently massage the flesh to get rid of any guts or blood. Run your finger down the center of the fish, where the bloodline was.

, Lay the fish down on its side, and spread it open. Cut the vent out at an angle. Flip the fish over, and cut the other side of the vent out.

, Start at the tail. Hold the knife so that the blade is almost parallel to the cutting board, but at a slight downward angle. Peel the skin up and slide the blade between the skin and the flesh. Carefully saw the flesh away from the skin. It helps to pull the skin up and towards you as you go.


Some fish, especially bottom-dwelling fish, should be skinned. Other fish, such as salmon and trout, are often cook with their skin on.

, Hold the fish by the head with one hand and the body with the other. Snap the head off using a twisting motion. Pull out any guts that come with it and toss them out.

, Cut from the neck all the way down to the tail. Stick to one side of the back/dorsal fin. You will need to make at least two slices: the first one to pierce the skin, and the second to slice through the flesh. Keep going over the cut until you reach the bones and peel the meat away.

, Stick the knife into the slit and start sawing down towards the tail, keeping the knife between the flesh and the ribs. Try to cut all the way down to the belly. Stop when you are half-way to the tail.

, Place your hand on top of the fish and continue sliding the knife down towards the tail. Always the knife between the ribs and the flesh.

, Flip the fish over. Make another cut along its back, to the other side of its back/dorsal fin. Once you get to the bones, use your knife to slice the flesh away from the ribs.

, When you look down at the fillets, you may notice some skin and leftover guts, especially towards the belly. Trim around them using your knife. Toss the trimmed skin and guts out.


At this point, you can also discard the rest of the fish body, including the head, spine, and guts.

, The pinbones are small bones embedded into the fish fillet. If you run your finger horizontally down the middle of the fish, you may feel some sharp bumps. These are pinbones. It would by a good idea to remove them. There are two ways to do this:


Use some tweezers or pliers to pull the bones out, one by one.
Use your knife to cut a long slit to either side of the row of bones. Use your fingers to peel the strip away from the skin.

, Place the fish skin-side-down on the cutting board. Place the knife blade close to the tail. Cut at an angle away from you, keeping the knife between the skin and the meat. Use a sawing motion while pulling the tail towards you.

Look for Atlantic salmon.,
Choose fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Use the point system to limit mercury consumption.,
Eat a variety of fish.,
Skin and trim caught fish.,
Cook your fish on a rack.,
Use a food thermometer.,
Follow package instructions carefully.,
Serve appropriate portions.,
Check advisories before you go fishing.,
Limit fish consumption if you are pregnant or nursing.,
Consider taking supplements instead.",How to Maximize the Health Benefits of Fish," Atlantic salmon may be the best fish you can eat on a regular basis and it is considered safe to eat two to three servings per week.. Salmon is rich in Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. It also provides calcium to strengthen your bones, and minerals such as iron and potassium.Farmed salmon is plentiful, and available in any grocery store. There is some controversy about wild vs. farmed salmon — in the past, farm-raised salmon was considered to be inferior to wild, but it is becoming more accepted as a safe alternative to wild salmon. To find quality farmed fish, check with The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), which creates sustainability standards for shellfish and fin fish aquaculture worldwide and is responsible for improving the quality expected of farmers.Salmon also is a good source of lean protein. The minerals and nutrients in salmon are essential for strong bones and muscles.
A risk/benefit analysis by the Connecticut Department of Public Healthdemonstrated that eating salmon significantly lowers your risk of cardiovascular disease without any significant risk due to contaminants.;
, Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that strengthen your heart and improve your brain functioning, including decreasing the risk of depression, ADHD, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Since your body doesn't produce omega-3 fatty acids, you must get them through food.


Omega-3 fatty acids also especially important for infants, young children, and women who are pregnant or nursing. These nutrients aid in brain and nerve development.
While you can take omega-3 fatty acids in supplement form, your body absorbs them better if you get them through eating fish.
Salmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, as are other fatty fish such as herring, mackerel, oysters, sardines, tuna, and trout.

, Many fish carry mercury, which presents a significant health risk. The point system, based on data regarding the mercury content of fish compiled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can help you plan your fish meals over the course of a month.The risks from mercury in fish and shellfish depend on the amount of fish and shellfish eaten and the levels of mercury in the fish and shellfish. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are advising women who may become pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid some types of fish and eat fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury.
Generally, adults should eat fish meals containing no more than eight points in any given month.
Fish such as catfish, salmon, crab, scallops, pollock, tilapia, and trout are common fish that are only worth one point. They are very low in mercury.
On the other end of the scale, grouper, orange roughy, and marlin are worth eight points. If you eat these fish, you should only eat one fish meal that month to avoid consuming too much mercury.
Other common fish that are relatively low in mercury include cod, snapper, and tuna, which are worth two points. If you buy tuna, buy canned light rather than canned white or Albacore tuna, which have three times more mercury.
Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children should not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.

, Especially if you plan on eating fish more than once a week, variety ensures you won't get tired of eating the same thing all the time. This also helps you maximize the health benefits of your fish, since different species have different nutrients.Some fish, including shellfish, you shouldn't consume as often because of mercury and other contaminants. To keep your exposure under control, you have to plan your fish consumption.
Salmon generally is safe to eat two or three times a week, as is canned light tuna.
Other safe fish include anchovies and sardines, which you can easily add to a salad or other food such as pizza.
Keep in mind that if you eat the maximum safe amount of a certain type of fish in a week, this does not mean you can supplement with other types of fish. For example, you shouldn't eat three servings of salmon and a serving of lobster in one week.

, If you go fishing, or buy fish that aren't already skinned, make sure you skin them and cut away the fat. This lowers the fat content, which will make the fish healthier for you to eat. It also reduces the amount of potential contaminants in your meal.After you've removed all the skin, cut away all fat along the fish's back and belly.
Make a V-shaped wedge along the side of the fish to remove the dark fatty tissue and expose the healthy fillet.
Keep in mind that skinning and trimming the fish won't do anything to reduce mercury content; however, it will protect you from other contaminants that may exist in the waterway where the fish was found.

, Baking or grilling your fish generally is the most healthy way to cook it, although fish is often fried. Whichever way you choose, put your fish on a rack that allows the fat to drip off and away from the fish as it cooks.Allowing the fat to drip away will make your fish a leaner meal. It also protects you from soil and water contaminants that may have been in the waterway where the fish was found.
Dispose of the drippings promptly. Don't use them in sauces or gravies. Apart from being full of fat that will decrease the health benefits of your fish, they also may contain harmful contaminants.

, Whatever method you use to cook your fish, it should reach an internal temperature of at least 145°F (62.8°C) before you eat it. You can buy a food thermometer at any discount or home goods store to measure the temperature of your fish.If you don't have a food thermometer, check your fish carefully to make sure it's completely cooked before you eat it.
Regardless of the temperature, your fish should be opaque and easy to separate with a fork. If it still looks clear or shiny, you need to cook it longer.

, If you buy frozen fish, you'll find cooking instructions on the box. Make sure you don't deviate from these instructions, or you could expose yourself to unwanted contaminants and other health dangers.If you're baking, poaching, broiling, or grilling your fish, cook it at least 10 minutes for each inch of thickness. For example, if you're baking a half-inch thick salmon filet, you would cook it for at least five minutes.
If your fish is frozen, you generally should double that time, unless the instructions on the box tell you differently.
Even if you microwave your fish, it's still important to check it and make sure it's cooked thoroughly and to the appropriate temperature.

, Generally, one serving of fish is about the size and thickness of your hand. You also can measure the appropriate serving size by apportioning one ounce of fish for every 20 pounds of body weight.


For example, for a 160-pound adult, the appropriate serving would be 8 ounces of fish.
Typically a 6- to 8-ounce serving will be fine for adults, regardless of their body size. A serving half that size would be appropriate for children.

, If you plan to go fishing and eat the fish you catch, review advisories that apply to the locations where you're going. In the U.S., you typically can find a list of these advisories at the website of your state's fishing and wildlife department.Many lakes, rivers, and streams are contaminated with pollutants that, if ingested, can actually increase your risk of contracting certain diseases.
This contamination can negate any of the health benefits you'd enjoy from eating fish generally.
Take particular caution if you are fishing in a lake or stream located near an active or formerly active factory or industrial site. These contaminants remain in sediment for years and can affect the quality of the water as well as the fish that live there.
Catch and eat smaller, younger fish. They have experienced less contamination by their environment than larger, older fish.

, If you're pregnant or nursing, it isn't necessary to completely eliminate your consumption of fish. In fact, you need nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids that are found in fish.However, you should be more careful about the types of fish you eat and how often you eat fish if you are pregnant or nursing.
Eating fish with high levels of mercury can cause significant developmental problems for your child.
Fish that are safe for expecting or nursing mothers and small children include salmon, pollock, and shrimp. Most ocean fish don't have high levels of mercury and are safe to consume.
Try to eat fish only once or twice a week, and buy your fish commercially rather than catching it yourself from local lakes, streams, or rivers.

, Both fish oil and Vitamin D, which you would get from eating fish, are available in supplements. If you don't like the taste of fish, or are concerned about contaminants in fish, you might want to take these supplements.Fish oil supplements, such as cod liver oil, may contain even more Vitamin D than a fish meal. If you want to maximize your health benefits, you may consider taking supplements even if you consume fish on a regular basis.
Keep in mind that fish oil supplements contain no mercury, so they are safe for pregnant or nursing mothers, children, and others who are concerned about mercury levels.

Garnish with chocolate curls.",How to Make a Lemon Cream Pie," Lemon cream pie doesn’t get baked, so the graham cracker pie crust must be baked separately so it will hold its shape. Preheat the oven to 350 F (177 C).;
, Break the graham crackers into quarters and transfer them to a food processor. Pulse the food processor for about a minute, until the graham crackers have been crushed into coarse crumbs. Nine crackers will give you about 1½ cups (128 g) of graham cracker crumbs.You can also crush the crackers in a bag if you don’t have a food processor. Transfer the graham crackers to a sealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and roll over the crackers with a rolling pin until they're crushed to crumbs.

, Transfer the graham cracker crumbs to a bowl. Add the sugar, salt, and melted butter. Stir the mixture together to combine all the ingredients.


The mixture should have a crumbly texture, and small clumps of graham cracker crumbs should stick together.

, Pour the mixture into a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate. Use your hands or the bottom of a cup to press the mixture firmly and evenly into the pie plate. Spread the mixture so it’s covering the bottom and sides of the dish.Make sure the graham cracker crumbs are spread out evenly, otherwise the pie shell won’t be uniform.

, Transfer the shell to the oven. Bake the shell for nine minutes. Remove the shell from the oven and set it aside to cool for at least an hour. To help it cool faster, place the entire pie plate on a metal cooling rack.The pie shell must be fully cooled before you add the filling, otherwise the filling will heat up and won’t set.

, The heavy cream in this recipe gets whipped before added to the pie filling. For the lightest and fluffiest whipped cream, chill a glass or metal bowl and the hand mixer beaters in the fridge for at least an hour before whipping the cream.If you're pressed for time, chill the beaters in the freezer for at least 20 minutes.

, Crack the eggs into a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the sugar and lemon zest. Whisk the mixture until the ingredients are all combined and the eggs are smooth. Whisk in the lemon juice. Add the butter and heat the mixture over medium heat. Whisk constantly as the mixture heats, and don’t let it boil.


The curd is ready when it becomes thick and smooth. This will take between seven and nine minutes., When the curd is thick and cooked, remove it from the heat. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a medium mixing bowl. Pour the mixture into the strainer. Use a rubber spatula to push the curd through the strainer and into the bowl.


Once strained, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the curd in the fridge for at least three hours.

, Remove the chilled bowl, beaters, and heavy cream from the refrigerator. Pour the cream into the bowl. Beat the cream with the hand mixer on medium speed. Beat for six to seven minutes, until soft peaks begin to form.As an alternative to the whipped cream, you can use 12 ounces (339 g) of softened creamed cheese in this recipe instead. The cream cheese will produce a heavier and even richer pie filling., Remove the lemon curd from the refrigerator and remove the plastic wrap. Carefully pour the whipped cream into the lemon curd. Fold the whipped cream in with a rubber spatula until the two are fully combined.It’s important to fold in the whipped cream gently with a rubber spatula rather than vigorous stirring, because you don’t want to break the air bubbles making the cream fluffy and light.

, Transfer the pie filling to the cooled graham cracker pie shell. Scrape the sides of the bowl with the rubber spatula. Use the spatula to spread the filling evenly around the pie shell and smooth out the top., Cover the pie with a piece of plastic wrap. Transfer the pie to the refrigerator and let it set for at least six hours. You can make this pie a full day in advance. Leave the pie chilling in the fridge for up to 24 hours before serving.When you're ready to serve the pie, garnish it with your favorite toppings and cut the pie into six or eight even slices.

, To make a whipped cream garnish for lemon cream pie, chill the bowl and beaters in the freezer for 20 minutes. Pour a cup (235 ml) of heavy cream into the bowl, along with a tablespoon (14 g) of granulated or castor sugar and a teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla.Beat the whipped cream for eight to nine minutes on medium speed, until stiff peaks form.


To garnish the pie, you can either spread the whipped cream over the pie before slicing, or you can garnish each piece with a dollop before serving.

, Lemon flavored treats pair very well with fruit, and serving this pie with fresh fruit makes it the ideal summer dessert. You can layer the fruit onto the pie before you cut it, you can garnish the plate with some fruit, or you can sprinkle some fruit onto each piece before serving. Good fruit choices to pair with lemon cream pie include any combination of:Raspberries
Blueberries
Sliced kiwi
Sliced strawberries
Blackberries

, Candied citrus peel is a zesty and sweet treat that’s often used as a garnish for cakes, ice cream desserts, muffins, and other baked goods. To garnish the lemon cream pie, slice and plate the individual pieces, and sprinkle each piece and the plate with candied citrus peel. Any citrus peel would work with this pie, including:


Lemon
Orange
Grapefruit
Lime

, Fruit and chocolate is a classic combination, and this includes lemon, which can be paired well with either white or dark chocolate. Slice and plate each piece of pie. Hold a block of white or dark chocolate over each piece of pie, and use a vegetable peeler to shave curls off the chocolate and onto the pie.You can also use a cheese grater to garnish the pie pieces with chocolate shavings.

Get out a 9-inch (22 cm) springform pan. Spread a little butter around the inside of the pan.Ensure that you spread butter along the sides as well as the bottom of the pan.;
, Place 9 full sheets of graham crackers (from about 1 sleeve) into a food processor. You may need to break them up a bit so they fit. Add 6 tablespoons (85 g) of melted butter, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 pinch of salt. Pulse the ingredients until they're crumbly and combined.

Press the mixture with your fingers. The crust mixture should hold its shape once it's well combined., Scoop the crust mixture into the buttered springform pan. Use your fingers or the bottom of a cup to press it evenly across the bottom of the pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes or until it's golden and smells fragrant.Let the crust cool completely before you fill it with the cheesecake filling.

, Wipe the inside of the food processor to remove any graham cracker crumbs. Place 4 8-ounce packages (900 g) of room temperature cream cheese, 1 1/4 cups (250 g) of sugar, and 1 cup (230 g) of sour cream in the processor. Pulse the mixture until it's completely combined, smooth, and creamy.You may need to wipe down the sides a few times so that the cream cheese is completely incorporated.

, Let 6 large eggs come to room temperature and crack them into the cream cheese mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and pulse the food processor to combine the ingredients. Spread the cheesecake filling into the cooled graham cracker crust.It's important to bring the eggs to room temperature. Cold eggs could cause the cream cheese to separate, causing lumps.

, Tear off a large piece of aluminum foil and set the cheesecake on the foil. Fold the foil up and along the sides of the springform pan to create a seal. Set the sealed cheesecake into a roasting pan. Carefully pour in hot water until the water is halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan. Just ensure that the water doesn't go higher than the foil.The roasting pan needs to be at least 10-inches wide so the cheesecake fits. It also needs to be at least 3-inches deep.

, Place the cheesecake in the water bath in the preheated oven. Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour and 10 minutes or until it sets on the edges. The center of the cheesecake will jiggle a little bit when you carefully wiggle the pan a bit. You may need to bake the cheesecake for up to 1 hour and 20 minutes if it's still uncooked.Don't worry if the cheesecake cracks while it's baking. You'll cover it with the pecan pie topping so the crack won't be visible.

, Leave the cheesecake in the water bath in the oven, but turn the heat off. Keep the door closed and let the cheesecake cool slowly in oven so that it finishes cooking. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven for one more hour.Letting the cheesecake cool in the oven will also make it easier to remove the water bath.

, Remove the cheesecake and water bath from the oven. Lift the cheesecake up and out of the water bath. Set the cheesecake on a cooling rack and run a knife around the edge of the cheesecake. Let the cheesecake cool on the rack until it's at room temperature. You can top the cheesecake with the pecan pie topping or store it until you're ready to serve it.To store the cheesecake, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for up to 2 days.

, Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Get out a rimmed baking sheet and spread 1 cup (125 g) of pecans across the sheet. When the oven is hot, place the sheet in the oven and toast the nuts for about 15 minutes. You should be able to smell the nuts and they should be darker.Let the toasted pecans cool while you make the caramel sauce. You can halve or chop the pecans before you use them.

, Put a small saucepan on the stove and add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of heavy cream, 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon of light corn syrup, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 pinch of salt. Stir the sweet cream mixture and heat it over medium heat. The liquid should just start steaming when it's ready to add to the caramel.Keep the sweet cream mixture warm while you make the caramel. Just turn the heat down to low.

, Place 1/2 cup (115 g) of granulated sugar in a large skillet so that the sugar is spread evenly. Turn the heat on to medium and let the sugar melt, but ensure that you don't stir the sugar. You can lift the handle of the skillet to gently swirl the sugar as it starts to caramelize. Cook the caramel until it turns golden brown. Turn off the heat.If you stir the sugar, it will melt unevenly and make a lot of lumps that won't smooth out.

, Slowly whisk the warm cream into the caramel and turn the caramel sauce up to medium heat. Use caution since the caramel may bubble a lot when you add the cream. Cook the caramel for 2 minutes so that it thickens a little. Turn off the heat and let it cool.To test whether or not the sauce is ready to use, dip a spoon in the sauce. It should slowly bead up and fall of the spoon if it's ready.

, Scoop the pecan pie topping in the center of the cheesecake. Spread it around with a spoon or offset spatula to evenly distribute the caramel sauce. Let the topping spill over the sides of the cheesecake. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the top of the cheesecake. Slice and serve the pecan pie cheesecake or chill it for up to 4 hours.To make it easier to slice, dip your sharp knife into a glass of warm water. Wipe the blade of the knife dry and slice the cheesecake. Warming the blade will make it easier to cut into the cheesecake.

, Make sure that the graham crackers are finely ground first; they should be the same texture as the ground pecans. Stir everything together with a rubber spatula until the mixture is damp and evenly combined.

You can easily grind the graham crackers in a blender or food processor. You can also put them into a plastic bag and smash them with a rolling pin.

, Pack the crust down using your fingers. When you are done, place the pan into the fridge so that it can set while you prepare the filling.

, You can do this by hand in a mixing bowl, but a food processor or electric mixer will speed up the process.

, Keep mixing until everything is blended together. There should be no streaks or swirls of egg yolk.

Finally, place the second cake layer on top of the cheesecake., A ""crumb coat"" is a very thin coat of frosting. It helps lock in the crumbs and make it easier to apply the second, thicker layer of frosting. Use a long, thin, cake decorating spatula to apply a thin layer of frosting to the sides and top of the cake.

Wipe the spatula clean each time before scooping up more frosting. This prevents any crumbs from getting into the frosting., Once you have your first, thin coat of frosting, place the cake into the fridge. Leave it there for 30 minutes. This will set the frosting and keep it in place during the next step., Once the crumb coat has set, take your cake out of the fridge. Place a large dollop of frosting on top of the cake, then spread it around using a cake decorating spatula. Once the top is covered, spread the frosting down the sides of the cake., You can add some texture to the cake by taping the sides with a spoon.

When the boba start floating, turn the heat to medium.,
Sweeten to taste, and eat alone or with cream.,
Use immediately.",How to Cook Tapioca1," Keep stirring! You don't want the boba to stick to the bottom of the pan. And be sure to keep a 8:1 ratio of water to boba; in other words, if you have 1/4 cup of boba, use 2 cups of water. Only need 1/8 cup? Then 1 cup of water will suffice.


Some recipes call for pre-soaking your boba. This depends on the brand and type of pearls you've bought. Some will start disintegrating in the soak, while others might benefit from it. If you can, buy boba that only has one ingredient: tapioca. Those are the best quality, soak or no soak.;
, Continue cooking the boba for another 12-15 minutes, stirring every 5 or so. When the time is up, remove the pan from heat, cover, and let the boba steep for another 15 minutes.

, Boba can be enjoyed by themselves, but they're also a great addition to just about anything, though the first image that pops into mind is tea.


If you're looking to make bubbles for bubble tea, create a simple syrup for the bubbles to soak in. 1/2 cup boiling water with 1/2 cup sugar will create a sweet gel for them to sop up more flavor., Boba are best within a few hours. Place them in your simple syrup, if need be, in the fridge and let cool for about 15 minutes. That should be just the right amount of time to gain some sweetness and yet still have the right consistency. Or just eat them when they're cool out of the pan!

For an extra touch, mix some finely crumbled Oreo cookies (the texture of coffee grounds) into the whipped cream first. Apply the whipped cream with a spatula.If the frosting is too sweet for you, add a pinch of salt to it. This will help cut the sweetness.

, You need enough to cover the entire top of your cake. How thick that layer is depends entirely on your preference. Use a food processor or a blender to grind the cookies into a fine dust., If you'd like, you can also press some into the sides of the cake as well. You can do this by cupping your hand, filling it with crumbs, and then gently pressing it against the side of the cake. When you are done, sweep any excess crumbs off the plate.

, Use a star-shaped decorating tip for the bag.You can also use a can of whipped cream instead—the type that you spray out of a nozzle., If you have any whipped cream leftover, you can add another small dollop of it in the center of the cake.

Aim to have about 16 dollops. This way, each dollop will get topped with one Oreo cookie.

, Be careful not to break them. You can also use mini Oreo cookies instead; this way, you won't have to cut them., If you don't have enough cookies, simply cut some more. These will serve as a guideline for cutting: each slice will get one cookie-topped dollop of whipped cream.

If you put some whipped cream in the center, top it off with another Oreo cookie.

, If you like your cheesecakes nice and cool, leave it in the fridge for 30 to 60 minutes. This will also help the whipped cream topping to set and harden."

In a medium saucepan, bring the milk, tapioca, sugar, and salt to a boil.,
Whisk 1 cup of the milk mixture into the beaten eggs, 2 tablespoons at a time.,
Simmer the pudding over medium-low heat.,
Take your pudding off the stove and stir in the vanilla.",How to Cook Tapioca2," Stir it constantly over medium heat. Once it hits a boil, reduce the heat to low, stir, and cook 5 minutes longer.


If you don't have the quick-cooking kind of tapioca, you can soak your tapioca overnight in water. Then throw this mixture into a slow cooker for 2 hours to get the tapioca to the right consistency.

, Keep whisking until it's fully combined. Then, stir the egg-milk-tapioca mixture back into the rest of the tapioca until it's well mixed.

, Once it's simmering, cook it, stirring regularly, for a couple of minutes longer until the pudding becomes thick enough to evenly coat the back of your spoon. Basically, when it starts looking like pudding.

, Then it's ready to go! It can be served hot or poured into serving dishes and refrigerated several hours until cold. Garnish it with whipped cream, pistachios, walnuts, or raisins if desired.


You can keep a skin from forming on top if you press plastic wrap onto the surface while chilling. And it won't dry out!
If the pudding's too stiff when serving, add a bit of milk or cream to make it be more palatable.

Use as a thickener.,
Stir into jams and jellies.,
Make bubble tea.,
Use it as substitute.",How to Cook Tapioca3," The possibilities are nearly endless: tapioca can thicken everything from pie fillings to soups and stews. And as for desserts, it can keep them fluffy without adding too much extra sugar and carbs. Just make sure to allow the tapioca time to soak in the flavor of whatever dish you're adding it to.


Quick-cooking tapioca is ideal for an addition to these dishes. Old-fashioned tapioca has a starker flavor that might end up contrasting with the flavor you're intending for.

, If you'd like to add an interesting twist to your jam or jelly, tapioca is where it's at. It can absorb the fruity sweetness and add interesting texture and volume. Add in the tapioca near the end of your cooking cycle so the tapioca doesn't overcook but yet still retains flavor.

, Because who doesn't love bubble tea? It's like eating and drinking your meal all at once, which is totally killing two birds with one stone. It's cheaper and healthier when you make it yourself, too!

, Turns out quick-cooking tapioca can serve as a substitute for cornmeal or flour. The ratio for cornstarch is 1:1, but the ratio for flour is 2:1; that is, 2 parts tapioca to 1 part flour. For diet restrictions and taste preferences, this can be quite the lifesaver!

Next, use foil to line a 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) baking dish and spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray.Make sure that the foil goes all the way up the sides the pans so it can serve as handles to lift the cheesecake out when it’s done baking.;
, For the Oreo cheesecake bites, you’ll need a 14.3 ounce (405 g) package of Oreos. Place 24 of the cookies in a food processor and grind them up into fine crumbs.If you don’t have a food processor, you can place the cookies in a plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin or other heavy object.

, When the Oreos are crumbled, add them to a large bowl. Mix in 5 tablespoons (71 g) of melted butter, and stir until they are fully combined.The easiest way to melt the butter is in the microwave. Place it in the microwave-safe bowl, and heat it in the 10 second intervals, stirring well after each. Continue heating the butter until is fully melted.

, Once the Oreo crumbs and butter are combined, use clean hands to press it into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Make sure to press hard so the crust is firmly compacted., When the crust is in the pan, place it in the preheated oven. Let the crust bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until it is just set.Be careful not to overbake the crust because it will bake further with the filling.

, When the crust is finished baking, remove the baking dish from the oven. Let the crust cool for about 15 minutes while you prepare the filling., The filling doesn’t need as high a temperature to bake as the crust does, so it’s important to adjust the oven temperature. Lower it to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius) so it can cool off while you prepare the filling., Add 2 8-ounce (226 g) packages of cream cheese and ½ cup (100 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Use a handheld electric mixer to beat the two together on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take approximately 3 minutes.You can use a stand mixer to prepare the filling if you prefer.
You can also mix the filling by hand, but it will take a little longer.

, Lower the mixer’s speed to low, and add in ¼ cup (58 g) of sour cream, 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla, 1 tablespoon (9 g) of all-purpose flour, and ½ teaspoon (2 g) of salt. Beat together until the ingredients are just incorporated.If you prefer, you can substitute vanilla Greek yogurt for the sour cream.

, Use a knife to roughly chop the remaining cookies from the Oreo package. Add them to the filling mixture, and use a rubber spatula to gently fold them in until they are fully incorporated.Make sure that the Oreo pieces aren’t too big; they should resemble rough crumbs.

, When the filling is just combined, add it to the prebaked crust. Use a rubber spatula to spread the filling so it sits in an even layer on the crust., Once the filling is spread over the crust, place the baking dish in the preheated oven. Allow the cheesecake to bake 35 to 45 minutes until the center is almost set.It’s normal for the cake to still be slightly jiggly when you remove it from the oven.

, When the cheesecake is finished baking, remove it from the oven. Place it on a wire cooling rack, and allow it to cool completely, which should take 20 to 30 minutes., Once the cheesecake has cooled, cover the baking dish with plastic wrap. Place it in the freezer, and allow the cake to chill until it is completely firm, which should take at least 3 hours.You can prepare the cheesecake the day before and freeze it overnight if you prefer.

, When the cheesecake is completely firm, remove it from the freezer. Lift it out of the baking dish using the foil on the sides, and use a sharp knife to cut the cheesecake into 36 bite-size squares.It helps to run the knife under hot water before you cut the cold cheesecake.

, After you’ve cut the cheesecake into squares, place them on a platter. Cover it with plastic wrap, and return them to the freezer for 10 minutes to chill., To coat the cheesecake bites, you’ll need 16 ounces (480 g) of chocolate. Place it in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat it at medium power for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir the mixture every 30 seconds, though, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.You can use any type of chocolate that you like to coat the bites, including milk, semisweet, or white chocolate.

, After you dip the bites, you’ll need a spot to place them until they set. Use parchment paper to line a large cookie sheet so the bites won’t stick even as the chocolate hardens.You can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper.

, When the chocolate is completely melted, use a fork to lower the squares into it one at a time. Move them around to ensure that they are coated on all sides, and lift out, allowing any excess to drip back into the bowl. Repeat until all of the squares are coated.When the bites are coated, set them down on the lined cookie sheet.

, Once you’ve covered all of the Oreo cheesecake bites, place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator. Allow them to chill for 20 to 30 minutes or until the chocolate is fully set. Place the bites on a platter, and serve.Store any leftover cheesecake bites in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Stir the ingredients and add 1 3/4 cups (400 g) of very cold and cubed butter. Use a fork or pastry cutter to combine the butter so that the mixture looks like coarse breadcrumbs. Mix in 3/4 cup (180 ml) of ice water, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) at a time. Stop adding water once the pastry dough starts to come together in a large ball.If you add too much water, the dough will become sticky and hard to handle.;
, Cut the ball of dough in half so you have two even pieces of dough. Flatten each piece a little and form it into a disk about 1-inch thick. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap so it's completely sealed. Refrigerate both of the disks for at least 2 hours before you roll it out. You can chill it up to five days.If you want to make the apple slab pie with the crumble topping, you'll only need to use one of the disks. You can freeze the remaining disk to use for another pie.

, Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 C). Peel, core, and chop 4 to 5 pounds of apples so you end up with 10 cups. Put these in a large mixing bowl and stir them with the other filling ingredients. You'll need:2/3 cup (135 g) of sugar
1/4 cup (31 g) of flour
2 tablespoons (30 ml) of fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg

, Remove the chilled pastry disks from the fridge. Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a rectangle. It should be 18x13-inches in size. Lay the pastry in the bottom of a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. There should be dough hanging over the sides of the pan. Roll out the other disk as well and set it aside.Turn the pastry rectangle as you roll it so it doesn't stick to your work surface.
Roll out the top pastry disk into another 18x13-inch rectangle.

, Scoop the spiced apple filling onto the pastry in your jelly roll pan. Spread it so that evenly covers all of the pastry dough. Gather the remaining rectangle of rolled pastry dough and place it on top of the filling. Pinch together the edges in order to seal them. Cut a few slits in the top of the apple slab pie and brush the beaten egg over the pastry. Sprinkle coarse sugar over the top, if you like.The slits will help steam escape as the pie cooks. This will prevent the pastry from becoming soggy.

, Instead of using a pastry crust topping, you could use a crumble topping. Mix together the crumble ingredients and cover the apple filling with it. You'll need to mix together:1 cup (90 g) of quick-cooking rolled oats
1 cup (200 g) of packed brown sugar
1/2 cup (65 g) of flour
1/2 cup (110 g) of diced butter
1/2 cup (65 g) of chopped pecans

, Put the apple slab pie in the preheated pie and bake it for 40 to 45 minutes. The crust should turn golden brown. You should also see filling bubbling around the sides and through the slits of the pie when it's cooked. Use oven mitts to carefully remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least an hour.Cooling the pie will make it easier to cut. If you cut the pie while it's still hot, the filling may spill out of the crust.

, You can make the glaze while the pie cools. Place 3/4 cup (90 g) of sifted confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of pure maple syrup, and a few teaspoons of milk or heavy cream in a small bowl. Use a fork or a whisk to combine the glaze. Drizzle the glaze over the apple slab pie before you're ready to serve it. Cut the pie into squares and serve them.If you want the glaze to harden, drizzle it over the pie once it's completely cooled. Drizzling it over a warm pie will make the glaze soak into the pastry.
You can store and refrigerate the leftover pie in an airtight container for three to four days.

Purchase ready-made pie crusts at your local supermarket if you don’t have time to make dough at home.,
Opt to make the pie crust from scratch at home.,
Measure the width of your pie dish with a measuring tape.,
Split the dough into two equal sections.,
Roll out your second half of the dough into a rectangle.,
Wash a plastic ruler.,
Decide if you want to cut your crust ribbons into three-fourth’s inch (1.9 cm) widths or half-inch (1.3 cm) widths.,
Cut a small slit every half-inch or three-fourth’s inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) across the width of the pastry rectangle.,
Turn the ruler 90 degrees.,
Realign the ruler with each slit.,
Lift the parchment paper carefully onto a cookie sheet.,
Remove the lattice strips from the refrigerator.,
Lay ribbons horizontally across the diameter of the pie.,
Work one side at a time.,
Unfold the strips back down over the center strip.,
Fold back every other strip, using the strips you left last time.,
Repeat folding back half the horizontal strips, placing a vertical strip of dough across the pie and unfolding the strips until you reach the right edge of the pie.







,
Turn the pie 180 degrees and repeat with the unwoven side.,
Pinch the point where the bottom crust meets the end of the lattice with your thumb and index finger.,
Cut along the outside edge of the pie plate with a pastry wheel or pizza cutter.








,
Mix one egg with 1 tbsp.",How to Lattice a Pie," Buy them in circles or sheets that you can roll out, rather than already set in a foil pie pan.;
, Remember to make a double batch if your recipe only makes one 12-inch (30.5 cm) pie crust base.

, When you cut your ribbons, the dough will need to be rolled at least this wide.








, Roll out the first section into a 12-inch round. Set it into your pie plate and ensure it extends past the top edge of the ceramic or glass plate.









Dough that is slightly cooled in the refrigerator will be easier to roll and cut.

, Roll it onto a piece of parchment paper, so that you can pick it up easily later. Aim for one-eighth-inch (0.3 cm) thickness.








Using a rectangle instead of a circle will allow you to make all the strips long enough to reach across the diameter of the pie. You can cut off extra after you have woven it.
Make sure to flour your parchment paper before rolling out the dough with a rolling pin.

, You can use it to help you create straight ribbons. Set the ruler across the shorter side of your pie dough rectangle, at the center.







, The smaller the ribbons, the more you can make and the tighter the lattice will be. You may way to start with thicker ribbons on your first lattice pie.








, Use a paring knife. Continue until you get to the other side.








, Align it with the first slit. Cut across the long side of the rectangle, across the edge of the ruler, with a pie cutter or pastry wheel.









A fluted pastry wheel will make wavy ribbons for your lattice., Repeat until your whole pastry dough is cut into ribbons.








, Place it inside the refrigerator while you fill your pie crust. Slightly cooled strips will be easier to handle.









When you fill the pie crust, try to mound it slightly in the middle. It will even out as the pie bakes and keep the center from falling.
Now is a good time to preheat your oven according to your pie recipe.

, Place them next to the filled pie.

, Lay them parallel to each other with one-fourth to three-fourth’s inch (0.6 to 1.9 cm) space in between. The closer you set them together, the more work you will need to do to weave the pie.









It is important that you space all the strips an equal amount away from each other. For example, if you choose to set them close together, at one-fourth-inch, the vertical and horizontal strips should be spaced one-fourth inch apart.

, Fold back every other ribbon, until the ends of the dough meet on the left side. Grab a new pie ribbon and lay it vertically in the center of the pie.







, You have begun to weave the dough.








, This time they will only fold back until they catch on the parallel strip you just laid. Place another strip of dough to the right of the last strip.









Make sure it is evenly spaced.
Unfold the strips and lay them flat.

,, When you finish weaving your lattice, you should have strips of dough hanging over the edges around the entire pie.

",How to Make a Caramel Brownie Cream Pie," Collect your ingredients accordingly.


If you’re using a box brownie, you’ll probably also need a couple eggs, some vegetable oil, and some water (generally). You may use the back of the box for this step! If you’re making brownies from scratch, there are a range of recipes available. The subsequent steps explain one of the options!;
,,,,,, Remember that flour is light, so you should not stir in all of the flour at once. Start with 1/2 cup, then 1/2 cup, then 1/4 cup to make sure you don’t lose any flour.

, If you would like to use baking powder instead of baking soda, use about ½ teaspoons of baking powder.

,,,,,, While the brownie is still warm, use the bottom of a wooden spoon to poke small holes into the brownie.


You may make as many or as few holes as you want. Ideally, do about 35 holes, 5 down and 7 across.

, Put your 30 pieces caramel, ¼ cup of milk, and 1/8 stick of butter or margarine into a pan on put it over low heat until smooth.

, You may also heat the caramel up in the microwave, putting it in for 1-minute intervals until smooth, stirring between intervals.

, As soon as the caramel is smooth, pour it over the brownie while the brownie is still in the pan. You should use a spatula to spread it evenly over the entire brownie.

, It should be left in the fridge for at least an hour to cool off.

, While your brownie is cooling off, put your candy on a cutting board and cut it up into small pieces.


This step may also be done later, if you would prefer.

, Once the caramel brownie has cooled off, and the caramel is partially hardened over the brownie, take the brownie out of the fridge.


Cover the entire brownie with the whipped cream, making it as thick or thin as you would prefer.

, If you have not chopped up your candy, you should now do it. Make sure the pieces are relatively small. When they are at the size of your preference, sprinkle them over the top of your cream pie to finish it off.


You may want to put your brownie back in the fridge if you do not serve it right away. The whipped cream melts rather quickly, so it’s best if served cold!

Plan for some trial-and-error.",How to Cook a Frozen Pie1," Preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC). After removing the pie from the freezer, place it on a foil-lined baking sheet. The foil safeguards against any spillage from the pie if the filling bubbles over the sides.


If you are placing a homemade raw pie into the oven, never place Pyrex or a glass pan directly into the oven. It can shatter.Some people suggest thawing the pie for about 25 minutes before you place it in the oven because it helps the pastry flour cook better.If you accidentally froze you pie in a glass dish, a brief thawing may also reduce the chance of it shattering. But it’s best to play it safe and use a disposable metal pie pan when baking from frozen.;
, Baking frozen pies can be tricky because the top can get brown before the bottom cooks. Oven placement is essential for a frozen pie. Bake your pie on the lowest rack, which places the bottom of the pie closest to the heating element. You can move the pie lower and higher as it cooks as needed.


Brush the top of the pie with butter or cream, or sprinkle with sugar for something extra.One trick that may help if you have raw bottom crust is to preheat the baking sheet before you place the pie in the oven. Put the empty baking sheet into the oven as you preheat it.A preheated pizza stone will also work.
Another tip is to place strips of foil around the edge of the pie. These will stay there until the middle of the pie begins to brown, so that you stop the edges from over-browning.

, To start out, bake the pie at 425ºF (220ºC) for 15 minutes. Then, reduce the heat to 350ºF (180ºC). Continue baking the pie for another 45 minutes.


The length of time you will have to bake the pie depends on how cold your freezer is, how hot the oven is, and the amount of filling in the pie. A good general rule is to bake the pie for 20-45 minutes longer than the recipe specifies for cooking normally.If you added foil around the edge of the pie, remove the foil edge pieces when the middle starts to brown.
If the top of the pie starts to brown before the middle or bottom is cooked, make a tent with foil over the top of the pie., When the whole pie appears golden brown, take the pie from the oven. Insert a knife into the pie to check if the filling is completely done. If you hit hard chunks, put it back in the oven on a lower temperature. Shield the edges with foil again if necessary.


When it’s done, allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.

, Baking a frozen pie (or any pie, for that matter) is both an art and a science. Every baker seems to have their particular tricks and tips, but there’s really only one way to find out what works best for you. Luckily, you get to eat your mistakes — and they’ll still be pretty tasty!


While some will argue in favor of it, most bakers seem to agree that it’s best not to freeze a homemade fruit pie after baking it. Prepare it raw, then bake it from frozen.However, instead of assembling the pie before freezing, you may want to try freezing it in parts — the prepared filling and the (unrolled) dough. In this case, you will let the components thaw to the point that they are workable."

Spray it with a generous coat of nonstick cooking spray, and line the bottom of the pan with a piece of parchment paper that’s cut to fit it exactly.If you prefer, you can grease the springform pan with softened butter.;
, Add 1 ½ cups (125 g) of finely crushed graham cracker crumbs, ½ cup (113 g) of melted and cooled butter, and ¼ cup (55 g) of sugar to a medium size bowl. Use clean fingers to thoroughly mix the ingredients until they hold together when you press the mixture.You can buy already crushed graham cracker crumbs at the grocery store, or crush your own by placing the crackers in a plastic bag and rolling over them with a rolling pin or other heavy item. A food processor also works well for crushing the crackers.

, Once you’ve mixed the graham crackers, butter, and sugar together, transfer the mixture to the prepared springform pan. Pack the mixture into the bottom of the pan in an even layer to form the crust.It helps to use a heavy measuring cup or small pot to press down on the graham cracker mixture to ensure that it’s tightly packed in the pan.

, After you’ve pressed the graham cracker crust into the pan, place it in the refrigerator. Allow the crust to chill for at least an hour or up to a day before you plan to assemble the cheesecake.If you prefer, you can bake the crust instead of chilling it to help it set it. Place it in an oven preheated to 325 degree Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius), and bake it for approximately 5 minutes or until the crust looks dry. Allow it to cool completely before adding the filling., Add 2 teaspoons (6 g) of powdered gelatin and 1 ½ tablespoons (23 ml) of cold water to a medium size, heatproof bowl. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the gelatin has softened.You’ll be placing the bowl with the gelatin and water in a double boiler after you’ve let it sit, so the bowl must be safe to heat.

, Add 1 ½ pounds (675 g) of softened cream cheese, 1 ½ cups (438 g) of plain, whole milk Greek yogurt, ¾ cup (165 g) of sugar, 2 teaspoons (30 ml) of fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt to a food processor. Process the ingredients until the mixture is completely smooth.It may be necessary to scrape down the sides of the food processor bowl a few times during blending to ensure that the mixture is fully combined.
If you don’t have a food processor, you can mix the filling in a blender.

, Fill a small saucepan that the bowl with the gelatin fits over with approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) of water, and heat it on the stove on medium. Set the bowl on top, and heat it in the double boiler for approximately 2 minutes, or until the gelatin dissolves.Make sure to stir the gelatin mixture constantly as it heats to help it dissolve.

, Once the gelatin has melted into the water, remove the bowl from the saucepan. Turn the food processor back on, and slowly drizzle the gelatin mixture into the cream cheese mixture. Process the filling until it is completely blended, which should take approximately 30 seconds.Be sure to handle the bowl with the gelatin mixture with a pot holder because it may be hot from the double boiler.

, Once you’ve finished mixing the filling, add it to the graham cracker crust in the springform pan. When you’re finished, tap the pan firmly against your counter or table to remove any air bubbles in the filling.To ensure that the cheesecake has an attractive appearance, use a spatula to smooth the top of the filling so it’s even.

, When the filling is in the pan and the top is smoothed, cover it with a piece of plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator, and allow it to chill for at least 6 hours before serving.Make sure that you wrap the plastic tightly over the cheesecake so it’s protected in the refrigerator.
You can make the cheesecake up to 2 days in advance and keep it refrigerated until you are ready to serve it.

, When you’re ready to serve the cake, remove it from the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap. If you like, you can place sliced strawberries on the top of the cake for garnish before cutting it into slices and serving it.You can arrange the strawberries however you like. You can place a single berry in the center or create a ring around the entire edge of the cake. You can also cover the entire top of the cake with sliced strawberries if you like.
To make cutting the cake easier, dip your knife in warm water and wipe off in between each slice that you make.
Store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator. It should keep for 5 to 6 days.

, If you aren't a fan of strawberries, you can garnish the cheesecake with other berries, such as raspberries or blueberries. If you prefer fruit syrups to whole fruit, drizzle strawberry, raspberry, or blueberry syrup over individual slices before serving.Arrange raspberries or blueberries on top of the cheesecake before slicing just as you would with the strawberries.

Bake the pie.,
Remove the pie from the oven.,
Learn from past experiences.",How to Cook a Frozen Pie2," Some frozen pies need thawing, while others don't. If you need to thaw your pie, leave it out at room temperature for a few hours. You want the pie to still be partially frozen when you put it in the oven. Follow the directions on the box to make sure you don't thaw if you're not supposed to, or vice versa.


Some pies, like a Dutch apple pie, may need to thaw for hours before cooking, while a pumpkin pie might need only 20 minutes. Other pies, like berry, strawberry, or peach, might not need to thaw.Reheating fully cooked homemade pies that you have frozen might taste stale or not keep as well as a raw pie. If you want to freeze a homemade pie, consider freezing it raw instead., Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC), or whatever temperature is indicated on the box. Place your pie on a foil-lined baking sheet, which will catch any filling that bubbles over. Place the pie in the oven, following any instructions the box gives you. If the box doesn't provide instructions, cook the pie on the lowest rack to make sure the bottom crust cooks.


If you have trouble with the bottom of your pie crust cooking, cook it lower in the oven, and/or preheat the baking sheet. Or, try to make a tent with foil to cover the top so it doesn't burn.You can add strips of foil to the edges if you want to protect your pie's edges from getting too brown or burnt.

, Bake the pie by following the instructions on the box. Many frozen pies need to be baked for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown in color. If that doesn't yield a pie that’s done all the way through, try baking it for 30 minutes, then reducing the temperature to 325ºF (160ºC) and baking for an additional 25-30 minutes.

, When the pie has cooked all the way through, remove it. To test it, stick a knife inside and see if there are any hard, frozen chunks. If so, pop it back in the oven. Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.

, If you regularly bake a particular brand of frozen pie, take note of the baking time, temperature, and techniques (tenting, preheating the baking sheet, etc.) that seem to produce the best results. Each oven is unique, so you may find that a bit of tweaking to the given instructions is necessary.

",How to Cook a Frozen Pie3," If you are making a homemade savory pie, cook all meats, vegetables, and other ingredients for the filling as if you intend to bake the pie immediately after. In other words, don’t freeze uncooked or undercooked filling ingredients and expect them to cook through in the oven later.Uncooked or undercooked meats could pose a serious health hazard.

, This is one of the many elements of frozen pie baking in which you can easily find a wide range of opinions. Your best bet is probably to try the different methods and see which works for you.


Some cooks recommend cooking the filling and freezing it and the (unrolled) pie crust separately in labeled freezer bags. In this case, you would allow each element to thaw to the point to which you could assemble the pie.Others, however, prefer the method of assembling the pie then freezing it whole. That way, you can pop it straight from the freezer into the oven. In this instance, don’t freeze the pie in a glass dish (it could shatter in the oven).

, Not surprisingly, a frozen pie will take a bit longer to cook through than an unfrozen one. You may also find that you need to reduce the temperature a little so that the edges don’t burn before the center cooks through.


For example, one pot pie recipe recommends baking unfrozen at 400 Fahrenheit (200 Celsius) for about 30 minutes, and frozen at 375 F (190 C) for up to 45 minutes.If you’re concerned about not getting good browning on the bottom crust, start out at the regular temperature for the first 15 minutes or so, then reduce it.
If the edge crust is getting too brown before the center of the pie heats through, you can also try creating a ring-shaped heat shield out of aluminum foil, which you can (carefully) place over the edge of the pie. Use another pie dish as a template.

, Many cultures around the world enjoy some version of a savory hand-held pie — sometimes called a pasty, among other names. They’re relatively easy to make, very portable, and tasty — and ideal for freezing ahead of time and baking on demand. In fact, many hand pie lovers contend that they come out even better when frozen first.Excess moisture — fats from cooked meats, water content in veggies, etc. — in the filling can make for a soggy hand pie, so drain or thicken fillings a bit more as a precautionary measure.

Pasty recipes abound online, so try several variations and see what crust and filling combinations hit the spot for you. As with larger pies, the frozen baking time will increase a bit and the baking temperature may need to be slightly reduced.

, If you simply want to bake up a boxed pot pie from the grocery store’s freezer case, follow the instructions on the box. In almost every case, these pies are meant to be baked directly from frozen.


Of course, with experience, you may find that adjustments to baking time and temperature produce a better result with a particular frozen pie brand.
As instructed, make sure the center of the pie is cooked through. Use a knife — or for more certainty, a meat thermometer — to test the center.

This will make it easier to mix together than cutting in the butter by hand.;
, Remove the dough from the food processor and divide it into two balls of different sizes. One ball should be about 2/3 of the dough and the other ball should be the remaining 1/3 of the dough.

6 tablespoons (75 g) of instant tapioca
3 tablespoons of dark rum

This will give the oats, sugars, and flour something solid to bind onto while they cook, leading to big, delicious crumble topping. It can help to cut the butter into 1/2"" cubes ahead of time and place in the freezer while you measure everything else out.


The amount of butter in your recipe is up to you. If you want a very rich topping, you can add as many as 8–9 tablespoons (120–130 ml), though you should add 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) more flour and brown sugar if you do.;
, Use a whisk to lightly mix the dry ingredients, getting rid of any clumps and making sure everything is evenly distributed.

, Cutting in the butter means you physically mash and cut the butter when surrounded by the flour mixture. This allows the flour to coat as much of the butter as possible, which leads to a crispy, delicious topping. You can cut the butter three ways:



Food Processor: Pulse the mixture until there are still 1/4"" clumps and none of the butter is uncoated with flour.

Pastry Blender: These D-shaped tools have 4-5 wires at the end which effectively cut the butter up into thin slices. Cut until you have a gravel-like consistency

Fingers: Freeze the whole mixture for 2-3 minutes before working, then quickly mash the butter into the flour, aiming for a crumbly, gravel-like mixture.

, Remember that the colder the butter is when it hits the oven, the better your topping will be. Set the topping in a cool place, like the refrigerator, while you prepare the apples."

What you want is a firm-textured apple, one that will hold up under heat. In addition, the best apples for baking have a nice balance between sweetness and tartness, leading to a better-balanced dish.If you're in doubt, check the labels at your supermarket, which often point out good ""baking"" apples. Some great examples (not including those in the ingredients list) include:


Must
Pink Lady
Granny Smith
Cortland
Empire
Jonathan and Jonagold, Wash the apples and then peel them first, as most people don't like the skins in their crisp. If you have an apple corer, use it to punch out the center and then cut the apple into whatever thickness you desire, though they should be a 1/4"" or less in order to fully cook. If you don't have an apple corer, the best way to cut apples with a knife is:


Wash and peel the apple. Remove the stem.
Cut the apple in half lengthwise, from the stem down
Cut the apple halves lengthwise into quarters
Lay each quarter on one side, peel side up, and diagonally slice out the core.
Cut remaining apple into slices., Add the lemon juice first, tossing to coat all of the apples the light acid, which keeps them semi-crisp and enhances their flavor. Then add the sugar and flour slowly, making sure all of the apples are adequately covered.


If you want a little extra sweetness, toss in 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of maple syrup with the lemon juice and coat the apples before adding sugar and flour.

, The apples go in nice, even layer on the bottom and the streusel goes in a nice, even layer on the top. With the apples, take care to prevent large air holes that might form from askew apples. While they don't have to be meticulously layered, you don't want it to cook unevenly.

, The longer the dish cooks, the softer the apples will get. However, too long and the topping will burn. 30-40 minutes should be right on the money.If the topping is getting too dark but the apples need more time, cover the whole thing with aluminum foil. This will protect the topping while trapping heat to cook the apples."

Know that this recipe can be easily adapted to your tastes.,
Toss in a ½ cup of your favorite chopped nuts to give the whole dish a little extra crunch.,
Mix in other fruits with the apples to create a complex crisp.,
Spice the apple mixture with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and/ore allspice.,
Use 4-5 tablespoons honey instead of butter for a healthier crisp.,
Use multiple apples for a more complex, layered taste.",How to Make an Apple Crisp3," Looking to get a little more variety in your crisp, or fine-tune it to your particular taste buds? This recipe is more of a template than anything, and adjusting it is easy. You can:


Omit the oats from the topping, instead adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour.Adding more cold butter for a richer topping, or 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) melted butter with the apples for a richer base.Change the brown sugar to white sugar mixture, adding more brown sugar for a more molasses-like taste.

, You can add them to either the topping, the apples, or both -- there are recipes that support all three. In general, the most commonly used nuts are pecans or walnuts, though toasted or sliced almonds, especially in the crumb topping, can be divine as well., You can add different fruits easily without changing your workflow much, simply tossing it in with the apples before the lemon, flour, and sugar. Some great compliments for the apples include:Dried fruits, like raisins, currants, and cranberries.
Fresh cranberries
Pears
Plums, This autumnal crisp goes great with tea, or a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Note, however that these spices go a long way, and you shouldn't need much more than a 1/2 teaspoon of each, though you could double the cinnamon if desired.


Spices go well if you add dried fruits, as well.
A touch of maple syrup here will help balance the spices with a dash of sweetness.

, Simply use a rubber spatula to mix the flour, sugar, and oats in with the honey until it forms small, sticky balls. This mixture will be decidedly less rich, but it will be much, much lower in calories., You want to use two apples that cover each other's ""weaknesses."" Otherwise said, you want to find a mostly sweet apple to combine with a more tart apple, like a sweet Fuji with a pucker-inducing Granny Smith. In general, this green-red combination will do you well."

Zest the lemons.,
Juice the lemons.,
Beat the eggs.,
Add butter.,
Bring the mixture to a simmer.,
Let cool slightly.",How to Make Lemon Curd1," It's much easier to juice a zested lemon than it is to zest a juiced lemon. Here are some ways to do this:


The first way is to use a lemon zester. This is a handy tool, built with the express purpose of peeling the skin off lemons and limes.
Another way to do this is with a fine-toothed grater. The advantage to this is that rather than having long strips of skin to then chop fine, the grater does all that in the process of grating.
A third method is paring. With a paring knife or vegetable peeler, peel away strips of lemon skin.
If you use a peeler, make sure you trim off any of the white pith before proceeding—it's very bitter.
Mince the lemon zest, until you have 1 tablespoon of lemon zest—about 1 lemon.;
, A regular hand juicer should get you about 2 tablespoons of juice from one lemon. If you find you're not getting enough juice, try rolling the lemon firmly on a hard surface to break up the tissue and release more juice, or microwave it for 10 seconds to warm it up.

, Combine the Whisk eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small saucepan, and whisk together until well-blended.

, Stir in the butter with a spoon, and mix until smooth.

, Do not bring to a boil. Over low heat, gently bring the mixture barely to a simmer (small bubbles occasionally rising to the surface). Cook, stirring constantly, for about 15 minutes or until the mixture thickens.

, Pour into small glass jars, custard cups, or small bowls, and store in the refrigerator.

Good handle grip

Ergonomic
Won't slide very easily


Sharp edges (this makes for easy scooping)
Wide scoop (for maximum ice cream retrieval);
, Scoop your ice cream on the sideboard next to the sink. Put both scoops into a large coffee cup under running hot water long enough to heat them up for 20-30 seconds. If you're scooping ice cream for several kids/people, leave the water running at a trickle into the cup. Heating the scoops makes it easier to glide through the ice cream and ultimately speeds up the process.

, Using the side edge of your scoop, scoop in a circular motion or an ""S"" shaped motion, allowing for round, even scoops. Don't take too long-it will melt!

, When you have scooped out the ice cream, place it in a dish or a cone then drop that scoop back into the cup and grab the other. This way you always have a heated scoop handy. The ice cream falls from a heated scoop much more easily than from a cold one - thus using it for only one or two scoops before returning it to the heated water and grabbing the second one.

How much sugar you add depends on your personal preferences. If you like your cobblers sweet, use more sugar. If you like them tart, use less sugar.
How much ground cinnamon you use is up to you.

, You can do this using a pastry blender or two crisscrossing knives. You can also cut the butter into cubes, add it to the flour mixture, then pulse everything for a few seconds in a food processor.

Use this recipe to have fun making simple ice cream.,
Crush ice.,
Fill a large container halfway full of crushed ice.,
Shake rock salt into the ice.,
Pour milk, sugar, and vanilla extract into a new zip lock bag.,
Seal the bag after squeezing out the air.,
Seal a second zip lock bag around the ice cream mixture.,
Put the bag with the ice cream mixture inside the container of ice.,
Shake the container until the ice cream is ready.,
Wipe the bag before opening.",How to Make Vanilla Ice Cream Without an Ice Cream Maker1," Ice cream made this way doesn't contain egg yolk, which makes it less rich and creamy than ice cream you may be used to. However, it is quick and easy to make, especially if you have a friend or two to help out. Kids often enjoy making this ice cream, since most of the process involves tossing it back and forth or shaking it.;
, You can purchase pre-crushed ice, or make your own from ice cubes or blocks of ice. Place the ice in a plastic bag and gently, slowly bash the bag with a wooden mallet to break up the ice. Alternatively, use a heavy-duty food processor to break up the ice with brief pulses.

, Use a large container that can be tightly closed, and that won't easily break when shaken around. You can buy an ""ice cream ball"" for this purpose, which is sturdy and fun to throw around, but you can easily use a gallon-sized zip lock bag or a large plastic jar instead.


The container must be large enough to contain the ice cream mixture as well as the ice. Use an even larger container if you are doubling the recipe.

, Add 6 tablespoons (90 mL) rock salt directly onto the ice, seal the container, and shake until the salt and ice are mixed. It may seem strange, but the rock salt actually cools the ice down!Ice cream will not freeze in a container of regular ice, but salt provides the colder temperature it needs.


Rock salt is sometimes sold as ""ice cream salt.""
Ordinary table salt can also be used, but the smaller grains may cool the mixture too rapidly, making your ice cream freeze unevenly.

, Measure out 1 cup (240 mL) milk, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) vanilla extract. Pour all of these ingredients into a quart- or liter-sized zip lock bag.


For a richer ice cream, use half-and-half or heavy cream instead of milk.
If using an ice cream ball, pour this mixture into the compartment of the ball without ice instead. Skip straight to the ""shake"" step.

, Hold the bag upright or have an assistant hold it for you. Press as much air as you can out of the bag, starting just above the level of the ingredients and moving up to the opening. Use the zip lock to seal the bag tightly.


The more air there is in the bag, the more likely the bag will be to burst open while you make the ice cream.

, Open another bag of the same size or larger. Place the bag containing the ice cream mixture inside this additional bag, then seal the same way you did the first. Ice cream needs to be shaken during freezing, and using two bags will prevent it from spilling if one of the bags is broken during the shaking.

, Seal the largest container tightly. It should now contain the double-bagged ice cream mixture as well as the loose ice and rock salt slush.

, Shake the container vigorously, or if the container is sturdy enough and tightly sealed, toss it back and forth. This movement prevents large ice chunks from forming, and stirs a little air into the ice cream as well to make it less dense. The ice cream may take 5–20 minutes to freeze, depending on the temperature, how vigorously you are shaking, and how hard you prefer your ice cream. It may take longer if you are making a larger batch.


Wrap the container in towels or wear gloves if it gets too cold to handle.
If the ice cream isn't ready after 20 minutes, add more ice and salt, or put in the freezer for no more than 5 minutes.

, Once the ice cream has reached the consistency you enjoy, remove the bag of ice cream from the larger container. Use a dish towel to wipe off the salty water on the outside of the bag, or rinse it briefly under cold water. Now that your ice cream is safe from being mixed with salt, open up the bag and pour it into another container. You can also eat single-serving ice cream made this way straight out of the bag.

",How to Make Vanilla Ice Cream Without an Ice Cream Maker2," If you want a dense, rich vanilla ice cream, you'll need to put in a bit more work than the bag method. This ice cream can also take several hours to freeze, so it's best started earlier in the day if you want it to be ready that night.

, You'll need at least 5 large egg yolks to create the custard base for the ice cream. Optionally, you can use 6, 7, or 8 to create a richer custard, and therefore a richer ice cream.If you are using small eggs, separate out a single additional yolk. Just go with the amounts listed if you are not sure what size your eggs are.

Raw egg whites can be frozen for later use.

, Put the egg yolks in a large bowl, or in an electric mixer bowl. Add 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt and 1 cup (240 mL) sugar. Whisk until the mixture is pale yellow, contains no lumps or dry spots, and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when you lift it into the air.You may reduce the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup (180 mL) to make it less sweet, but reducing it further may make the ice cream freeze in larger chunks.

, Fill a large bowl halfway with ice or ice water, leaving enough room to place another bowl inside it. You will use this ice bath later to chill the finished custard base, without the risk of freezing it.


Optionally, you may keep the 2 cups (480 mL) heavy cream or half-and-half chilled in a small, dry bowl within the ice bath.Otherwise, keep it in the refrigerator.

, Evaporated milk is simply milk that has had a large percentage of its water content removed. This is useful for ice cream to minimize the amount of large ice crystals that form, which allows you to churn less often and less vigorously.If evaporated milk is not available, use whole (full-fat) milk instead. Milk with a lower fat content will likely provide less flavor and may affect the density of the ice cream as well.

, Add 2 tsp (10 mL) vanilla extract to the milk and stir it in. Alternatively, split a vanilla bean pod lengthwise and scrape out the sticky seeds inside into the milk. For the strongest vanilla flavor, the vanilla pod itself can also be placed into the mixture, which is then covered and left to infuse for an hour. Remove the vanilla pod before continuing.


There is no need to wait if using vanilla extract.

, Gradually pour the hot milk into the whisked egg in a thin stream, whisking constantly. Be careful not to pour too much milk in at a time, as the heat could turn your excellent ice cream base into sugary scrambled eggs.

, Transfer the newly combined mixture back to the stove and heat at low heat while whisking constantly. Remove it from heat once it reaches a thick, custard consistency.


Be careful not to overheat it; remove from heat immediately if you see any lumps of cooked egg or scalded milk skin.

, Transfer the mixture yet again to a container that can fit inside the ice bath without getting filled with water. Place this container into the ice bath and let it chill while you move on to the next step.


If you were using the ice bath to keep the cream chilled, remove it before moving the mixture into the bath.

, Whisk 2 cups (480 mL) heavy cream, or substitute half-and-half for a lower fat, but less rich and creamy, recipe. It may take several minutes of whisking by hand, or a shorter time by electric mixer, to create an airy cream that has doubled in volume.Do not beat it so long that it forms whipped cream.

, Once the cream is whisked and the egg-and-milk custard is completely chilled, combine the two together. Using a rubber spatula or other flat implement, fold the cream into the egg mixture. Continue until there are no lumps in the mixture.

, If you have clean ice cube trays, fill them with the mixture and place them in the freezer. Because more of the ice cream's surface is exposed to the cold surroundings, the ice cream will freeze faster, preventing the formation of large ice crystals.These typically take 4 hours to freeze.


To form a more ordinary shape of ice cream, remove the frozen cubes of ice cream from the tray with a spoon and combine in a food processor. Transfer to a larger container and freeze., The more traditional method of making ice cream without a machine involves freezing it in one container. However, especially if you are using ordinary milk instead of evaporated milk, large ice crystals will form that ruin the texture of your ice cream and make its flavor uneven. To break up these crystals, you will need to remove it periodically and ""churn"" vigorously by stirring with an electric mixer or by hand:Churn after about half an hour, before the center has frozen. Churn until the mixture is creamy again.
Churn every half hour, breaking up the frozen edges and stirring them into the mixture.
Once the ice cream is more evenly frozen (typically after 2–3 hours), leave it until it freezes completely.

Remove the mixture from heat.

, Use a whisk to beat them slightly.

, Use a whisk to beat constantly while you pour. Pouring hot milk into the eggs slowly will temper the eggs. This prevents them from cooking when you add them to the pot with the milk mixture.

, Whisk constantly so the eggs don't have time to sit in the hot milk and cook.

, Whisk constantly to prevent the mixture from curdling. Heat until it reaches 160 °F (71.1 °C) and becomes thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.


Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature until it reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
Do not overcook the custard, or the texture will become clumpy.

, Add the cubes to the pot and keep stirring constantly. Once the cream cheese cubes have melted, remove the mixture from heat.

, This will help the custard cool quickly. Keep stirring for about two minutes to help more heat escape from the pot.

, Stir until it is thoroughly incorporated into the custard.

, Use plastic wrap and make sure it touches the surface of the custard. This prevents the custard from forming a skin on top. Refrigerate the custard until it is entirely cool. This should take three or four hours. You may also refrigerate it overnight.

, Wash the strawberries and use a paper towel to dry them. Use a paring knife to remove the leaves. Chop, slice or crush the strawberries into small pieces that will evenly distribute throughout the ice cream.If you are using frozen strawberries, thaw them completely.
Make sure the strawberry pieces are sufficiently small. Large pieces of strawberry will freeze solid in the ice cream and become difficult to chew.

, Remove the plastic wrap. If a skin has formed over any part of the custard, skim it off.

, Pour the heavy cream and strawberries into the pot and mix well.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions to churn and freeze the ice cream to your desired consistency. If you freeze the ice cream in batches, refrigerate the extra ice cream mixture until you're ready to process it with the ice cream maker.

, The mixture is usually soft after being processed in the ice cream maker. Scoop it into a separate container and freeze for two to four hours before eating. The ice cream will keep for up to two weeks in the freezer.

, Strawberry cheesecake is often served with a sweetened strawberry puree or jam. If you prefer strawberry puree over the taste of whole or crushed strawberries, follow these steps when you're making your ice cream:Place the strawberries and 1/3 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan. Use a fork or a potato masher to mash the strawberries for one minute.
Cook the mixture it comes to a full boil, about four minutes. Use a spoon to skim any foam off the top.
Store the mixture in the refrigerator and let it chill completely. Stir it into your custard ice cream base in place of fresh strawberries.

, For some people, the crust is the best part. There's no reason to leave it out of your ice cream. cheesecake is often made with a graham cracker crust. Try adding it to your ice cream by doing the following:Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
Process 1/3 cup melted unsalted butter, 12 graham crackers, and 1/4 cup sugar in a food processor until the graham crackers are finely ground.
Press the mixture into a pie tin. Bake for 10 minutes, or until it looks golden brown. Allow the crust to cool completely.
Pop the crust out of the tin and break it into bite-sized chunks. Stir the pieces into the ice cream after you process it in the ice cream maker, while it's still soft. Then freeze the ice cream in the freezer until solid.

, Why not take it over the top? After you have processed the ice cream in the ice cream maker, stir in 1 cup of chocolate chips to the mix. Do this while the ice cream is still soft. Transfer the ice cream to a freezer container and freeze until solid.


If you love the taste of fudge topping on cheesecake, try adding 1/2 cup of chilled fudge topping to the ice cream after processing it in the ice cream maker. Swirl it in while the ice cream is still soft. Freeze the mixture until solid.
Chocolate candy is also a tasty addition. Try adding 1 cup of chopped chocolate candy of your choice to the ice cream after processing it in the ice cream maker. Stir it in while the ice cream is still soft. Finish the ice cream by freezing until solid.

Churn mixture in ice cream maker.",How to Make Soft Serve Ice Cream1," Different models of home ice cream makers can work differently, but most have a removable two-layered bowl with cooling fluid in between the layers.This bowl needs to be ice cold to make ice cream, so put it in the freezer at least an hour or two before you plan to start. Consult your machine's directions to learn the exact freezing time — some models may need to freeze overnight (or longer).

Wrap the bowl in a plastic bag before putting it in the freezer to prevent frost from forming on it.;
, Before you begin, use the instant pudding packet to make pudding. Follow the directions on the pudding's packaging for preparation. Depending on the type of pudding you are using, the process can take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour. For longer recipes, much of the time will usually be waiting for the pudding to set in the fridge, so you can ready the rest of your ingredients while you wait.

Instant pudding products will vary, but generally all you'll need to do is mix the powder with milk and put it in the fridge to set. See our article on making instant pudding for more information.

, Add the ingredients to a large bowl, making sure the pudding is set before doing so. If you have an electric mixer, you can use this to combine the ingredients quickly. Otherwise, use a whisk.

You only need to mix the ingredients so they're uniform here. You aren't trying to churn the ice cream into something solid yet.

, Stir slowly as you add these ingredients to the bowl. Fold the mixture a few times to combine them well.

If you don't have vanilla flavoring, try adding a tablespoon of vanilla extract instead (which can be a little easier to find at the grocery store).

, Assemble your ice cream maker, taking the bowl out of the freezer and locking it in its place under the paddle. Pour your liquid mixture into the bowl, close the machine, and turn it on. Consult the directions for your machine to learn how long to run it for — most models will get the ice cream to a soft-serve consistency within 20-30 minutes.Soft serve is best-enjoyed immediately. It will keep in a freezer-safe container, but may loose its soft, light texture, becoming something closer to ""normal"" ice cream.

, Make sure there is at least an inch left that is not covered with chocolate chips.

, Because the chocolate chips are not in a puddle when you take them out doesn't mean they are not heated.

, If the chocolate is still not melted enough put in for a little longer. Do the same thing with the spoon and again for shorter time if still not melted enough.

, Let a child crumble a little of the cut toffee on the bottom of the plastic box. With heated chocolate, pour a little in the middle of the plastic box. Spread with a spoon to cover all of the bottom.

, Shape the ice cream carefully with your hands into the shape of the box, but a little smaller. Place it in the middle of the box so there is still a little bit of room in the front, back, and sides.

, Do the same thing with all the other sides. At one side pour heated chocolate in while pushing it in. Do the same thing with the rest of the sides.

, Let a child sprinkle toffee on top.

Keep in mind that the ice cream won't be as creamy., Freezing the ice cream for 4 to 6 hours would be recommended, however.This allows the ice cream to ""ripen."" It will improve its texture and flavor.


If you are not using an ice cream maker, then you cam simply pull your ice cream after the initial freezing time.

, If it is too hard, let it soften for about 15 minutes on the counter. The ice cream will last 1 to 2 weeks in the freezer."

Combine all ingredients (besides dry ice) in a mixing bowl.,
Optionally, warm the ingredients on the stove.,
Break up the dry ice.,
Churn the liquid base with dry ice.,
Continue until you reach soft serve texture.",How to Make Soft Serve Ice Cream2," You can use the stand mixer for this. Alternatively, use a whisk to mix the ingredients by hand in a separate bowl. Your goal here isn't to churn the mixture into ice cream — just to combine it until it's uniform. Transfer it to the fridge when you're done to chill.

Make sure any clumps formed by the milk powder are completely broken up before proceeding.

, You don't have to do this, but it can make for slightly smoother ice cream. The mild heat breaks down the proteins in the milk powder, ensuring you don't get any clumps or uneven textures in your final product.

If you want to do this, transfer the mixture to a small pot and warm them over medium-low heat to about 176 F (80 C). The liquid should be quite warm to the touch but not boiling. Once it reaches this temperature, remove it from the stove, transfer to another container, and let it chill in the fridge thoroughly before proceeding.

, Transfer the dry ice to a clean burlap sack or another sturdy bag that you don't mind beating up. Alternatively, wrap it tightly in a clean bath towel. Use a mallet or a heavy pan to break the dry ice into tiny pieces. Transfer it into a Tupperware container or a plastic bowl. Don't use ceramic or glass containers — dry ice's extreme cold can make these break.

Handle dry ice with care. Use gloves, an oven mitt, or a towel to carry it. If it touches the skin for more than a few seconds, it can cause ""burns"" similar to what you may get from high heat. Never put dry ice in your mouth., Add the chilled liquid from earlier to the bowl of your stand mixer. Start mixing it on the lowest possible speed with a paddle attachment. As the mixture churns, use a spoon to add the dry ice once scoop at a time. It will immediately begin to foam and sputter. Go slowly — wait until one spoonful stops foaming to add the next one., As you slowly add the dry ice, the mixture will begin to thicken. Increase the mixing speed slightly and continue to add dry ice as before. Keep a close eye on the ice cream at this point. When it starts to look like soft serve, try a small amount. If you like the texture, you're ready to eat. If it needs to be thicker, keep adding dry ice and mixing. That's all there is to it!

If you're not enjoying it right away, this soft serve stores well in the freezer. Use an airtight container to prevent freezer burn.

Use a piping bag for a classic soft serve look.,
Add new ingredients to get different flavors.,
Make your own cone.,
Add fillings to the ice cream.",How to Make Soft Serve Ice Cream3," When you enjoy soft serve at a restaurant, it's usually served in a cone or a bowl in a tidy-looking spiraling arrangement, rather than as a rough-looking ""clump."" To get this presentation, transfer the soft serve to a piping bag (which are often used to apply frosting to baked goods) and squeeze the ice cream through the hole or nozzle, piling it in a spiraling circle.

Stop squeezing and use a ""dipping"" motion to break the stream of ice cream and get a ""curled over"" look when you're done.

, The recipes above are for vanilla ice cream, but it's not hard to get other flavors. Simply keep the non-vanilla ingredients (milk, cream, sugar, etc.) the same and replace the vanilla ingredients with your preferred flavorings. There's practically no limit to what you can add, but things like syrups, blended fruits, and powdered ingredients all work well because they can blend uniformly through the mixture.

For example, if you want to make chocolate ice cream, try adding 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to either recipe in place of the vanilla flavoring.

, Nothing goes with ice cream like a crunchy, flavorful cone. You can buy these from the store, but you can also make better-tasting cones at home from a few simple ingredients. See ] to get started — note that you will need a waffle cone or pizzelle press, both of which look like shallow waffle makers., One easy way to customize your ice cream is to add ""fillings"" to it. These are chunks of your favorite ingredients that you simply fold into the soft serve ice cream once it's nearly finished churning. Below are just a few ideas:

Chocolate chips
Sliced strawberries
Chunks of cookie or cookie dough
Corn flakes or breakfast cereal

",How to Make Fish Stock," The best types of fish bones to make stock with are those from lean, white, mild-flavored fish such as halibut, cod, flounder, sole, turbot, sea bass, haddock, hake or pollock. You can use a combination of these in your stock, if you wish.;
, You should avoid using the bones from oily, fatty, brown-fleshed fish like salmon, trout or mackerel to make your stock, as the flavor from these fish will be overpowering.

, If you don't want to fillet a whole fish yourself, speak to your local fishmonger. They are usually happy to sell fish bones (and heads) at a relatively low cost., Rinse the fish bones thoroughly under running water to remove any traces of blood. Use a sharp knife to rough chop the bones into 2 inch (5.1 cm) pieces.

, Add enough water to cover the bones, approximately 2 US quarts (2,000 ml).


Bring the contents of the boil, periodically skimming the white foam from the surface using a ladle.
Once the pot is boiling, reduce the heat to a low simmer.

, Once you have reduced the heat, add the celery, onions, carrots and herbs to the stock pot.


Add a little more water -- just enough to ensure that the vegetables are completely covered.
Leave to simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes.

, After 20 minutes of simmering, remove the pot from the heat and give it a good stir.


Leave the stock to steep for 10 minutes, before pouring it through a fine-mesh strainer.
Season the stock with sea salt, to taste.

, If you are not planning to use the fish stock in another recipe within the next hour, quickly chill it in the refrigerator.


You should only cover the stock (with a lid or plastic wrap) after it has completely cooled.
Fish stock will keep in the refrigerator for up to three days and in the freezer for about two months., Fish chowder is a delicious, warming dish that is greatly enhanced when you use your own homemade fish stock.

Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together well, so they’re fully blended.In some parts of the world, icing sugar is also known as powdered sugar.
In some parts of the world, flavored gelatin is also known as jelly crystals.
Food grade citric acid is usually sold in grocery and mass merchandise stores with the canning supplies. If you can’t find it in a local store, you can also order it online.
The citric acid helps give the sherbet powder a sour taste to contrast with the sweetness of the sugar. It also reacts with the baking soda for a fizzy sensation. If you want sherbet powder to be more fizzy, you can add in a little more citric acid.;
, After you’ve mixed all of the ingredients, pour the sherbet powder into a sealable plastic bag for storage. Make sure that you have a separate bag for each flavor of powder that you’ve mixed up.You can substitute any airtight container for the plastic bag. A jar with a lid or a tupperware container will also work well.

, A lollipop is one of the most common ways to enjoy sherbet powder. Lick the lollipop, dip it in the powder, and then lick it off. If you don’t want to use candy to eat the powder, you can just use a plain wooden popsicle stick to dip into it.Kids often enjoy just dipping their fingers into the sherbet powder and licking it off.
This recipe will make a single flavor of sherbet powder. If you want to create more than one flavor, you’ll need 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, 1 teaspoon (5 g) food grade citric acid, and 3 tablespoons (23 g) of icing sugar for every 2 tablespoons (19 g) of different flavored gelatin that you plan to use.

It’s best to use a deep saucepan so you don’t have to worry about the hot candy mixture boiling over as you cook it.
Make sure to stir the mixture regularly as the mixture’s heating so the sugar crystals don’t stick to the pan.

Continue to heat the mixture until it comes to a boil, which should take another 5 to 7 minutes.While you don’t have to stir the mixture as frequently as when the sugar was dissolving, mix it periodically to ensure that it’s heating evenly.

, After the mixture has come to boil, keep heating it over medium heat. Watch the candy thermometer, and cook it until it reaches 309 degrees Fahrenheit (154 degrees Celsius) or the hard-crack candy stage.The mixture will be extremely hot so be sure to handle it carefully.

, As soon as the lollipop mixture reaches the proper temperature, take the pan off the heat. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of orange or lemon extract and a small amount of gel food color in your choice of color, and stir well until the ingredients are completely blended.You can substitute another fruit flavoring or extract, such as raspberry flavoring or lime extract, for the lemon or orange.

, Once the mixture is flavored and colored, carefully pour it into the greased lollipop mold. Place a lollipop stick in each compartment so the pops will have a handle.You can usually find lollipop sticks at the craft store.
Be very careful when you’re pouring the candy mixture. It will be extremely hot, so it may burn your skin if you accidentally get it on yourself.
If you’re not using a mold for the lollipops, allow the mixture to cool for approximately 5 minutes so it thickens and is easier to pour into a circle with a spoon.

, After you’ve filled the mold, allow the lollipops to sit for 10 to 15 until they harden and cool completely. When they’re set, gently bend the mold to remove the lollipops. Give one a lick and dip it in your sherbet powder to enjoy.Store any unused lollipops in individual cellophane bags.

Grease the pan well.,

",How to Keep Cheesecake from Cracking," A baked cheesecake shrinks as it cools. If the sides of your pan are not thoroughly greased, the cheesecake may cling to the sides and pull apart in the center as it shrinks. Greasing the pan encourages the cheesecake to pull away from the sides and shrink in.


You can use cooking spray, butter, margarine, or shortening to grease the pan. As a general rule, the sides and bottom of the pan should appear glossy and feel greasy to the touch, but they should not be dripping wet.
Use a clean paper towel to spread the shortening, spray, or butter around the sides of the pan evenly.;
, As soon as the ingredients have been combined and the batter is smooth, stop mixing it. Over-mixing the batter can cause air bubbles to get trapped inside, and these air bubbles are ultimately the main cause of cracks.


Inside the oven, the air bubbles created in the batter expand and try to escape. They move to the top of the cheesecake, creating a crack or indentation as they break free.

, Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) to 1/4 cup (60 ml) of cornstarch or flour to the batter alongside the sugar.Starches minimize the amount of cracking that can occur. The starch molecules get in between the egg proteins and prevent them from over-coagulating. As a result, the cheesecake shrinks less, causing fewer cracks.
If you're working with a recipe that already includes flour or cornstarch, however, you may not need to add any extra. The writer of the recipe may have already taken the matter of starch into consideration.

, Eggs bind the ingredients of the batter together, and as a result, they are the main component responsible for trapping air bubbles inside the cheesecake. Mix the rest of the ingredients together thoroughly before adding the eggs to reduce the number of trapped air bubbles.


Any lumps created by the cream cheese or other ingredients should be completely beaten out before you add the eggs.
Mix the batter as little as possible after you add the eggs.

,


To create a warm water bath, first cover the sides and bottom of your cheesecake pan with aluminum foil to provide an extra barrier from the water. Use heavy-duty aluminum foil, if possible, and wrap outside of the pan as securely as possible.
Rest the cheesecake pan inside a larger pan. Fill the larger pan with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of warm water, or just enough water to surround half of the depth of the pan.

, Ideally, you should bake your cheesecake at a temperature of 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius). Extreme temperatures and dramatic temperature changes can cause the cake to crack, but cooking the cheesecake at a fairly low temperature can minimize the risk.


You can bake a cheesecake at a lower temperature if the recipe calls for it, but avoid temperatures that are higher than this. At high temperatures, the egg proteins over-coagulate and cause the cheesecake to split apart at the surface.

, Instead of keeping the oven on the entire time, turn the temperature off after about 45 minutes. Leave the cheesecake inside for another hour or until done. The batter should continue to bake inside the warm oven.


Gently baking the cheesecake for the final hour prevents it from over-baking, which is important since over-baking can cause cracks to form.

, Check the center of the cheesecake with the point of an instant-read cooking thermometer near the end of the cooking time. When the cheesecake reaches a temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), it should be removed from the oven.A cheesecake will always crack if the internal temperature rises above 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) during the baking process.
The thermometer will leave a hole in the center of your cheesecake, so you can skip this step if you want a perfectly smooth surface. Many people consider a hole to be far less distracting than surface cracks, though. Since the thermometer will allow you to measure the doneness on a detailed level, it's a valuable tool in the battle against surface cracking and definitely has its benefits.

, The cheesecake is done with the outer perimeter is firm but 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of the center is still wobbly.


Note that while the center should look moist and wiggly, it should not look runny.
The center will firm up as the cheesecake cools.
If you bake the cheesecake until the center appears dry, you'll end up drying the cheesecake out. This dryness is another factor that can cause surface cracking., After pulling the cheesecake out of the oven, let it cool undisturbed only for a few minutes. After those minutes pass, run a smooth paring knife around the inner sides of the pan, separating the cheesecake from the pan.Since cheesecakes shrink as they cool, this action further prevents the dessert from clinging to the sides of the pan as it shrinks and tearing apart at the center.

, Allow the cheesecake to cool at room temperature until the cake itself drops down to room temperature.


Do not refrigerate the cheesecake immediately after pulling it out of the oven. The dramatic shift in temperature can cause cracks to form.
Place an inverted plate or cookie sheet over the cheesecake as it cools to protect the surface.
After the cheesecake drops to room temperature, refrigerate it for another six hours or until it fully solidifies.

Surrounding the pan with aluminum foil will prevent water from leaking into the pan if you end up preparing a baked cheesecake, but this step is not necessary if you plan on using the crust for a no-bake cheesecake.






Place an 18- by 18-inch (46- by 46-cm) square of aluminum foil beneath the springform pan. Fold the sides of the foil around the pan, doing so gently to prevent yourself from ripping the foil.






Repeat this procedure using a second sheet of aluminum foil with equal dimensions.






Crimp the foil around the edge of the pan.






Note that a springform pan is necessary. This pan is designed so that the sides can be separated from the bottom, making it easier to remove your cheesecake after it is done.;
, Place the graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush them into fine crumbs.


Alternatively, you could crush the graham crackers by pulsing them in a food processor or blender. This may actually allow you to achieve finer crumbs in a shorter period of time.
Transfer the crumbs to a large bowl when done.

, Mix the crumbs with the sugar and a pinch of salt first. Then, stir in the melted butter.


You could stir the butter into the crumbs using a wooden spoon, but your hands will do a more thorough job. Just make sure the wash them, first.






If using salted butter, skip the salt.

, Put all but 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the crust mixture into the pan. Pack the crumbs in gently, leaving a slight rise along the inside edge.


Leave roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of crust along the edge of the pan.
The remaining cup can be used to fill in any holes in the crust that form as you pack the crust or after you remove the finished cheesecake from the pan.






Use your hands to pack down the crust. Alternatively, you could use a metal measuring cup to get a smooth, even crust by packing the crumbs down with the bottom of the cup., Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. It may look slightly darker or glossier, but otherwise, there should be no visible change.

, If you plan on using the crust for a no-bake cheesecake, you must cool it first before filling it. Cool the crust for at least 1 to 2 hours. It should be no warmer than room temperature.


Note that you do not need to cool the crust if you plan on using it for a baked cheesecake.

, If you had baked your crust just prior to this, you will need to reduce the temperature of the oven.

, Cut room temperature cream cheese into chunks and beat with an electric mixer for 4 minutes on medium speed.

If possible, use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.






The cream cheese should become smooth and creamy when done.
Let the cream cheese sit out at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes prior to use to soften it up. Softening the cream cheese will allow it to become fluffier once you beat it.







, Add the sugar to the cream cheese and continue beating for another 4 minutes.

, Add each ingredient separately, beating for one minute after each addition. Each egg should also be added separately.


For best results, allow the eggs to sit out at room temperature for 10 to 30 minutes prior to use.

, Add one after the other, beat well until incorporated thoroughly.


Give the sides of the bowl a final scrape and beat the filling once more to incorporate anything scraped from the sides.







, Slowly pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan over the graham crust.


Smooth the top of the filling using a rubber or silicone spatula.

, Fill the roasting pan with enough boiling water to cover the bottom half of the springform pan.

Prepare 2 quarts (2 liters) of boiling water. You may not need all of it, though.






The water should not be high enough to leak over the top of the springform pan and into the batter.






Sitting the cheesecake in a hot water bath will reduce cracking. Without the hot water bath, the cheesecake filling is likely to form deep, unsightly cracks in the top as it solidifies.

, Place the cheesecake and water bath in the preheated oven and cook for a full 1 1/2 hours. The filling should seem fairly solid once done.

, Turn the oven off and crack the door open by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Let the cheesecake cool for the first hour in the oven.


This is a gentle cooling cycle that also helps prevent the cheesecake from cracking.

, Cover the top of the cheesecake with aluminum foil and chill for at least 4 hours before serving.


You could also chill the cheesecake overnight.

, Cube the softened cream cheese and place it in a large mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed for 3 to 4 minutes or until smooth.


The cream cheese must be at room temperature when you use it; otherwise it will not be fluffy enough after you beat it. Let the cream cheese sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes before use.

, Pour the condensed milk into the cream cheese a little at a time, beating well to incorporate it. Continue until all of the condensed milk is fully mixed in.


Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber or silicone spatula in between additions to make sure that all of the cream cheese and condensed milk gets mixed.







, Add the lemon juice and vanilla to the filling and beat well to fully incorporate. You may need to beat for another 1 minute or so.


Give the sides of the bowl a final scrape.

, Smooth the top surface of the filling with a rubber or silicone spatula.


Make sure that the crust is completely cool before adding the filling. Otherwise, you may have trouble cooling the filling properly.

, Cover the cheesecake and chill for 2 1/2 to 3 hours before serving.

, Combine standard cheesecake ingredients and bake in muffin tins, silicone liners, or ramekins.


Similarly, you could bake mini black-bottom cheesecakes by replacing the graham crackers with chocolate wafer cookies and baking the desserts in muffin tins.

, Replace the graham crackers with chocolate cookies and add semi-sweet chocolate to the filling.


For an even richer variation, make a brownie cheesecake by replacing the bottom crust with a layer of baked brownie. You can use this altered crust with a standard filling or a chocolate filling.
You could also bake a white chocolate cheesecake, instead. Just like chocolate cheesecake uses semi-sweet chocolate in the filling, white chocolate cheesecake uses white chocolate in the filling.

, Scatter chunks of caramel over the crust before adding the cream cheese filling. Once you finish baking the cheesecake, drizzle melted caramel over it for an even stronger caramel flavor.


Make your treat even more elaborate by turning it into a turtle cheesecake. The addition of pecans and chocolate chips can completely transform a caramel cheesecake into something even sweeter.

, Raspberry jam is swirled into the cream cheese filling before the cheesecake is baked, resulting in elegant swirls.

, Line your crust with chopped candy bars before pouring the filling in and baking the cheesecake as normal. Garnish with additional chocolate or candy pieces.


Try a Toblerone cheesecake as a variation on the candy bar cheesecake. Use melted Toblerone milk chocolate to create a rich chocolate filling and top the cheesecake with shavings or chunks of Toblerone chocolate bars.

Make a Butterfinger cheesecake, instead. Crushed Butterfinger candy bars are mixed into the filling and sprinkled on top of the finished cheesecake.

, Believe it or not, cheesecake can be turned into a vegan dish by using vegan cream cheese, silken tofu, vegan sour cream, and soy creamer. This cheesecake should be baked in the oven., You can prepare cheesecake using creamy goat cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream. This cheesecake will be slightly firmer and slightly tangier than a standard cheesecake.

, Certain seasonal flavors can be incorporated into you cheesecake with relative ease.


Finish Christmas dinner with a Christmas cheesecake. You can either prepare an eggnog and fruit cake cheesecake or a gingerbread cheesecake.
Polish off Thanksgiving dinner with a pumpkin spice cheesecake or cranberry cheesecake.
Finish any holiday meal with a chilled banana pudding cheesecake or a baked Bailey's cheesecake.

Reduce the oven temperature.",How to Bake a Simple Cheesecake1," Cheesecake is cooked in a springform pan set in a bath of water, which prevents the cheese filling from getting dry and cracked. To keep the water from getting into the pan, wrap a few layers of aluminum foil around the bottom and sides the pan. Crimp it around the rim of the pan, making sure it is securely fastened.Be sure not to tear any holes in the foil so that water won't leak in and get the crust wet.



 


If you'd prefer not to bake the cheesecake in a water bath, you can skip this step; however, the cheesecake will probably have a crack or two.





;
, Place the graham cracker crumbs, butter and sugar in a blender or food processor and pulse until they are thoroughly combined.

, Place the crust mixture in the pan and use the back of a spoon or your fingers to flatten it evenly across the bottom of the pan. It should rise up the sides of the pan about 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm).

, Place the crust in an oven preheated to 350 degrees. Bake it for about 10 minutes, until it becomes fragrant and turns slightly darker.

, The filling should bake at a slightly lower temperature; reduce it to 325 degrees while you prepare the remaining ingredients.

, If you plan to cook your cheesecake in a water bath, heat a small pot of water to boiling. Alternatively, heat a container of water in the microwave.

, Place the springform pan (still covered with water-tight aluminum foil) into a larger roasting pan. Pour the cake filling into the springform pan over the graham cracker crust. Use a spatula to spread it evenly. Finally, pour the hot water into the roasting pan so that it rises up the side of the springform pan an inch or two. Carefully pick up the roasting pan and place it in the oven. Bake the cake for 1 1/2 hours.


If you'd prefer to pour the water into the roasting pan after placing it in the oven, that's fine, too.






If you aren't using water to bake the cake, simply place the springform pan in the oven. Without water, the baking time is reduced; check the cake after about 45 minutes to see if it has set.







, When the cake is set, turn off the oven and open the door a few inches. Let the cake and the oven cool at the same time; this reduces the chance that the top of the cake will crack. After an hour or so, remove the cake from the oven, cover it with aluminum foil, and place it in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight."

Pour the glaze over the cake.",How to Decorate a Cheesecake1," It is best to decorate this cake just before you plan on serving it, so plan accordingly., Although not necessary, this will give the cheesecake extra flavor. It will also give the strawberries something to stick to., Use a paring knife to chop off the stems first, then to cut the strawberries into ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) thick slices. Leave one strawberry whole for the center.You can also choose to leave the strawberries whole.

, Staring from the edge of the cake, arrange the strawberries side-by-side, with the pointy ends facing out. Keep setting down the strawberries in rings, overlapping each one slightly, until you reach the center of the cake. The strawberries will start to stand up as you reach the center, sort of like a flower. Place the remaining, whole strawberry in the center.

If you are using whole strawberries, place the strawberries stem-side down onto the cake. You won't be able to overlap them.

, Whip the heavy whipping cream using an electric mixer or handheld beater until it starts to thicken. Add the powdered sugar, and continue to mix it until it forms stiff peaks.You can also use a food processor fitted with whisks for this step.

, It's okay if the frosting overlaps the strawberries a little. If you have any frosting left over, consider piping more ""starts"" around the base of the cake., Stir together the cornstarch and water in a small saucepan using a whisk. Add the jelly and cook over medium-high heat until the jelly has dissolved and the mixture thickened.

Choose something that will contrast nicely with your cheesecake. Cocoa powder will show up the best on plain cheesecake, but powdered sugar will show up nicely on a chocolate ganache-covered cheesecake.

You can create an ombre design by using three batches of cocoa powder. One batch is pure cocoa powder, while the other two have varying amounts of powdered sugar mixed into them., Hold a fine, mesh sieve over a sheet of wax paper. Pour your chosen powder into it, then tap it to sift the powder onto the wax paper. Carefully discard any clumps.If you are using more than one powder, sift the powder onto separate pieces of wax paper.
If you don't have any wax paper, you can use a plate instead.

, Gently press it against the surface of the cake so that it sticks., Place the powder back into the sieve. Hold the sieve over the cake, and gently tap it to sift your powder over the stencil. You can use as much or as little powder as you want. Keep in mind that if you use too thick of a layer, the design is more likely to ""smudge.""If there are bits of the stencil that are curling up, hold them down.If you are creating an ombre design: dust one third of the cake with pure cocoa powder, dust the next third with your cocoa powder and sugar mix, and the final third with your powdered sugar and cocoa mix., Hold the stencil as flat as you can so that the powder doesn't fall back onto the cake.

Use Golden, Spartan, McIntosh and Rome apples if you would prefer not to pre-bake them. These types of apples tend to break down quickly in an oven.
Use Granny Smiths, Honeycrisp or Gala apples if you would prefer to pre-bake apples. They are denser and may be too crisp if they are not pre-baked before adding them to the pastry.;

Use a mandolin to thinly slice the apples, if you are not planning on pre-cooking your apples. Thinner slices will bake down more quickly.
Cut slices with a knife, if you plan to pre-bake them. Pre-baked apples can be up to 1/2 inch (1.3cm) thick.

Choose to cook them on the stove, if you prefer apple pie filling that is less crispy. Place your apples in a Dutch oven heated to medium heat. #*Stir them occasionally while they heat for 10 minutes.
If you choose not to pre-cook your apples, mix them with the juice and zest of 1 lemon immediately after slicing them.

",How to Make Gourmet Chocolate Covered Apples2," If you don't have all the necessary equipment, you can try placing a glass or ceramic bowl into the water, but it may be a bit harder to work with. A double boiler slowly melts the chocolate, preventing it from bubbling up and burning to a crisp.


Add your chocolate chunks, stirring often. If it gets too hot, turn the heat down. Once they are near completely melted, remove from the heat, stirring until smooth and warm. Not hot.

The handy microwave is always an option. Heat on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway through. Note: With a microwave, there's a greater risk of scorching your chocolate.



, Raise it and allow the extra chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Roll it around, turning the stick, allowing every bit of the apple to get a nice, thorough coating.


If the bits next to the Popsicle stick are proving a bit hard to reach, grab a spoon and dash on a pinch to any hard to reach spots. Even it out; the layering should be equal on all sides.

, You may have to use your hands and get in there to ensure the entire apple is coated evenly. If the topping is dripping off under the weight, pat it down on each side.


If you're using a drizzle, place the apples on the cookie sheet, Popsicle stick up. Then, simply take a spoonful of your drizzle and hold it about six inches (15 cm) above your apples, creating lines of varying thickness across the paper.

, The Popsicle sticks should be pointing up. Put it into the refrigerator to chill, until the chocolate is set.

You can also sift the ingredients together into a bowl, but whisking is faster.

, Use a pastry cutter, fork, or your hands to cut the butter into the dry mixture. Cutting in simply means combining the butter with the flour till it reaches a crumbly sandy texture.

Switch up your fruit.,
Use oats in the topping.,
Add nuts.,
Serve with whipped cream, ice cream, or crème anglaise.",How to Make Apple Crumble2," You can make crumbles all year using seasonally fresh produce. Try blackberries and strawberries during the summer or pears and rhubarb during the spring. If you use fruit that is considerably tarter, you may need to adjust the sugar. For example, rhubarb will require extra sugar.


Frozen fruit can also be used in crumbles. Don't thaw before covering it with crumble topping. Simply top and bake.

, To add a heftier chewy texture to your crumble topping, consider adding oats. Replace half of the flour with oats. This will give your crumble a bit of a granola taste.


Remember to keep some flour in your topping, even when using oats. Flour acts as a binder and keeps the topping together. It will also help soak up juices from the fruit.

, Nuts can add flavor, nutrition, and crunch to a crumble. Use your favorite nut, or try pecans, walnuts, or hazelnuts. They're best if you use roasted nuts and chop them before adding them to the topping.


Make sure nuts are well mixed into the crumble topping. If simply scattered over the topping, they're likely to burn.

, While apple crumble is great on its own, try adding a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream over it. Or pour crème anglaise, a rich creamy custard, over the warm crumble.


You don't have to stick to vanilla ice cream. Apple crumbles work well with caramel or dulce de leche ice cream.

Place equal amounts of cooking oil and all purpose flour in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat (1/2 cup is about right for this dish). Stir continuously until the flour is browned, keeping it from overcooking or scorching. The color of the roux is very important. A good Etouffee roux should be the color of shelled pecans.

, This is very important to stop the roux from continuing to cook and burning.

,, Simmer until the roux is completely dissolved and the liquid in the pot is thickened. It should be the consistency of a regular gravy, without lumps and uniform in color and texture.

Lightly dredge the fish in flour to help the batter stick.,
Dunk a piece of fish in the batter with tongs, coating completely.,
Still holding by the tail, dip the fish in the hot oil, swirling it around until the outside sets.,
Cook each fish until golden brown, roughly 2-3 minutes.,
Drain everything on newspaper (or paper towels) and liberally add salt.",How to Make Fish and Chips," You can cut the fries any width you want, but try to keep them all a uniform thickness. This helps them cook evenly. To get good chips, use a V-slicer with a wide blade,or simply use your hands:


Rinse and scrub the outside of the potatoes to remove dirt. Leave the skin.
Cut the potato in half, lengthwise.
Take your two halves and cut them in half again, this time through the sides. You should be left with four ""planks"" of potato.
Cut these planks into strips.
Cut the strips, if desired, into shorter individual fries.;
, This slightly tenderizes them, giving them more moisture inside so that you get a creamier texture inside the chips. If you do soak them, drain them of water and pat dry with paper towels before proceeding.


These fries could even soak overnight if you feel like working in advance.
Make sure, if you plan to soak the potatoes, the oil isn't burning on your stove!, A large dutch oven or a deep-fryer will work best. You will need to know how hot the oil is to get the best results, as the fries and fish need to cook at different temperatures for both to come out fully cooked but still tender.


If you don't have a thermometer, but want to go for it anyway, use medium heat for 325F and medium high for 372F (needed later). Give the oil 2-3 minutes to adjust when changing temperature., When they come out, they will be pale and floppy. This is good! They shouldn't be completely cooked the first time, as this leads to soggy, not so delicious chips., Remove the chips from the hot oil and drain them on a plate full of paper towels. You'll re-fry the chips again after the fish has cooked, which will get them golden brown and delicious.


The reason for a double-fry is surprisingly complex: water in the potato is bound up in the starch, with less water in the outer edges that you cut through and more in the centers. In the first fry, this water is driven out, but the water in the center only makes it to the edge of the potato, where it forms a coating with the oil and starch as it cools to room temperature. The second fry crisps up this , You can use any type of fish you like; in the U.K. they usually use cod for their fish and chips. If your fish has been in the freezer, take it out and put it in your fridge overnight so it thaws out, but stays cool and fresh.

, Turn up to medium and let the oil get nice and hot while you prepare the batter for the fish fry. The oil should not be dirty from the potatoes, as it takes a while to overuse oil, but if it is discolored then you should replace the oil and re-heat it., If you're in a rush, you don't need to actually let the batter sit, though this does help the flavors blend slightly. You'll not that the ingredients have two different liquid components -- a beer-batter and a more traditional egg + water batter. One cup of milk or buttermilk could also be substituted, depending on your tastes and kitchen supplies.


The batter will be thin and liquidy -- this is fine.
This recipe uses 2 cups of flour. Save the other 1/2 cup for the next step., The oil should be 375F, and the potatoes should be room temperature. This method will develop the delicious, golden-brown crunch of great chips. Most cooks will remove the potatoes from the oil before proceeding, keeping them hot in the oven after draining once more on paper towels.


Adventurous cooks can go the traditional way and cook the fish on the potatoes. To do so, skip ahead and prepare the fish, then add the potatoes right before you add the fish in. Remove together and drain at the same time., Simply dust the fish in flour, as this will help the liquid batter stick to the fish instead of sliding right off. You can also use cornmeal or rice flour to help the batter adhere.


The entire fish should be dusted with flour when done.

, Hold it by the tail to ensure most of the fish gets coated. You just want to work with one piece at a time. This is a thin batter that will try to slip off the slick fish quickly, so it's best to focus on one at at time.

, As it hits the hot oil, the batter should rapidly cook and harden onto the outside of the fish. If you just drop it in, however, any batter not touching the hot oil will ""melt"" right off in the oil and won't stick to the fish.

, After you've gotten the first piece in, you can move on to the other pieces until that one is done. Remember to work quickly, and get the pieces out before they burn. If the outside looks tasty and golden-brown, you're good to go., The traditional English dish drains paper towels, then rolls everything into a cone on the greasy paper and serves the fish with a bit of salt and paper. You can also drain on oven racks or with paper towels, of course. Enjoy with malt vinegar or tartar sauce.Add the salt while everything is still hot to help it spread out better.

Serve the jello.",How to Make Jello1," Keep whisking until no powdery granules remain, about 2 to 3 minutes.


If you are using a larger, 6-ounce (170 grams) packet of jello, use 2 cups (475 milliliters) of hot water instead.
This recipe uses the sweetened, flavored jello packets. If you are working with regular gelatin, click here to learn how to make jello from scratch.;
, If you'd like to make the jello set faster, use enough ice cubes to fill 1 cup (240 milliliters). Keep in mind that the jello will start to set up rapidly, so you will need to work quickly.If you are using a larger, 6-ounce (170 grams) packet of jello, use 2 cups (475 milliliters) of cold water.

, Once you add the fruit, give the jello a quick stir to disperse the fruit. You can use a baking pan, a bowl, or even a fancy jello mold. You can also use any type of fruit you'd like. Grapes, berries, and orange pieces are great choices!


If you are using a baking pan, choose one that is 9 by 12 inches (22.86 by 30.48 centimeters) or 8 by 8 inches (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters). This is great if you plan to cut the jello into fun shapes using cookie cutters.
If you are using a fancy jello mold and would like to add some fruit, fill the mold with ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of jello first, then add your desired fruit. Fill the mold the rest of the way with more jello; don't stir the fruit. This will give you a pretty design at the top of the mold.

, Depending on how cold your fridge is and how much jello you made, this can take overnight. You can test if the jello is ready by pressing your finger against it. If the jello sticks to your finger, it's not ready. If it doesn't stick to your finger, it's ready.

, Dip the mold all the way up to its rim in warm water. Wait 10 seconds, then flip the jello out of its mold and onto a plate. If it doesn't come out easily, dip the mold into warm water for another 10 seconds.


If you poured the jello into individual bowls, you don't have to de-mold it.
If you poured the jello into a baking pan, you can cut it into cubes, or use cookie cutters to make fun shapes. If you are having trouble getting the shapes out, dip the bottom of the pan into warm water for 10 seconds.
If you poured the jello into a large bowl, you can scoop it out using a melon scoop to make little jello balls. Serve the jello balls in a separate bowl.

, You can serve it as is, or garnish it with some whipped cream or pieces of fruit.

",How to Make Jello Juice," You can get these very cheap at such places as Walmart or in your local grocery store. Check it out in the frozen foods isle. For a rainbow experience of flavours, get several different kinds. Perhaps some cherry, lime, and grape mixes? De-lish!;
, Although not much room is needed for this task, still, when working in the kitchen and getting a bit messy, it's always easier for you to tidy up in the beginning, than for you to clean up what looks like tornado wreckage after words. After setting aside a few things, let the fun commence!

, There are two ways. The easier first way is for those who want a single flavour per glass. Just rip open your package, and begin to pour the grainy contents into a large glass (or glasses). Now, how much you put in, is another question. But you really don't need too much. Start with a little, and if it's not sweet enough, add some more.

, Filtered is usually best, although it really doesn't matter. Some folks even boil their water first, but this only firms the jello when you add ice, so if that's what you're going for, be my guest!

, The little bitty contents of the jello will linger around for a bit, so it's best to mix em' for a minute or two.

, Garnish however you please. Maybe take some whipped cream on top, put some sprinkles on that bad boy. Or, for a refreshing serenade, add some ice and lemon. Throw a fruity umbrella in there and you're set for the beach!

, This is for all you rainbow/science lovers out there. This is also fun to do with kids. Read on.

, Put in the exact same amount of water in each one. Around four centimetres or around there should do it. Now, take a small tablespoon and take a large amount of a chosen flavour. For white/clear, use sugar for this part. This is the bottom layer. Put in the most jello powder in one container and mix until it disappears.

, This is decreasing the fluid's density. The lightest on the top, heaviest on the bottom. (It is best not to put dark colours with each other.)

, Carefully, along the edge of the glass and close to the bottom, allow it to slowly drip until the baster is empty.

, You might want to save up most of the jello, as this is extremely frustrating. But the end result is indeed worth the wait.

, At least until you drink it. If your last two colours are dark ones, such as blue and purple, maybe add a white sugared layer in between to show of the vibrant layers. And don't fuss over it, really, in the end it's just a drink. And a cool/yummy science experiment!

, Whipped cream and lemon slices look good, great for summers. Don't add ice to this variation though, your hard work would mix together!

Grab a bowl, and pour some fruit juice into it.,
Put a few gummy bears into the bowl.,
Leave the gummy bears in the bowl and wait for 1-2 hours.,
Pour the juice from the bowl into a separate container.,
Serve your newly made jello bears.",How to Make Jello Bears," Try different options such as apple juice, berry juice, etc. If you don't have any, then water may work as well, although this may make the final result taste a bit bland.;
, Keep in mind that gummy bears aren't the only things that can work in this project! You may also try other gummy candy such as gummy worms, gummy frogs — anything gummy!

, If you want them to be softer in the end, then you may want to prolong the time. Don't let them sit for too long though, as this may dissolve the bears altogether.

, The gummy bears in the bowl should absorb the juice and become soft. They should also double or triple in size. This happens because water molecules move into the bears by means of osmosis, expanding (and softening) them in the process.

, They make a great treat for children!

Remove the gelato when it is still half frozen.,
Place the half-frozen gelato in the freezer.,
Thaw the gelato slightly before enjoying.",How to Make Gelato," The pan should be large enough to hold a smaller heatproof bowl., Place 2 bowls or other containers on a flat, clean surface. One container is for the egg whites and the other is for the yolks. Holding 1 cupped hand over the first container with your fingers spread slightly apart, crack an egg over your hand, letting the whites slip through the gaps between your fingers, but not the yolk. When all of the egg white has passed through your fingers and into the container, leaving only the yolk, place the yolk in the other container. Repeat the process for all 5 eggs.

, Place it in a saucepan over medium high heat. Heat it until it begins to bubble, then reduce the heat slightly.

, Do this while the milk is heating, since you'll need to combine the ingredients quickly. Beat the eggs and sugar until the mixture is smooth and silky.


The mixture is ready when it's slightly thick. Beat for at least 2 minutes.
If you're using an extract like vanilla or almond, add it to the egg mixture.

, Pour the milk in slowly while the beaters are running. Don't add it too quickly, since the temperature of the milk might scramble the eggs. Keep beating until the mixture is thick and creamy.

, Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture continuously as it gently cooks. It will begin to thicken into a custard. The mixture is ready to remove from heat when it coats the back of the spoon as you lift it from the bowl. Remove it from heat and let it cool.


Don't let any water get into the bowl. This will affect the texture of the custard and may prevent it from cooking evenly.
Use a wooden spoon, rather than a metal one. The metal may taint the flavor of the custard.

, Once the base has been prepared, there is no limit to the flavors that can be added to the gelato. Consider adding fruit, chocolate, caramel, and mix-ins to deepen the gelato's flavor profile.


For a fruit flavored gelato, prepare a puree of the fruit or berry of your choice, adding it to the gelato while still at room temperature.
Create a vanilla gelato by splitting a vanilla bean down the center and adding it to the cream prior to boiling. Remove the bean once you begin to combine the eggs with the cream.
A chocolate gelato can be prepared by adding melted chocolate to the gelato base. Let the chocolate cool slightly prior to adding it to the gelato base.

, Complete your gelato by adding some mix-ins to create different textures and flavors. Choose mix-ins that complement the flavors you used in your gelato based.


You could add chopped fresh fruit or dried fruit to your gelato. Choose fruit that is overripe for the best flavor.Chopped nuts or cacao nibs would add some nice crunch.
Consider a spoonful of cinnamon or another spice you like.
Chopped candies also add a delicious touch.

, Cover the bowl of gelato with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator for about 3 hours to give it time to cool down before you put it in your ice cream freezer.

, Freeze it according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, This ensures that the gelato will stay dense, rather than airy. Gelato should not be as light and airy as ice cream.

, Continue freezing the gelato until it is solid.

, Letting it thaw a bit before taking a bite will prevent the gelato from being too cold on your tongue. This way you'll be able to taste the intense flavors that much better."

If you are vegan/vegetarian and would like a more firm jello, use 2 teaspoons of Agar powder. You can also use 2 ounces of carrageenan instead., The water should be very hot, but not yet boiling. This will soften the gelatin and make it more liquidy. Don't worry, the jello will thicken back up again.

, You can use just one type of fruit juice, or you could use two different types of fruit juice for a more unique flavor. Apple, grape, orange, or pineapple juice are all great options.Take caution when using pineapple juice. Some people find that the enzymes in it prevent the jello from setting properly.
Give the jello a taste. If it is not sweet enough for you, add some sweetener, such as agave, sugar, or stevia.

, Just about any type of fruit goes well in jello, including blueberries, orange slices, pineapple, and strawberries.After you add the fruit, give it a quick stir.


If you want to cut the jello into cubes or fun shapes, pour the jello into a 9 by 12 inch (22.86 by 30.48 centimeters) or 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) baking pan.
If you'd like to add fruit to a fancy mold, fill the mold with ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of the jello mixture first, then add the fruit. Fill the mold the rest of the way with the rest of the jello mixture; don't stir. This will help create a nicer design., You can also leave it there overnight. You can test whether or not the jello is ready by pressing your finger gently against it. If the jello sticks to your finger, it's not ready and needs to be refrigerated longer. If your finger comes out clean, the jello is ready., You can serve the jello as it is, or with a dollop of whipped cream.You can also garnish it with extra fruit as well.


If you chilled the jello in a baking pan, cut it into cubes or use a cookie cutter to make some fun shapes.

",How to Make Gelatin Molds with Decorations Inside," The shape of the mold you choose is almost as important as the flavor and the decoration inside. You could use a simple household item, like a bowl, or go for something fancier. Consider the following options:


A bowl with an interesting shape. Instead of using a basic round bowl, choose one that has unique indentations or a pattern of some kind.
Individual molds. You can make several small molds using dessert cups or ramekins.
A vintage gelatin mold. Check out antique stores to find molds in interesting shapes and sizes.;
, Choose a flavor (and color) that will contrast well with the object you want to suspend in the gelatin. For example, if you're suspending a decoration that is dark in color, choose lemon or orange gelatin, which are light enough to see through clearly.


Choose a color that won't cause the object inside to look unappealing. If you're using a decorative object that is purple, for example, using a yellow gelatin will make it look brown.
You can also make your own flavor and color combination: buy clear flavorless gelatin, and add a few drops of food coloring and essential oil when you make the gelatin.

, All kinds of objects may be used to decorate gelatin. Choose an object that fits with your party's theme and coordinates well with the color of your gelatin. Other factors to consider include the following:


Make sure the object is lightweight enough to be suspended in gelatin. Heavy objects may simply sink to the bottom. Flowers, small plastic or rubber toys, or fruit that has been carved into a decorative shape are all good options.
Use a decoration that is composed of parts that won't fall apart or dissolve when heated. You don't want to choose something made of wood, cloth, or another soft, porous material.
The decoration should be somewhat appetizing. Decorative gelatin molds are made to be eaten, and if you want people to enjoy it you should choose a decoration that doesn't put people off. The only exception is if you want to make a gelatin mold as a Halloween decoration; in that case, go crazy with rubber spiders and snakes.
Most importantly, choose a decoration that is nontoxic. This is extremely important, since you'll be pouring hot liquid gelatin over the object, which will distribute particles of the item throughout the mold. Fresh flowers and fruit are a safe bet. If you want to use a plastic or rubber toy, choose one that's nontoxic; items that are safe for a baby or toddler to chew on are safe enough to use in a gelatin mold.

, If you're using fresh flowers, rinse them well in cold water. For any type of plastic or rubber decoration, scrub it well with hot, soapy water, then rinse it again in hot water.


If you're using an object that can be boiled, sanitize it by placing it in boiling water for a few minutes before proceeding.
If you're using fruit that hasn't been peeled, wash the outside of the fruit well.

, Read the instructions on the gelatin package to find out how it should be prepared. In most cases you will need to boil water, then add the contents of the gelatin packet and stir.

, Use a bowl, a fancy vintage mold, or individual cups or ramekins.

, Set the object in the center of the mold, or position it wherever you like. Be sure it is completely submerged.


If the object bobs to the top, try weighting it down by tying it to a heavier object, like a small knife or spoon. Choose a weight that is as slim and discreet as possible.
If you plan to invert the gelatin onto a plate when it's ready, you might want to place the object upside down. When you invert the mold, the object will be right side up.

, Follow the instructions on the gelatin package to determine how long it should stay in the refrigerator. Resist the temptation to take it out early, since you could accidentally spoil the decorative effect.

, When the gelatin is thoroughly chilled and set, it's ready to serve. Either serve it in the container you made it in or carefully invert it onto a serving plate or into individual cups.

Remove your cheesecake from the pan.,Serve and enjoy!",How to Make a Baked Cheesecake," Cheesecakes are notoriously crumbly, so choosing the right pan will ensure that your cheesecake comes out smoothly when you take it out of the pan. For the best outcome, use a springform pan. This sort of pan is comprised of round cake pan with a removable bottom. It is all held together by a sprung collar., For the best cheesecake you’ve ever eaten, you’ll need to bake it surrounded by boiling water (this will be discussed in Part Three). To avoid any water leaking into your pan and ruining your crust, you will need to wrap the pan with hole-free aluminum foil. Place a piece of foil under the pan and then wrap it upwards and fold it so that the foil rests along the edge of the pan but doesn’t fold over the lip.If needed, use a second piece of foil to cover any spots that the first piece missed.

, Once you have done this, preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C)(176c). While the oven is preheating, place the graham crackers into a blender or food processor. Make sure that the lid is tightly secured and pulse the crackers until they reach a finely ground texture.

, Use a spatula to stir in the salt and sugar, making sure that all of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Melt the butter in the microwave or on the stove and then add it to the mixture. Wash your hands and use them to mix the ingredients together using a folding movement until all the ingredients are well mixed.If you chose to use salted butter, you should not have to add the pinch of salt called for in this step.

, Save about ¼ cup of the mixture to use later if need be (you can use it if you discover any holes in your crust once you remove it from the pan). Press the crust down with your hands, making sure that there are no holes. The result should be an even layer of crust that ever so slightly curves up along the edges of the pan.


While pressing the crust into the pan, make sure that you do not accidentally tear any of the foil. If you do notice a tear, replace it with a different piece of tin foil.

, The crust will need to harden up a bit--putting it in the oven for 10 minutes should achieve the desired texture. Once the 10 minutes have passed, remove the pan from the oven and turn the oven temperature down to 325°F (163C). Let the crust cool for several minutes.

, One by one, cut away a chunk of the cream cheese and place it into the bowl of your electric mixture. Use the paddle attachment of your electric mixture to get the creamiest texture. Mix the cream cheese for four minutes on a medium speed--the result should be a smooth texture.


If you don’t have an electric mixture, place the cream cheese in a large bowl and use a handheld electric mixer to stir it up.

, Pour your sugar into the bowl and mix the two ingredients together for four minutes. Your mixture should be set to a medium speed. Repeat this process with the vanilla and salt. Add one ingredient and then mix for four minutes. Then add the other ingredient and mix for four minutes., When you add one egg, turn the mixer on and beat it for one minute. Repeat this process with the three remaining eggs. Use a spatula to scrape along the insides and bottom of the mixing bowl. This is important to do because large chunks of cream cheese can get stuck in these areas. Next, add the sour cream and mix thoroughly. Follow this up with the heavy cream, which you should also mix until the ingredients are all blended together.

, Make sure that you scoop out all of the filling while also making sure that it doesn’t overflow the pan. Once it is in the pan, use a spatula to make the top smooth., Bring two quarts of water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, carefully pour it into the roasting pan so that the water reaches about halfway up the side of the springboard pan. While this might sound like an odd instruction, you are actually giving the cake a water bath that will help the filling to cook without cracking the crust., Set your timer for one and a half hours and let your delicious cheesecake bake. After the baking time has passed, open the oven and gently shake the cheesecake back and forth to ensure doneness. The cake should wiggle slightly in the center and should be firm around the edge. The center will firm up as the cake cools.

, Open the door of the oven so that it is about an inch open. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven as the oven cools, which should take about one hour. This sort of slow, gentle cooling will make sure that the crust doesn’t crack in the face of the cold air outside the oven.

, You will want to leave it in the fridge for a minimum of four hours. The cold temperature will help the cheesecake to firm up.


Some dessert chefs believe the cheesecake should be cooled uncovered for two to three hours. Chilling the cheesecake this way also helps to disperse the moisture that would otherwise form on the top of the cheesecake., Once it has chilled thoroughly, you can slide a spatula along the inside of the pan to separate the crust and cake from the pan. You must wait to do this until after the cheesecake has cooled or else you run the high risk of separating the cheesecake from its crust. Open the springform latch and gently remove the sides, leaving the cheesecake in all its glory.,"

, You can use all-purpose flour, but cake flour will give you even better results.Stir them briskly together using a fork or whisk until they are evenly combined.

, Cut the butter into ¼-inch (0.64 centimeter) thick slices first, then combine it with the flour mixture. You can do this using a pastry blender, two crisscrossing knives, or in a food processor. The crumbs should be no larger than small peas.


For best results, use cold butter straight from the fridge., Combine the two using a fork or rubber spatula. Do not overwork the dough, or the butter will become too soft.

, Once the dough has come together, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and gently pat it into a 6-inch (15.24 centimeters) wide disk. Wrap it up with some plastic wrap, and put it into the fridge for at least 30 to 60 minutes or overnight. The dough must be cold before you roll it out.

, Dust the dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking., Gently pat the dough against the bottom and the sides of the pan. Trim off any excess, overhanging dough until it is ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters) above the rim.This will prevent any shrinking.


Try to use a fluted tart tin with a removable bottom. If you absolutely cannot find one, you can use a regular tart tin; you just won't be able to take the tart out of the tin at all.

, The pierced holes will prevent the dough from fluffing up during baking. Again, the dough must be properly chilled before you bake it; it would have softened up considerably during all that rolling.


Alternatively, you can line the crust with tin foil or parchment paper just before baking, and fill it with pie weights, uncooked rice, or dried, uncooked beans.

, Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C), and make sure that the baking rack is in the bottom third of the oven. Once the oven is hot enough, place the crust inside and bake it for 25 minutes, or until it turns golden brown.

, Once the crust is completely baked, take it out of the oven and place it onto a wire rack to cool off. Do not remove the crust from the tin.

, You can do this using an electric stand mixer, a handheld mixer, or even a food processor. You can also do it by hand, but it will take longer.

, Slowly beat in the confectioner's sugar, a little bit at a time. Beat the mixture well after each addition of sugar.

, Keep the crust inside the tin. Use a rubber spatula to spread the cream over the top of the crust.

, Cut the stems off of the strawberries first, then cut them into ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) thick slices, from top to bottom. Arrange the strawberries on top of the cream in a tight spiral. Start the outside of the tart first, then work your way inward in a tight spiral. Overlap each new row by a little, like scales., Put the jelly into a small saucepan. Cook it over medium-low heat until it turns liquid, about 3 minutes., It might also be a good idea to let the glaze set at room temperature first (about20 minutes) before refrigerating it.

, Gently loosen the sides of the tart tin first. Once the sides come off, carefully transfer the tart to a plate using a spatula.If your tart tin does not have a removable bottom, serve it straight from the tin. If you try to remove it, the crust may break. Simply cut three slices, and serve the center one first.

, Whisk the ingredients together until everything is smooth and evenly combined. Do not add the rest of the milk just yet., Stir the milk while you pour it in, and be careful not to pour it in all at once. If you pour it in too fast, you will cook the eggs.

, Stir the mixture constantly to prevent a skin from forming on top. The cream is ready when it turns thick, like pudding., Place a strainer over a large bowl. Pour the cooked mixture through it and discard any cooked egg bits. Whisk in the heavy cream until everything is combined. There should be no streaks or swirls.

, Be sure to press the plastic wrap right against the cream. This will prevent a skin from forming on top., Once the cream is chilled, take it out of the fridge and remove the plastic wrap. Beat it vigorously with a whisk, then spread it over the pastry crust using a rubber spatula. Do not remove the crust from the tin just yet.

, Chop the stems off of the strawberries, then cut them into ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) thick slices from top to bottom. Arrange the strawberries on top of the cream in a tight spiral, starting from the outer edge and working your way inward. Overlap each new row of strawberries like scales., This will allow the pastry cream to finish setting and turn solid., Loosen the sides of the tart tin first, then let them fall to the table. Gently transfer the tart to a plate using a spatula.If your tart tin does not have a removable bottom, serve it in the tin. Cut three slices first, then serve the middle one first.

Use gloves.,

Add the liquid nitrogen.,
Serve the ice cream.",How to Make Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream," Liquid nitrogen is 320 degrees below zero, so it's important to take certain precautions to avoid frost burns and other injuries. Make sure that you always wear gloves when handling the liquid nitrogen.


Admittedly, it is okay if the liquid nitrogen comes into contact with your skin briefly. In most cases, it will just slide right off your skin. The real danger comes when you try to contain it, like in a fist, or if your skin is already wet. Just be very cautious when handling it.;
, You definitely don't want to get the liquid nitrogen in your eyes. So be very careful when mixing, but still wear protective eye gear just to be safe. Liquid nitrogen is so cold that it can make your finger shatter; just imagine what it could do to your eyes., You want to always be in control of where the liquid nitrogen ends up, so try not to splash it as you're mixing it or when you're carrying it in the container.

, Multiply the amount of ice cream by 5 to find out how much liquid nitrogen you need. For example, one gallon of ice cream requires five gallons of liquid nitrogen.

, This might not be as easy as it sounds. Since liquid nitrogen has to be stored and transported carefully (and because it is somewhat dangerous), you can't just buy it at any old grocery store. Look in your local Yellow Pages to see if there is a liquid nitrogen supplier listed.You might also try calling a dermatologist to ask them where they purchase the liquid nitrogen they use for burning off warts.
You could try calling a local high school or college chemistry department to see where they get their liquid nitrogen for science experiments.
Some farmers and welders also use liquid nitrogen, so you might try calling people in those professions., Liquid nitrogen is usually held in a special container called a Dewar that helps prevent it from evaporating. You'll need a container like this to transport your liquid nitrogen to your home. But most places that sell liquid nitrogen will let you rent or borrow a Dewar for relatively cheap. Each Dewar usually holds about 5 liters (1 US gal) of liquid nitrogen.

,, Using a wooden spoon or stainless steel whisk, mix all of the ingredients together until the sugar has dissolved. If you can still feel some sugar at the bottom, you need to keep stirring.

Add these seeds to the milk, with the scraped bean pod. Take the saucepan off the heat, cover with a lid, and allow infusing for at least an hour.


You can tell if a vanilla bean is good quality by smelling it. You should be able to smell the vanilla. Don't be fooled by the plumpness of the bean -- a plump bean doesn't automatically equal more flavor, it may just have a high water content.
If the bean smells smoky, this means the bean was not left to dry out properly, rather it was quickly flash dried over a fire. If this is the case, the vanilla beans are probably not of a high quality.;
, Next, you will need to chill the heavy cream in an ice bath. You can make an ice bath by filling a large bowl halfway with icy water. Place a smaller bowl into the water, into which you will strain the cream. Let the heavy cream sit in the ice bowl until cooled.

, In a large, clean bowl, whisk the egg yolks until combined. Take the vanilla-infused milk mixture and warm it up again. Once it is warm, gradually stir it into the bowl with the egg yolks, adding a little at a time and whisking constantly to combine. Once all the milk has been combined with the yolks, pour this mixture back into the saucepan.


Place the saucepan on a low heat and stir the custard constantly. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the saucepan with a spoon or spatula to prevent any of the mixture from sticking. When the custard forms a light coat on the back of the spoon or spatula, it is ready.
Depending on how rich you want your custard to be, you can add up to three more egg yolks.

, Pour the custard mixture through the strainer, into the heavy cream in the ice bath. Remove the strainer and stir to combine. When the mixture has cooled fully, add in the vanilla extract, cover the bowl, and place in the refrigerator. Leave for several hours or overnight, if possible.


There are three main types of vanilla extract: Bourbon, Tahitian and Mexican. Each has a slightly different flavor. Bourbon vanilla is from Madagascar and has a strong, bold flavor; Tahitian vanilla is floral, while real Mexican vanilla is creamy-tasting, with a pronounced flavor.
Always use a vanilla essence with an alcohol base. The alcohol, even if burned off during cooking, enhances the flavor of the vanilla extract.
For a lighter custard, you can replace the heavy cream with half-and-half. Just be aware that your ice cream will turn out less smooth as a result.

, Remove the vanilla bean and spoon the mixture into your ice cream maker. From this point, you can follow the manufacturer's instructions to find out how to freeze the ice cream mixture in your particular machine.

, Serve your homemade vanilla ice cream straight from the ice cream maker or store in an airtight container in the freezer to create a firmer ice cream.

Place in an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled, preferably overnight.

, Stir the mixture vigorously with a rubber spatula. Transfer the mixture to a freezer-safe bowl or container (if not already in one). Cover tightly with plastic wrap or an airtight cover. Place in the freezer.

, Once the edges of the mixture have begun to freeze, remove it from the freezer, and stir it well with a handheld mixer. Make sure that you break up any frozen bits, as this is what will give your ice cream a smooth consistency. Cover and return to freezer for two to three hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so while the mixture freezes.


You can also use a spatula, wire whisk, or a stick-blender to stir the mixture, however using these methods will require a little more elbow grease. Use a handheld mixer for the best, smoothest results.
Stirring the ice cream mixture while it freezes is important when making ice cream without an ice cream maker. If you just leave the ice cream mixture in the freezer until it is frozen, you will end with a solid block of icy dairy, which is lumpy and difficult to scoop.
Mixing the ice cream while it freezes prevents large ice crystals from forming and produces a smooth and creamy ice cream.

, The mixture should be thick but still too soft to scoop, almost like soft-serve ice cream.


If the ice cream is not thick enough, return it to the freezer for additional freezing time before beating again.
If the ice cream has thickened properly, you can stir in any additional ingredients at this point, such as chocolate chips or cookie chunks.

, Make sure to leave at least a 1/2-inch of space at the top. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer. Allow the ice cream to freeze until firm.


Serve your vanilla ice cream on its own or as an accompaniment to warm fruit pies or chocolate cake.

Transfer your ice cream to a container and freeze for 4 hours.",How to Make Ice Cream with Milk3," Shake the cans of coconut milk up vigorously before opening them. Measure out ½ cup of it and set this aside for now. Pour the remaining coconut milk into a saucepan.


Coconut milk separates inside the can, so giving it a good shake before using it will reincorporate the liquid with the solid elements.

, Measure out agave, maple syrup, honey or sugar for your ice cream, depending on which you like the best. Add this to the saucepan. Measure out the salt and add that too.

, Turn your stove’s burner to medium-low heat. Stir the coconut milk mixture as it warms up. Keep stirring until the mixture is warmed through and the sweetener is completely dissolved. This should take 1-2 minutes.

, Put the cornstarch in a small bowl with the ½ cup coconut milk you reserved. Whisk it briskly. Keep whisking until the cornstarch is completely dissolved.

, Add the cornstarch mixture to the saucepan with the warm, sweetened coconut milk. Whisk gently to incorporate the two.

, Increase the heat and stir the mixture as it begins to cook and thicken. Keep stirring until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. This should take anywhere from 6-8 minutes. Keep your eye on it and don’t let it come to a boil.

, Once your base has thickened, turn off the burner and move the saucepan off the heating element. Add the vanilla to the base and stir to incorporate them. Allow the base to cool for a few minutes.

, Transfer the base to a shallow container. Cover the container with plastic wrap. Refrigerate it for at least 4 hours or up to 3 days.

, Remove the container from the fridge and take off the plastic covering. The base should have a texture similar to pudding at this point. Pour it into your ice cream maker and start churning. You want the base to thicken quite a bit, until it reaches a similar consistence to soft serve ice cream.


Every machine is different, but this should take between 10 and 20 minutes.
Add any extras you want at the very end of the churning session, then churn a few more seconds.

, Scrape the ice cream from the maker’s bowl into a freezer container with a resealable lid. Cover it with a piece of wax or parchment paper, which will protect it from ice crystal formations. Freeze it for 4 hours, until the mixture hardens, and then serve.


You may want to remove it from the freezer and place it on the counter for a few minutes to defrost slightly before scooping it.

If you forgot or didn't get to freeze the bowl, make the ice cream base first. Put the base into the fridge and the ice cream maker bowl into the freezer. Churn the ice cream the next day.


Philadelphia-style ice cream is egg-free. It has a light and delicate texture and flavor. It is also quicker to make, compared to French-style ice cream.;
, Even though you won't be cooking the ice cream base, you still want it to be as cold as possible. Fill your sink with enough cold water and ice so that it comes up ½ to ⅔ of the way up the side of your mixing bowl. The ice bath should be more ice than water.

, Pour both into a large bowl or saucepan, and stir them together. Make sure that you have enough room for the sugar as well.

, This will take about 3 to 4 minutes. Taste the mixture and make sure that it doesn't feel grainy. If you are using a glass bowl, look at the bottom and make sure that there are no grains of sugar.

, At this point, you can also add in other flavoring extracts or oils.

, Set the bowl down into the sink. Make sure that the ice comes up ½ to ⅔ of the way up the sides of the bowl. Leave the bowl in the ice bath for 30 to 45 minutes.

, Take the bowl out of the ice bath. Place a sheet of plastic wrap right onto the surface of the mixture. Put it in the fridge, and leave it there for 3 to 24 hours.

, Most types of ice cream machines have a bowl that needs to be frozen for several hours. If you forgot or didn't get a chance to freeze the bowl, prepare the base as instructed in the following steps. Put the base into the fridge and the bowl in the freezer, then churn it the following day.


French-style ice cream is also called custard style. It is made with egg yolks, which gives the ice cream a smooth, rich, and creamy taste and texture., Place a large bowl into a sink. Fill the sink with enough ice and cold water to reach ½ to ⅔ of the way up the side of the bowl. Place a strainer over the bowl.


The ice bath should be more ""ice"" than ""water.""
You will be tempering the eggs to reduce curdling, but some curdles may form. The strainer will catch them.

, Separate the yolks from the whites first. Place the yolks into a medium-sized mixing bowl and add the sugar. Whisk the two together until the mixture turns pale yellow. Set the bowl aside when you are done.


The mixture will be thick and dark yellow at first; keep whisking until it turns pale.

, Pour the milk into a medium-sized saucepan, then place it on the stove. Add the vanilla extract, then bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat. Once it comes to a simmer, remove it from heat.


You can also use a vanilla bean pod instead. Split the bean in half, then scrape the seeds into the milk. Add in the pod as well.Consider adding other herbs and spices to the milk for extra flavor, such as mint leaves, lavender flowers, coffee beans, chocolate, etc.

, Measure out ½ to 1 cup (120 to 240 milliliters) of the hot milk. Slowly pour it into the egg mixture, whisking while you do so. This will help gradually warm up the egg mixture and prevent it from curdling in the next step.

, Stir the tempered egg mixture into the milk first. Place the saucepan back on the stove and turn the heat up to low. Stir the custard base slowly, but constantly, as it cooks. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the saucepan often. You are ready for the next step when the custard turns thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and reaches 170°F (77°C).

, Once you have everything in the bowl, lift the strainer out. If you see anything caught in the strainer, such as egg curdles or vanilla bean pods, throw them out.

, You can leave the custard base in the ice bath for 20 minutes, stirring it occasionally. You can also cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then refrigerate it for 3 to 8 hours.


For extra flavor, stir in your favorite extract, liqueur, or flavoring oil., If you have not already, put the bowl of your ice cream maker into the freezer the night before you plan to make ice cream. If it's too late for that, put the bowl into the freezer now, and the ice cream base in the fridge. Leave them there over night, then continue the next day., Take the bowl out of the freezer and place it into the ice cream maker. Insert the beater, then plug the ice cream maker in. If you have a manual/hand-cranked ice cream maker, do the following:Insert the bowl into the bucket, then the beater.
Fill the bucket (not the bowl) with 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) of ice.
Sprinkle salt evenly over the ice.
Repeat these layers until the bucket is half-full.
Pour cold water over the ice until the bucket is full.

, Use a rubber spatula to help scrape the bowl clean so that you don't waste any ice cream base.

, You want it to reach a soft-serve consistency, which is a little thicker than a milkshake. If the mixture becomes hard to churn, you are ready for the next step. This will take about 20 minutes for most machines, but double-check the instructions on your machine.If you have a manual or hand-cranked machine, you will have to turn the crank to the right., Now is the time to add in any extra ingredients into your ice cream, such as chocolate chips, nuts, or chopped up strawberries. Other options include caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, and sprinkles. You don't have to do this, but it can take your ice cream to the next level.

, Remove the churner from the bowl first, then take the bowl out. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the ice cream into a freezer-safe container.


If you want to enjoy your ice cream as soft-serve, you can serve it now.

, Make sure that it is touching the surface of the ice cream. This will help prevent the ice cream from developing ice crystals.If you don't have any wax paper, you could try parchment paper or plastic wrap.

, Cover the container with a lid, if you have one, and place it in the coldest part of your freezer. Leave it there until the ice cream turns solid. This will take at least 4 hours., If you made Philadelphia-style ice cream, you may start noticing ice crystals after a few days.After 2 weeks, the French-style will start to form ice crystals as well."

When you have a general idea of the size and design, you be able to more accurately estimate the type of fruit you need to purchase and how much of each kind you need to buy.


Make a bouquet with nothing but strawberries. Craft a more complex bouquet out of all different types of fruits, like pineapple, watermelon, and muskmelon. Cut your fruit into unique shapes, such as stars, balls, and animals. Transform your fruit into a replica of a baby, bride, or one of your favorite characters.
If you are not a visual person, it may be helpful to conduct a quick internet search for examples of fruit and floral arrangements. Allow these images to inspire your vision for the fruit bouquet. You may find or draw a design that roughly resembles a floral display, and then have fun imagining which fruit will replace the flowers.
If you’re not a planner, feel free to design the bouquet as you are creating it.;
, When you choose fruits, there are several factors to consider. Does the fruit brown quickly? Is the fruit hardy enough to stay on a skewer? Do the colors of the fruit complement each other and or your theme? Popular fruits for edible arrangements include:


Berries: strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries
Melon: watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew
Citrus fruits: oranges, mangos, and pineapple
Grapes, Fruit bouquets are edible centerpieces. In order to keep your arrangement looking fresh and appetizing, do not include fruits that brown quickly. These fruits include:


Bananas
Pears
Apples

, Fruit pairs really well with sweet treats. You can elevate your fruit arrangement to a delectable dessert by dipping a portion of the fruit in milk, white, or dark chocolate. You may also wish to add mini-marshmallows or puffed cereal to your skewers., Fruit bouquets are displayed in a variety of containers, including vases, cups, pots, and baskets. You can even use other fruit as a base, such as a melon or apple. Select a container that is appropriate for your party or gathering. , Prior to creating the individual stems of the arrangement, you should thoroughly wash and dry all of your fruit. Rinsing your fruit with water will remove dirt, grime, pesticides, and bacteria from the surface of the produce.


Individually rinse the melons, oranges, and mangos.
Place one type of berry or grape into a colander at a time. Rinse the fruit and the spread it out on paper towels or kitchen towels to dry., It is important that your edible bouquet is consumer friendly. Remove all inedible materials from the fruit, such as stems, seeds, and leaves.


Hull the strawberries. Use a knife to remove the stem and hull from the strawberries.
Remove the seeds from your muskmelon and honeydew.
Remove the stems from your grapes and berries.
If you are using fresh pineapple, cut off the ends of your fresh pineapple and then use a knife to remove the sides of the pineapple from the fruit., Edible arrangements feature fruit that has been cut into both festive shapes, such as flowers, animals, and even letters, as well as traditional shapes, such as wedges or balls.


Instead of creating the festive shapes by hand, you can use cookie cutters to produce uniform, professional-quality cutouts. Select a variety of sharp edged cutting cutters that match the theme of your event.
Create pineapple cutouts. Cut the fruit into ¾ inch thick slices. Place the sliced pineapple in the freezer for one hour. Remove the fruit from the freezer and use the cookie cutters to transform the pineapple into fun shapes.
Create melon cutouts. Slice the melon into ¾ inch thick slices. Cut fun shapes out of the melon with cookie cutters.
Slice the melon. Sliced melon is a great gap filler. Leave the rind on the melon. Cut it into slices or wedges. Instead of a traditional knife, you can use a scalloped garnish tool to cut the melon.
Ball the melon. Use a melon baller to create uniform balls of fruit.
Cut oranges, mangos, apples, pears, or kiwis into slices or wedges., To appease those with a sweet tooth, you may wish to dip some of the fruit in chocolate.


Melt the chocolate in the microwave or on the stovetop in a double boiler.
Use toothpicks to dip your fruit into the melted chocolate.
Set the dipped fruit on a sheet of wax paper.
Once all the items are dipped, move the fruit to the refrigerator and allow the chocolate to set for 15 minutes., After all of your fruit is washed, prepped, and cut, the fun of creating designs out of the fruit can begin. Don’t stress about this part of the process—there is no right or wrong way to assemble a fruit skewer. You may use any size and type of food safe skewer, from a toothpick to a wooden kabob stick; you have the freedom to arrange the fruit in any order or combination you choose. As you create, just make sure to leave enough space on the end of the skewer to stick into the base. Common combinations include:


Alternating colors of grapes and or berries.
Pineapple and melon flowers. Slide a melon ball, marshmallow, or strawberry to the top of the skewer (the non-pointy end). Next, slide a few different sized melon and or pineapple flower cut outs onto the skewer. Fill the remaining space with grapes or berries.
Melon wedges.
A single chocolate covered strawberry or a chocolate covered strawberry followed by a row of mini-marshmallows., Insert a piece of floral foam, Styrofoam ball, or a head of lettuce into the container—all of the skewers will be stuck into this item. Use toothpicks to attach decorative tissue paper or dark leafy greens to the surface of the floral foam, Styrofoam ball, or head of lettuce.If you use floral foam, you can place parsley on top of the floral foam to fill in any gaps that can be seen between the skewers.
Do not let the florist's foam come into direct contact with the food. Wrap the foam completely in plastic wrap.

, When you are arranging fruit, or flowers, your goal is to create an even and aesthetically pleasing bouquet. Insert your tallest skewers of fruit into and near the center of your base. As you work your way to the outer edges, the skewers should decrease in height., Periodically step back and evaluate the arrangement. Remove any skewers that seem out of place. Fill in all of the gaps with additional skewers. Continue the process until you are satisfied with the arrangement.


You may need to skewer additional fruit to fill in the gaps., After you have assembled the arrangement, wrap the fruit bouquet in plastic wrap or a cellophane gift bag . Transfer the arrangement from your workspace to the fridge. Pull the fruit bouquet out of the fridge 5 minutes prior to the party or moments before you intend to deliver it. If you are transporting the arrangement in a vehicle, place the edible centerpiece in a cardboard box and fill the empty space with bags, clean towels, or tissue paper."

Choose the fruit.,
Prepare the chosen fruits.,
Slice the fruits into slices no thicker than 1cm or 1/2 an inch.,
Use foil packets (or ""papillotes"") for softer fruits to barbecue inside them.,
Prepare the sauce mix either from one of the above suggestions or your own.,
Clean the barbecue grill plate well.,
Place the fruit, fruit kebab or foil packet of fruit directly on the grill plate and grill 3-5 minutes or until tender enough for eating (the foil packet can take 15-20 minutes).,
Serve with sauce and serving options and sprinkle with brown sugar as desired to make best use of the caramel flavours.",How to Barbecue Fruits," As you can see from the list above, there are numerous recommended fruits as well as some suggestions about what to avoid. In general, it's best to avoid fruits that have a high water content (such as some berries) or delicate fruits, but pretty much any other sort of fruit can be barbecued with care or with a wrapping such as foil around the fruits. And, although watermelon has a high water content, it barbecues surprisingly well when cut into thick chunks.;
, Wash, peel, and remove any hard or inedible portions from the fruits. The items you'll need to remove will often be the skin, core, pith or any seeds or pits, but be guided by the type of fruit you're using.

, You can cut them into chunks of any shape you wish, but aim to keep the width no thicker than 1cm or 1/2 inch thickness, and keep all pieces uniform to ensure even cooking times for all of the fruits. The thinner slice size helps the fruit cook evenly and quickly, without falling apart.


Stone fruits such as peaches actually can be cooked in halves.
You can cook large wedges of pineapple, but on a much lower heat. It's easier to cut such fruit into wedges.
, it's recommended that you soak them in water for 15 minutes before use. Doing this prevents burning.]]Aim to have the shapes made so they will not fall through the slots of the grill, or place them on a skewer in the same manner as making a shish-kebab. Don't crowd them on the skewer -– simply place them along the skewer evenly.
If barbecuing skewered fruits, aim to make the fruit kebabs from a range of fruit pieces to make it more interesting, such as pineapple, banana, melon, kiwifruit, strawberries and grapes. A marshmallow can be stuck on the kebab for added sweetness too, and it can drip down on the fruit pieces just after cooking.
Brushing fruit pieces destined for the grill/grate top with vegetable oil can help to ensure that they won't stick to the grill plate.

, Simply chop fruit up into small pieces or slices, fold foil over and wrap securely inside the foil packet. This can be added straight to the barbecue and cooked for around 15-20 minutes, and you'll find that all the fruit inside will be delicious and easy to remove.



Sprinkle seasoning, sauce or other suitable flavourings over the fruits inside the packet before closing it. The juices will soak up the flavourings and disperse them across the fruit pieces.

, All sauces should be heated through in a small pan either on the barbecue or on the stove until smooth. Keep them below simmering point.

, This means scraping down the surface and rubbing with a piece of paper towel or cloth until minimal residue is left on the plate. You want the fruits to take a nice caramelised flavour, but it's not ideal if the previous meat, fish or vegetable foods cooked on that grill were burnt on or have left behind their strong flavours, as these will affect the dessert.


You can tell when the barbecue plate is sufficiently clean is when it does not smoke when made hot enough to cook on. Some cooks scrape the plate down then leave the heat going during the main meal to burn any residue off the grill plates.
Provided the burned and fatty residues have been removed, you can also place the fruits onto the barbecue using a perforated foil plate or place a double layer of oiled foil onto the barbecue plate. This takes care of having the fruit sitting directly on the barbecue plate, which may not be to everyone's liking. However, be aware that it is the grill-marking that helps to caramelize the fruits and brings out that extraordinary flavour!, Use direct medium to high heat for short periods of cooking. Turn the fruit often (unless it's in a foil packet) and if you made the baste spice mix, baste during this stage, aiming not to drip the baste mix where it may scorch and create smoke. Some common cooking times:Apple or pear wedges need about 5 minutes each side
A peeled banana wrapped in foil cooks in about 5 minutes
Grilled mangoes should be turned every 3 to 5 minutes
Fruit kebabs should be turned every 3-5 minutes
Soft fruits such as strawberries cook very quickly; keep an eye on them at all times.

,


When barbecued and rolled inside a large, thin, cooked pancake for example it can work much like a filled-crepe dessert.
Serving a slice of cake underneath the barbecued fruit makes it richer with the sauce poured over the top, but there are as many options as the imagination offers.

Finished.








",How to Make a Baked Apple," Medium-sized apples are usually best, since you don't want a tiny treat, but too large an apple will take a long time to cook. Use a melon baller to core the apple. Leave the flower end on as a bottom. Score the skin, making the skin easier to eat.






;
, The core hole is the hollowed out space where the core sat. Cut the skin about an inch / 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) around the core hole. Place each apple in a suitably sized baking dish (microwave or oven-proof depending on method you will choose).








, This is traditionally cinnamon and raisins, although you can make variations - see ""Tips"" for suggestions. The amount of raisins you use depends on the size of the core. If you're using other fruit, you will obviously wish to reduce the amount of raisins used. Add a pinch of cinnamon to taste, and a pinch of fresh nutmeg.








, Don't use a lot, just enough to cover the hole - a quarter to a half a tablespoon is sufficient.








, If you do not want to add any sweetener, skip this step. Ensure that you have chosen a sweeter variety of apple if you do not wish to use a sweetener.








, This will add the moisture needed to keep the apple moist as it bakes, so that it doesn't come out dry. This will also provide a little apple juice at the bottom of the bowl, which adds a lot of flavor.








,










Oven - Set oven to moderate: 350ºF / 180ºC / gas mark 4. Bake apples for 1 hour, or until they feel tender when pierced with a fork. It is important to check regularly and add more water to prevent the apples from drying out as they bake. Alternatively, if you haven't time or patience to keep checking, place aluminum foil over a pan for 30 minutes and then remove for the last 30 minutes. Some people claim that the aluminum spoils the taste of the apples though, so you may wish to consider this. Keep the foil shiny side down if you use this method.

Microwave - Although some people frown upon the use of a microwave, it's not just for frozen dinners, nor is it a sign of laziness. You really cannot predict how long it'll take in the microwave, it depends on how hard the apple is. The apple decides for itself! Most apples take at least 10 minutes. After it cooks for five minutes, microwave it at intervals of 30 seconds, checking each time the microwave stops. When the apple is soft and the skin is softer, it's done!

, Don't try to eat it right away, because it will be extremely hot. Some people like cream or whipped cream (or even ice cream) on top. Be sure to cut up the apple, or you'll wind up with the whole apple in your mouth after taking one bite!

",How to Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops," You want large scallops which are nice and white. They shouldn’t be too wet or too dry. Look for a uniform shape, as opposed to scallops that look shredded and destroyed These are signs that they have been mishandled.Most are wet-packed, but dry-packed and diver-caught scallops are higher quality. Any of these will work.
Avoid using frozen scallops for this recipe.;
, Hold the scallops under cool, running water for a few seconds. Set them on a paper towel. Place another paper towel on top of the scallops and pat them dry., Often times, the scallops you purchase will already have the muscle removed. If your scallops still have the muscle attached, pull it off. Grasp it between your thumb and forefinger and tear it away.The muscle is a rectangular tab attached to the body of the scallop.
The muscle is tougher than the rest of the scallop, making it less desirable to eat.

, Lie the bacon strips on a cutting board. Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut the strips in half so that the strips are half their original length. This way the bacon will wrap around the scallop more evenly with less overlap., Place one end of the strip of bacon on the side of the scallop. Wrap the bacon all the way around the side of the scallop until the ends of the strip of bacon overlap.For crispier bacon, partially cook the bacon before wrapping the scallops. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Cover a baking sheet in parchment paper and lay the strips of bacon out on the paper. Cook the bacon for 12-15 minutes until it starts to become golden brown. Don't cook it so long that it begins to get crisp and lose its flexibility., Thread a toothpick into the outer, loose end of the bacon strip. Push it into the scallop, then thread the toothpick back out through the overlapped end of the strip of bacon. This will keep the bacon wrapped around the scallop and secured to it so it won’t come apart or slip off.You can also cook up to 5 scallops on one skewer. In this case, use the skewer to secure the bacon to the scallops by pushing the point through the overlapped bacon, into the scallop and out through the other side of the wrapped scallop. Push the scallop down from the pointed end toward the handle of the skewer and repeat the process, stacking the scallops until the skewer is full.

, The most common way to cook bacon-wrapped scallops is to broil them. Place the oven rack 6 inches from the source of heat. Set the oven to broil and allow it to preheat., The basic recipe for bacon-wrapped scallops is very simple. Toss the wrapped scallops in melted butter and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.You can use olive oil in place of butter.
Teriyaki sauce is a common variation to the simple butter recipe. Combine 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 3 tablespoons of minced ginger in a bowl. Toss the wrapped scallops in the mixture., Line the scallops on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet on the oven rack and allow the scallops to broil for 10-15 minutes until the bacon is cooked completely through.Flip the scallops half way through the cook time. Remove the baking sheet using an oven mitt and flip the scallops using tongs, then replace the scallops and finish broiling them.

, When you are cooking your scallops over an open flame, soak the toothpicks or skewers for 30 minutes before using them. The saturation keeps them from catching fire., Light the grill and heat it to a medium-high setting. Brush the grate with a light coat of butter so the scallops don't stick. Once the grill is hot, brush the grate with a light coating of oil to keep the scallops from sticking., Spread the bacon wrapped scallops evenly across the grill. Cook them until the scallops have just cooked all the way through. This should take about 7 minutes. Flip the scallops often during the grilling process so that they cook evenly and don't burn.You can tell the scallops are finished when you see them change from translucent to opaque.
Cut a scallop open to check if it is finished.

Dissolve the gelatin in hot water.,
Combine with the coffee and sugar.,
Pour the mixture into serving dishes.,
Chill until firm.,
Serve.",How to Make Coffee Jelly1," Pour the hot water into a small bowl. Stir gently until the gelatin dissolves.To ensure smooth jelly, allow the gelatin to ""bloom"" in the hot water for 1 or 2 minutes before stirring it. Allowing the granules to absorb the water like this them may help them dissolve more readily.;
, Pour the dissolved gelatin mixture into the hot coffee. Add the sugar and whisk until the sugar dissolves.


The coffee must be very hot (near boiling) when you use it. If you use cold coffee, it could result in stringy or clumpy coffee jelly.
If you do start with cooled coffee, you'll need to combine the coffee, gelatin mixture, and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat the entire mixture on your stove over high heat until it reaches a boil., Evenly distribute the coffee mixture among four custard dishes, coffee mugs, or similar serving glasses.


If you wish to cut the coffee jelly into cubes, you'll need to pour it into a lightly greased 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) pan.

, Place your filled dishes into the refrigerator and allow the coffee jelly to firm up.


If you plan to eat it directly from its dish, the coffee jelly might be ready in as few as 3 to 4 hours.
If you want to cut the coffee jelly into cubes, you should wait at least 6 to 7 hours for it to solidify even further.

, The coffee jelly should be done and ready to enjoy.


Consider garnishing the dishes of jelly with a dollop of whipped cream.
If you wish to make cubes of coffee jelly, cut the sheet of firm jelly into even cubes using a warm knife. Gently invert the pan into a large serving dish to collect the cubes.
Cover and store remaining coffee jelly in your refrigerator for up to 3 or 4 days.

Chill for 4 to 5 hours.,
Serve.",How to Make Coffee Jelly2," Pour the water and agar agar into a small saucepan. Whisk until combined, then set the saucepan on your stove over high heat.Bring the mixture to a boil before continuing to the next step.
Note that agar agar powder (also called ""kanten powder"") works best, but you could use three-quarters of an agar stick if necessary. Break the stick into pieces and soak them for 20 minutes in separate water. Drain the soaking water, then use the broken pieces of agar as you would use the powder.Equal amounts of unflavored powdered gelatin could be used instead of the agar agar powder, but gelatin is not vegetarian-friendly.

, Once the mixture starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium. Pour the sugar and instant coffee into the saucepan and whisk to combine.


Continue cooking the mixture at a gentle simmer for approximately 2 minutes, or until everything dissolves. Stir the mixture occasionally to help it along.

, Turn off the heat and remove the saucepan from the stove. Allow it to rest at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes.


During this time, the liquid should begin to thicken. Make sure that it does not solidify, though. Agar sets quickly, and waiting too long can make it difficult to pour.

, Pour the hot mixture into individual serving dishes. Wait another 5 to 10 minutes, then cover each dish with plastic wrap.


After pouring the mixture into each dish, use a spoon to scoop away any bubbles that form on the surface.

, Place the filled dishes in your refrigerator. Chill them until the jelly sets and becomes thoroughly cooled.


Jelly made with agar will technically set even at room temperature, but the process will take more time. Moreover, the jelly will taste better cold.

, The coffee jelly is finished and ready to enjoy.


Consider serving each portion with whipped cream or 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of half-and-half.
Leftover coffee jelly should last for up to 2 days when stored in the refrigerator.

Pour the mixture into a glass dish.,
Chill until set.,
Serve.",How to Make Coffee Jelly3," Place the cold water in a medium mixing bowl. Sprinkle the unflavored gelatin over the water and allow it to sit for 10 minutes.As the gelatin sits, the individual granules should begin to absorb the water. This process, known as ""hydrating"" or ""blooming,"" makes it easier to dissolve the gelatin once you add hot liquid.

, Pour the strong, hot coffee into the gelatin mixture. Stir well for several minutes, or until the gelatin completely dissolves.


Note that the coffee must be very hot when you add it; otherwise, the gelatin may not set properly.
The coffee should also be quite strong to balance the sweetness of the condensed milk and mimic the taste of Vietnamese coffee.

, After the gelatin dissolves, pour the sweetened condensed milk into the mixture. Stir well to combine.


You must use condensed milk. Do not used evaporated milk since it lacks the sweetness and thickness of condensed milk.

, Carefully pour the coffee mixture into an 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) square glass dish.


To make thinner cubes of coffee jelly, you could use a 7-inch by 11-inch (18-cm by 28-cm) glass dish or a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) glass dish.

, Place the filled dish into the refrigerator. Chill for 2 to 4 hours, or until the coffee jelly is firm.


Thinner cubes will solidify quicker than thicker cubes.
Wait until the jelly feels firm enough to hold between your fingers. To be on the safe side, you may wish to wait 8 hours or overnight.

, Cut the finished coffee jelly into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes and turn the cubes out into a large serving bowl or dish. Enjoy immediately.


Store extra coffee jelly in an airtight container kept in the refrigerator for up 3 or 4 days.

Lightly grease the brioche molds.,
Combine the gelatin and coffee liqueur.,
Add the coffee, sugar, and salt.,
Pour the mixture into the molds.,
Chill overnight.,
Remove the firm jelly from the molds.,
Serve.",How to Make Coffee Jelly4," Spray six to eight brioche molds with nonstick cooking spray. Use a clean paper towel to spread the oil over the bottom and sides, coating the entire mold in a thin layer.Ideally, you should use 4-inch (10-cm) molds or 1/2-cup (125-ml) molds. Brioche molds work well and give the finished jelly an appealing appearance, but any similarly sized mold would also work.
If you do not wish to remove the jelly from its dish before serving it, you could use six to eight 1/2-cup (125-ml) custard dishes, instead. Do not coat the dishes with cooking spray if you choose this option.

, Pour the coffee liqueur into a small to medium mixing bowl and sprinkle the gelatin on top. Allow it to stand for 5 minutes.As it stands, the gelatin should soften or ""bloom."" The individual grain will absorb the moisture and will dissolve more readily once you add them to the hot coffee.

, Pour the hot coffee, sugar, and salt into the bowl. Stir well until the gelatin fully dissolves.


The coffee must be hot when you add it to the gelatin. Using cool coffee can result in stringy jelly.
Continue stirring until the entire mixture seems like a smooth liquid. This should take approximately 2 minutes.

, Divide the mixture evenly between your prepared brioche molds.


After filling the molds, loosely cover them with a single layer of plastic wrap.

, Place the filled molds in your refrigerator and keep them there until the jelly becomes firm.


Chilling them for 8 hours or overnight should result in very firm jellies, which will be ideal if you plan to remove them from their molds.
If you wish to eat the coffee jelly directly from its dish, however, it might be firm enough to enjoy after 4 hours. Waiting longer will still produce a firmer texture, though.

, Remove the coffee jelly from your refrigerator. Use your fingers to gently pull the jelly away from the edges of the mold, then turn each mold over onto its own dessert plate.


If the coffee jelly sticks to the mold, quickly dip the bottom of the mold into hot water. The heat should loosen the jelly and make it easier to remove.

, The coffee jelly is finished and ready to enjoy.


If desired, garnish each serving with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
This coffee jelly is best when enjoyed immediately, but you can cover and store the leftovers in your refrigerator for up to 4 days.

You can even try making the pops with yogurt drinks like kefir and lassi. Transfer the yogurt to a medium mixing bowl.

Greek yogurt is quite thick, so if you do use this to make your pops, you'll have to thin it out with the ½ cup (118 ml) of milk. Add the milk to the bowl with the yogurt and whisk to combine.;
, Add the sweetener to the bowl with the yogurt. Whisk the mixture until the sweetener is completely incorporated into the yogurt.You can use any type of sweetener you like for this recipe, but liquid ones will incorporate better into the yogurt. Sweeteners you can use include:

White sugar
Brown sugar
Honey
Maple syrup
Corn syrup
Agave syrup

, To give your yogurt pops more flavor, color, and nutritional benefits, add fruit or berries to the yogurt. Transfer the berries to a blender or food processor and blend until the berries reduce to a syrup or paste. Pour the berry paste into the yogurt and stir to combine. Fruit you can add to your pops include:Strawberries
Raspberries
Blueberries
Blackberries
Banana
Pineapple
Kiwi
Peaches

, Jam is a great fruit alternative if you're making yogurt pops in winter when there are no berries in season. You can also substitute frozen berries for fresh ones if those are all that’s available.

Use the same quantity of frozen berries in place of fresh ones.
Use 1 cup (325 g) of jam or preserves in place of fresh or frozen berries., Granola and yogurt parfaits are classic healthy breakfast fare, and you can turn your yogurt pops into frozen parfaits by adding some granola. Add the granola to the bowl and fold it into the yogurt with the rubber spatula.You can use any type of granola you like in your pops, including cereal, trail mix, nut mix, granola clusters, or any other similar mix.

, When you use plain, vanilla, or pineapple yogurt combined with chunks of fresh pineapple, you can easily turn your basic fruit and yogurt pops into pina colada pops simply by adding ½ cup (47 g) of shredded coconut. Fold the coconut in with the yogurt and pineapple until it’s evenly distributed throughout the yogurt.If you use sweetened coconut to make these pops, add less sugar to avoid making them overly sweet.

, Similarly, you can also make chunky monkey yogurt pops by combining plain, chocolate, or vanilla yogurt, chunks of banana, and the ½ cup (88 g) of chocolate chips. Leave out the granola and the coconut shreds, and use unsweetened chocolate to avoid pops that are overly sugary.If you use plain or vanilla yogurt and want chocolate-colored pops, whisk 1 tablespoon (7 g) of cocoa powder into the yogurt before adding the banana and coconut.

, Once your yogurt has been customized with sweetener, fruit, and other additions, distribute the yogurt evenly among the popsicle molds. Pour enough yogurt into each popsicle mold to fill it to the rim.

Don’t add so much yogurt that it’s overflowing from the mold, or it will be difficult to remove the pops once they're frozen.
If you don’t have popsicle molds, you can use small paper cups to make your pops instead., Some popsicle molds come with their own reusable sticks, but if yours doesn’t have those, then use regular wooden popsicle sticks. Insert the stick into the slot in the center of the mold, making sure the stick is upright and straight.

Paper cups don’t have special slots for holding the sticks, so if you're using paper cups to make your pops, freeze the pops for two hours and then insert the sticks into the center of the yogurt., Transfer the filled popsicle molds to the freezer. Shut the door and let the pops freeze for eight hours, or overnight. For paper-cup yogurt pops, remove the pops after two hours and insert the sticks. Then, return the pops to the freezer for an additional six hours.

You don’t have to eat the yogurt pops right away, and they will last in the freezer for about four weeks., When the pops are frozen and you're ready to enjoy them, remove them from the freezer. Pull on a stick to remove a pop from the mold. If the pop won’t come out of the mold easily, run the outside of the mold under hot water for a few seconds to loosen the yogurt.

For paper-cup pops, simply tear or peel away the paper cup before enjoying the pop., Instead of blending your fruit and berries before adding them to the yogurt, you can leave the berries in small chunks. This will leave tasty bites of fruit or berries inside the yogurt pop, and will give the pops a bit more substance. You can also do a combination of blended berries and chunks.For an even more special look, line the sides of the molds with thin slices of berries or fruit and then fill the molds with yogurt.

, You can also create a swirled or marbled effect with your yogurt pops by mixing the berry paste into the yogurt in a particular way. Add all the additional ingredients to the yogurt first, and then add the berry paste to the center of the yogurt. Stir the paste a few times in a circular motion, but stop before the yogurt and berries are fully combined.Spoon the yogurt into the molds carefully to preserve the swirled effect.

, You can also create a number of neat effects by combining different colored yogurts into one pop. This will require different flavors of yogurt and different berries. To make tie-dyed pops:

Pick at least two different flavors of yogurt
Select berries or fruit to match each yogurt (such as banana with vanilla yogurt and raspberries with strawberry yogurt)
In separate bowls, combine each yogurt flavor with its matching berry
Fill each yogurt mold by adding yogurt by the spoonful, alternating the yogurt type with each spoonful
To make the tie-dye, use a different quantity of yogurt with each spoonful

, You can make a rainbow effect using the same method as the tie-dyed effect. Mix similar colored berries with similar colored yogurts in separate bowls. When you fill the molds:Add a thin layer of one color to the bottom of the mold
Add an equal sized layer of a different yogurt color on top
Continue alternating colors until the mold is full

",How to Make Cookie Dough Ice Cream," Toss the chocolate chips in a food processor and pulse in short bursts. Stop once the chocolate chips are broken into uneven chunks and a pile of ""chocolate dust."" These pieces will mix throughout your ice cream, adding more chocolate flavor.Set them aside for now.


Skip this step if you prefer intact chocolate chips in your cookie dough ice cream.;
, Combine butter and both types of sugar with an electric mixer or a long-tined fork.Whisk until there are no streaks, and the mixture is paler and larger in volume. This takes about one or two minutes in an electric mixer, or several minutes by hand.


Start with soft butter, especially if mixing by hand. You can shorten the wait by chopping cold butter into small pieces, grating it, or trying our other solutions.

, Stir in the vanilla and salt, then scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add flour in small batches, stirring until fully combined but still crumbly., Toss in the chocolate chips, and scrape out all the dust from the food processor. Add the cream one spoonful at a time, stirring until the mixture becomes soft and sticks together, looking like cookie dough.

, Cover a baking tray completely with parchment paper. You'll be using this to freeze your cookie dough, so clear some freezer space.

, Frozen cookie dough will be much easier to stir into the ice cream while keeping those nice, chewy chunks. Freezing usually takes about four hours, but you can make the ice cream while you wait. There are two ways to approach this:Spread the cookie dough onto the tray in a thin, even layer and freeze until solid. Once frozen, cut it into small pieces using a sharp knife.
For lager chunks, instead place small spoonfuls of the cookie dough onto the tray, as though you were making small cookies. Freeze until solid.

, Separate the egg yolks and combine them with the salt and sugar in a bowl. With a fork or electric mixer, whisk until the mixture becomes smooth and pale yellow, and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons.Optionally, add another egg yolk for an extra-rich ice cream.

, Fill a large bowl partway full of ice and cold water. Place a medium bowl inside the larger bowl, nestling it in the middle of the ice. Set this aside in the refrigerator to use later.

, Stir the milk and vanilla extract together in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until the first small bubbles form. This should only take a few minutes.


Evaporated milk contains much less water, so your ice cream will have fewer ice crystals to break up while churning.If you use ordinary whole milk instead, you'll need to spend more time churning the ice cream as it freezes.

, Pour a very thin stream of milk into the bowl of eggs and sugar, whisking constantly as you pour. Adding the milk too quickly may cook the eggs, which ruins the recipe.


If you are concerned about ruining the recipe, let the milk cool until it is safe to touch.This may increase the cooking time.

, Return the milk and egg mixture to the saucepan and turn the heat to low. Gently stir with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom. Remove the mixture from heat once it forms a thick custard, and coats the back of the spoon when you lift it out.


Take the pot off the stove right away if you notice any lumps of cooked egg. Strain these out before you continue., Pour the custard into the dry bowl in your ice bath. Leave this to chill while you continue to the next step.

, Whisk until the cream has doubled in volume, but not so long that it forms whipped cream. This will take a minute or two in an electric mixer, or several minutes of hand whisking., Wait until the egg mixture is cold to the touch. Fold the cream into the custard until they form a smooth mixture.

, Transfer the ice cream base to a freezer-safe container. If the cookie dough is ready, you can continue to the next section. Otherwise, leave the ice cream in the freezer for no more than 2 hours, while you wait for the dough. Stir the ice cream vigorously every 45 minutes to break up ice crystals as they form. Freezing for too long will make the ice cream difficult to combine with the cookie dough.

, Scoop the soft ice cream into a large container, then drop a handful of cookie dough on top. Repeat with alternate scoops, eyeballing the amount of cookie dough you'd like. Once you've scooped all the ice cream, fold the to ingredients together to distribute the cookie dough evenly.


Optionally, stir in some extra chocolate chips.
Save any cookie dough you don't use to sprinkle over the ice cream.

, Once the two ingredients are mixed together, transfer to a freezer-safe container. To break up ice crystals as they form, set alarms to check on the ice cream frequently, as follows:After 45 minutes, stir with an electric mixer or rubber spatula, breaking up all frozen chunks and forming a smooth mixture.
Check on the ice cream every 30–60 minutes, and stir again whenever ice crystals form.
After 2 or 3 hours the ice cream should start setting evenly. Leave it alone at this point and let it freeze to ice cream consistency.
If you used whole milk instead of evaporated milk, you may need to churn the ice cream more frequently.

, If you're using an ice cream machine, freeze and churn the custard base as usual, with the cookie dough set aside. About five minutes before the ice cream is ready, drop the pieces of cookie dough into the ice cream machine.Let the machine complete the process as usual.


You may not need to use all the cookie dough. Add according to preference, then keep the rest around for cookie dough lovers to nibble.

A note on coconut milk: choose full-fat coconut milk, rather than low-fat, for best flavor. Don't confuse coconut milk with cream of coconut, which is a different product. It's normal for coconut milk to separate during storage; just scoop it into the saucepan and mix it up.;
, In a separate bowl, mix the eggs, sugar and salt with a whisk. Mix until the sugar has dissolved and the combination is light, fluffy and pale yellow., Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, all the while continuing to whisk the contents of the bowl with your other hand. If you pour too fast or neglect to stir constantly, the hot liquid will scramble the eggs. Pour in a slow, steady stream while you mix.

, Return the mixture to the saucepan and place it over medium low heat. Stir it constantly while slowly cooks and begins to thicken. When the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of your spoon, it's ready. This should take about 10 minutes.


Don't cook the mixture too quickly, or the texture will suffer. Cook it slowly and keep stirring until it's smooth and thick.

, Pour it into a mixing bowl and set it into a larger bowl full of ice water. Stir it occasionally and allow it to chill completely before freezing.

, Pour the custard into your ice cream freezer and freeze it according to the manufacturer's instructions. In most cases you will be instructed to transfer the churned ice cream to the freezer for a few hours until it firms up and become scoopable.


If you don't have an ice cream maker, freeze it as follows: pour the chilled custard into a shallow baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze it for 45 minutes, then unwrap it and stir the custard to whip some air into the mixture. Wrap it back up, put it in the freezer and repeat every 45 minutes until the mixture is frozen and scoopable. The more frequently you stir, the lighter and fluffier your ice cream will be.

Be sure to use coconut milk, and not cream of coconut, which is a different product. Coconut milk naturally separates during storage. Scoop the entire contents of the cans into your blender.

Optional: add 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum to the mixture. This is completely optional, but it will result in a final texture that's less ""icy"" and more similar to traditional ice cream.

, Place it in your refrigerator and chill the mixture completely before proceeding. Starting with a chilled mixture will make it easier to achieve the light, fluffy texture of ice cream.

, Pour it into your ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. In most cases you will be instructed to transfer the churned ice cream to the freezer for a few hours until it firms up and become scoopable.

Cover with plastic wrap and freeze it for 45 minutes, then unwrap it and stir the custard to whip some air into the mixture. Wrap it back up, put it in the freezer and repeat every 45 minutes until the mixture is frozen and scoopable. The more frequently you stir, the lighter and fluffier your ice cream will be.

Make it more coconutty.,
Swirl in your favorite mix-ins.,
Add another base flavor.",How to Make Coconut Ice Cream3," If you love coconut flavor, make your ice cream more intensely coconutty by adding actual shredded coconut. Spread unsweetened shredded coconut on a baking sheet in a thin layer. Bake it at 350 °F (177 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it toasts and turns golden brown. Stir it into the ice cream toward the end of the churning process, before it is completely frozen.


The texture of untoasted coconut is not nearly as pleasant as that of toasted coconut, so it's not advisable to use plain untoasted coconut.
Sweetened coconut could cause the ice cream to taste overly sweet.

, Coconut ice cream is a great base for all your favorite mix-ins. Any mix-in you'd enjoy with vanilla ice cream will taste equally good paired with the mild, sweet coconut ice cream. Add mix-ins toward the end of the churning process, before the ice cream is completely frozen. Try one or more of the following:


Crushed cookies
Chocolate chips
Frozen berries
Sprinkles
Candies

, If you're craving flavored ice cream but you can't eat dairy, try using coconut ice cream as your base for a different flavor. Again, coconut is mild enough that it can act as a delicious blank slate, just like vanilla. When you pair its creamy, rich flavor with your other favorites, you won't miss the taste of dairy. Try adding one of these flavors to your ice cream mix before you put it in your ice cream maker:


1/2 cup chilled espresso (caffeinated or decaffeinated)
1/2 cup lemon, grapefruit or orange juice
1/4 cup cocoa powder or chocolate syrup

You can buy cotton candy syrup at some grocery stores or candy shops.

, Turn the saucepan on to medium heat. Whisk the ice cream base occasionally to keep it from sticking. Heat the base until it comes to a boil., Slowly pour about one-third of the hot ice cream base into the egg mixture while you whisk the egg mixture. Slowly whisk in another third into the egg mixture and stir it well. Add the last of the ice cream base and whisk the mixture well.Slowly whisking the ice cream base into the egg mixture will prevent the egg mixture from curdling.

Stir the mixture to combine the ingredients.It's important to use whole milk (not skim or low fat milk) in this recipe, since the fat in the milk will help your ice cream set up properly.

, Get out a bowl that's larger than the saucepan. Fill half of the bowl with ice and pour cold water over it, so the bowl is half-full of ice water.The ice bath will quickly chill the ice cream base once it's cooked.

, Turn the saucepan with the ice cream base mixture on to medium heat. Whisk the mixture every once in a while until it simmers. Once it simmers, set a timer and whisk the mixture for 6 minutes.Whisking will prevent the ice cream base from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

It's important to whisk while you do this, so the ice cream won't develop lumps of thickener., Turn the heat up to medium and whisk the base for two more minutes. You should notice the base start to thicken as the cornstarch mixture cooks., Turn off the heat and set the saucepan directly into the bowl with the ice water.

Put the thermometer into the ice cream base to check the temperature.The ice cream base should be 45 degrees F (10 C) before you freeze it.

, Pour the cold ice cream base into the frozen ice cream freezer bowl that fits your ice cream maker. Turn the machine on and churn the ice cream. Depending on your machine, this may take 35 to 45 minutes.You'll see the ice cream thicken and pull away from the sides of the bowl once it's finished freezing.

, Pull apart one large ball of cotton candy into pieces or long strands and add it to the churning ice cream. Do this during the last minute or two of churning to evenly distribute the cotton candy.If you'd rather stir the cotton candy in by hand, you can wait incorporate it until you're ready to serve it.

Store the watermelon chips.",How to Make Watermelon Chips," Select a ripe watermelon. It should feel heavy and firm. Avoid watermelons that have soft spots on the rind since they may be too ripe. Look for a watermelon that has a slightly yellow-colored spot on the rind. This is the spot where the watermelon ripened when it was on the ground. Wash the watermelon before you slice it.If you tap the watermelon, it should sound hollow, not dull.;
, If you're using a large watermelon, use a large chef's knife to carefully cut the melon into four large wedges. To make a small batch of watermelon chips, you'll only need to use one quarter wedge. Set the other quarters aside or just make a large batch of the chips.If you're using a smaller, personal-sized watermelon, you may need to use half or all of the melon.

, Slice the quarter of watermelon into slivers that are triangle-shaped. Try to slice them at least 1/4-inch (6 mm) thin or thinner so they'll dry evenly. Use a smaller paring knife to slice off and discard the rind from each slice.If you want triangular strips of watermelon chips, you can dry these strips or cut them into smaller pieces.

, If you want your watermelon chips to be smaller and similar to tortilla chips in size, cut them again. Roughly chop the triangular strips of watermelon into bite-sized chips. Keep in mind that they'll shrink in size as they dry., Get out the trays that came with your dehydrator. Arrange the watermelon pieces so they're in a single layer. Leave a little bit of room between the fruit pieces to let the air circulate easily., Put the trays with watermelon into the dehydrator and close it. Turn your dehydrator on to the fruit setting. If your dehydrator doesn't have a fruit setting, set it to 135 degrees F (60 C)., Leave the watermelon chips in the dehydrator for 8 to 12 hours. You may want to turn the fruit halfway through the drying time to prevent it from sticking to the trays. The watermelon chips will be dry and chewy once they've finished dehydrating.The time it takes to dehydrate the watermelon will depend on how much water is in the melon, the size of the chips, and your dehydrator.

, Once the watermelon chips have dried, scoop them into an airtight container. If you'd like to store them for a long period of time, add an oxygen absorber packet to the container. This will absorb excess moisture that could cause the chips to spoil.

Consider using mason jars or airtight plastic containers to store the watermelon chips.

, Get out a large nonstick baking sheet. Arrange the watermelon pieces so they're in a single layer. Leave some room between the watermelon pieces to let the air circulate easily., Turn your oven on to the lowest setting that's available. Put the sheet with watermelon in the oven and leave the door to the oven open. You'll need to let as much air as possible circulate as the fruit dehydrates. This is why it's important not to shut the oven door., Keep the watermelon in the oven for about 2 hours. Turn the pieces over and return them to the oven. Leave the door open and dry them for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The watermelon chips should be smaller, dry, and slightly crispy or chewy (depending on if you did strips or small pieces)., Once the watermelon chips have dried, transfer them to an airtight container. If you'd like to store them for a long period of time, add an oxygen absorber packet to the container.

This entire step is optional, but will allow the tomato puree to keep longer. Some cooks prefer to use the pure tomato puree and not add the other ingredients.
You can also add sauteed onions and/or green peppers to cook with the tomato puree.
Simmer the puree until you have the desired consistency. This time can vary depending on the type of tomato you are using. The time frame can range from 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the lid after the first 20 minutes to allow the puree to cool down.

,


If you are planning on storing the puree for a long period, be sure to follow proper preserving guidelines, such as creating a proper acidic balance, reheating to a boil before storage and using clean storage jars to avoid bacteria growth.
Another way to store the puree is to freeze it in an ice cube tray and store the frozen puree cubes in a bag in your freezer. This takes up less space and allows you to access varying amounts of puree as needed.

, If you are using cherry tomatoes, cut them in half. For other larger tomatoes, cut them into quarters.

, This is not necessary but removing the seeds will speed up the drying process.

, Fresh herbs are a popular choice. Basil is often used to flavor sun dried tomatoes. Toss the tomatoes so they are well coated with the herbs.

, Choose a really hot day. For optimal results, the temperature should be over 90 °F (32 °C) with humidity less than 60 percent.

, You can use a screen made for drying purposes or an old window or door screen that has been scrubbed clean. Set the screen up on a table, and raise the screen by placing small boards or bricks at the corners. This will allow air to circulate around the drying tomatoes.

, Arrange them so there is space between the tomatoes; you do not want them touching. Proper drying requires adequate air flow for each individual piece of tomato.

, Place boards or bricks around the screen, then place the cheesecloth over this. The cheesecloth should cover the tomatoes but not touch them. Hold the cheesecloth in place by placing more bricks on top of the bottom bricks.The cheesecloth will help keep bugs off and birds out, as well as falling debris from trees.

, They can take anywhere from 1 day of full sun to 2 weeks to properly dry. Make sure to take them in at night. After the sun goes down, humidity levels tend to rise and you do not want your tomatoes to absorb any moisture (which would basically undo any drying that has already occurred).


The tomatoes are completely sun dried when they have a leathery texture and are not sticky. They should feel dry but not cold to the touch. Do not over dry them so they become brittle. The finished product will be much darker than the original.

, Drying tomatoes in the oven requires the lowest setting on your oven. If it is above 150 degrees, leave the oven door open slightly to reduce the heat.

, They will have to be turned and tossed periodically through the drying process since there is no air circulation with a baking sheet.

, This may take 6 to 12 hours.

, Pack them loosely and rid the container of as much air as possible. Keep the dried tomatoes in a cool, dark, dry place.


If you have put your dried tomatoes in an air-tight container, you can also store them in the refrigerator or freezer.

Eat them!",How to Roast Cherry Tomatoes," First of all you should quickly rinse the tomatoes in cool water to make sure they are clean and ready to eat. Before you prepare food and cook always remember to wash your hands too.
, Do not rub or pat the tomatoes dry, but place them in a bowl with paper towels at the bottom. The paper towels will collect the excess water, so you don’t get a little p0ol at the bottom of the bowl.

, You don’t want water and dampness to be trapped in the bowl. The resulting condensation can turn your tomatoes bad, even moldy, relatively quickly. You can leave them in the fridge until you are ready to roast them.

, When you are ready to roast the tomatoes, find an aluminum pan that is suitable for roasting. A good pan to use would be a relatively shallow roasting pan, such as a ‘sheet pan’, or ‘jelly roll pan’, which are typically around 1 inch (3 cm) deep.You want enough space so that you’re tomatoes aren’t piled on top of each other., Place about 1/3 cup (or four or five tablespoons) of good olive oil in the bottom of the pan. The nicer the olive oil, the nicer the roasted tomatoes, so ideally you would use only virgin, and only cold pressed olive oil. Spread out the oil with your fingers so that it covers the bottom of the pan.

, Get out your tomatoes, and with the olive oil still on your fingers, place them into the oiled pan. Move them around a little in the pan so that they get nicely coated with oil. This will add to the taste but also protect the skin of the tomatoes a bit from burning in the oven, helping them to brown without drying out., Once your tomatoes are in the pan, wash your hands to get the oil off your fingers before you move onto the spices and seasoning. You can experiment with spices, but good ones to start with are: rosemary, oregano, black cracked pepper (not whole), sea salt, and basil.


These all go great with roasted tomatoes for a Mediterranean-style meal, but maybe another time you could try some chilli for a different flavor.

, Take out a teaspoon, or a teaspoon measuring device. Shake one teaspoon of each of the rosemary, oregano, black pepper, salt and basil over the tomatoes. Try to get as even a distribution of spices as possible. You don’t want one really salty tomato and the rest to go without.


If you have fresh herbs that is even better than the dried ones. A sprinkling of chopped fresh rosemary, oregano and basil leaves will lead to more flavorful roasted tomatoes than a teaspoon of dried herbs.

, Get a spatula and gently mix-up your tomatoes in pan to ensure that the herbs and oil and well spread out over them. Take a little care with this as you don’t want to break the skins of any of the tomatoes. Also make sure that the tomatoes are evenly laid out in the pan, so you don’t have a big pile in one corner.

, When you're happy with the oil and herbs coating the tomatoes, you can add some garlic for the final kick of flavor. Grab some fresh garlic, and chop up two small cloves very finely. You can grate the garlic if you find it hard or awkward to chop it up. Take your garlic, distribute in the pan, and blend it all together one more time.

, If you want to seal in some of the extra moistness of the tomatoes, you can cover the pan with aluminum foil. If you do this, be sure to poke some holes into the foil on top of the pan so that the steam can escape. Covering the pan is optional, but it can help stop the tomatoes from drying out as you roast them.

, When you have pre-heated your oven to around 400 degrees (200 degrees Celsius), place the pan in the middle of the oven. They roast relatively quickly, and they shouldn’t need more than 15 minutes.

, Adding the wine late in the roasting process will really add some flavor. Marsala wine is often used in Italian cuisine, and will really take your roasted tomatoes to the next level. Mix the tomatoes again, and then cook for 3 minutes more uncovered.

, Now they are roasted you should take them out of the oven and carefully remove them from the juices that will be swilling around the pan. You can pick them out carefully, perhaps using some kitchen tongs, or a slotted spoon. Place them into a new container like a bowl or dish., Toss around a 1/4 teaspoon of a good balsamic vinegar over the tomatoes and carefully blend it all together. By now, you're tomatoes should be glistening, juicy and smelling great. You can add any extra seasoning, or perhaps grate a little parmesan cheese over the top.

, Now can enjoy some delicious roasted cherry tomatoes as a side, tossed in a salad, with some pasta or however you like! They can make a great appetizer with some freshly baked bread, cheese, and a glass of wine.

Now they are roasted you can also keep them in a sealed container in the fridge, and they should be good for another five or so days.

Put the grated ube into a steamer basket over a few inches (5 cm) of simmering water and put the lid on. Steam the ube for 15 minutes. It should become completely soft.You can also buy whole ube and prepare it yourself. Wear kitchen gloves to peel the ube, since it can make your hands itchy and use a box grater to grate the ube.;
, Take the lid off of the steamer and remove the steamed ube. Transfer the ube to a small bowl and use a fork to mash the steamed ube until it's smooth., Get out a medium saucepan and measure 1 cup (240 ml) of whole milk and 2/3 cup (145 g) of sugar into it. Turn the heat on to medium and stir the mixture until the liquid barely starts bubbling. Turn off the heat.Heating the milk and sugar should make the sugar dissolve. This will give you smooth ube ice cream.

, Add 1½ cups (360 ml) of heavy whipping cream and the steamed ube to the saucepan. Carefully place an immersion blender into the saucepan and turn it on. Blend the mixture until it's totally smooth.If you don't have an immersion blender, you could pour the ice cream mixture into a blender. Puree the mixture until it's completely smooth.

, Set a mesh strainer or sieve over a medium mixing bowl. Slowly pour the ice cream mixture through the strainer, so the liquid is transferred to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. It needs to be completely cold before you freeze it.You can throw away the solids that end up in the strainer.

, Set up your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Remove the chilled ice cream mixture from the fridge and pour it into the frozen part of the ice cream maker. Turn the maker on, so the machine churns the ice cream. It should take about 10 to 15 minutes for the ice cream to form.If you prefer more of a soft-serve texture, you can serve the ube ice cream right out of the ice cream maker. For a firmer ice cream, freeze it for a few hours in the freezer before you serve.

Drain the water and transfer the cooked ube to a blender.You may want to wear gloves to prevent the ube from making your fingers and hands itchy.
If you want to purchase ube puree, you'll need to buy and thaw 1/2 cup (100 g) of ube puree. Place the puree in a blender.

, Measure 1½ cups (360 ml) of full-fat coconut milk into the blender with the prepared ube. Add 1 tablespoon of arrowroot powder and ¼ cup (60 ml) maple syrup. Put the lid on the blender and blitz it until the mixture is completely smooth.If you can't find arrowroot powder, you can use tapioca flour or cornstarch.

, Remove the blender lid and pour the ice cream mixture into a medium saucepan. Turn the heat on to medium-high, so the mixture starts to boil. Stir it occasionally to keep it from sticking. Turn off the heat and whisk the mixture.The ice cream mixture will thicken a little as it cooks. Whisking can prevent lumps from forming.

, Once you've removed the ice cream mixture from the heat, stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Pour the ice cream mixture into an airtight container and put it in the fridge to chill. It should chill at least 2 hours or overnight.The ice cream mixture will need to be totally cold before you freeze the ice cream in your machine.

, Prepare your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pour the chilled ice cream base into the frozen bowl of the machine and turn it on. Churn the ice cream until it sets up and is firm. You can serve it immediately if you like it a little soft.For a firmer ice cream, scoop the ice cream into a container and freeze the ice cream until it's hard.

Pour ¼ cup of flour into a bowl.,
Fry the tomatoes.,
Remove them from the oil when they are golden brown.,
Serve with salt and pepper and enjoy!",How to Make Fried Green Tomatoes1," Look for tomatoes that are medium in size and firm--softer, older tomatoes tend to get a little mushy when fried. If you are picking your own green tomatoes, try to pick the ones that are just barely getting a hint of a pinkish hue. These are the best for frying because they are less bitter than fully green tomatoes and have a bit of that delicious red tomato flavor., Cast-iron skillets work really well for this recipe, but any heavy skillet will work as well. Add ¼ to ½ inches of cooking oil to the pan. You don’t want to drown the tomatoes in oil so don’t put much more than ½ inches of oil into your pan.


For an extra boost of flavor, add three tablespoons of bacon grease to the oil and stir until it is relatively diluted. The bacon grease will give your tomatoes an extra dose of salty deliciousness.

, Make sure to get rid of any dirt or foreign debris on the surface of the tomato. Pat them dry with paper towels and proceed to the cutting board. Patting them dry will make cutting them a bit easier.

, For tomato slices that stay together best when fried, make 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick slices. For even sturdier appetizers, cut the tomatoes into thirds.


If you are concerned that your tomatoes might be a little bitter (very green tomatoes can be) add a pinch of sugar each side of the slices. The sugar will cut the bitterness., There are many different recipes you can use. The most common one is to combine ½ cup of buttermilk with one large egg. Whisk the two ingredients together.If you do not have buttermilk, you can whisk three eggs together. If you want to add a bit of creaminess to the mixture, you can add a dash of milk.

, Again, there are several variations you can use for this part of the recipe. The most common is to use a ½ cup of cornmeal. Combine ¼ cup of flour with the ½ cup of cornmeal. Add one teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper. Stir all of the ingredients together and set it aside.If you do not have cornmeal, you can use seasoned breadcrumbs (Italian or cracked pepper flavorings work well.) You could also crush up some crackers (Ritz work well) and set them aside in a bowl. The point is simply to add a bit of crunch to the fried tomatoes.

, Lay the tomatoes slices in the flour, coating both sides evenly. Once you have done this, lay the flour-coated slices in the buttermilk and egg mixture, making sure they are fully coated in the liquid. Once coated in the egg mixture, dredge them in the cornmeal mixture (or whatever crunchy coating you chose to use.) Make sure they get a generous dipping in the crunchy concoction.

, Place each coated slice into the hot oil in the skillet. Make sure to give each tomato enough space or else they might fuse together while they are getting fried. Fry them for three minutes on each side. A good way to know when they are done is to watch them until they develop a golden brown color. until golden brown.

, Use tongs to take each fried tomato out. Place them on a plate that has been covered with paper towels. The paper towels will absorb the grease that drips off of them, allowing them to become crunchy.

, Ranch also makes a great dipping sauce for these delicious fried treats.

Serve and enjoy.",How to Make Fried Green Tomatoes2," These should be the same sort of tomatoes you would purchase for normal fried tomatoes. Slice the tomatoes into evenly sized discs. Generally cutting them into thirds or fourths work best.

, In a large bowl, combine one cup of flour, one tablespoon of cornstarch, and ¼ teaspoon of baking powder. You can also add any herbs you would like, as well as salt and pepper. Pour half a can of dark beer and a ½ cup of cold water into the dry mixture. Stir this mixture together.Dark beer such as a lager or an ale works best but if you only have lighter beers or ambers on hand, those should work fine as well.

, You should only pour about ½ an inch of oil into the skillet. The oil can either be vegetable oil or canola oil. Make sure the oil is fully heated by dropping a pinch of the batter into the oil. If it sizzles and immediately creates bubbles, the oil is perfectly heated.

, Make sure to coat both sides of the tomatoes evenly. Because the batter will be relatively thin and slippery, you will need to dip the tomatoes in and make sure they are coated really well.

, You will then need to transfer them immediately to the frying pan to ensure that none of the batter drips off. You should fry them for about three minutes or until they are golden brown.

, Place them on a plate or pan that has been covered in paper towels. This will ensure that the excess oil drains off and the tomatoes become extra crispy.

, Note that these are awesome when served with a dipping sauce like Ranch or marinara.

Discard anything caught in the strainer, and let the milk mixture come to room temperature before chilling it in the fridge for 2 hours.Make sure that the bowl is big enough to hold your heavy whipping cream and strawberries as well.

, Just as the milk mixture is almost done chilling, take the strawberries out of the fridge, and pour them into a blender or food processor. Purée them until you get your desired consistency. The longer you purée them for, the smoother your ice cream will be.


Try not to leave behind any big chunks, however; that's what your remaining ½ cup (100 grams) of strawberries is for!

, Take the milk mixture out of the fridge, and fold in the puréed strawberries and heavy cream. Keep folding and stirring until the color is even, and you can't see any streaks or swirls.

, The longer you purée them for, the smoother your ice cream will be. If you want, you can leave some chunks to mimic store-bought strawberry ice cream., You can do this in an electric, stand mixer, or in a food processor fitted with whisks. You can also use a handheld beater. Keep beating the heavy cream until it becomes thick and fluffy. This will take about 1 minute., Keep beating it until it is just mixed in.

, This will take about 5 minutes. The custard is ready when it has become thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon and reaches 160°F (72°C).

, Fill a sink with ice, then place a bowl inside of it. Set a fine, mesh strainer on top of the bowl, then pour the custard through it. Discard anything caught in the strainer, then stir the custard as it cools.


The ice should be level with the custard in the bowl. Do not let any ice get inside of the custard.
Make sure that the bowl is large enough to hold the heavy whipping cream as well. You will be mixing everything in this bowl once the mixture cools.

, Once the custard has cooled, take the bowl out of the ice bath, and stir in the heavy whipping cream and vanilla extract. You can do this using a whisk or rubber spatula.

, It would be better if you chilled it overnight, however. Be sure to press the plastic wrap right against the surface of the custard. This will prevent a skin from forming on top.

, Peel and slice the peaches first, then put them into a blender or food processor. Purée them until you get the consistency you want. The longer you purée them for, the smoother your ice cream will be.


If you can't get any fresh peaches, you can use 4 cups (900 grams) of frozen, unsweetened peach slices instead.Let the peaches thaw first; this will make it easier to mix them into the custard.

, You can do this using a rubber spatula or a whisk. Keep stirring until the color is even, and there are no streaks or swirls.

, Fill your ice cream maker two-thirds of the way with the mixture, then freeze the ice cream according to manufacturer's directions. Keep the rest of the mixture in the fridge while you are freezing your current batch. As you finish freezing each batch, put it into a freezer-safe container, and store it in the fridge.If you don't have an ice cream maker, pour the ice cream mixture into a shallow cake or loaf pan, and freeze it for 45 minutes. Stir the ice cream well, making sure to break up any ice crystals. After that, freeze the ice cream for 2 to 4 hours, stirring it every 30 minutes., Once the ice cream comes out of the ice cream maker, it is ready to serve as a soft-serve type of ice cream. If you want the ice cream to be more firm, you will need to leave it in the freezer for 2 to 4 hours.Even if you are not using an ice cream maker, you might want to do this as well. Keep your ice cream covered as it freezes to prevent ice crystals from forming.

Place molds in the freezer.,
Remove molds from the freezer once the juice is completely frozen through.",How to Make Ice Lollies2," It's best to let an adult do this, since it requires you to use a knife. Use a small, sharp knife (a pairing knife works best), holding it against the thumb of your dominant hand so about 1/2 inch of the tip sticks out beyond your thumb. Hold the strawberry in your opposite hand.Insert the tip of the knife into the top of the strawberry--under the leaves, where the red turns white--at a 45 degree angle.Turn the strawberry and the knife in opposite directions.Cut until your knife reaches the starting point and you can easily remove the core from the strawberry., Have an adult help you with this part so you don't cut yourself on the blades or make a mess!


You can substitute frozen strawberries if you don't have any fresh strawberries. Frozen fruits are frozen when ripe, so they should still taste great.
You can also leave chunks of strawberries to add texture to your lollies. Use the ""pulse"" setting on the blender so you don't puree all the fruit. You can also add slices of strawberry to the puree later., You want to catch all the little strawberry seeds in the strainer, so make sure the strainer is fine enough to only let the juice pass through.It's okay if you don't strain out your seeds. Your lollies won't be quite as smooth and the seeds may get stuck in your teeth, but they will still be delicious.
If you decided to leave some fruit chunks in your puree, skip this step so you don't lose those big pieces of fruit.

, The mix should be the same color and consistency throughout. If there are white streaks from the heavy cream, you may want to mix a little more thoroughly.


If you don't like strawberry, feel free to experiment with other fruit flavors! Try watermelon, mango, blueberry--whatever you like best! Look for fruit that is ripe and in season for the best, sweetest flavors.Try coconut milk instead of heavy cream for a refreshing tropical flavor.
You can also improvise with your sweetener. Instead of simple syrup, try agave nectar, honey, or maple syrup.

, A little extra space also gives the liquid room to expand.


If you don't have molds, you can easily make your own. Just pour the mixture into a paper or plastic cup instead.
Do not try to make your own mold using a glass. Liquid expands as it freezes, and it may break the glass. This will ruin your pop and make a dangerous mess in your freezer.

, Usually, molds come with a lid that also acts as the handle. If your mold didn't come with a lid, you lost the lid, or you're using cups instead of store-bought molds, cover the top tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Then insert a popsicle stick through the wrap.


Don't move the popsicle stick around too much--the smaller the hole in the aluminum, the straighter your handle will stand.
You can also use plastic knives as handles if you don't have popsicle sticks--just be careful not to lick the rough part when you're eating!

, Leaving them overnight will ensure the pops are completely frozen, but they may be ready in as little as four hours., If you try to wiggle the handle, it should be firm in the juice and not move at all. You can run warm water over the sides and bottom of the mold to help release ice lollies in one piece.If you used a paper cup, you can try to just peel the paper off the lolly.

Your finished ice lollies should be equal layers of pink, yellow, and green--just like a traffic light!",How to Make Ice Lollies3," All the fruit should be ripe (or even overripe)--ripened fruit is sweeter, so you won't need to add any extra sugar., Use a small, sharp knife to cut the core out of the strawberries.


Insert the tip of the knife into the top of the strawberry, right where it turns white.
Cut out the white center of the strawberry. In doing so, you will remove the leaves as well.

, The taste might not be as intense or fresh, but it will still be delicious!


Clean the blender after use, since you will be using it again for the peaches and the kiwi.

, This should catch all the strawberry seeds so they don't end up in your frozen lolly.,


You can substitute another sweetener for simple syrup. Try honey, agave nectar, or maple syrup.
Sample a little of the puree to make sure it's sweet enough. If not, add a little bit more sweetener, to taste.

,


If you don't have an ice pop mold, you can substitute a paper or disposable plastic cup.
Don't try to substitute a glass for the pop mold--as the juice freezes, it expands, and it may break the glass. This will ruin your pop and make a dangerous, sharp mess in your freezer.

, This should take 1 1/2 to 2 hours.Cover the mold with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. If the molds came with covers that double as a handle/popsicle stick, wait to use these. If the first layer of your ice lolly freezes around the stick, you won't be able to add the next two layers.

, If you don't have fresh peaches, you can use canned peaches that are already peeled, stoned, and sliced. Just drain the water from the can.

, Your blender won't have to work as hard to puree the fruit if it's cut into little slices. Using a paring knife, cut all the way through one side of the peach, until your knife hits the pit.Run the knife all the way around the peach, keeping the blade against the pit, cutting the peach in half.Hold the peach in your hands and twist each half in opposite directions until the come apart. The pit should still be stuck in one half of the peach.Remove the pit with your fingers or the tip of the knife., If it's not sweet enough, and a little simple syrup until it's to your liking.


Clean the blender so it will be ready for the kiwi puree.

, Only fill the mold another 1/3 of the way to the top.Cover the mold with tinfoil or plastic wrap.


Make sure the strawberry puree is completely frozen before you add the peach puree, or they will mix together. This will probably taste good, but the effect of having 3 individual sections of flavors will be ruined.

, This should take another 1 1/2 to 2 hours., Make sure you remove all the fuzzy skin and discard the top and bottom tips., Again, you may want to taste the puree to make sure it's sweet enough.

, Don't let the kiwi spill out of the top of the mold, or your lollies will all freeze together. Leave a little room at the top so you can insert the handle and give the puree a little room to expand as it freezes.

, Usually, molds come with a lid that also acts as the handle. You may have to push it into the already frozen part of the lollie.


If your mold didn't come with a lid, you lost the lid, or you're using cups instead of store-bought molds, cover the top tightly with aluminum foil.
Insert a popsicle stick through the aluminum foil. Make sure it is straight. It's okay if you have to push it into the frozen peach layer to make sure it's secure.

,


Test that the juice is completely frozen by wiggling the handle of one of the pops. It should be firm in the juice and not move at all. You can run warm water over the sides and bottom mold to help release ice lollies in one piece--just don't loosen them from the handle!, After you've enjoyed these frozen treats, consider experimenting with other flavors. Try to stick with fruits that are all in season at the same time for the most harmonious flavors.Spring and summer fruits include blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, boysenberries, grapes, melons, nectarines, plums, peaches, and pluots.Blackberries, apples, kiwis, dates, kumquats, peaches, pomegranates, and raspberries are all in season during late summer and fall.Try grapefruit, kumquats, limes, mandarins, and pomelos in the winter.Oranges are in season all year long."

, Many chefs will even do this overnight, making sure they'll have the ice cream solid enough and taking one thing off their list on baking day. Don't skimp on this time -- the ice cream has to be rock solid., Meringues are made out of egg whites and sugars, and the yolk will prevent the sorry of stiff binding you need for a solid meringue. Even if you don't have an egg separator, there are a few ways to remove the yolk from the white:


Crack the egg in half, then transfer the yolk back and forth between the two shell halves. Do this over your mixing bowl, and the white should drip down as you toss the yolk back and forth.
Crack the egg over a slotted spoon or funnel letting the white drip out.
Crack the egg into your hands, holding the yolk and letting the white drip through., Cream of tartar helps the meringue keep its shape, allowing the eggs to solidify under the stress of mixing.

, This should only take a minute. ""Peaks"" are when you lift the mixer out and the egg mixture comes up with the beaters to form a little sagging point., Beat the sugar in with the egg whites, adding it slowly so that it doesn't splatter out. A simple 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla will add a nice, subtle flavor to meringue as well, though it isn't necessary if you don't have it around., Stiff peaks mean that the mixture holds its shape well. If you pull up a little point of egg with the beaters, it doesn't immediately begin to wilt. Once you hit this point, stop. Further beating will make the mixture even more dry and stiff, and you need to be able to spread it!, You want a very high temperature to quickly cook the meringue on the outside without the heat penetrating to the ice cream in the middle. The baking sheet with parchment paper will prevent sticking and messy cleanups later.

, There are endless ways to make the base of your baked Alaska, and you should choose the one that best fits your ice cream choices, cooking time, and preferences. You can:


Cut strips out of a larger sheet cake, which you then use to ""build"" your base

Bake a round layer cake or brownie in an 8"" pie pan, let it cool, and use.
Purchase a sponge cake disc and cut it to fit, then drizzle with orange or chocolate liquor., The ice cream will likely need to warm up slightly in order to slide out of the bowl, but you want to act fast once the ice cream comes out of the freezer -- it should be as cold as possible when the cake goes in the oven., If you've cut a sheet cake into strips, place them down on the bottom of the ice cream so that there are no spaces. If you have a full round cake, center it on the ice cream, but don't worry about pressing it in just yet, especially if the edges overlap and you're worried the cake will split.

, With the cake on the bottom of the pile, pull up on the plastic wrap. This should detach the bowl from the ice cream, leaving you with a beautiful dome of ice cream on your cake base. If it does not, leave it for 1-2 minutes and try again. Use the excess plastic wrap to pull up on the bowl without yanking on the ice cream.


You may just have to wait if it is frozen on solid. Keep lifting at the edges, but be careful of the cake underneath -- don't let it rip or tear because you're pulling too hard or impatient.

, You can use a spoon and make swirls, but the classic Baked Alaska has flowery, starred meringue that browns beautifully on the edge. Add about 1/2 inch of meringue around the entire dish in whatever pattern you want.


Make sure all of the ice cream is covered -- you need the meringue to absorb the heat so that it doesn't all melt.

, Once the meringue has a nice golden color across the entire cake (some small bits will be brown, but don't let it become black) you can take the dessert out. You're ready to serve and enjoy!


If you have a kitchen torch, you can use this to brown the meringue without putting the dish in the oven at all."

Grease a 9-inch cake pan, taking care to ensure that the bottom and sides are completely oiled, so the cake won't stick to the pan. Sprinkle a little flour in the center of the pan and tip it from side to side, so the flour coats the bottom and sides of the pan.






;
, Either use a sifter to sift the ingredients or place them in a small bowl and stir them together with a whisk.









If you'd like to make a chocolate ice cream cake, add 1/2 cup cocoa powder to the mixture.
For a spice cake, add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves.

, In a large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer to beat the egg yolks, vanilla, and 1/2 cup sugar. Continue beating until the mixture becomes thick and pale, which takes about 5 minutes.








, Place the egg whites and a pinch of salt in a medium mixing bowl. Using a whisk or clean beaters, beat the whites until they form soft peaks. Continue beating the mixture and add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Keep beating until the egg whites become stiff and glossy.








, Carefully fold the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Fold in the flour mixture with a spatula. Be careful not to overmix the ingredients; continue folding them until they are just combined.







, Spread it evenly into the pan with a spatula.








, Place the cake pan in the oven and bake it for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven, invert it onto a wire rack or plate, and let it cool completely.









If the cake seems to be sticking to the sides of the pan, run a knife around the edge of the cake before attempting to invert it.
If the cake breaks when you invert it, place the pieces on a plate and allow them to cool. You can still use the cake.

, Using a large serrated knife, slice the cake crosswise so that you have two thin discs of cake. Wrap each in plastic wrap and place them in the freezer for several hours. You can assemble the cake when the halves are frozen solid.

, While the ice cream is softening, remove the cake halves from the freezer. Unwrap one half and place it on a cake plate. Set the other half aside for now.








, Spread a pint of ice cream over the first cake half using a spoon and an offset spatula or knife. Try not to let it spill over the edges of the cake. You should have a thick, solid layer of ice cream. Place the second layer of cake on the layer of ice cream. Spread the second pint of ice cream on top of the cake.








For a smaller cake, you can leave off the second ice cream layer.
If you'd prefer to have the cake layer on top, you can still have two ice cream layers; after spreading the first ice cream layer, make a layer of crushed cookies or chocolate chips, then spread the second pint of ice cream on top of that before adding the second cake layer.

, Place the cake in the freezer until it is completely frozen, which will take about two to four hours.

Don't overbeat the topping, or it will turn into butter.
You can add a few drops of food coloring to the whipped cream so that it matches your ice cream. For example, if you're making a strawberry ice cream cake, add a few drops of red food coloring to make a pink topping.

, Remove the cake from the freezer. Spread the whipped topping on the cake using an offset spatula. If you wish, spread more topping onto the sides of the cake to hide the layers.









You can decorate the cake with sprinkles, chocolate chips, or fruit if you desire.

Wait a little longer after the vodka has been emptied into the watermelon.,
Stick in the original watermelon plug, or a cork or wrap something over the hole.,
Slice the watermelon, serve and enjoy.",How to Make a Vodka Watermelon1," Basically you need an evenly sized, robust miniature watermelon and a 375 ml (12.6 fl oz) bottle of vodka.;
, Using a sharp knife, cut a circle (also known as a ""plug"") in the skin of the watermelon large enough for the funnel to fit in. Cut deep enough to reveal the red flesh of the watermelon fruit inside because the flesh needs to be in contact with the bottle for this to work.


Don't throw away the watermelon skin ""plug"", as this can be reused later for transporting the vodka-infused watermelon to a party.
Pouring in small amounts of vodka from different holes will be likely to distribute the alcohol more evenly than diffusion from one hole.Some people also choose to cut a thin slice from the ""base"" of the watermelon to enable it to stand without spinning. If you do this, avoid cutting into the fruit flesh, as the vodka will start dripping out the other side.

, Pour the vodka with into the exposed fruit via the funnel. It will possibly take several turns to completely empty the bottle into the watermelon.


Note that this recipe will work best with seedless watermelons., Gradually keep adding the vodka until the entire bottle has been absorbed into the fruit and has diffused through the watermelon. This may require you to come back and add more over several hours.


Another approach is to place the bottle direct into the watermelon (using good force) and ensure that it cannot move. If you prefer this method, leave the bottle in place until it is emptied out.

, This will ensure that the watermelon has absorbed all of the delicious flavoring. Depending on your watermelon size, this may take quite a long time; it can take a day (or sometimes longer).Given that you're dealing with perishable fruit and non-perishable vodka, keep the watermelon refrigerated while waiting for the vodka to seep through.Another variation is to freeze the whole watermelon for 24 hours after the vodka has been added.This will provide an ice cold refreshing treat.

, This is to stop anything getting into or out of the vodka-infused watermelon when transporting it to a party. Keep it upright when carrying.

, Only give to persons over the legal age for the consumption of alcohol as it is definitely pure alcohol. Share it around with lots of people too; while a whole mini-watermelon isn't very much to eat by yourself, a whole bottle of vodka is a lot of alcohol to consume.

Here you can see the pattern image close up. If you need to transfer this, see How to transfer a photograph and How to transfer and resize images using a grid.






, Cut all the way through the rind when cutting the top portion of the swan design. The melon above this line will be cut away once the design is done.


For better grip and to help protect your hands, use a fresh, new thick pair of gardening gloves with gripper palms.

, This is essential for the stability of the design.

, This is best done before removing the top flesh because it's a delicate cut and the weight of all the melon still in place will help you to get it right.

, Cut it into quarters, then gently pulling the pieces apart one by one. Keep an eye out for any attached parts that need a bit more cutting to release the melon rind and flesh. Cut smoothly instead of tugging to avoid the design to tear.

, Trim the features so they're are not too thick or uneven.



Use a melon baller to remove the remaining melon. These balls will be added back into the swan basket on completion of the hollowing.

, The exact amount will depend on the size of the melon – you may be able to fit more or less than one cup. Serve any remaining fruit, including melon balls, in another bowl or make another carved watermelon to balance as a pair.

If you can, pick green tomatoes that have a tinge of color at the blossom end and feel a little softer than the solid young fruits.If you pick them any earlier than this, they will not have matured and thus will not ripen at all. Cook immature green tomatoes as is.


If you're not sure whether your green tomatoes are mature, cut a questionable tomato in half--if it has yellowish interiors and jelly-like or sticky tissue, it is mature enough to ripen.Obviously, the one that you cut in half won't ripen, but observing how it looks on the outside will give you an idea of what to look for with green tomatoes on the vine.
If you know there's a frost coming that will ruin all of the tomatoes, don't pick individual tomatoes; lift the entire plant out of the ground, making sure that some roots are still attached. Shake off as much dirt as you can and hang it upright in a dry, sheltered location, such as the garage. Avoid extremes (direct sunlight, total darkness). your tomatoes will die! The tomatoes will still ripen almost as well as they would have on the vine., that might rub on other tomatoes and cause damage during the ripening process. If the tomatoes are dirty, wash them gently first and allow to air dry before trying to ripen them.

,, If you see any, remove the affected tomatoes immediately and give the tomatoes more air circulation. The cooler the storage area for the tomatoes, the longer the ripening process will be. Expect about 2 weeks for ripening under normal, warm household conditions. If the house or storage area is too cold, the tomatoes may never ripen or will result in flavour-less tomatoes.

Puree the tomatoes.",How to Grill Tomatoes," Thick-skinned tomatoes are less likely to burst on the grill. These include Roma tomatoes, plum tomatoes, and crack resistant tomatoes.Avoid overripe, oozing tomatoes, which will drop juice and flesh through the grate.;
, Remove excess water to shorten the grilling time and keep your tomatoes firm. Cut the tomatoes in half, then sprinkle salt on the cut sides. Place face down on a paper towel or cooking rack for 30 minutes.Even if you don't wait the full 30 minutes, drain them while the grill is warming up.
Don't try this with small tomatoes. You'll lose too many flavorful juices just cutting them open.

, Tomatoes grill best over high heat. Set a gas grill to high at least 15 minutes before grilling. For a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered in ash and you can only keep your hand near the grate for three seconds or less.Place the grate 4–5 inches (10–13cm) above the heat source.
Close the lid of the gas grill on cool or windy days.

, Tomatoes taste great with just a drizzle of olive oil, but extra flavor is useful if they're the centerpiece of a dish. Here are a few delicious options:


Olive oil, salt, black pepper (or lemon pepper), garlic powder, ground habanero pepper. Go easy on the salt and pepper, to avoid overpowering the tomato flavor.1 cup (240 mL) olive oil, ¼ cup (60 mL) white vinegar, ¼ cup (60 mL) sugar, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) anchovy paste.Add parsley once cooled, and top the tomatoes with feta.
To turn a marinade into a crust, mash breadcrumbs into it until soggy. Top the tomato with blue cheese and cover with the breadcrumb marinade mixture.Fresh basil, minced garlic, chopped fresh basil, and a pinch each of black pepper and salt., The best approach depends on the size and juiciness of your tomatoes. The goal is to stop the pulp from dripping out, and to make the tomatoes easy to handle. Here are your options:Cut medium to large tomatoes in half for easy handling with a spatula.
If you're using the ""cheese crust"" mentioned above, cut the top ¼ off medium or large tomatoes.Skewer small tomatoes whole on two parallel skewers, for easy turning.
Place small tomatoes in a grill basket. Preheat the basket on the grill for a few minutes.
Wrap a mound of juicy tomatoes in aluminum foil, crimping tightly to seal in juices. (Brush with marinade first.)

, For best results, let the tomatoes soak in the marinade for at least twenty minutes. If you're planning ahead, they can soak in the fridge overnight.


If you're in a hurry, just brush the marinade onto the cut side of the tomatoes, or onto the whole surface if the tomatoes are uncut. You'll still get some flavor, and the oil will help prevent sticking on the grate.
For extra flavor, let the tomatoes soak in the marinade for a couple hours, or even overnight.

, Place halved tomatoes cut side down on the grill, and leave them in place until ready. When grilling whole tomatoes, rotate whenever they start to drip. Keep a close eye on the tomatoes the whole time. Move them to a cooler spot on the grill if one of them bursts.


Use a metal spatula instead of tongs, to avoid mashing the tomatoes.For the ""cheese crust"" method, grill with the cheese on top instead.

, Grill until the tomatoes shrivel and develop a few black spots. This usually takes 5–10 minutes, depending on tomato size and grill temperature.


When grilling foil-wrapped tomatoes, you can wait until they burst into a hot, caramelized mess. This takes about 18 minutes.Optionally, paint on more marinade halfway through.

, These are plenty delicious as their own dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan or Asiago right away, so it melts over the tomatoes. Top with sprigs of fresh basil, Italian parsley, or pine nuts toasted for five minutes in a dry pan.

, Tomatoes are close comrades with steak, mushrooms, chicken, and other grilled vegetables. Lay out a platter, or skewer onto kabobs.

, Grilled tomatoes turn even simple dishes into smoky, caramelized love. They make a perfect crostini topping, or you could try them on Italian pasta salad or mushroom risotto.

, Chop grilled tomatoes coarsely. Complement the caramelized sugars with salty ingredients, such as capers and feta. Mix with grilled asparagus and red onion, or add a fresh taste with arugula and snap peas.

, Roast jalapeño peppers with the tomatoes, then remove the stem and seeds. Coarsely chop peppers and tomatoes alongside garlic, cilantro, and white onion. Toss in apple cider vinegar, a sprinkle of salt, and a pinch of cumin.

, Squeeze off the skins, then boil them down to a sauce that packs caramelized tomato flavor. Include garlic, basil, and/or fresh Italian parsley.


For a fresher flavor, grill halved tomatoes on the skin side, for just a minute or two.The tomatoes will roast further as they boil down. Using fully grilled tomatoes can lead to a burnt or over-sweet sauce.

, Squeeze off the skins and puree. Store this simple paste and use it as a base for sauces, salsas, and soups."

",How to Make Coke Popsicles," Find a cupcake pan or anything with cup molds in it. Clean it out by washing it with soap and water. Dry the pan with a paper towel or rag.;
, All cokes are different so find the one you like and prefer. Try looking for flavor options for a little twist and flavor to your popsicles. Some popular flavor options could be vanilla, cherry, lemon, or lime.

For a healthier choice and dessert, try using diet coke instead of regular coke.

, Figure out how much popsicles you'll exactly need. Pour the amount of how much you need. When pouring the coke in the molds, fill it all the to the top. This helps the popsicle get bigger and have more room to eat. Popsicles that are too flat won't look very appealing.

, Rip a piece of aluminum foil and cover it on the cupcake pan. Tuck in the edges to have the foil stick together.

Plastic wrap can also be used as a substitute. Try using a plastic wrap that is strong so it can hold the popsicles together in a better standing position.

, In each cupcake hole, poke a popsicle stick in between. It should pop in easily and if it doesn't try poking it harder.

Do not use toothpicks when making these popsicles. The popsicles are round from the cupcake pan and the toothpicks will be too thin to be able to hold the popsicles. Also, the edges are pokey and may harm others by mistake.

, Place popsicles in a freezer and wait until thoroughly frozen. For it to be thoroughly solid, wait about three hours to overnight. Some people make the mistake by taking out their popsicles too early. The popsicles break and crack open their liquid.

Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully mixed.You can usually find all of the spices for the chai concentrate in the spice aisle of your regular grocery store.
Whole vanilla beans are available at most grocery stores, though you can also find them at online retailers.
You can adjust the spice amounts so the flavors that you prefer most stand out.;
, Place the pan with the spice mixture on the stove, and heat it over medium-high heat. Allow the mixture to come to a complete boil, which should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes.Be sure to keep an eye on the pan to ensure that the mixture doesn’t boil over.

, After the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan. Let the mixture simmer for 15 minutes., Once the spice mixture has simmered for 15 minutes, place 1 black tea bag inside. Allow the tea to steep in the spice mixture for at least 5 minutes.You can use whatever type of black tea that you like, but Darjeeling is a particularly good option.

, After you’ve steeped the tea bag in the spice mixture for several minutes, pour it through a strainer. Discard the solids and reserve the liquid chai tea concentrate.In addition to using the chai concentrate for the popsicles, you can also mix it with water or milk to make chai tea.
This recipe makes 1 cup (237 ml) of the chai tea concentrate, which is the amount that’s needed for the popsicles. You can easily double or triple the recipe, though, so you have extra to use for tea.
If you make the concentrate ahead of time or have extra, you can store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

, Add the chai tea concentrate and 1 cup (237 ml) of milk to a large bowl. Stir well so the two are thoroughly combined.You can use whatever type of milk that you like, but canned coconut milk will create the richest popsicles. For lighter popsicles, use cow’s milk, nut milk, or soy milk.

, Once the chai tea concentrate and milk are mixed, add the liquid to a popsicle mold.

Mix the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.You can substitute half and half for the heavy cream if you prefer. The popsicles won’t be as creamy, but they’ll still have a delicious chai flavor.

, Once the milk, heavy cream, and sugar are combined, stir 3 tablespoons (12 g) of strong black loose tea to the pot. Place the mixture on the stove and heat on medium until it comes to a gentle simmer. Let the mixture simmer for a minute.Don’t allow the mixture to come to a boil. If it seems like it might, lower the heat.
You can use any black tea, but Assam, Ceylon or Nilgiri are all good options.
You can substitute 3 black tea bags for the loose tea. However, you’ll need to steep the bags longer in the next step.

, After the mixture has simmered for a minute, remove the pot from the heat. Allow the tea to steep in the liquid for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently.The longer that you let the tea steep, the stronger the chai taste will be.
If you are using tea bags, let them steep for about 10 minutes.

, When the tea is finished steeping, pour the mixture through a sieve into a clean pot. Add a 1-inch (2.5-cm) piece of ginger that’s been sliced to the mixture and mix well to combine., Place 1 teaspoon (3 g) of green cardamom pods, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of whole cloves, a 3-inch (7.5-cm) piece of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of whole fennel seeds, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of whole black pepper, and 1 star anise in the bowl of a mortar and pestle. Gently crush the spices with the pestle until they have a coarse texture.If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, roll a rolling pin over the spices to coarsely crush them.

, After you’ve crushed the spices, add them to strained cream mixture. Return the mixture to stove, and heat over medium until it returns to a simmer, which should take about 5 minutes., Once the mixture comes a simmer, take the pot off the heat. Allow the mixture to sit for about 30 minutes, so the spices have time to fully infuse the liquid.If you want the popsicles to have a stronger spice flavor, you can let the mixture sit for up to 45 minutes.

, After the spices have had time to infuse the mixture, add the remaining ½ cup (118 ml) of heavy cream to the pot. Mix well so the cream is fully incorporated.Taste the chai mixture after you add the cream. If you prefer your chair to be sweeter, you can mix in some more sugar.

, When the cream is fully mixed into the chai, use a sieve to strain it into a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for approximately 1 hour., Once the mixture has chilled for an hour, transfer it to a popsicle mold. Add sticks if necessary, and chill in the freezer until they are completely set, which should take about 3 to 4 hours.Be careful not to overfill the molds as you pour the chai mixture into them.

Heat the mixture on medium heat until it begins to simmer.You’ll know that the mixture is simmering when small bubbles begin to appear near the edges of the pan.

, Add 5 egg yolks and ¾ cup (150 g) of sugar to a medium bowl. Use a whisk to blend the two together until the mixture is thick and pale yellow.To separate the egg yolks, crack the eggs against a flat surface, such as a countertop. Break them into two halves over a bowl, allowing the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolks back and forth so the white drips into the bowl below, continuing the process until you’ve removed all of the egg whites.

, After you’ve combined the egg yolks and sugar, slowly add a small amount of the hot cream mixture into the bowl. Be sure to whisk the mixture the entire time that you’re adding the cream.Adding a small amount of the heated cream to the eggs helps temper them, or raise their temperature, so they don’t cook when you add them to the full cream mixture.

, Once the egg mixture is tempered, pour it into the rest of the cream mixture. Whisk the mixture constantly to help prevent the eggs from scrambling., When the entire egg mixture is added to the cream, turn down the heat to medium-low. Allow the mixture to cook until it thickens, which should take 5 to 10 minutes.You’ll know that the mixture is thick enough when it coats the back of a spoon that you lift out of it.

, When the mixture has thickened up, take the pot off the heat. Pour the mixture through a sieve into a bowl to strain any solids from it., After you’ve strained the custard, add the zest from 1 orange to the mixture. Stir well to ensure that it is fully incorporated.Adding the orange zest is an optional step. You can let the chai flavor stand on its own if you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed in the orange zest, transfer the custard to a popsicle mold. Place the mold in the freezer, and allow the popsicles to set up for an hour.If your popsicle molds have built-in sticks, you can just freeze the pops for 4 to 5 hours until they are fully frozen and skip the next step.

, If your mold doesn’t have built-in sticks, take the pops out of the freezer after an hour. Place wooden sticks in the center of each pop and return the mold to the freezer until the popsicles are fully set, which should take another 3 to 4 hours., When the pops are set, run the outside of the mold under warm water to help loosen them. Gently take them out by the stick and serve them.Leave any popsicles that you don’t eat in the mold in the freezer until you are ready to serve them.

Create adult snow cones with a dash of liqueur.",How to Make Snow Cones," You can add a little bit of ice to make a personal snow cone, a moderate amount of ice to serve a few people, or you could fill the blender with ice to create many servings. Be sure to follow the directions that came with your blender for best results.
/images/thumb/d/dc/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-1-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/dc/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-1-Version-2.jpg









Depending on your blender, you might have many different settings to choose from when crushing your ice. In many cases, the puree feature will give you finely crushed ice, which is ideal for snow cones.
You might like your snow cones with larger bits of ice. If so, you should blend your ice for a shorter period of time. Extra fine ice can be achieved by running the ice through the blender for longer.
If you don't have a blender, you can put your ice in a heavy duty plastic bag and smash the ice with a rolling pin, hammer, or tenderizing mallet. You could also drop your ice repeatedly onto a hard surface to crush this ice, though this may take some time.You can also make your snow cone out of fresh, clean snow. You should exercise caution when doing this, though. Some snow may contain impurities that are unhealthy to consume.;
, You can leave your ice in the blender and scoop it out for the snow cones, but you should be careful that no one accidentally cuts themselves on the blades at the bottom of the blender. To prevent this, you may want to pour or scoop your ice from the blender into a bowl.For especially large parties, you might have to prepare several blender's worth of ice and put it in a bowl for serving. You can keep your ice frozen until you're ready to serve it by keeping the blended ice in your freezer.
You shouldn't leave your blended ice in the freezer for too long. If you do, it may refreeze leaving you with a bowl of solid ice.

, Traditionally, at fairs and summer events, snow cones are served in paper cones. These are a cheap and disposable way of serving your snow cones, so you may want to use these yourself. You could also use a mug cup, a paper cup, or a plastic cup, depending on your preference./images/thumb/d/d5/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-3-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d5/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-3-Version-2.jpg









You should fill your cup until it is full of crushed ice. You can use a large serving spoon, but you may want to use an ice cream scoop to give your snow cones a rounded shape.

, There are many different ways you can flavor your snow cone. You can use juice, soda, or specially made syrups. In most cases, one to two tablespoons per two scoops of ice should be enough to flavor your snow cone./images/thumb/a/a0/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-4-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/a/a0/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-4-Version-2.jpg









Be careful not to add too much flavoring to your frozen treat! The temperature difference could cause your snow cone to melt quickly, turning your snow cone to a slush cone.

, With a paper cone, it's easy enough to eat a snow cone without any utensils. For regular shaped cups or deep cups, you may want to serve your cones with a spoon., Add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water to a saucepan or small pot. Heat this on your stove on high until the mixture comes to a simmer and the sugar is dissolved. Then add your favorite Kool-Aid to the mix and stir until the Kool-Aid is completely dissolved./images/thumb/4/43/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-6-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/4/43/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-6-Version-2.jpg









You should wait until your Kool-Aid syrup is completely cooled before you use it. This kind of syrup can often be kept in the refrigerator for up to a month., This natural syrup can be made from your choice of fruit juice mixed with water. You should combine the two in a 2 to 1 ratio; 2 parts fruit juice to every 1 part water. For example, for every 2 cups of fruit juice, you should add 1 cup of water.
/images/thumb/4/4d/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-7.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-7.jpg
/images/thumb/4/4d/Make-Snow-Cones-Step-7.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Snow-Cones-Step-7.jpg









You may notice that natural syrups have a slightly different taste than out-of-the-box flavors. You may need to thin the mixture with water to make it suit your tastes., You'll need a sugar free flavoring packet, like Crystal Light or Everly, but you could also use a mix of Kool-Aid and Splenda.

Make chocolate covered banana pops.",How to Choose Healthy Frozen Snacks and Desserts," In the case that you want to get some help from the store, choose a fairly healthy and nutritious pre-made frozen treat. To make sure you're choosing something smart, read the nutrition fact panel.


One of the first things you want to look at on the nutrition panel is the serving size. Many prepackaged foods that appear to be a single serving are more than once serving in a package. Choose to either eat the amount that equals a single serving, or calculate what the real nutritional info would be for the serving you choose to eat.
Next, check the total calories. This is listed right at the top. Make sure whatever you're buying falls into an appropriate calorie level for you.Remember to multiply the total calories by the number of servings. So if it has 250 calories but contains three servings, the entire meal is actually 750 calories.
Also look at the total sugar or carbohydrate content. This is found mid-way down the nutrition fact panel. If you're diabetic or want to follow a reduced-sugar diet, this number should be low — aim for less than 30 gm carbohydrates for a serving.
Also consider the total fat. This is listed near the top. Choose frozen treats that have no trans-fat and less than 2 – 3 grams of saturated fat per serving.;
, In addition the nutrition fact panel, take a look at the ingredient list. This will provide you with information on what was used to make the dessert.


The ingredient list is where you'll find out if there is added sugar, trans fat, preservatives, artificial colors or additives.
If you are looking to avoid certain types of ingredients, you need to review this list. Note that the first ingredient listed is the one in the highest quantity.
For example, if you want to avoid added sugars, review the ingredient list for items like: sucrose, sugar in the raw, organic cane juice, corn syrup or corn syrup solids.

, When you are reviewing the ingredient label, there are things you should specifically be on the lookout for. Some ingredients are not considered healthy or nutritious and should be avoided in your frozen treats.


Look for trans-fats in the ingredient list. Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils mean there are trans-fats in the product. Stay away from these unhealthy sources of fat.Avoided highly processed forms of sugar like corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup or sucrose.Some frozen treats, especially kid-friendly treats, will have a variety of dyes and coloring agents. Avoid these ingredients as well as they are more processed.
In general, try to pick frozen treats with ingredient lists that are fairly short and the ingredients listed are natural and not processed additives.

, Another way that buying store bought items can help keep your frozen treats a bit healthier is if you can purchase more portion controlled options.


Many food manufacturers are making smaller, portion-controlled treats. This makes it easier to stick to a smaller serving.
If you purchase a gallon of ice cream or a whole cake, it's easy to go back for seconds or serve yourself a big portion.
However, purchasing items like individually frozen popsicles or ice cream cups can keep you to a pre-specified, small portion.
Look for these types of items at the store. Avoid purchasing large quantities or frozen treats that are multiple servings.

, One way to make sure your frozen treat is a little bit better for you is by making items at home. You'll have full control over every ingredient.


When you make foods from home, you can control how much added sugar, fats or salt that are in the food. So instead of adding a lot of high fat or high sugar foods to your frozen treats, you can pick better options.Think about a few of your top favorite frozen desserts. Look up healthy or low-calorie versions of these recipes and online and try out a few at home.

, When you're preparing frozen items at home, keep your desserts healthy and more nutritious by being picky about what ingredients you use.


Just because you make something at home, that doesn't automatically mean it'll be healthy. You need to make sure you're also choosing healthy ingredients.If your frozen dessert recipe calls for flour (like in a crust for a frozen pie), use 100% whole wheat flour. It's higher in fiber and protein.
Choose low-fat dairy products for items like milkshakes, ice cream or popsicles. The lower fat content will lower the total calorie count.
Use fruit products that don't have added sugar. Choose fresh fruit, 100% fruit juice or unsweetened dried fruit.
Cut down on the total sugar you use in recipes or consider using a no-calorie sweetener.

, When you're making and eating your homemade frozen treats, measure out your portions. Whether you're being accurate with ingredients or serving yourself, portion control is essential.


Keeping portions in control essentially keeps the total calories, fat and sugar in control as well.
For example, if a popsicle recipe says to add in 2 tablespoons of honey, but you squirted it in without measuring, you may add much more than that. This mistake will cause your frozen treat to be higher in calories and sugar.
In addition, after you've made your homemade sweet treats, measure out the appropriate portion of your treat.
In general, for ice creams or sorbets, the serving size is a 1/2 cup. One popsicle or one small slice of a frozen cake is also one serving.

, Both fruits and vegetables are naturally nutritious foods. Making your frozen desserts based off of these foods, you'll be boosting the overall nutrient content.


Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories, but high in vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.Instead of basing your frozen treats off of dairy products or sugar, use fruit. It's naturally sweet which allows you to minimize how much sugar you add to your desserts.
Also, when blended, fruit can have a smooth and creamy texture which can help take the place of dairy products.

, Get in some vitamins and antioxidants in your dessert by making your own homemade sorbet. Using fruit as the base of this sweet treat makes this a healthy and nutritious indulgence.In the bowl of a food processor or blender, dump in about 1 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries.
Also add in a squeeze of lemon juice, small pinch of salt, 1/4 cup of coconut milk and a small drizzle of honey or agave syrup.
Blend or puree the mixture on high until the ingredients are smooth without any chunks.
Taste your sorbet for sweetness. If it needs a little more sweet, add in more honey or agave syrup. Remove from the food processor and place in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Serve cold!

, Frozen treats are not only for fruits and dairy products. In fact, many desserts, like popsicles, are a great place to add in some pureed vegetables for an extra hit of nutrition.In the bowl of a food processor, combine 1 1/2 cups of fresh strawberries, 1/2 cup of cooked red beets (do not buy pickled beets — just plain), 3/4 cup of 100% apple juice and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.
Puree the popsicle ingredients until they are completely smooth and combined. Taste the mixture for sweetness. Add a little more fruit juice if you want it sweeter.
Carefully pour the popsicle mixture into silicone or plastic popsicle molds. Freeze for about three to four hours or until they're completely firm. Serve cold!

, If you're a big fan of ice cream, you might enjoy this healthy twist. Using a frozen banana makes for a creamy and rich-tasting frozen treat.To start, cut 1 large, very ripe banana into 1/2"" slices. Place in a freezer safe bag and freeze overnight.
Place the frozen banana pieces into a food processor. Process until smooth and creamy and feels like a frozen yogurt type texture. This will take several minutes to achieve.
Once the banana is creamy, you can add any type of ""mix-ins"" that you'd like. You can add dark chocolate chips, sliced strawberries or a drizzle of peanut butter.
Scrape out the ice cream and place in a freezer-safe container. Freeze the ice cream for at least 30 minutes or until it's solid. Serve cold!

, Another fun and easy homemade treat are frozen banana pops. Covered in nutrient-rich dark chocolate, these are the perfect cold snack.To start, peel four large bananas and cut them in half. Carefully insert a wooden popsicle stick about halfway up into the banana.
Place the banana pops onto a sheet tray and freeze for about one hour.
While the bananas are freezing, melt about 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips in a deep bowl.
Carefully dip each banana pop in the melted chocolate. Try to cover the entire banana.
Lay the dipped bananas back on the sheet tray. You can sprinkle on additional toppings like: chopped nuts or unsweetened coconut flakes. Return pops to the freezer for another hour. Serve cold!
