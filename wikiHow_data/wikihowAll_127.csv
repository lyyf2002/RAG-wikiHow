Freeze the maker’s bowl overnight.,
Set the bowl in the machine and insert the mixing arm.,
Turn on the machine and add the chilled base.,
Allow the ice cream to process according to manufacturer instructions.,
Transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and freeze it until solid.",How to Make Ice Cream2," The bowl that holds your ice cream base must be fully chilled so the cooling liquid inside it is frozen solid. Place it in your freezer until is completely frozen, which should take 10 to 22 hours.If you’re having a problem with the bowl getting freezer burn, wrap it in a plastic bag before putting it in the freezer.

, When the bowl is completely frozen, remove it from the freezer and place it inside the ice cream maker. Next, place the dasher, or mixing arm, in the bowl to ready it for churning., The ice cream maker should be turned on before you add the base so it begins churning it immediately. Carefully pour the base into the machine and place the lid on top., Consult the manual that comes with your machine to know how long it takes for the ice cream to churn. In most cases, it will need 20 to 30 minutes to reach the proper consistency.If you want to add mix-ins such as nuts, crumbled cookies, and candy pieces to the ice cream, you should also consult your manual. You’ll likely be advised to add to them just before the ice cream is finished mixing.

, When the ice cream maker is finished churning the ice cream, it will have the consistency of soft serve. If you like that texture, you can eat it right away. Otherwise, spoon it into a freezer-safe container with a lid and freeze it for another 2 to 4 hours.Make sure your container is airtight to prevent the ice cream from becoming freezer burned.

Freeze a freezer-safe container.,
Pour the base into the container and freeze it for a half hour.,
Remove the mixture from the freezer and beat it with a hand mixer.,
Repeat the process of freezing and beating for about two hours.,
Store the ice cream in a freezer container until you’re ready to serve it.",How to Make Ice Cream3," You’ll need a freezer-safe, shallow pan or bowl to make the ice cream. Before you begin making the base, place the container in the freezer to chill it for 3 to 6 hours.A stainless steel pan that’s approximately 13-inches by 9-inches (33-cm by 23-cm) works well for making the ice cream.

, When the pan or bowl is properly chilled, transfer your prepared ice cream base to it and cover it. Return the container to the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes so the ice cream begins to solidify.You’ll know that the ice cream is ready for the next step when the edges just begin to freeze.

, Once the ice cream has chilled for a while, take the container out of the freezer. Use an electric hand mixer to mix up the ice cream on medium speed. That will help break it up and create a smooth, creamy texture.If you don’t have an electric mixer, you can mix the ice cream by hand with a wooden spoon. It will just take a little more time and elbow grease.

, After you’ve broken up the ice cream into creamier texture, cover it again and return it to the freezer. Let it chill for another 20 to 30 minutes and then mix it again. Repeat this process another three to four times until the ice cream is firm but still creamy and smooth.If you’d like to add crumbled cookies, brownies, or candy to the ice cream, mix them in by hand just before the last time you return the ice cream to the freezer.

, If you aren’t going to eat your ice cream right away, transfer it to an airtight, freezer-safe container. Store it in the freezer until you serve it.It’s a good idea to let the ice cream sit out for 5 to 10 minutes before you serve it so it’s easier to scoop.

Pour the mixture into the pan and cover.,
Freeze the mixture for a couple of hours and add mix-ins.,
Continue to freeze the ice cream until it’s scoopable.",How to Make Ice Cream4," For the ice cream, you’ll need a stainless steel 9-inch by 5-inch by 3-inch (23-cm by 13-cm by 8 cm) loaf pan. Place it in the freezer, and allow it to chill for at least an hour., Add a 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of pure vanilla extract, and a pinch of fine salt to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully blended, and then set the mixture aside., Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of cold heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer. Use medium-high speed to whip the cream until stiff peaks form, which should take about 5 minutes.For the best results, chill the stand mixer bowl in your refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes.
You can use an electric hand mixer or whip the cream by hand if you prefer.

, After you’ve whipped the cream, spoon about half of it into the bowl with the condensed milk mixture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the whipped cream into the mixture until it is just incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the mixture or you’ll take some of the air out of the cream.

, Once you’ve lightened the condensed milk mixture with some of the whipped cream, spoon it into the bowl with the rest of the whipped cream. Fold the two together until they’re well blended., Use the rubber spatula to help transfer all of the ice cream mixture into the chilled pan. Cover it with a pieces of plastic wrap, making sure that it’s airtight., Place the pan in the freezer, and allow it to freeze until it reaches the consistency of soft-serve, which should take approximately 2 hours. If you’d like to add any cookies, nuts, candy, or other mix-ins, stir them in until they’re incorporated., Cover the pan once more, and return it to the freezer. Let the ice cream freeze for another 3 hours, or until it is solid and able to be scooped."

Serve the ice cream balls.",How to Make Fried Ice Cream," Then place the sheets in the freezer for half an hour prior to making the ice cream balls.;
, Try to make each scoop about as large as your fist. Make as many scoops as will fit on the baking sheets.

, Place the sheets of ice cream balls into the freezer and leave them there for at least 30 minutes and up to two hours.

, Place a bowl of flour, a bowl of beaten egg and a bowl of crushed cereal or fine cookie/cracker crumbs in the workspace, in a formation that makes it easy to dip in order.

, Remove the balls from the freezer, then:


Roll each ice cream ball first in the flour bowl. A little flour over each ball provides increased strength.
Roll each ice cream ball in the beaten egg.
Lastly, roll each ball around in the crushed cereal. (For a tastier treat, you can add cinnamon and sugar to the crushed cereal. Just make sure you still have enough cereal bits on the ice cream to coat the surface of the scoop.)

Alternatively, you may dip the ice cream balls in cake batter to make a thin, donut-like coating. Then either fry the balls directly or sprinkle / roll them in crushed cookie or biscuit crumbs to give a crisp shell. This method can be done immediately before frying, or like the method above may be re-frozen as follows.

, Freeze for at least two hours before frying.


At this point, you can actually keep the ice cream balls frozen for up to two months if needed.

, Heat up the oil until it shimmers - approx 185C or 364F. Fry the ice cream balls in batches two at a time to avoid reducing the temperature of the oil. A low temperature won't fry them crisply. Fry until each ball turns a light/golden brown all over. Remove as soon as it's done.

, Serve immediately after frying, with chocolate or caramel sauce or other favorite sauce.


If you'd like the dessert to be colder, place it back into the freezer for a few more minutes after it's fried, then pull out and serve a little colder. This is a personal preference and isn't essential.

, Poke each one straight through the tight layer of plastic wrap into an individual ice cube hole. Make sure they are standing up somewhat straight and try to center them.

, Let the juice freeze for 24 hours.


Avoid taking the ice tray out of the freezer to check too often, because this can slow down the freezing process.

, Remove the plastic covering by pulling it up over the sticks.

, If it's really informal, just let everyone grab a stick straight out of the ice cube tray. If it's more formal, such as for a party, take the Popsicles out and arrange them individually on a serving platter. Don't delay the serving as these will melt. Enjoy – these are perfect for a hot summer's day.

Select good tomatillos.,
Remove the husk.,
Rinse.",How to Roast Tomatillos1," Look for small tomatillos that feel firm and are free from defects.Small tomatillos will be sweeter than larger ones. Generally, a good tomatillo should be smaller than a golf ball.
Also pay attention to the husk surrounding the fruit. It should be light brown and fresh. Avoid tomatillos with shriveled, dried husks.

, When you're ready to use the tomatillos, simply peel the husk away using your fingers.

The husks are inedible, so removal is necessary.
You should leave the actual green skin of the fruit intact.

, Clean each tomatillo under cool running water before roasting it.

Most tomatillos will be slightly sticky before you clean them.
Dry well with clean paper towels when done.

"
"
Place the tomatillos in a heavy pan.,
Toast gently over low heat.,
Cool the tomatillos before using them.",How to Roast Tomatillos2," Arrange the tomatillos in a single layer in a large, heavy frying pan.

Do not stack the tomatillos in multiple layers.
A cast iron frying pan will give you the best results, but if you do not have a cast iron pan, any heavy pan should work well enough.
This method draws out the ""earthy"" flavor undertones of the fruit.;
, Place the frying pan on your stove and switch the heat to low. Roast the tomatillos for 20 to 30 minutes, turning them occasionally using tongs.

Continue cooking until the tomatillos become very soft on all sides. You should also notice some light browning on all sides, but the skins will not usually blacken when you use this method.

, Remove the tomatillos from the heat and let them rest at room temperature for a few minutes, or until they are cool enough to touch with your fingers. They should be ready to use or eat as you desire at the completion of this step.

You can peel the skin off tomatillos after cooking them, but doing so is only optional.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil or by spraying it with cooking spray.,
Cut the tomatillos in half.,
Bake for 20 minutes.,
Cool slightly.",How to Roast Tomatillos3,", Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut each fruit in half horizontally. Arrange the halves on your prepared baking sheet.

Do not slice the tomatillos in half from top to bottom.
Keep the them in an even, single layer on your baking sheet. Do not overlap the halves or stack them in multiple layers, since doing so will prevent them from cooking evenly.
The halves should be cut-side down on your baking sheet.

, Place the baking sheet on the top rack of your oven and cook until the tomatillos become very tender.

The skins should begin to shrivel and may take on some light browning, but this method will not cause the skins to char or blacken.

, Remove the tomatillos from the oven and cool at room temperature until you can safely handle them with your hands. Eat or use as desired.

You can peel the tomatillos, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.

"
"
Preheat the broiler.,
Slice the tomatillos in half.,
Coat with cooking spray.,
Broil the tomatillos for 8 minutes.,
Broil for another 5 minutes.,
Cool before use.",How to Roast Tomatillos4," Switch on your broiler and let it heat up for 5 to 10 minutes.

Most broilers only have two settings: ""on"" and ""off."" If you broiler has ""high"" and ""low"" settings, though, switch it to the ""low"" option.
Prepare a broiler-safe baking sheet or baking dish by spraying it lightly with a thin coat of cooking spray.

, Use a kitchen knife to cut each tomatillo in half from side to side. Arrange the halves on your prepared cooking sheet.

A horizontal cut is preferable to a vertical cut.
The halves should be cut-side up on your cooking sheet and kept to a single layer. Do not stack them or overlap them in multiple layers.

, Thoroughly spray the exposed sides of the tomatillos with an oil-based cooking spray. Flip the halves over so that the cut sides are now face-down, and spray the skin sides, as well.

The pieces do not need to be dripping wet with cooking oil, but the surfaces should all be covered.
In the absence of cooking spray, you could drizzle a little vegetable oil over the surfaces or brush the oil on with a pastry brush.

, Place the tray of tomatillos in your preheated broiler and cook them for about 8 minutes, or until the skins begin to brown and shrivel.

At this point, you should remove the tray from the broiler and flip the halves over to the other side.

, Place the tomatillos back into your broiler and continue roasting them for another 5 minutes, or until the skin side is charred and blistering.

The flesh of the tomatillos will be very soft at this point.

, Remove the roasted fruit from your broiler and let the halves rest at room temperature until they are safe to handle with your bare hands. Use as desired.

You can peel the skins off after cooking the tomatillos, if you so desire, but charred skins can enrich the flavor of sauces, salsas, and other recipes with a smoky taste.

"
"
Cut the tomatillos in half.,
Preheat the grill.A charcoal grill is usually preferred, but you can use a gas grill, as well.,
Spray the cooking grate.,
Grill the tomatillos.,
Flip and continue grilling.,
Cool to room temperature.",How to Roast Tomatillos5," Slice the tomatillos with a kitchen knife. Cut them into horizontal halves--side to side—rather than cutting them vertically—from top to bottom.,

If using a gas grill, preheat all the burners to a medium-high temperature. Allow the grill at least 10 to 15 minutes to reach an ideal heat.
If using a charcoal grill, light a full chimney of charcoal on fire. Once the coals are covered with gray ash, pour them out into your grill and spread them across the bottom.

, Remove the grate from the grill and coat it in cooking spray. Place the grate back inside the grill when done.

If you do not have cooking spray, you could also coat the grate with vegetable oil.
Make sure that the grate is also clean before you oil it.

, Place each tomatillo half on your oiled grill grate cut-side down. Grill them until they begin to soften.

By this point, the cut sides and skins should both be brown.

, Use tongs to turn the halves so that they are cut-side up. Continue grilling for another few minutes or until they have completely softened.

The skins will usually be charred and blackened by this point.

, Remove the tomatillos and place them in a bowl or on a cutting board sitting out at room temperature. Let them cool until they are safe to handle with your hands.

The skin can affect the texture of your final dish, so if desired, you can peel the skin off your tomatillos after cooking them. Since charred skins contribute a smoky flavor to finished sauces and dishes, though, many cooks prefer to leave them intact.

"
"
Hold each tomatillo with tongs.Grab a whole tomatillo with long-handled tongs.,
Apply heat from a culinary torch.,
Cool before use.",How to Roast Tomatillos6," Make sure that you have a firm grasp on the fruit.

To prevent yourself from getting burned, you may also want to slip on a flame-resistant oven mitt.
Alternatively, you could place the tomatillo on a heatproof surface.

, Switch on the culinary torch and apply the flame directly to the surface of the tomatillo. Torch the skin for several minutes until it blackens and cracks.

Make sure that you turn the tomatillo as you torch it so that the flame can touch it from all sides. If you do not rotate the fruit, it may cook unevenly.
Note that the tomatillo will also become very soft as you roast it.

, Turn off the flame and place the tomatillo in a dish. Let it rest at room temperature until it is cool enough to handle with your bare hands, then use or eat as desired.

You can easily peel off the charred skins if you do not like the flavor and texture, but the skins are perfectly edible and can be left on if you choose to do so. Moreover, the skins take on a smoky flavor when charred, so they may even enhance the overall taste of a sauce or salsa.

Substitute for sugar with monk fruit when baking.,
Substitute sugar in sauces and dressings.,
Sweeten breakfast foods with monk fruit.,
Sprinkle monk fruit on sour fruits.",How to Sweeten with Monk Fruit1," Monk fruit in sugar form can make a great substitute for sugar in baked goods. It does not have any calories and can help cut back on added sugar in your diet. However, monk fruit is much sweeter than sugar. When using monk fruit for baking, use half as much monk fruit as you would sugar.For example, if a recipe calls for half a cup of sugar (120 mL), use a quarter cup (60 mL) of monk fruit.;
, When making sauces and dressings that call for sugar, add monk fruit instead. Use monk fruit in sugar or extract form. It will sweeten sauces and dressings without adding extra sugar and calories.Add less monk fruit than you would sugar, as it's much sweeter than sugar. It may take some experimentation to figure out the right amount of monk fruit to use.

, You can add monk fruit in sugar or extract form to cereals and oatmeal. This will sweeten them up without having to add any extra sugar. If you usually add things like honey or sugar to your plain cereal and oatmeal, use monk fruit instead.

, If you prefer adding sugar to more sour-tasting fruits, like grapefruit, use monk fruit instead. Sprinkle a small amount of monk fruit sugar over a grapefruit before eating it. This will prevent you from needing to add extra sugar, which adds calories to your dish.

Talk to your doctor about monk fruit and weight loss.,
Switch to natural flavors if monk fruit causes cravings.,
Avoid monk fruit sweetener with additives.,
Talk to your doctor if you have diabetes.",How to Sweeten with Monk Fruit3," Monk fruit is new to the market. Its effect on weight has not been widely studied. While some low calorie sweeteners do modestly reduce weight, you should talk to your doctor about weight loss before substituting sugar for monk fruit., Artificial sweeteners can sometimes increase your craving for sweet foods.

Purchase extra lean ground beef.,
Use ground turkey in place of hamburger.,
Opt for white meat instead of dark meat poultry.,
Remove the skins from any chicken or turkey used.,
Replace pork with turkey products.,
Get the tuna that is packaged in water instead of the tuna that is packaged in oil.",How to Turn a Regular Recipe Into a Low Fat Recipe1," You will not find your meat floating in grease as you cook it, and you will still gain the benefits offered from red meat.;
, The taste of ground turkey is slightly different than that of beef, but the health benefits of the exchange are worth any difference in taste. When used in casseroles or dishes where the meat is mixed in with other ingredients, any flavor difference is hardly distinguishable.

, The white meat contains less fat than the dark. Also, turkey has less fat than chicken, but both are great low-fat meat options.

, You can remove it before or after cooking. Though skin helps retain moisture in the meat while cooking and adds moisture because of its fat content, the skin itself contains no nutritional value, only fat, and can be discarded.

, Use turkey ham instead of pork ham--you will be surprised at how close to ""real"" ham the turkey ham is. Consider switching to turkey bacon instead of ""real"" bacon too.

, The difference in flavor between the two is of no consequence, but the difference in the amount of fat is great.

Switch to skim milk instead of 2% or whole.

,
Substitute applesauce for butter or oils in baked goods recipes.,
Use egg substitute in place of real eggs.,
Coat pans with spay oil instead of pouring tablespoons of vegetable oil into the pan to cook with.,
Replace the cream in cream soup recipes with low-fat plain yogurt and regular milk.,
Exchange regular items for low-fat items in recipes.",How to Turn a Regular Recipe Into a Low Fat Recipe2,", The switch-off is in equivalent amounts. Most baked good recipes need a little bit of fat. Consider substituting half the fat at first and experimenting from there with the percentage of fat you switch out.

, The replacement of 1/4 cup of egg substitute per each egg called for in the recipe lowers the fat in the recipe but does little to effect the texture or flavor of your baked goods.

, Use water or stock to cook food with to keep things from sticking to the bottom instead of the butter or oil a recipe calls for.

, Replacing with yogurt works well also in cakes and most baked goods.

, When mixed in with other ingredients, some items respond the same in the recipe without carrying all the fat with them. In recipes, use low-fat cheeses, yogurts, mayonnaise, salad dressings, sour cream, cream cheese and cream soups.

Dip the pretzels into the yogurt mixture of your choice and set on the rack.,
Turn the oven off and place the baking sheet in the oven to dry the pretzels.",How to Make Yogurt Covered Pretzels," To ensure that the oven is warm enough to dry the pretzels, set the temperature to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully. Next, place a wire cooling rack over a baking sheet to catch any yogurt that drips off after the pretzels are coated.It’s a good idea to line the baking sheet with foil, wax paper, or parchment paper before placing the wire rack over it. That will make it easier to clean up the sheet when you’re finished making the pretzels.;
, Add 2 cups (500 g) of low fat yogurt in the flavor of your choice to a large bowl. Mix 5 cups (625 g) of powdered sugar into the yogurt one cup (125 g) at a time with an electric mixer until it is completely incorporated.You can use any flavor of yogurt that you like for the pretzels. Strawberry, blueberry, and vanilla are classic options.
If you don’t have an electric mixer, you can mix the yogurt and powdered sugar by hand with a whisk.

, After the yogurt and powdered sugar are completely mixed, use a pair of tongs to dip 3 dozen miniature pretzels into the mixture one at a time. Make sure that they are coated on both sides, and set them on the wire cooling rack on the baking sheet. Repeat the process with all of the pretzels.If you don’t have tongs, you can use chopsticks or even a pair of tweezers to dip the pretzels.

, When you’ve coated all of the pretzels with the yogurt mixture, shut off your oven. Place the baking sheet and wire rack with the pretzels in the oven with the door slightly ajar.You don’t necessarily have to dry the pretzels in the warm oven. However, it helps the yogurt coating set without the pretzels getting soggy.

, Leave the pretzels in the oven for 3 to 4 hours so the yogurt coating has time to fully set. Remove them from the oven, and store them in an airtight container.The yogurt covered pretzels should keep for up to 3 days.

, To arrange the setup for drying the pretzels, line a baking sheet with foil, wax paper, or parchment paper. Next, place a wire cooling rack on top of it so the baking sheet will catch any yogurt that drips off.Lining the baking sheet makes it easier to clean after all of the pretzels have set. None of the yogurt will actually make it to the baking sheet, and you can just throw the liner away.

, Add 2 cups (250 g) of powdered sugar , ⅓ cup (85 g) plain low fat yogurt, and 1 teaspoon (7 g) of seedless blackberry preserves to a medium size bowl. Mix the ingredients with a whisk until they are fully combined.It’s best to use plain, unsweetened yogurt so the coating isn’t overly sweet.
You can substitute your favorite flavor of preserves for the blackberry. Use a seedless variety, though, and strain out any large pieces of fruit or skin before mixing it into the coating.

, When you’ve finished mixing up the yogurt coating, dip 36 thin pretzel twists in one at a time. Use a spoon or wooden skewer to turn them over in the coating so both sides are coated and then lift them out onto the wire cooling rack. Repeat the process with all of the pretzels.If you have a pair of tongs, you can use them to dip the pretzels into the yogurt coating.

, If you are making the pretzels for a gift or special occasion, you may want to garnish them. While the coating is still soft, add a light layer of colored sprinkles to the pretzels.Adding the sprinkles is optional. You can leave the pretzels plain if desired.
You can substitute colored sugar for the sprinkles if you prefer.

, After you’ve added the sprinkles, leave the pretzels to dry on the rack for 3 to 4 hours. For the best results, serve the pretzels immediately.Store any leftover pretzels in an airtight container, but try to eat them within a day of making them.

, Set your oven’s temperature to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius), and let it heat fully so it’s warm enough to dry the pretzels. Next, place a wire cooling rack on a large baking sheet for the pretzels to dry on.Line the baking sheet with foil, parchment paper, or wax paper before placing the cooling rack on it. You’ll have less mess to clean up that way.

, Place 1 cup (175 g) of white melting chocolates or chips into a medium microwave-safe bowl. Heat the white chocolate on high in 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval. Continue until the white chocolate is completely melted.You can melt the white chocolate in a double boiler if you prefer.

, Place ½ cup (125 g) of blueberry yogurt in one medium bowl and ½ cup (125 g) of vanilla yogurt in a separate bowl. Next, add a 2 ½ cups (312 g) of powdered sugar to each bowl, and mix until it’s fully incorporated into each yogurt flavor.You can use any flavors of yogurt that you like for the pretzels. If you prefer, you can also use 1 full cup (250 g) of a single flavor of yogurt and mix all of the powdered sugar into it.

, When the powdered sugar is fully mixed into each flavor of yogurt, add half of the melted white chocolate to the blueberry yogurt mixture and the other half to the vanilla yogurt mixture. Stir well until the white chocolate is fully incorporated into each mixture., When each flavor of the yogurt mixture is fully blended, coat 1 16 ounce (454 g) bag of miniature pretzels in the two flavors. Use a pair of tongs to dip the pretzels and lif them to set them on the cooling rack to dry.You can coat half of the pretzels in the blueberry flavored yogurt mixture and the other half in the vanilla, or break the flavors up to have more of your favorite.

, Once all of the pretzels are coated, shut off your oven. Set the baking sheet with the pretzels inside, and leave the door slightly open. Allow the pretzels to set for 3 to 4 hours before serving them.Store your leftover pretzels in an airtight container. They should stay fresh for 2 to 3 days.

Add half a cup of tomato sauce or chicken stock.,
Heat the chili for 10-12 minutes.,
Eat reheated chili by itself.",How to Use Leftover Chili1," Whatever cookware you use should be spacious enough to reheat however much chili you plan on cooking with. Spray slow cookers and nonstick pots and saucepans with cooking spray to keep the reheated chili from sticking when it gets hot.


For smaller servings, you can also microwave a single bowl at a time.
Only use as much chili as you need to make a given dish—refrigerating and reheating chili multiple times will cause it to lose its freshness faster.;
, Chili thickens as it loses moisture in the refrigerator, so a splash of liquid will help return it to its original consistency. Be careful not to add too much liquid, or you could inadvertently make it soupy. Stir the liquid into the chili thoroughly before you begin heating it.Using tomato sauce or savory chicken stock as opposed to water will keep from diluting the rich flavor of the chili.
If you prefer your chili extra thick, skip this step and reheat as usual.

, Turn on the cooktop to medium-high heat. Keep an eye on the chili as it warms up, stirring once every few minutes. When it begins the bubble continually around the edges, it’s ready to serve.Stir the chili from the bottom of the pot to better distribute heat.
The chili will be ready to eat when it’s warm, but you can also leave it to simmer for about half an hour more to revitalize the individual flavors., Once your chili has been warmed through, ladle up a big bowl and savor it for a second time. This is the simplest way to get more enjoyment out of a batch. Chili keeps well in the refrigerator, so you can keep using it until the last of it is gone.

Smoke the fish.,
Smoke again.,
Test the fish for doneness by inserting a fork into its side.,
Enjoy the fish.",How to Smoke Haddock," There are two different approaches to this, depending on whether you want to do a dry cure or a wet cure:


Dry Curing: Mix 700ml (about 3 cups) of salt and 250 (about 1 cup) of sugar. Add other flavourings, such as garlic, chives, pepper, et cetera, if desired. Rub the mixture over the entire fish thoroughly.

Wrap the fish tightly in plastic wrap, put the fish on a plate, and refrigerate for 18 - 24 hours. Drain off any liquid that pools over this time.



Wet curing: Mix 700ml (about 3 cups) of salt and 250 (about 1 cup) of sugar with 4.5 litres of water (about a gallon) in a large pot. Add other flavourings, such as garlic, chives, pepper, et cetera, if desired.

Keep the fish in the plastic wrapping and place the fish into the pot, cover, and refrigerate for 6 - 24 hours. A longer brining time will create a stronger flavour and a longer-lasting fish.

;
, Remove the fish and all wrapping and run the fish under cool water until completely clean., Place the fish in a cool, breezy place to dry. If your smoker is available, drying the fish in the racks will save you time later. After 2 - 3 hours, a shiny film, called a pellicle, forms over the fish. This will keep the juices in, so try to not to damage it., Place the fish in a smoker at 30 degrees centigrade (about 90 degrees   Fahrenheit) for 2 hours., Now smoke the fish at an increased temperature of 65 degrees centigrade (about 150 degrees Fahrenheit) for 6 hours per 2.5 centimeters (about 1 inch) of thickness., If it flakes easily, you`re done!, At room temperature (about 16 degrees centigrade or 60 degrees Fahrenheit), smoked haddock will remain safe-to-eat for 4 - 6 days.

, When the pancakes are finished cooking on the first side, use a large, wide spatula to carefully turn them over. Let them cook on the other side for another 1 to 2 minutes, or until the bottoms are set and the pancakes are completely cooked through.Repeat the process of adding the batter and cooking the pancakes until you’ve used up all of the batter.
If you want keep the pancakes warm as you finish preparing breakfast, place the cooked pancakes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Set the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius), and leave the pancakes inside for up to 30 minutes.

, To make the cream cheese topping for the pancakes, add 4 ounces (115 g) of softened cream cheese and ½ cup (75 g) of powdered sugar to a small bowl. Blend the two together until they are well mixed., After you’ve mixed the cream cheese and powdered sugar, gradually mix in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk. Stir well so the mixture is completely smooth.For the creamiest topping, use whole milk.

, Once the cream cheese mixture is well blended and smooth, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract. Mix the topping well to ensure that the vanilla is fully incorporated.If you prefer, you can omit the vanilla.

, Once you’ve finished mixing the cream cheese topping, transfer it to a piping bag with a round tip. Set a serving of pancakes on a plate and drizzle the topping over the pancakes before serving.If you don’t have a piping bag, put the cream cheese topping in a sealable plastic bag. Squeeze out all of the air, seal it, and cut off one of the corners, so you can use the bag to drizzle the topping over the pancakes.
If you’d like extra garnish for your pancakes, consider sprinkling them with chopped nuts, such as pecans or walnuts, and powdered sugar.

, Keep beating the egg whites and add the sugar mixture teaspoon by teaspoon. Continue until you run out of sugar and the whites have formed stiff, glossy peaks.

, Pour the vinegar and vanilla over the peaks and keep beating until everything is mixed together. The vinegar will help the meringue stay crispy around the edges and soft in the middle as it bakes.

, Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly. It should be approximately dinner plate roundness in size.

, Pavlovas should be round with a little hollow that takes the cream and topping, so it helps to imagine that you're making a nest shape with slightly raised edges.


If your shape is on the oblong side of circular, don't worry too much about how accurate the circular shape is - creative misshapes are permissible as long as the topping stays put.

, Place it in the oven and cook for 60-70 minutes, or until crisp. Don't let the meringue over-brown; it should be an off-white color on the outside when it's ready.

, Place it on a wire rack to cool. Transfer it to a serving dish and prepare to add the toppings. Allow the meringue to cool completely before finishing the dish.


There's a tradition to turn the pavlova over and decorate the base because it is said that this side is less crisp. Sometimes this reason is actually a nifty cover-up trick for little cooking mistakes like over-browning the top. Either way, the pavlova centre will quickly lose its initial crispness anyway because of the whipped cream and topping.

, Whip the cream and sugar until the cream forms soft peaks. Slice the strawberries and kiwis or other fruit toppings. If there's time left, research the origins of the pavlova and make up your own mind about who invented it.

, Spread it evenly to the edges of the meringue. Use the cream to fill in cracks and cover other imperfections.


You can also flavor the cream if you'd like - try a teaspoon of vanilla extract, rosewater, orange water, lemon extract, or almond extract.
Although whipped cream is traditional, you might like to vary the whipped cream with other soft creamy like substances such as custard. This would be frowned upon by traditionalists but experimental cooks have creative license.

, Another popular tradition is to drizzle freshly opened passionfruit over the top of the pavlova.


Other topping ideas include a mixture of berries, sliced cherries, apricots, mangoes or peaches, grated dark chocolate, or a mixture of chocolate and raspberries.

, The beauty of a pavlova is in the eye of the creator; everyone else just wants to eat it. Don't be surprised at how quickly your creation disappears.

Serve when ready.",How to Make Natillas1," Pour 1/2 cup (125 ml) of milk into a medium mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and cornstarch to the same bowl and whisk well.Continue whisking until the mixture seems smooth and the contents are evenly distributed.;
, Pour the remaining milk in a medium saucepan. Add the lemon zest, sugar, cinnamon stick, and salt to the same saucepan, then set the pan on your stove over medium-low heat.


Mix the contents of the saucepan slowly and continuously as they heat up and do not use a higher heat setting. Milk burns and sticks to pans easily, so continuous motion and low heat are both necessities.
Continue heating and stirring until the mixture becomes hot but do not allow it to reach a boil yet. This step should take several minutes.

, Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the hot milk mixture, mixing the two together constantly to combine them.

, Continue stirring and heating the mixture over medium-low heat until it boils. After it begins to boil, continue whisking it for 2 minutes or longer.


Test the taste of the natillas after the first 2 minutes. If you can detect the taste of cornstarch, you'll need to continue heating the mixture for another minute or so. If the cornstarch taste is gone, you can proceed to the next step.

, Remove the saucepan from the stove. Take out the lemon zest and cinnamon stick, then add the vanilla extract, stirring it in until evenly distributed.

, In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites using an electric mixer set to low speed, continuing until stiff peaks form.


When the egg whites are ready, stiff peaks should form when you lift the mixer out. These peaks should stand sharply without drooping.
Note that the addition of egg whites is mostly found in Mexican versions of natillas. Many traditional Spanish versions do not use egg whites, and the result is a much denser custard. As such, you may omit the egg whites altogether if desired.

, Top the custard in your saucepan with the stiff egg whites. Carefully fold the egg white into the custard with a spatula until no visible streaks of white remain.Fold carefully, applying as little pressure as possible to the egg whites during the process. Working too quickly or with too much force can cause the egg whites to lose most of the air you just beat into them.

, Carefully press a sheet of plastic wrap over the surface of the natillas, then place the saucepan in your refrigerator until the custard is cool and semi-set.


If you want to serve the natillas in individual custard cups, you should pour the mixture into the cups while it is still warm.

, After the natillas have cooled and set, scoop the custard into individual serving dishes and sprinkle each one with ground cinnamon or ground nutmeg.


Alternatively, you could top each helping of natillas with a shortbread cookie.
You should be able to store natillas in sealed containers for 3 days inside your refrigerator."

You won't actually bake the natilla, but you will need to pour it into the baking dish while it sets.
Another option would be to prepare individual custard cups or ramekins.If you wish to remove the natilla from these dishes, grease them with a little cooking spray. If you would prefer to serve the natilla straight from these dishes, you do not need to grease them in advance.

, Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of cold milk into a small mixing bowl and add the cornstarch. Whisk the two ingredients together well until the mixture is smooth, then set it aside., Place the three ingredients in a medium saucepan and set it on your stove over medium-low heat.


Stir the mixture for 2 to 5 minutes. The milk should become warm but should not be allowed to reach a boil yet.
Panela is unrefined whole cane sugar. You can usually find it in Mexican markets or in the Mexican aisle of a large grocery store, but if you are unable to get your hands on it, dark brown sugar can be substituted. Replace the panela with dark brown sugar in even proportions.

, Mix the ground cloves into the panela mixture. Drop the cinnamon sticks in, as well. Increase the heat to medium and continue cooking the mixture until it boils and dissolves all of the sugar.


You may need to boil the mixture for 5 to 10 minutes before the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar dissolves, the mixture will seem less grainy.
Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks as soon as this step is complete. If you would prefer a stronger cinnamon flavor, however, you can keep the cinnamon sticks in for a longer period of time but should remove them before stirring in the butter.

, Carefully pour the cornstarch mixture into the panela mixture, stirring continuously to combine the two evenly.

, Reduce the heat to low and whisk continuously for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the mixture feels notably thickened.You must whisk the mixture constantly at this point to prevent lumps from forming.
Scrape the bottom and sides of the pan with your whisk as you stir the mixture. Doing so can reduce the risk of burning the mixture or causing lumps to form.
If you did not remove the cinnamon sticks earlier, do so after finishing this step.

, Add the butter to the mixture. Drop in the raisins and coconut at this time, too, if you plan to include them. Stir well and remove the pan from the heat.

, Pour the mixture into your prepared baking dish and cover it with plastic wrap. Place it in your refrigerator and chill for a minimum of 4 hours.


The natilla must be cold and firm before you continue past this step.

, Once the natilla has solidified, invert the baking dish over a serving platter and allow the natilla to drop out. Sprinkle the entire block with ground cinnamon, if desired, and cut the block into 12 even pieces using a smooth kitchen knife.


If the natilla does not release from the baking dish on its own, run a thin butter knife around the edges of the pan to help separate the dessert from the sides.
Square blocks of natilla are the easiest to prepare, but you could also use cookie cutters to cut the finished natilla into different shapes.
Prepared natilla can remain good for two days. Store it in a covered container kept in your refrigerator for the duration of that time.

",How to Make Green Tea Ice Cream," In a bowl, mix 2 tablespoons (approximately 30 g) of matcha green tea powder with 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar. Use a spoon to ensure that they’re blended well.You can usually find matcha green tea powder at Asian food markets, as well as in the ethnic or international food aisle of some larger grocery stores.;
, In a separate bowl, combine the yolks from 3 eggs with the remaining ½ cup (approximately 105 g) sugar. Use a whisk to beat them together so the sugar is fully incorporated into the egg yolks.To separate the egg yolk from the white, crack the egg against a hard surface, such as the edge of a bowl or the counter. Hold the egg over a bowl and gently separate the two halves. Some of egg white should drip down into the bowl. To remove the rest of the white, move the contents back and forth in the two halves of the shell so more of the white drips out. When you've separated the yolk from the whites, dump the yolk in a separate bowl, and repeat with two more eggs.

, Take the bowl with the matcha and sugar mixture, and pour it into the egg yolk and sugar mixture. Stir the ingredients together well until a thick paste forms.It’s usually easier to stir the ingredients together if you use a whisk or fork because the mixture can become very thick and difficult to blend.

, Add ¾ cup (180 mL) milk to a small sauce pan, and set it on a stove burner set to medium low heat. Allow the milk to gently heat without coming to a boil, and remove it from the stove.You should ideally heat the milk to a temperature of 176 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).
Watch your milk closely because it’s extremely easy for it to scorch. If it seems to be getting too warm too quickly, lower the heat on the stove.

, When the milk is heated, mix a small amount of it, such as 2 tablespoons (approximately 30 mL), into the matcha green tea paste mixture. Stir until the paste becomes smooth.Use as little milk as necessary to create the smooth paste. That means it’s best to start with less that you’ll think you need, and only add more when you see that the mixture is still thick and lumpy.

, Once you’ve formed a smooth paste, pour the rest of the milk into the matcha green tea mixture. Add it gradually, though, to ensure that you don’t heat the mixture too quickly. Put it back on the stove at medium-low to heat it, but remove it before it comes to a boil. Allow the mixture to cool completely. It should take approximately 5 minutes to heat the mixture properly, and 10 to 15 minutes for the mixture to cool fully.
After you remove the mixture from the stove, strain it into a clean container with a fine sieve to remove any impurities.

, In a bowl, use a whisk to lightly whip ¾ cup (180 mL) of heavy cream. When the matcha mixture is completely cooled, carefully fold the whipped cream into it with a spatula.It’s best to whip the heavy cream by hand because using a stand mixer or an electric mixer may cause it to develop stiff peaks, which you don’t want for the ice cream.

, Check that your ice maker's freezer bowl is completely frozen, having spent at least 10 hours in the freezer. Next, pour the green tea ice cream mixture into an airtight container and place it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to chill.While you can chill your ice cream mixture for as little as 2 hours, you’ll get better results the colder that it is. You may want to leave it in the refrigerator overnight.

, When the green tea ice cream mixture is thoroughly chilled, add to the ice maker’s freezer bowl, and place it in the ice cream maker with the dasher or mixing arm attached. Turn on the machine, and churn the ice cream according to the manufacturer’s instructions., If you like soft serve ice cream, you can serve your green tea ice cream immediately after it’s done churning. However, if you like a harder texture for your ice cream, transfer it to an airtight container and put it in the freezer for 2 to 4 hours to help it firm up.To keep your ice cream from developing freezer burn, wrap your airtight container in plastic wrap to provide additional protection.
Store any ice cream that you want to save for later in the freezer in the airtight container.

, Pour your green tea ice mixture into a large container, and place it in the refrigerator. Allow it to sit for approximately 2 to 3 hours to ensure that it’s thoroughly chilled., Once the ice cream mixture is chilled, move the container to the freezer. As it freezes, ice crystals may start to develop. To prevent them from altering the ice cream’s texture, remove it after approximately half an hour. Stir the ice cream thoroughly to ensure that it remains smooth.You a wooden spoon to mix the ice cream, and stir forcefully so the texture is as smooth as possible.

, As the ice cream continues to freeze, you’ll need to repeat the mixing process several times. Check on it every 30 minutes to stir it so it remains smooth. It should take approximately 4 hours for the ice cream to fully freeze.You’ll know that the ice cream is done when it’s too firm to mix any longer.

Add flavoring (optional).,
Beat the mixture into heavy cream.,
Freeze until set.",How to Make Coffee Ice Cream1," Add a spoonful of water at a time, stirring until all the powder is dissolved. Three tbsp (45 mL) of powder makes a strong-flavored ice cream, but you can use less or more according to your preference.


You can use a shot of espresso instead. Instant coffee powder isn't a recommended substitute, as it tends to taste sour or metallic.;
, Stir until combined. The condensed milk will let the ice cream freeze on its own, without frequent churning.


If you own an ice cream maker, you can replace the condensed milk with 1 cup (240 mL) milk and ½ cup (50g) sugar., For a richer flavor, try adding 1 tbsp (15 mL) espresso liqueur. For a classic ice cream taste and general deliciousness, use 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract instead.

, Pour the heavy cream and the condensed milk mixture into a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer or a whisk at medium speed, until it forms soft peaks.Chilling the bowl and whisk in the fridge will speed up the process., Transfer the mixture to an airtight, freezer-safe container. Freeze until set, about 6 hours or overnight.Large, metal containers freeze the ice cream faster than small or plastic ones.If you have an ice cream maker, chill in the fridge, then pour in the mixture and follow your model's instructions. This will typically set the ice cream in about 20–30 minutes.

If using brewed coffee instead of whole beans, do not include it at this stage.

, Leave the saucepan covered at room temperature to give the coffee beans time to lend flavor to the milk.


Skip this step if using brewed coffee instead.

, Whisk for about 5 minutes, or until it turns pale yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons., Return the saucepan to the stove and reheat until once again hot and steaming. Pour very slowly into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.


Pouring too fast here will cook the egg, which is taking ice cream breakfast ingredients a step too far. If you notice any lumps, stop pouring and beat the mixture vigorously.If the beans are getting in the way of stirring, pour through a mesh and return the beans to the mixture once you're done whisking.

, Pour the remaining cup (240 mL) heavy cream into a metal bowl. Place this bowl inside a larger container, filled with ice.

, Return the egg and milk mixture to the saucepan. Heat on medium low, stirring constantly with a flat-bottomed spatula. Cook until you can run your finger on the spatula without the custard running across the mark you made. If you're not used to making custard, consider the following safeguards:Use an infrared thermometer to make sure the temperature stays below 180ºF (82ºC).
To avoid burning the bottom or heating it too quickly, use a double boiler.

, Place a mesh strainer over your chilled cream, to catch the coffee beans. Pour the hot custard through this strainer. Press the beans to extract flavorful liquids, then discard them. Add vanilla extract to the ice cream and stir to combine.

, Chill the mixture in the refrigerator, then freeze in the ice cream maker according to your model's instructions. This typically takes less than half an hour.

",How to Make Coffee Ice Cream3," Whisk for about five minutes, until thick enough to fall in ribbons from the whisk. Set aside.

, Add the evaporated milk and the coffee beans to a saucepan. Heat while stirring constantly until steaming heavily or just barely simmering. Remove from heat as soon as you reach this point.


You can use whole beans, but you'll get a stronger flavor if you crush them. To do this, seal them in a plastic bag and crush with a heavy rolling pin or mallet.The most common way to make ice cream without an ice cream maker involves frequent hand churning to break up ice crystals. Switching to evaporated milk to reduce water content is one of several tricks you can use to make this process much easier., Pour the hot milk in a thin trickle into the egg, whisking constantly. This forms a custard base, the beginning of most all commercial and restaurant ice creams.

, Return the egg, milk, and coffee beans to the stove. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. This will thicken gradually over the course of about ten minutes. Once it coats the back of a spoon dipped into the custard, remove from heat.


If you see any lumps forming, turn off heat and beat vigorously. High temperatures or rapid heating can cook egg proteins into rubbery lumps.

, Cover the mixture and place it in the refrigerator for one hour. This gives the coffee beans time to infuse the custard with coffee flavor.


You may get a stronger coffee flavor if you infuse the milk for one hour instead of waiting until it's been added to the eggs.This method will take a little longer, since you still need to chill the custard.

, After straining, hold the strainer over the custard and press the coffee beans against the mesh. Once the last bit of flavor has drained through, discard the beans.

, Whip 1 cup (240 mL) of the heavy cream until it doubles in volume. Fold into the custard until there are no lumps.


This size increase comes from air whipped into the mixture. During freezing, the air will keep water molecules farther apart, reducing the size of ice crystals that usually plague freezer-made ice cream., There are two ways to finish the job, depending on what equipment you own:


Freeze in ice cube trays until solid (several hours). Transfer to food processor and pulse with remaining ½ cup (120 mL) cream. Freeze in an ice cream tub.Or place a metal bowl inside a larger bowl of ice and rock salt. Add 1 pint (500 mL) ice cream mix at a time to the small bowl. Beat with electric mixer for ten minutes, until very cold. Freeze for 45 minutes, until pudding-like. Beat the same way for 5 minutes, then freeze until done.,"

, Pour the cream and vanilla into the mixture slowly to combine completely.

, A homemade ice cream maker can be created using a few plastic bags and ice, as follows:


Pour the cooled ice cream mixture into a freezer-grade plastic bag with a seal. Go for a good quality, strong bag since you’ll be shaking this bag to create your ice cream.
Place the plastic bag containing the ice cream into a larger similar bag, filled halfway with ice and one cup of salt (or rock salt).
Seal the larger bag and wrap it in a towel. Shake the bags vigorously and then knead the ice cream mix inside the bag for approximately 10 minutes.
Allow the ice cream to sit on the ice for about five minutes after it’s well kneaded. The longer the ice cream sits on the ice, the harder its consistency.

, No matter which method you choose (homemade maker or professional), sprinkle bacon crumbles during the last minute of churning or kneading in order to fully integrate the ice cream, without dissolving the bacon.

, This ice cream is rich enough to be dessert or a treat on its own but if you like syrup, a dash of maple syrup over the top is delicious.

Finish your sundae.",How to Make an Ice Cream Sundae," While ice cream sundaes are delicious in any kind of container, choosing the proper bowl can certainly add to your experience. The traditional ice cream sundae vessel is the tulip sundae glass. However, you can also use boats, bowls, or cups. Use a bucket if you want – you can make your ice cream sundae as big as you want.;
, This might seem like an easy task, but your spoon selection can change the sundae-eating experience. If you’re eating out of a tall sundae glass, you should select a long, thin spoon. This will allow you to get the ice cream from the very bottom without getting your hands messy. If you’re eating out of a simple bowl, you can use any spoon you like. Some people prefer big spoons for big bites, but beware of brain freeze!

, In order to get the perfect balls of ice cream you see in picture perfect sundaes, you need to use a special ice cream scooper. To help them glide smoothly through the frozen ice cream, fill a glass with hot water. Place the scoop in it, and let it soak there until you’re ready to serve the ice cream., You can use hot fudge, chocolate syrup, a fruit sauce, caramel sauce, or any other sauce your heart desires. This step is optional, but it can be helpful to ensure that your sundae has a good ice cream to sauce ratio. Often times, the bottom of layer is barren of any sauce and toppings. By putting sauce in the dish before you place any ice cream in it, you’ll ensure that your final bites of sundae have their fair share of sauce., Using your warm ice cream scoop, place two to three generous scoops of your favorite ice cream on the bottom of the dish. Plain vanilla ice cream is the classic ice cream to use for a sundae, but don’t feel limited. You can use chocolate, strawberry, cookies and cream, cookie dough, or any other flavor your heart desires.

, It won't take long – just warm them up for a few seconds. The sauces will be much easier to drizzle onto your ice cream once they are a little bit heated.This is especially useful if you want to top your sundae with something like peanut butter, which is obviously much thicker than normal sauce. Make sure to only microwave sauces that are in microwave-safe containers, or transfer the sauce to a small bowl or cup before heating.

, You can use the same sauce you coated the bottom of the dish with, or mix it up! Melted hot fudge is a classic ice cream sundae sauce, but there are a lot of other fun options in the grocery stores. Try caramel sauce, strawberry sauce, butterscotch, or marshmallow fluff.Either use a spoon to scoop the sauce onto your sundae or use the sauces that come in a squeezable container.

, Texture is an important aspect of the sundae that can be overlooked. By adding something with a bit of a crunch, you’ll create a nice contrast to the smooth ice cream and sauce. There are lots of options for crunchy toppings.For a healthier option, add some chopped peanuts or almonds.
Major sweets lovers can add something like M&M’s, crushed Oreos, or any chopped up candy bar. Sugary cereals, like Fruit Loops, can also be used on sundaes.

, Some people love chewy sundae toppings, and some people hate it. If you add gummy bears or gummy worms to your sundae, they will harden a bit, making them more difficult to chew. You may or may not enjoy this. Easier to chew options include crumbled brownies, chunks of cookie dough, or mini Reeses., You can add a handful of strawberries or blueberries to make your ice cream sundae slightly healthier. Sliced banana is a classic addition! Shredded coconut can add some great flavor while adding a bit of texture as well. You can also add different fruit sauces and jams to your ice cream sundae to make it extra fruity. Even if you don’t want a lot of fruit on your sundae, consider topping it with a cherry – it’s tradition!, If you like, add a big dollop of whipped cream for the grand finale. Serve with your spoon of choice, and don't forget to grab a napkin – topping avalanches are real! Enjoy your delicious, customized sundae.

Puree the fruit.,
Strain the mixture.",How to Make Sorbet1," The fresher and tastier the fruit you choose is, the better your sorbet will taste in the end.Getting local fruit that is very fresh is often the most cost-effective way to get tasty, ripe fruit.


The amount of fruit you get will determine how much sorbet you have. In order to make a quart of sorbet, try to get about 2 pounds of fruit (which should yield about 4 cups of puree).;
, While you can make sorbet with any fruit, some fruits (such as citrus and pomegranate) are more challenging for beginners. Fruits that are high in pectin (such as berries) or high in fiber (such as strawberries, peaches, mangoes, or bananas) make getting a creamier sorbet texture easier., Wash your fruit, remove any tops, cores, seeds, or ends, and cut into smallish pieces. Cutting the fruit ahead of time will make the pureeing process go more smoothly.

, Use a food processor or blender to puree your fruit.Make sure that the mixture is free of lumps and remove any errant seeds that got through. You should have about 4 cups of pureed fruit. If you have less, you might want to puree a little more fruit to have the right balance of fruit and sugar.

, This step may be optional, depending upon the fruit you’re using and what kind of texture you’d like for your final product. If you want a delicate texture, strain the fruit.If you don’t mind a rougher texture, you can leave the pulp in.

Understand the importance of sugar in a sorbet.,
Use a 4:1 ratio.,
Decide whether to use simple syrup.,
Add alcohol if desired.,
Consider using corn syrup.,
Do the “egg float” test.,
Chill the mixture.",How to Make Sorbet2," The amount of sugar in your sorbet base will determine the texture of your final product. Too much sugar will keep the sorbet from freezing, while too little sugar will leave you with an icy final product. The right amount of sugar in a sorbet also depend on the sugar content of the fruit itself, which is difficult to quantify.The “pros” use a tool called a refractometer that allows for measuring how much sugar is present in a solution.However, you can also just experiment with different batches of sorbet to determine how much sugar works best for you!

, In general, the best ratio for making sorbet is 4 parts of fruit puree to 1 part sugar.In most recipes, this means 4 cups of pureed fruit to 1 cup of sugar. If you are using a very sweet fruit, you might want to use a bit less sugar. A tart fruit (such as lemon) may require a bit more sugar.


It is best to start with the standard 4:1 ratio and then experiment with adding more or less sugar to subsequent batches as you master the art of sorbet.

, Simple syrup, a mixture of sugar and water, is recommended in many sorbet recipes.Dissolving the sugar in water makes the texture more even and allows it to blend into the pureed fruit more easily. However, some sorbet purists point out that the use of as simple syrup waters down the flavor of sorbet (by adding water).If you do choose to use simple syrup, dissolve 1 cup of sugar into 1 cup boiling (or near-boiling) water. Then allow the solution to cool completely.You can either add the cooled simple syrup to the pureed fruit or add the pureed fruit to simple syrup while it is still hot (in the pan) and allow the mixture to cool together., Alcohol, like sugar, lowers the freezing point of a solution, which affects the texture of sorbet. If you add alcohol, be sure to add it sparingly (too much can keep the sorbet from freezing at all) and be sure that the flavor will complement the fruit in the sorbet. A few ideas are:


Strawberry with rum (daiquiri, anyone?)
Pear with a Riesling wineBlackberry with merlot wineOrange with chocolate liqueur

, Some fruits that are very thin or low in fiber, such as lemon, may freeze into a sorbet more effectively if combined with corn syrup instead of granulated sugar. , To determine whether your mixture has the right amount of sugar in it, try floating a (washed and dried) large egg in the pureed fruit and sugar mix. A nickel-sized portion of the egg should be visible.If the egg sinks or a very small amount of the egg is visible, add more sugar to your mixture.
If more than a nickel-sized portion of egg is visible, you have too much sugar and you should add more fruit puree, fruit juice, or water to lessen the sugar ratio.

, When you have the perfect ratio of fruit and sugar, cool your mixture in the fridge to get it ready to turn into sorbet.

Consult your machine’s manual.,
Freeze the bowl.,
Place the bowl into the machine and add the paddle or stirrer.,
Pour the sorbet mixture in the bowl.,
Turn the machine on.,
Re-freeze the mixture for a firmer texture.",How to Make Sorbet3," The best way to use an ice cream machine is to follow the instructions that came with the model of machine you purchased. If you do not have the instructions, you can likely find time on the manufacturer’s website. However, the description below should fit most ice cream makers.

, Many ice cream makers come with a bowl that should be frozen completely (usually for 24-hours) prior to making ice cream. Sometimes the bowl has liquid between the inner and outer walls of the bowl that freezes to help keep the product cold.Old-fashioned ice cream makers that do not have a frozen bowl may have a stainless steel (or other metal) bowl that sits inside a bucket of ice and rock salt. The salt helps melt the ice, which makes for a colder environment around the outside of the bowl.

, Most ice cream machines have a detachable paddle that stirs the mixture inside. Put the paddle in place per the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Remove the sorbet mixture from your refrigerator (where it has been cooling) and carefully pour it into the ice cream maker bowl.

, The ice cream maker should do most (if not all) of the work for you. Turn it on and it will spin for a set amount of time or until the mixture is frozen.Some models have a timer on them for a pre-determined length of mixing time, while others will automatically shut off once they meet a certain amount of resistance (caused by the frozen mixture).

, Depending on your machine, your sorbet may be very soft when it finishes mixing. If this is the case, you may want to place the sorbet in an air-tight container and put it in your freezer to harden.

"

Freeze the mixture.,
Remove the frozen mixture and blend it.,
Re-freeze the mixture.",How to Make Sorbet4," Once you have made your fruit puree and sugar mixture, place it in the freezer. You might want to remove it from the freezer to stir it occasionally as it freezes. Otherwise, you can just let it freeze hard., Remove the frozen sorbet mixture from the freezer and blend it. You can use a blender, a food processor, or a stand mixer. Whatever you use, you may need to let it thaw slightly before it will cooperate with the blending process., Once you have blended the frozen mixture, freeze it again.This should give you a product with a consistency that is more like sorbet from an ice cream machine.

You can scoop the ice cream out with an ice cream scoop or large spoon.

, If you want to get fancy, garnish your sorbet. You can place a whole piece of fruit on top, garnish with a sprig of mint or another herb, or drizzle with a colorful syrup or reduction.

, You can store your sorbet for up to a week. It is best if stored in the back of your freezer, behind other food items and away from the door to regulate the temperature more effectively.,"

, Fresh strawberries would be the best, but if you can't find any, you can use frozen ones instead. Be sure to let them thaw first, however., Use the back of a spoon to get as much pulp out as possible, and discard the seeds. At this point, you can also add the optional ingredients, such as vanilla extract and Grand Marnier (or other liquor).Straining the mixture will get rid of the strawberry seeds and give you a smoother texture. If you don't care about the seeds, then you can leave the puree in the blender, and simply add the syrup, lemon juice, and other ingredients to it.

, At this point, give the mixture a taste; it will give you an idea of what your sorbet will taste like when it is frozen. If the mixture is not sweet enough, add a little bit more sugar. If the mixture is too sweet, add a little bit more water or lemon juice. After making the adjustment, pulse the mixture one last time. , You can freeze it using an ice cream maker or a pan and freezer.

, Make sure that the pan is resting on a flat surface so that the mixture doesn't spill.

, This will make it easier to blend later on. Don't worry if it looks too smooth when you take it out; you will be freezing it again after you blend it.

, This will break up any ice crystals and make the sorbet light and fluffy.

, After this, the sorbet is ready to serve.If the sorbet is too firm, let it thaw a little first. It will last up to 1 week in the freezer.

If you absolutely cannot get one, don't worry; you will still be able to make hard mint candies., Add the sugar, light corn syrup, and water to the saucepan and turn the heat to low. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves.Make sure that you are using light corn syrup and not dark. It will show up nice and clear, which is important if you wish to color your candy.

, The temperature will rise slowly at first, but then it will jump very quickly to the necessary temperature.If you do not have a candy thermometer: Wait until the mixture has been boiling for a few minutes, then place a small drop of it into cold water.If it has reached the hard crack stage, it will form hard, brittle strands that snap when bent. Let the candy cool before trying to snap it., At this point, you can also stir in the food coloring. Blue or green make great colors for mint candy!, If you need to, use a rubber or silicone spatula to help spread the mixture across the baking sheet. You don't have to spread it from edge to edge or be perfectly neat, but you want the sheet to be somewhat thin., Aim to make the squares about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) big. You might also find it easier to lightly score the lines first, then cut them using a pizza cutter., If you need to, separate the squares or rectangles using a knife or your fingers., This is very important.

Chill a large bowl in the fridge.,
Pour the cream into the bowl.,
Beat the cream rapidly with a whisk.,
Add maple syrup when the cream forms soft peaks.,
Whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks.,
Serve or chill the whipped cream.",How to Make Maple Whipped Cream1," Place a large mixing bowl in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, preferably a stainless steel bowl because it chills faster. Chilling your mixing bowl before whipping your cream helps the cream to thicken faster and makes it easier to whip.Make sure that the cream you are going to use has been refrigerated for a couple of hours.
Use heavy whipping cream as opposed to half and half or other varieties of milk or cream.;
, After your have chilled your bowl and your cream, take them both out of the fridge. Pour one cup (236.5 ml) of the heavy cream into the chilled bowl., To beat the cream, use your non-dominant hand to hold the edge of the mixing bowl and tilt it slightly. Use your dominant hand to whip the cream with the whisk in rapid circular motions.When whipping the cream, get momentum from your wrist rather than moving your whole arm.
You need to whip rapidly and work quickly, before the cream has time to warm up.
Try to whip and disrupt the cream without splashing the cream. Instead of repeatedly taking the whisk out of the cream at the beginning of every circular motion, keep the head of the whisk in the cream as you whip.
You can also use a hand-mixer to whip the cream. To use a hand-mixer, turn the setting up to high and move the mixer in circular motions. You don’t have to whisk as rapidly as you do when whipping using a whisk, because the mixer will churn the cream for you., Keep hand-whipping the cream until the cream starts to gloom together and form soft peaks, about 3-5 minutes. Once you see that your cream is starting to look more solid, add in 2 tablespoons (29.5 ml) of pure maple syrup.Use pure maple syrup as opposed to artificial maple syrup, which has a different consistency and flavor.

, Once you have added in the maple syrup, whip either using your whisk or your hand-mixer on its highest setting. Whip for about 1-2 minutes, until the cream starts to take on the consistency of whipped cream and has stiff peaks.You can tell that your whipped cream is forming stiff peaks when the hill-like masses of cream look solid as opposed to liquid-y and soft.
Make sure not to whip for too long after the soft peaks become stiff. If you whip your cream for too long a time, it will become butter!

, Your whipped cream is now ready to be enjoyed! Dollop your homemade whipped cream onto fruit, baked goods or ice cream. Immediately store any unused whipped cream in the refrigerator, making sure to cover it by placing plastic wrap over the mixing bowl or putting it in a sealed container.

Whipped cream lasts a few days covered in the fridge. If it becomes runny in the fridge, whip it for 30 seconds or so before serving until it reaches its former consistency.

Lightly dust your work surface with confectioners' sugar.,
Turn the sugar mixture onto the dusted surface and knead it until it is smooth and silky.,
Roll out a small amount of the dough into a thin rope.,
Cut the rope into smaller pieces.,
Place the cut mints onto the baking sheet.,
Keep rolling and cutting the dough until you have nothing left.,
Let the mints dry for 1 to 2 days, then store them in the fridge in an airtight container.It might also be a good idea to store them in between layers of parchment paper.",How to Make Mints2," If you don't have any parchment paper, you can use wax paper or even plastic wrap. You will be setting the finished mint onto this to dry.

Plan ahead: avoid making these if it is humid. The moisture will make the mints stickier than usual., Cut the softened butter into smaller cubes and place it into a large bowl. Beat the butter using an electric mixer until it is soft any creamy. If you don't have an electric mixer, you can also use a food processor., Don't worry if the mixture doesn't form a dough-like texture yet. Hold off on adding the food coloring just yet; you will be kneading it into the mixture later., This will prevent the dough from sticking to it. Be sure to have the box or bag of confectioners' sugar on hand; you will likely need more of it., At this point, you can also add some food coloring. You can use either gel or liquid, but many people find that gel works better. Simply add 1 to 2 drops of food coloring and knead it into the dough until it is evenly mixed in., Lightly dust your work surface with more confectioners' sugar. Take about 2 tablespoons worth of the dough, and roll it into a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick rope.

Keep the rest of the dough you aren't working with covered with a damp towel. This will prevent it from drying out too soon.

, Each piece should be between ½ and ¾-inch (1.27 and 1.91 centimeters) long., Use a spatula to transfer them. The mints will be very soft at this point, and if you use your fingers, you might squish them., Remember to keep the dough you aren't rolling and cutting under a damp towel, or it will harden and dry out too fast., This will prevent the mints from sticking to each other.Because these mints are made of butter, they will soften up again at room temperature. It is important to keep them cool.

Make sure that everything is evenly combined., Keep beating until the mixture turns dough-like. It will feel hard and dry at first, but it will soften after about 1 to 2 minutes. If it is still too hard, add in 1 tablespoon of milk and mix again., At this point, you can also add in some food coloring. You can use liquid or gel good coloring, but you might find more success with gel.You don't need much; only a few drops should be plenty. Keep kneading the dough until all the ingredients come together, and the dough is silky-smooth., The balls should be small—roughly the size of marbles. You will only need about ½ teaspoon to make each mint., Fill a shallow dish with granulated or confectioners' sugar. Gently roll the balls one by one in the sugar before placing them back onto the wax paper., You can do this with your fingertip, the back of a spoon, a fork, etc. Don't flatten the balls so much that they are flat like a pancake. If you are using a mint mold, simply push the ball into the mold, smooth down the back, and pop it out., If you are in a hurry, you can also leave them to harden in the fridge or freezer; this will only take about 2 hours., These mints are based on cream cheese, so they will go bad if they are left out at room temperature for too long. You might also want to place a sheet of parchment paper between each layer of mint candy; this will prevent the candies from sticking together."

You can buy whipped cream canisters and chargers at kitchen specialty stores. They are typically made of stainless steel because the material chills easily.
Making whipped cream in a canister is mess-free, makes the whipped cream easier to dispense, and also helps the whipped cream last longer.

, After you pour in the whipping cream and maple syrup, screw the head back on the dispenser and shake it for about ten seconds to mix up the contents.Make completely sure that you have screwed the head on properly, or else you could have a mess on your hands!
Also be sure that the rubber gasket is in place between the top and the body of the canister, or else it won’t seal properly and gas will escape.

, After you have sealed the canister, unscrew the rod-like unit at the top of the container that holds the charger. Take one nitrous oxide charger and put it inside the unit that you unscrewed., After you put the nitrous oxide charger into the rod-like holder, screw the rod back onto the canister until you hear a popping noise.The popping noise occurs when the nitrous oxide charger is pierced by a pin, letting the nitrous oxide fill the canister. The nitrous oxide helps preserve the whipped cream inside the canister, and also creates pressure so that the cream can be properly dispensed through the nozzle.

, Hold the whipped cream canister in your dominant hand and turn it upside-down. Give the canister a few vigorous shakes to mix up everything inside., After shaking your whipped cream, aim the nozzle over your baked goods or whatever treats you are garnishing, then press the lever. After a second or so, the whipped cream will dispense out of the nozzle!If the whipped cream is too runny, shake the dispenser for a few seconds, then try again.
Store the whipped cream for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. Shake the container for 15-30 seconds before dispensing each time you use it.

Keep it in the back of the fridge or in a place where it can sit undisturbed, as opposed to on the door or in front of items that you reach for a lot in your fridge.It’s important to let the coconut milk or cream sit undisturbed so that the oil of the coconut can separate from the cream.
Also chill your mixing bowl or canister that you will use to whip the coconut milk or cream.
The coconut milk or cream will add a hint of coconut to the flavor of the whipped cream.

, After you have chilled the coconut milk or cream for 24 hours, take it out of the fridge. Transport it from the fridge to the counter without tipping or shaking it. Use a can opener to remove the lid, then use a spoon to dollop the coconut cream that has floated to the top out from the oil, which should have settled at the bottom, and place the cream in a large mixing bowl.Try to dollop the cream out very gently so that you don’t disrupt the coconut cream or milk and mix up the contents.
Dispose of the oil if you wish or reserve it to use for use in baking or other recipes.
If you are using a canister, place the cream in the body of a whipped cream canister.

, After you place the cream in the mixing bowl, use a whisk to whip the cream in rapid circular motions for about 30 seconds. If you are using a hand-mixer, turn the mixer onto high and move the mixer in lines back and forth through the cream for 30 seconds.If you are creating the vegan maple whipped cream in a canister, place the cream and the maple syrup into the canister, then follow the steps in Method 2 to properly assemble, mix and dispense the whipped cream.

It does not matter if you use white mini marshmallows or colored marshmallows.Rainbow marshmallows are great for bark made for Easter.;
, You will need the dish for when you put the bark into the freezer. You can use an 8x11 glass dish, or a half-sized cookie sheet for the marshmallow bark. Line the dish or sheet with parchment paper.The parchment paper keeps the ingredients from sticking to the sheet, and it makes it easier to move the bark.

, This recipe calls for white chocolate chips, but you can use any type of chocolate that you’d like. If you don’t have chocolate chips, you can also use cut up pieces of chocolate. Put the entire package of chocolate chips into a medium size glass bowl., The it takes me vary depending on the method you use. Take the bowl and put it into the microwave for two minutes. If you don’t want to to put the bowl into the microwave, you can put the chocolate into a pot and melt it over over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of shortening to the chocolate to aid the melting process.White chocolate is a bit more frustrating to melt than other types of chocolate because it doesn’t look melted when it really is. Stir the chocolate to see if it’s melted rather than melting it more without need.

, No matter what method you use to melt the chocolate, you will need to stir it. Stir it after every thirty seconds it is in the microwave. Remove it from the microwave, stir it with a large, wooden spoon, and then return it to the microwave until another thirty seconds passes. If you’re melting it over the stove, continuously stir it as it is melting.Sometimes stirring the chocolate will help it melt the rest of the way.

, Pour the three cups of marshmallows into the bowl of melted chocolate. Then, use the spoon to coat the marshmallows in the chocolate. Do this quickly or the marshmallows will begin to melt., Transfer the ingredients to the dish or cookie sheet as soon as the marshmallows have melted. Simply pour the bowl of chocolate and marshmallows onto the parchment paper. Use a rubber scraper to extend the mixture to the sides of the sheet. Use the same scraper to pat the mixture down so that it is even.Pour the mixture slowly, or you may unintentionally make a mess.

, Put the sheet into the freezer as soon as the ingredients have been poured and patted down. It can take anywhere from five minutes to twenty minutes in the freezer. The freezer is best to use because it allows the mixture to cool off quickly.If you do put it in the refrigerator, allow the mixture an hour to cool.

, Once you remove the mixture from the freezer, put it out on the counter or kitchen table. Wait until the bark reaches room temperature to cut it up. It shouldn’t take very long for the bark to reach room temperature—maybe five or ten minutes., You can break or cut the bark into pieces. Breaking it will leave a less uniform look. Cutting the pieces allows you to shape the bark as you wish. Use a sharp kitchen knife to cute the bark., Unless you are immediately eating the bark, store it in an airtight container. The container keeps the bark from melting. The bark will be good for at least a few days, but it is better to eat it as soon as possible."

Chill the custard in the fridge, covered, once it has reached room temperature.",How to Make Vanilla Custard1," An ice bath will quickly stop the cooking custard, which allows it to cool rapidly without curdling. While you can make custards without one, professional pastry chefs know that this little trick will make better custards every time., A shallow cut all the way down the pod should allow you to gently pry the pod open. Save both the husks and the beans inside.









If you are using vanilla extract, ignore this step and add the vanilla later, after cooking., This is your last bit of prep. Separate the yolks from the whites and then lightly whisk the yolks with a fork -- they don;t have to be pure liquid, just ""roughed up."" Set this aside near your ice bath.








, Stir until their are no more clumps of cornstarch or sugar, even if it isn't totally dissolved yet. Once it's mixed, use the end of a knife to scrape out the vanilla seeds and toss the husks in as well.

If you're using vanilla extract, stir it in now., Make sure, of course, that water cannot get into the custard. Then simply cover it with a towel or cheesecloth and let it cool down to room temperature.









For an even smoother custard, run it through a fine-mesh strainer before pouring into the chilling bowl., The custard should keep for several days in the fridge. It can be severed with berries, on it's own, or stuffed into pastries, like eclairs."

, A simple teaspoon of almond or cherry extract will quickly change the flavor profile of your desert. Similarly, a touch or spiced rum, chocolate liquor, or other strongly-flavored alcohols have long been used in custards. Add it after you've mixed the egg yolks in and stir well., The butter goes in towards the end, after you mixed in the eggs and the milk mixture. Simply stir it in until melted.

Set it to 400° Fahrenheit, or 200° Celsius.While your oven heats up, you will prepare your spaghetti squash for roasting.;
, Give your squash a good rinse in cold water before starting. Whether you got it from the supermarket, the farmer’s market, or from a friendly neighbor, the FDA recommends washing all produce before cooking or eating it.Once it’s cleaned to your satisfaction, you’ll need to cut it.


To cut your spaghetti squash, you’ll want to use a very sharp knife. You’ll have a difficult time piercing the squash with a dull one.
Cut it in half, length-wise.

, Using a spoon or a melon scoop, gently remove all of the seeds from each half of the squash. Toss those in the garbage. Once your spaghetti squash halves are seedless, lightly drizzle olive oil on each half and season with a bit of salt and pepper.Place them cut side down on a baking sheet., The spaghetti squash is done when the outside is tender. If, at the hour mark, they are not tender, you can keep them in for a bit longer and keep an eye on them.When the outsides feel soft and malleable, remove the baking sheet from the oven.

, To do this, turn your halves cut side up and rake a fork along the inside. The squash should easily shred into strands that look like spaghetti.Keep running your fork along the inside of the squash until you’ve gotten all of the “spaghetti” strands loose. Now that you’ve created your spaghetti base, you can spice it up by following one of these two very different recipes!

, While your spaghetti squash is roasting away, you’ll need to halve about 24 plum or Roma tomatoes, and then place them on a rimmed baking sheet. Top your tomatoes with the sliced garlic cloves and chopped thyme, and then drizzle them with olive oil. Season it all with salt and pepper.Place the tomatoes in the oven when your squash is about halfway done. Pull your tomatoes out as soon as they are brown at the edges and look wilted. This should take around 30 minutes.

, When the tomatoes are done roasting, pull them out of the oven and transfer them all into a bowl. Add your torn basil leaves. If you like your food extra garlicky, feel free to add more chopped garlic as well. Mash the mixture, blending everything together., When you’re satisfied with the texture of the tomato mixture, spoon it on top of the two spaghetti squash halves. Each half is a single portion, and you’ll be serving this pasta right out of the “shell!” To finish, top each half with grated Parmesan cheese., While your spaghetti squash is roasting in the oven, you’ll prepare the sauce. Add about two tablespoons (29.57 mL) of olive oil to the skillet. Set your stovetop to medium high heat.


Place the pancetta in the skillet. It will probably take about five minutes to crisp up, but just keep watching the pan.
When the pancetta is nice and crispy, add the sirloin and cook another six to seven minutes. When the sirloin is golden brown, it’s all set., You’ll want to cook these for about five minutes or so. Continue stirring them, and wait for them to get nice and tender. Season your meat and veggies with salt and pepper., The tomato paste should go in first. You’ll stir that into the skillet for about a minute, or until it’s a golden brown color. Then pour in the red wine and the beef stock, continuously stirring to prevent things from sticking to the pan. Set your timer for five minutes, and let the sauce thicken. Continue stirring sporadically so that the sauce doesn’t stick., Each half of the squash is one portion, and you’ll be serving them in their little boats. Spoon generous portions of the sauce onto each half, and then sprinkle the parsley and basil on top. If you want, you can also add a bit of cheese."

Wash the aubergine thoroughly.,
Cut the aubergine however your recipe dictates.,
Salt the exposed flesh of the aubergine.,
Rinse the aubergine under water to remove the salt and thoroughly dry it.",How to Cook Aubergine1," Check for brown spots or bruises. If the skin is in good shape, it is edible, though some varieties have skin that is too tough to eat. Peel the skin with a vegetable peeler if you think it’s wise – younger aubergine skin is fine to eat, but older, more ripened aubergine skin has a bitter taste. Cut off the stem and base, too.


Leave the skin on if you are baking aubergine whole in the oven or roasting it on the grill. It’s also best left on if you want to scrape out the insides later and make an aubergine mash.;
, It could be halved lengthwise, cubed, diced or sliced. It’s sometimes a matter of personal preference, too. Just remember that if you're grilling it, keep it in larger chunks so it doesn't fall through the grates.


If your recipe calls for mashed or pureed aubergine, do not cut it since you can bake it whole. This is the easiest way, too.

, This helps to draw out the bitterness that an aubergine can typically have. Salting also creates a denser flesh, making it less sponge-like so it will not absorb fat so easily. Keep them sitting in a colander for 20 to 30 minutes.


If you need, you can skip this step. The aubergine will still be tasty, but it may have a slightly different consistency and be a little more bitter.

, This action keeps the aubergine from absorbing too much oil when cooking, keeping the aubergine's crunch.


Make sure the aubergine is actually dry. Water left on may absorb into the meat of the veggie, making it chewier than is desirable.

Bake at  high (375 to 400) degree oven for 1 hour to 2 hours.,
Let the pie stand for 1 to 6 hours.,
Serve like sweet potato or pumpkin pie with cream, ice cream, or milk.",How to Bake a Winter Squash Pie," A winter squash is grown and, in fact, tastes sort of like pumpkins. They are harvest during the cold (fall) season and produce one crop per year. Some squashes can be wrongly called pumpkins in some stores. The squash group of vegetables is a very diverse group and new colors and shapes are showing up in markets thanks to breeding by garden experts. You can always pre-taste a squash variety to be sure it's a sweet squash. In order to know what you're getting, consider the main winter squash options:.


The acorn squash looks like a 3D spade of the playing cards and has tougher skin than the other varieties. This also has ribbed or waved skin. It's often a deep dark green color, but they can have creamy white or speckled skins. This squash as hollow and its cavity is the largest. This one has a nutty mild taste. If a cultivar of acorn squash has turned orange or yellow, it might be old.
The butternut squash stands out with its unusual pear shape. It's a solid type with skin is pale brown pink to beige color. This squash skin is very tender and butternuts have a lot of flesh in ratio to a small seed cavity. Sometime the shape is like a 2 balled snowman! The seeds are always on the bottom. Its flavor gives it its name, because it tastes a lot like butter roasted pecans or walnuts.
The buttercup squash has a round turban shape and hollow with a smallish center seed cavity. Its colors can be a bright burning red or green with stripes. Some fruits have a ""crown"" on top of the main fruit. Its flavor is more sweet than buttery.
Other winter squash are rarer but may be available in fruit markets or farmer markets. The Hubbard squash is shaped like a butternut squash but is either a bright red-orange or a bluish gray color and may or may not have ""warts"" on the skin. The cushaw, crooked neck or Tennessee sweet potato is technically a butternut squash with dark green skin and white stripes. Cushaw and hubbard squash can be huge in size. The delicata squash is a small cute cylindrical shaped type with creamy colored skin and dark green stripes.
Avoid the spaghetti squash for this recipe. This yellow egg shaped squash doesn't cook down like other winter squash and tastes like zucchini. Its flesh is pale yellow and comes apart in noodle like strands.;
, Winter squash can be found in many markets at any time of the year. However, a good squash will be heavy for its size and not light. If it's light the flesh is dry, it means the squash is old or underripe and may be harder to cook down. Old squash, when cooked, will leave more hard ""chunks"" in the filling that'll have to be removed, and they can result in a gritty pie. A good heavy squash will cook down very quickly and give smoother filling.


The size of the squash will dictate how many pies you can make using this recipe and how squash you'll need. A large fat butternut squash will fill two store brought graham cracker crust forms. The round or acorn shaped ones produce less flesh than butternuts. Size will also have to be a consideration when baking the squash. Larger squash could take longer to cook.
Don't worry about bruises and ""warts""; these are natural occurrences.

, You can use either a ready made pie crust in the store or make your own pie crust using any recipe. You can also fill the pie pan with the filling first and drop the crust in as dumplings, crumble or cobbler style. graham cracker or cookie crusts work nicely with this recipe.

, You can use the microwave or the oven.



For the microwave: Rinse in running water and place the whole squash without cutting into the microwave on a microwave safe plate. If it's too big, you can cut it into smaller pieces first. Microwave at high power for 10 to 30 minutes.

For the oven: If you're using an oven, place the squash on any oven-safe container and bake it for 20 to 40 minutes on high heat (350 to 400) degrees.
The squash is ready when it darkens, sweats and wilts. It will turn very soft to first touch. The skin becomes easily pierced by a fork. The flesh should be soft and have a texture like mashed potatoes.
If a huge part of the squash doesn't cook tender like the rest, remove the ready parts and return the squash back into the oven to cook some more. Don't be afraid to rotate or flip the squash for even cooking.
Some people cut the squash big or small remove the seeds first and then cook it. This may dry the squash out and affect the flavor, but it's doable if you prefer to cook that way.
Let the squash cool.

, When the squash is cool enough to handle, cut the squash in half if your using a round or acorn shaped one. If you're using a pear-shaped one, cut the fat end off and then cut it half. You just remove the skin of the skinny or ""neck"" part of the squash and have lots of flesh. With a spoon or scoop, remove the seeds. You don't have to worry about removing the stringy pulp. The pulp is full of moisture and flavor and is very tender. Scrape the flesh off the skin and discard the skin and seeds.


If you run into hard ""chunks"" that don't cook or mash right, throw those out. Also throw out the two ""ends,"" which are the very top and bottom of the fruit. Acorn squash can also have strings at every ""ridge or hill""; get rid of those as well.

, It's totally up to your taste and you can add a little or a lot of sweetness. A good sweet combo is sugar, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cloves, anise, cinnamon and/or 5 spice.


Mix the mixture in a large container until throughly mixed. The squash will turn into a smooth velvet texture. Remove any seeds, hard chunks and skins that might have been missed as you go.
Cloves, allspice and ginger are very strong! Do not put too much of any of these three or they'll overwhelm the other spices and squash flavors. Taste your species first to see how strong they are before adding.
There's no additional milk, cream, or eggs in this recipe. Squash has a lot of water in it already in it. Adding more moisture will make a soupy pie that won't firm up right after baking. It'll also ruin the texture of the squash.
Give the blender a rest! You don't want to make a squash puree.

, Leave a little bit of the crust edge showing. Don't worry about over filling, as squash doesn't bubble or rise.

, If your crust starts burning anytime during baking, turn down the oven. The pie is ready when the filling dries out and a knife inserted inside the center of the pie comes clean.

, Resist the first slice and let the flavors develop.

, You might want to even try some nuts with it.

Preheat the oven to 230°C (450°F).,
Peel the aubergine, if desired, and cut to size.,
Roast the aubergine about 20 minutes or until tender.",How to Cook Aubergine2," You’ll also need to line a baking pan with foil or lightly grease it. Alternatively, if you have one, you can use a Silpat (though a little greasing still wouldn't hurt).

, Consider a few of these variations:


Cut it into 3/4-inch cubes. Toss the cubes with garlic, olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Once all the cubes are covered, place into the pan.
Bake your aubergine whole. Pierce the skin a few times when baking so it does not explode from expanding moisture. You can then scoop out the flesh for mashing or pureeing.
Slice the aubergine length-wise and brush with olive oil and seasoning (diced onion, pepper, grated cheese, breadcrumbs and spices all work wonderfully).

, If you're working with cubes, you may wish to stir them up about halfway through, or 10 minutes in. And if your oven cooks unevenly, turn the pan around as well. You want each piece to have that hint of crunch while still being tender.


If you're roasting a whole aubergine, pierce it with a fork. If there is initial pressure and then it slides right in, your aubergine is fully cooked.

"
"
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.,
Slice the aubergine and brush with olive oil on both sides.,
Add the aubergine slices to the hot oil.,
When the slices are evenly browned, take them off the heat.",How to Cook Aubergine3," If you don't have olive oil, you can substitute avocado oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or palm oil – and it'll still be healthy.Don't be tempted to use much more oil than that; oil will be brushed on the aubergine later. If you bombard the aubergine with even more, it'll take on a fried yet soggy texture.

, Slice it in 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) slices, or however your recipe calls for. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add any other spices you'd like to accompany the aubergine, too.


If you’d like, coat the aubergine slices in breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese. You’ll need around ⅓ cup of breadcrumbs and 1 or 2 tablespoons of Parmesan for one, good-sized aubergine. Mix it up and dip each slice in before adding it to the pan.

, Each side will need to cook for about 5 minutes or until golden. Don't walk away from the pan – there's a window of perfection that, if missed, will result in your slices blackening too much. Keep turning as need be for browned perfection.


Looking for a zestier kick? Add some soy sauce into the mix (but keep some for dipping later). Introduce whatever other flavors you think would pair well, too.

, Place them onto a paper towel to sop up the extra oil. Give them a few minutes to cool down and then it's chow time.


Aubergine is tasty with soy sauce, ranch, or even plain. They're a great complement to any meal, putting a new twist on boring ol' veggies.

"
"
If you’re using a gas grill, preheat it.,
Peel the aubergine, if desired, and cut into 1/2-inch slices.,
Season as desired with herbs, salt, and ground black pepper.,
Line the grill with foil or place it directly onto the rack.,
Grill for about 8 minutes or until crispy and tender, turning occasionally.",How to Cook Aubergine4," Put it on medium heat with a grill rack on top. If you’re using a charcoal grill, get the coals going nice and hot.


Make sure your grill is clean before you use it. Put some vegetable oil on a paper towel and wipe down the grate, one by one. Using oil can also help to prevent sticking.

, You can also halve small aubergines lengthwise instead of slicing vertically. Brush slices on all sides generously with olive oil, melted butter, or cooking oil. This adds flavor and keeps them from sticking to the grill rack, too.


Alternatively, you can grill eggplant whole or sliced in half over a medium to hot flame for 15 to 20 minutes until the skin is blackened. Pierce the skin when cooking aubergines this way to get heat into the center.

, You can also brush the aubergine with oil-based marinade instead of the oil or butter. Any marinade that works on other vegetables will work on aubergine, too.

, If you’re working with small slices, lining the grill with foil will be best to keep the slices from falling through the grate. It also keeps the oil on top and redistributable.


Pierce a few holes into the foil to allow the heat to transfer more quickly.

, For both a charcoal and gas grill, place the aubergine on a rack directly above the heat. A gas grill should be covered; a charcoal grill should not.


When finished, turn off the heat, leave the foil, and transfer the aubergine to a plate. Give both the aubergine and the foil a few minutes to cool down before either are touched.
The aubergine is now good to be added to a salad or a stir fry, or even eaten alone with your dipping sauce of choice. It can even be kept for later as part of a soup or stew.

Pick eggplant that is at its peak freshness. Pickling will preserve the vegetable at its prime crispness. A fresh eggplant is a shiny, deep purple. The stem should be bright and the surface of the eggplant should have no bruises. Squeeze the eggplant gently to determine its sponginess. It should be firm. Purchase enough eggplant for the size of your pickling jar.
Run the vegetable under cold water, rinsing the skin lightly with your fingers.
Slice the eggplant into eighths. Cut each slice lengthwise into thin strips.
Place the strips into a colander and sprinkle kosher salt over them.

, You can sauté your squash in olive oil or butter. You can also use a combination of the two. Which one you choose depends on your taste.Butter will give your squash a sweeter taste. For a sweeter squash, use butter. However, if you want a sweeter taste without as much calories or cholesterol, you can use half butter and half olive oil.
If you would rather have a more savory taste, olive oil may be a better option.

, Adding meat to your sautéd squash can give it a richer, heartier taste. If you're making a meal, consider cooking your squash with a few pieces of bacon, sliced into one-inch strips. You can also add diced onions to add a savory taste to your squash., Before you cook any vegetable, it's important to wash it. This will remove any contaminants or harmful chemicals. Before washing the vegetable, make sure to wash your hands first. Wash them for about 20 seconds using soap and water.Wash your squash under running water. Rub any dirt or debris off of the squash as you wash it.
Do not use any soap to wash your squash. You simply need to wash it using water.

, You should cut your squash into small cubes to cook it. How big or small the cubes are depend on your personal preference. Thinner, smaller cubes may cook faster than larger, thicker ones.If you're working with winter squash, peel your squash first using a vegetable peeler. It's hard to work with un-peeled squash. You also may want to microwave the squash for 3 minute before cutting it into cubes. Winter squash is tougher, and this can make it easier to cut., Turn the burner on medium-high heat. Spend a few minutes allowing your butter or olive oil to heat up. You want the squash to sizzle slightly when it makes contact with the butter and oil.However, if you're cooking squash with bacon, add the bacon first. Bacon should start on a cold pan without any olive or butter. If the bacon produces enough grease, you may not have to add butter or olive oil when you add your squash.

, Place the meat or onions into the skillet. If you're using bacon, cook until it's crispy. For onions, cook them until they're crisp and tender as well., Take your cubed squash and place it into the heated pan. Be careful. Butter and olive oil may spit off the pan when squash is added. It's a good idea to wear an apron for your own safety., Stir the squash on occasion as it cooks to make sure it cooks evenly throughout. It should take about 8 minutes for the squash to adequately cook. It may take more or less, however, depending on the precise strength of your pan. Therefore, keep an eye on the squash as it cooks. Cook the squash until it's tender., Once the squash is cooked, you can stir in your spices. You can add about a tablespoon or teaspoon of each spice, depending on how strong you want the flavor. You should also add salt to taste., Your squash should not be ready to eat. Remove the squash from the heat and serve it. You may want to wait a few minutes before eating your squash, as it may be hot.

You can use regular table salt, kosher salt, or whatever you have on hand.Sprinkle the salt on, or toss the cubes in the salt. Spread the cubes out in a colander or over a cooling rack, as water will drip off them.A medium eggplant is about a pound by weight. If you're eggplant is larger or smaller, adjust the amount of salt in the same ratio. For instance, if you have an eggplant that is 1 1/2 pounds, add 3/4 tablespoon of salt for each eggplant.

, This process takes time, as the salt is drawing moisture out of the eggplant. You'll need 30 minutes at the minimum, but you can leave them up to an hour and a half. Watch for moisture beading up on the eggplant, which is what you want., Run the eggplant under water for a minute or two, making sure you get most of the salt off. Leaving too much salt on will make the final dish too salty., For most applications, you want to dry the eggplant off as much as possible.

Green onions are also known as ""scallions"" or ""eschallots"". They are sometimes mistakenly called shallots or spring onions.;
, These are also known as ""salad onions"" and they're the more mature green onions. The bulb is white and sweet to the taste. While the tops of these onions can be used, they have an intense flavour.

Wash your sweet potatoes.,

Wrap your sweet potato for cooking.,
Put the plate in the microwave and select a cooking time.,
Check your sweet potato for doneness.,
Let your sweet potato cool.,
Serve the potato.",How to Cook a Sweet Potato in the Microwave1," Clean your sweet potatoes under cool running water and scrub with a produce scrubbing brush. Make sure to clean your potatoes well. Pat your potato dry with a paper towel.


This is especially important if you enjoy eating the sweet potato skin.;
, Prick the skin of your sweet potato about six to eight times all around. When you heat your sweet potato in the microwave, it warms up quickly and steam gathers in-between the fleshy inside and the skin. If you don't poke holes in the skin for the steam to escape, your potato will explode in the microwave.


You only need to open small holes in the skin, so don't stab your potato deeply with your fork.
Alternatively, you can cut a shallow ""X"" onto the top of the potato, using a knife.
Trust me, you do not want to skip this step!

, Take a full-sized paper towel and dampen it with cold water. Gently squeeze out the excess water and take care not to rip the towel. Lay the towel flat on a microwavable plate and place your sweet potato in the center of the paper towel. Cover the potato by loosely folding the sides of the paper towel over it.


The wet paper towel will provide a steaming effect when microwaving your sweet potato.
This will also help to keep the potato moist and prevent it from shrinking, and it will also result in softer skin.

Never use aluminum foil for microwave cooking! Do not wrap your sweet potato in metal foil while cooking in the microwave. This will cause sparking and is a potential fire hazard. Doing this will also break your microwave.

, Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the potato and the power of the microwave. Most medium to large potatoes will take between 8-12 minutes to cook at full power.Try putting the potato in for 5 minutes to begin with, then take it out and turn it over so that both sides cook evenly. Place it back in the microwave for another 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft it is already.
After that, if it still doesn't feel fully cooked, continue to microwave it in 1 minute bursts, checking after each minute.If you are cooking multiple potatoes at once, you will need to increase the cooking time by about two-thirds. For example, if one large potato takes 10 minutes to cook, two large potatoes would take between 16-17 minutes.
If you prefer crispy skinned sweet potatoes, you can cook the potatoes in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, then unwrap your sweep potato and transfer it to a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 400 °F (204 °C) for 20 minutes. This method is great if you want oven-crisp potato skins, in less than half the normal cooking time!, Be careful when removing the sweet potato from the microwave. Both the potato and the plate will be hot! The potato should yield to firm pressure but not be too mushy. If the potato is too firm, microwave again for 1 minute increments, until cooked through. You can check if a potato is cooked by sticking a fork in the center; if the fork goes in easily, but the center is still a little firm, the potato is ready.


When in doubt, it is best to err on the side of undercooking, as an overcooked potato may burn or explode in the microwave.

, Unwrap your potato completely and discard the damp paper towel. It's a good idea to let your sweet potato cool for about five minutes. This allows the core of the potato to finish cooking using the heat that is trapped in the inner layers. It also helps it to become fluffy on the inside without over-drying on the outside.


If you are saving a potato for someone who's running late, wrapping the potato in aluminum foil will keep it warm for a remarkably long time. Just be sure to do this as soon as it comes out of the microwave, to conserve as much heat as possible.

, Cut the potato in half and enjoy.

Avoid peeling new potatoes where possible.,

Consider not peeling when the potatoes are organic.,
Be kitchen-lazy.,
Decide what you're using the potatoes for.,
Use the peels.",How to Decide Whether or Not to Peel Potatoes," New potatoes are the first potatoes of the season, often small and carrying a delicate flavour. What you may find upon trying to wash these potatoes, is that the peel will come off by itself, just from the water pressure. Try to wash these potatoes gently, so as not to remove much peel and don't bother peeling off their lovely skin.;
, Potatoes that are really dirty and have blemishes are often best peeled. Peeling helps to remove the dirt (always wash first though) and will lift away many of the blemishes.

, Peeling became a habit with the rise of pesticides on edible food. When you grow your own or purchase certified pesticide-free potatoes, this ceases to be a reason for peeling., Many people don't peel potatoes because they don't enjoy doing it and it's just one more kitchen chore! Always give the potatoes a good scrub to remove dirt and cut out any blemishes but apart from that, the potatoes will generally be fine with their peel left on.


Challenge your recipes. Perhaps you've always made that potato recipe with peeled potatoes, and perhaps the recipe says to peel. However, being the intuitive and creative cook that you are, give it a try unpeeled and see what results!






At least try dishes made with unpeeled potatoes before saying you don't like them. You won't know unless you give it a go!







, Of all things, this one is the most important for determining whether or not you'll peel the potatoes. Here are some basic tips:



Mashed potatoes: You'll need to peel first unless the potato skin is very thin and fine. Thick peel doesn't mash well and it tends to simply tear apart and get stuck throughout the mash, annoying the diner when eating. If you are absolutely certain that the potato skin is thin and likely to disintegrate, then you can probably get away with not peeling but be sure to wash well first. Never leave peel on if you want really smooth mashed potato.







Roasted potatoes: This is usually a taste preference. If possible, leave the peel on for a crunchier, tastier experience. However, some people actually prefer the peeled version (and a crunchy crust still forms), so base the choice on trialing what everyone prefers. You could even do half half when roasting––half peeled and half unpeeled.






Fries or chips: Most fries and chips benefit from leaving the peel on. It's added taste and it looks lovely. However, again there are many people who prefer no peel, whether out of habit, seeing most fries and chips without peel, or simply from taste. Either way works well.







Soups: Smooth soups require removal of the peel. Soups which leave the potato chunks unblended or mashed can usually get away with the peel being left on. Again, this is all a matter of personal preference.







Baked potatoes: Leave the peel on, no question about it!







Steamed potatoes: This is one time where only new or delicate skinned potatoes should have the peel left on. For older, tougher-skinned potatoes, it's best to peel them.







Potato salad: Skins are naturally softer once cooked, and provided you've scrubbed the potato well and are using potatoes without tough skins, unpeeled potatoes in a salad are just fine. Some people may prefer the peeled potato version though, and tougher potatoes are best peeled.







Potatoes added to stews, curries, casseroles, etc.: There is no hard and fast rule here and provided the potatoes are clean and the blemishes have been removed, the peel can be left on. However, in some cases, the peel must be removed to ensure a smooth texture. You might need a little trial and error here.







, Peel from potatoes that is clean and free of green spots or blemishes can be added to soups and stock for flavouring.

Start at one end of the potato. Dig the blade just beneath the surface of the skin and apply light yet steady pressure as you drag the blade down the length of the potato. Repeat until all the skin is removed from the potato and until each potato is peeled.
If desired, you can use potatoes that still have some or all of their skin. The skin of the potato actually has nutritional value, and keeping it can add an interesting dimension of texture to your mashed potatoes. Make sure, however, that the potatoes are scrubbed well if you intend to keep the skin.;
, If the potatoes are peeled, all you need to do is rinse them under cool, running water, gently scrubbing the flesh with your fingers to remove any lingering dirt left behind by the skins.


If you kept the skins on the potatoes, you will need to scrub the skins with a vegetable brush under running water. The potatoes are sufficiently clean once the water runs clear and all major clumps of dirt have been removed.

,


Cut each potato in half and each half into quarters. If these pieces are still too large, continue cutting them down to size until they are all roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm).







, Add about 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) salt to the water, as well.


The salt is not strictly necessary for cooking, but adding salt to the water as the potatoes cook allows it to permeate the potatoes more thoroughly, drawing out more of the potatoes' natural flavor.






You only need to add enough water to just barely cover the potatoes. The level of potatoes and water should not take up more than 3/4 of the saucepan, however. If the level is too high, water will splash out, leading to less effective cooking and a more hazardous situation. Transfer the potatoes and water to another saucepan if necessary to avoid this situation.







, Bring the pot of potatoes up to a boil over medium-high to high heat.


Leave the saucepan uncovered as you boil the potatoes.
You do not need to stir the potatoes as they cook.
Depending on how much water you used and how hot your stove gets, this step usually takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

, Cover and continue cooking until the potatoes reach medium softness.


The potatoes are done once tender. You should be able to stick a fork through the largest of chunks without any resistance.






A foam will naturally gather on top of the water as the starches break down. To manage the simmer more effectively, skim this foam off with a large serving spoon once it covers the entire surface of the water. You may need to do this multiple times during the boiling process.







, Place the butter in a microwave-safe dish and add the cream. Microwave on half or medium power in 20 second intervals, stirring well after each, until the butter is completely melted.


Proceed slowly to avoid heating the butter and cream too quickly.
The two ingredients can also be combined and heated over the stove. Place them in a small saucepan over medium-low to medium heat and melt the butter completely, stirring the mix occasionally.







, Cautiously pour the contents of your large saucepan through a large colander, retaining the potatoes while discarding the water they were cooked in.


You can return the potatoes to the large saucepan afterward or transfer them to a clean, large bowl with a wide mouth.







, Pour the cream and butter mixture into the bowl of potatoes.

, Use a manual potato masher to smash the potatoes down and mix in the cream-butter combination. Continue mashing until the potatoes are mostly smooth with a few chunks.


Alternatively, skip the potato masher and use an electric mixer. An electric mixer creates mashed potatoes with a slightly chunkier texture. Continue beating the potatoes until they begin releasing naturally from the beaters., Use a strong metal spoon to press down on any remaining chunks of potato. Slowly add the milk until you reach your desired consistency.


Note that you should avoid over-beating your potatoes, since doing so will cause them to develop a paste-like texture.

, Mix the salt and pepper in with a spoon and serve warm.


Other seasonings, like parsley or paprika, can also be added as desired.







, If you're especially short on ingredients, use a simplified mashed potato recipe. All you really need for homemade mashed potatoes are potatoes, milk, and butter.


Salt can still be added to taste.

, To draw out the flavor of the butter, replace the cream or milk with chicken broth. This allows the taste of the butter to become a more prominent flavor.

, Garlic and mashed potatoes are a classic flavor combination, and you can prepare your own homemade garlic mashed potatoes simply by adding cloves of garlic to the recipe.

, You can experiment with your own combination of herbs if you have a pretty good sense of taste, but if you need some guidance or a place to start, try adding a little thyme and dried mint to your mashed potatoes.

, Poppy seeds have a natural sweetness, so adding ground poppy seed to your mashed potatoes is a good way to balance out the heartiness of the dish.

, This is a traditional Irish mashed potato recipe that mixes potatoes with cabbage.

Other ingredients, like onion, garlic, and bay leaf, are also commonly added.

, This unusual combination adds a little sweetness to the mashed potatoes, but it also makes the dish more savory., Wasabi is a hot Japanese spice made from horseradish. Adding wasabi powder or pre-mixed wasabi to your mashed potatoes is a great option for someone who finds normal mashed potatoes a little bland.

, Believe it or not, the purple potato is a natural potato variety. These potatoes can be mashed like most other varieties.

Complete the flavor by stirring in fruity olive oil instead of butter. You can also garnish the potatoes with violet flowers.

, Steaming preserves more water-soluble nutrients than boiling.


Simply peel and chop potatoes as usual before steaming them in the top portion of a two-section steamer. Mash the potatoes once they reach medium softness.

, Since this method is so simple and deals with minimal heat, it is a good choice to use when teaching your kids to cook.


Chop your potatoes and microwave them as though cooking microwave-""baked"" potatoes. Pull medium-soft potatoes out of the microwave and mash as desired.

, Add whole, halved, or sliced potatoes to the pressure cooker with adequate water.

Cook the potatoes for several minutes. Slices potatoes may take as little as 2 1/2 minutes, while whole potatoes may take 15 minutes.
Mash the softened potatoes as usual after pulling them out of the pressure cooker.

Next, line a baking sheet with nonstick foil and spray it lightly with nonstick cooking spray.You can substitute parchment paper for the foil if you prefer.

, For the hash browns, you’ll need 4 cups of peeled, shredded baking potatoes. Place the potatoes in a large bowl, and cover them with cold water. Allow them to soak for about 5 minutes.You can substitute sweet potatoes for the baking potatoes if you prefer.

, After the potatoes have soaked for several minutes, drain the water from them. Next, rinse them under cold water from the sink to remove any lingering starch., To create crispy hash browns, it’s important that potatoes are completely dry before you bake them. Place the shredded potatoes in a salad spinner, and spin them until they are fully dry.If you don’t have a salad spinner, dry the potatoes thoroughly by patting them with paper towel.

, Once the potatoes are dry, combine them with ¼ cup (58 g) of thinly sliced green onions and ¼ cup (45 g) of chopped green bell pepper in a large bowl. Toss the ingredients together well so they’re fully combined.You can substitute yellow onion for the green if you prefer.
You can substitute red or yellow bell peppers for the green if you prefer. You can also use a combination of two or more of the peppers.

, After you’ve combined the potatoes with the peppers and onions, mix 2 tablespoons (16 g) of cornstarch, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of salt, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of black pepper, and ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of onion powder into the bowl. Toss the mixture well to make sure all of the potatoes are coated with the seasonings.You can add any other seasonings, such as garlic powder, paprika, and/or cayenne pepper, that you might like to the hash browns.

, When you’re ready to make the hash brown patties, set a 3-inch (8-cm) biscuit cutter on the prepared baking sheet. Fill the cutter with ½ cup (115 g) of the potato mixture to form a patty.While you want a neat pile of the potato mixture to create the potato, don’t press on the potatoes to pack them.
If you don’t have a biscuit or pastry cutter, you can form the patties with clean hands. However, be careful not to pack the mixture together too tightly.

, Once you’ve filled the biscuit cutter with the potato mixture, carefully lift away the cutter, making sure to leave the patty intact. Continue the process until you’ve used up all of the potato mixture., After you’ve formed all the hash brown patties, lightly coat their tops with cooking spray. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and allow them to bake for 20 minutes., When the hash browns have cooked for 20 minutes, use a wide spatula to carefully flip the patties over. Let the patties cook for another 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown.Keep an eye on hash browns, particularly near the end of the cooking time, to ensure that the edges don’t burn.

, After the hash browns have finished baking, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Use the spatula to transfer the patties to a platter, and serve with the rest of your breakfast while they are still warm.The recipe makes approximately 8 hash brown patties.
To store leftover hash browns, place the patties in an airtight container and refrigerate. They should keep for 2 to 3 days.

Feel free to mix in or substitute any other seasonings in the hash browns. Cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, dried oregano, and dried sage are some tasty options.

, Place a large skillet on the stove, and add 2 teaspoons (8 g) of coconut oil. Allow the oil to heat on medium-high until it melts, which should take 3 to 5 minutes., Once the oil is heated, place half of the cauliflower mixture in the skillet.

",How to Make Healthy Mashed Potatoes2," Mashed potatoes can be a little bland. Make your healthy mashed potatoes delicious by adding a small handful of fresh, chopped herbs. This will also give your mashed potatoes a great color. If you don't have fresh herbs, you can substitute dried herbs--just use a little less. Try a few of these herbs:


Parsley
Tarragon
Chives
Rosemary
Garlic

, Just because you're making healthy mashed potatoes doesn't mean they can't taste good. Include a little bit of rich flavor which will season the entire dish. For example, include a bit of grated aged cheese or just a little drizzle of olive oil.


You can use blue cheese, parmesan, asiago, or your favorite cheese. Remember to use just use a little of the cheese as a garnish.

, You've probably had really rich mashed potatoes that relied on loads of cream or whole milk for flavor. Instead of using high-calorie dairy products, use a different liquid when mashing the potatoes. Lower calorie options that are flavorful and nutritious include:


Low-fat buttermilk
Low-sodium chicken stock
Vegetable broth
Fat-free evaporated milk

, Instead of flavoring your mashed potatoes with a dollop of sour cream or melted butter, cut the calories and use Greek yogurt or plain yogurt. You can choose nonfat varieties which will give you calcium and creamy flavor without the high fat content.Keep in mind that the Greek yogurt will give your mashed potatoes a slightly tangy taste.

, Russet potatoes are a classic potato for mashing, but you can easily swap out a more flavorful potato. Try to choose a red, yellow, or white potato, since their peels are thinner and you can leave them on. They often have a naturally creamy flavor that makes your mashed potatoes tasty without adding butter or cream.Russet potatoes are higher in starch than the other varieties and you'll need to peel their thick skins before you mash the potatoes.
If you'd like to use an entirely different vegetable, give riced cauliflower a try. You can steam cauliflower and rice it, then mash it just like potatoes.

, If you're using red or gold potatoes (like Yukon Gold), don't peel the potatoes before you cook and peel them. Since most of the potatoes nutrients and fiber are found in the skin, this is an easy way to make your mashed potatoes healthier.Go for rustic mashed potatoes when leaving the skin on. For example, use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they're roughly pureed. They should have some texture from the peels and the small chunks of potato.

, To keep most of the potatoes nutrients, try steaming the potatoes instead of boiling and draining the nutrients with the water. Put the potatoes in a steamer over a pot of boiling water and steam the potato chunks for 12 to 15 minutes. They should be tender before you remove them.Many sauce pots also come with steam basket inserts. Or you can use a small, expandable metal steamer that you set in a sauce pot.

, While most mashed potatoes are only made with potatoes, you can easily add other root vegetables. These will add a variety of nutrients and a little flavor to the mashed potatoes. For example, turnips can add a slightly sweet flavor while parsnips will give a bit of a spicy kick. Try adding one of these:Broccoli
Turnips
Parsnips
Carrots
Leeks
Spinach

Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Your oven will alert you that the oven has preheated in some way. Most models either flash a light or beep to let you know.;
, While the oven is preheating, place 2 pounds (900 g) of russet potatoes that have been peeled and cut into 2-inch (5-cm) chunks into a large pot. Cover the potatoes with approximately 1-inch (2.5 cm) of water, and bring the pot to a boil on medium-high. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and allow the potatoes to cook until tender.It should take approximately 10 minutes for the potatoes to become tender.
Use a fork to test the potatoes’ tenderness.

, Once the potatoes are tender, remove the pot from the stove and drain it completely. Place the potatoes back in the pot, and cook on medium-low for 3 minutes. Make sure to stir the potatoes often to prevent burning.Returning the potatoes to the pot without the water helps dry them out slightly.

, After you’ve dried out the potatoes, use a potato masher to mash them until they are completely smooth. Allow them to cool for approximately 5 minutes in the pot.You can use a potato ricer in place of the masher if you prefer.

, When the potatoes are completely mashed, add 5 tablespoons (71 g) of butter that has been softened to room temperature, ¼ cup (60 ml) of heavy cream that’s at room temperature, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, ¼ teaspoon (2 g) of ground nutmeg, and ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) of pepper to the pot. Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure that all of the ingredients are well blended.If you want your potatoes to have some cheesy flavor, you can also mix in 2 tablespoons (10 g) of grated parmesan cheese.

, After you’ve mixed in the seasonings, give the potatoes a taste. If you think they need more salt, add more until you’re satisfied with the flavor., Once the potatoes are seasoned, add the yolks from 3 large eggs to them. Use a spatula to gently fold the yolks in until they’re blended with the potatoes.Work the yolks into the potatoes until they’re just combined. Avoid overmixing the yolks.

, Take a large baking sheet, and line it with a piece of parchment paper. You can also use a silicone baking mat if you prefer.If you don’t have parchment paper or a baking mat, you can grease the baking sheet with butter or nonstick cooking spray.

, Take a pastry or piping bag and fit it with a large star or round tip. Next, use a spatula to fill the bag with the prepared potatoes.If you don’t have a pastry bag, you can spoon the potatoes onto the baking sheet in mounds. Use the back of the spoon to swirl the tops of the mounds.

, With the piping bag, create approximately 3-inch (7.6-cm) swirled mounds on the baking sheet with the potatoes. You should have enough potatoes to make 12 to 16 potato swirls., In a small bowl, combine 1 whole egg with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk to create an egg wash. Use a pastry brush to carefully apply the wash all over the potato spirals.You can use any type of milk that you like, but whole milk typically works best.
It’s usually easier to brush the potatoes with the egg wash if you chill them for approximately 30 minutes in the refrigerator beforehand.

, After you’ve applied the egg wash, place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the potatoes to bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the edges become golden brown.Be sure to keep an eye on the potatoes as they’re cooking to ensure that the edges don’t burn.

, Once the potatoes have cooked for at least 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Use a spatula to carefully lift them off the sheet, and place them on a decorative platter for serving."

, After you’ve covered the potatoes with water, add a generous amount of Kosher salt to the pot to season the water. Heat the pot on high to bring it to a boil, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.If you’re trying to limit your sodium intake, you can omit the salt.

, Once the potatoes come to a boil, allow them to cook for another 10 minutes so they become completely tender. You can test their doneness by piercing them with a sharp knife or cake tester.Be careful not to boil the potatoes too long. If they’re too soft when you smash them, they’ll probably fall apart.

, When the potatoes are finished boiling, pour them into a colander in the sink to drain the water. Allow them to cool and dry for 5 to 10 minutes., Once the potatoes have cooled, set them out on a cookie sheet. Use a heavy pan or clean hand to crush each potato individually so it’s approximately ½-inch thick (5-cm). Repeat the process with all of the potatoes.Be sure to keep the potatoes as intact as possible when you crush them.

, Add ½ cup (118 ½ ml) of olive oil to a large, nonstick skillet. Turn the burner to medium, and allow it to heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute vegetable oil or even duck fat for the olive oil.

, Once the olive oil is hot, place as many potatoes as will fit in a single layer in the skillet. Allow them to fry for approximately 6 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden brown.It helps to use a spatula to transfer the potatoes to the pan so they don’t fall apart as you’re moving them.

, When the bottom of the potatoes are finished cooking, use a spatula to carefully flip them over. Allow them to cook until the other side is golden brown and crisp too, which should take another 5 minutes.If the oil seems to have cooked off, you can add a little more to the skillet before flipping the potatoes.

, Once the potatoes are cooked on both sides, use the spatula to lift them out of the skillet. Set them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain slightly., After you’ve removed the first batch of potatoes from the skillet, add a second group of potatoes. Repeat the entire process, adding olive oil to the pan when necessary.If you find that most of the potatoes are cool by the time that you finish the frying, place them on cookie sheet and warm in an oven that’s been preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit ( 204 degrees Celsius) for 6 minutes or until they’re heated through.

, When the potatoes have finished draining on the paper-towel lined plate, transfer them to a large bowl. Add 1 cup (100 g) of grated parmesan cheese. You can also add a ¼ cup (5 g) of minced chives, parsley, or tarragon if you like. Carefully toss the potatoes until they’re all coated with the cheese and herbs.You can substitute asiago or romano cheese.

, After you’ve tossed the potatoes with the cheese and herbs, add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. If you salted the water that you used to boil the potatoes, you may not need to add much salt because the cheese also provides some salty flavor., When the potatoes are properly seasoned, use a spatula to lift them out of the bowl and onto a platter.

Season as desired.,
Serve.",How to Make Sweet Potato Mash1," Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the sweet potatoes, then rinse the bare sweet potatoes with running water. Cut each one into 2-inch (5-cm) chunks.Since you'll be removing the skins from the sweet potatoes, there's no need to scrub them clean beforehand. A simple rinse after peeling the spuds should be enough to remove any residual dirt from the flesh.
Try to keep the pieces evenly sized to promote consistent cooking. If you cut the pieces much smaller than instructed, they may disintegrate. If you cut them too large, they will take longer to cook.;
, Place the cubed sweet potatoes in a large stockpot. Add enough cold water to cover them by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Place stockpot on the stove over medium-high heat. Bring the water to a boil, then cook the sweet potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes.Test the sweet potatoes for doneness by piercing one chunk with the tines of a fork. If the sweet potatoes are ready, the fork should slide into the chunk easily and nearly break it apart.

, Pour the contents of the stockpot through a colander to drain any water, then return the chunks of sweet potato to the pot.


Keep the stockpot on a heat-resistant surface but do not return it to the stove.
It's best to return the sweet potatoes to the empty stockpot than to place them in a separate bowl. The residual heat should help dry any remaining water lingering on the surface of the sweet potato chunks.

, Roughly mash the softened sweet potatoes using an electric hand mixer, immersion blender, potato masher, or fork. Add milk and butter, then continue mashing until combined.


If you prefer chunky sweet potato mash, use a fork or potato masher and limit the amount of milk and butter you add. In fact, you can omit the milk completely to make the mash as hearty as possible.On the other hand, if you prefer creamy sweet potato mash, you'll need to use an electric hand mixer or immersion blender. Add the full amount of milk and butter, and beat the sweet potatoes until smooth.

, Add your desired seasonings to the sweet potato mash. Stir well to incorporate the seasonings into the mash.


For basic sweet potato mash, add salt and pepper to taste, starting with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper and adjusting as needed.
For a conventionally sweet taste, stir in maple syrup, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.
If you prefer savory sweet potato mash, use salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder.
If you enjoy spicy foods, try mixing in a little chilli sauce with some cinnamon and nutmeg.

, The sweet potato mash is finished. Enjoy it while it's still hot.

Serve immediately.",How to Make Sweet Potato Mash2,", Rinse the sweet potatoes under cool, running water and use a vegetable brush to scrub away as much visible dirt as possible. Pierce each sweet potato several times using the tines of a fork.Do not peel the sweet potatoes during this step. You'll remove the skins after the spuds have finished baking.
Piercing the sweet potatoes should help regulate the distribution of heat, preventing the sweet potatoes from bursting while they cook. Try to make four to seven sets of piercings, and position the holes evenly around the entire spud.

, Place the sweet potatoes on your prepared baking sheet, then place the baking sheet into the preheated oven. Roast the sweet potatoes for 40 to 50 minutes.


When ready, a fork inserted into the center of the thickest sweet potato should glide all the way through without resistance. The sweet potatoes should also give a little when squeezed in the center.

, Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven. Set them aside for about 5 minutes, or until they are cool enough to safely handle with your bare hands.

, Cut a slit into skin of each sweet potato using a knife. Then, peel the entire skin away using your fingers.


When fully roasted, the skins of the sweet potatoes should loosen and peel away without much effort. You shouldn't need to use a vegetable peeler or knife. Work carefully, however, to avoid burning your hands.
If you have difficulty peeling the skins away, you can cut the sweet potatoes open lengthwise and use a spoon to dig out the flesh, leaving the skins behind.

, Place the flesh of the sweet potatoes in a large bowl. Lightly mash the sweet potatoes with a fork. Gradually add the milk and butter, working in small increments and mashing after each one. Stop when the mash reaches your desired consistency.


If you prefer chunky sweet potatoes, you should add very little (if any) milk and minimal butter, and continue mashing the spuds with a fork or potato masher.
If you prefer creamy mash, use the full amount of milk and butter and beat the sweet potatoes using an electric hand mixer or immersion blender., Add 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper, or adjust the amounts to fit your sense of taste. If you would prefer another flavor profile, however, skip the salt and pepper and add the appropriate set of seasonings instead.


Sweeten the mash with the conventional autumn flavors of maple syrup, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.
Try mixing in some salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder to create a more savory dish.
Spice things up by adding a few dashes of chilli sauce, along with some cinnamon and nutmeg to balance the flavor.

Note that you should not peel the sweet potatoes during this step, even though you'll eventually remove the skins before mashing the spuds.

, Prick each sweet potato several times using the tines of a fork. Position these prick holes around the entire sweet potato; do not restrict them to one side.


The piercing step is necessary because it regulates the distribution of heat throughout each sweet potato. If heat and steam build up in the sweet potatoes while they cook, they could burst and create a huge mess in your microwave.

, Microwave the sweet potatoes on full power for 5 minutes. Turn each one, then continue microwaving in 5-minute intervals until they feel tender.


Depending on the size of the sweet potatoes, you may need to microwave the entire batch for about 5 minutes per spud; for four sweet potatoes, that could be a full 20 minutes. It's best to continue microwaving in 5-minute or less intervals, however, to prevent the sweet potatoes from overcooking.
When ready, you should easily be able to pierce through the side of the thickest sweet potato and into its center. The sweet potatoes should also be easy the squeeze between your fingers.

, Let the sweet potatoes cool for a couple of minutes. When the sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice them in half lengthwise, then use a spoon the scrape out the flesh and transfer it into a large bowl., Gradually add the milk and butter, working in small increments, while simultaneously mashing the sweet potato flesh with a fork or potato masher. Continue until the mash reaches your desired consistency.


For chunky sweet potatoes, add minimal milk and butter, and mash the sweet potatoes using a potato masher or fork.For smooth and creamy sweet potatoes, add the full amount of milk and butter, and use an electric hand mixer or immersion blender to create the mash.

, Choose which flavor profile you'd like to try, then add the appropriate seasonings. Mash or stir until the seasoning mix into the sweet potatoes.


Keep things simple with standard salt and pepper. Use approximately 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper, or adjust these amounts to taste.
Try something sweet by adding a little maple syrup. Pair this flavor with cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.
Add paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the mash if you'd like to accent the savory side of sweet potatoes.
Mix in some chilli sauce with a little cinnamon and nutmeg to create something with a spicy kick.

Soak wood chips in water.,
Fuel the smoker.,
Preheat the smoker to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius).Light the coals or turn on the heat source.,
Prick each potato.,
Season well.,
Place the chips in your smoker.,
Place the potatoes directly on the smoker rack.,
Cook for 1 hour.,
Serve warm.",How to Smoke Potatoes1," Place 2 cups (500 ml) of untreated wood chips in a large bowl and cover them with water. Allow the chips to soak for 30 minutes.


Mesquite and alder wood chips are recommended for use with this recipe.
Note that this step does not need to be done if you are using pre-soaked wood chips.;
, Fill the smoker with the appropriate fuel. The exact source of fuel will vary depending on the type of smoker you have.


For a charcoal smoker, fill the charcoal tray with an even layer of coals.
For a gas smoker, attach an appropriately sized propane tank.
For an electrical smoker, plug the power supply into an outlet.

, After the smoker achieves a high and steady heat, reduce the heat to about 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius).


Open the air vents when you start preheating the smoker. Allow the smoker to heat up for 20 to 30 minutes, at which point it will be about 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).
Turn the air vents so that they are almost completely closed. This should cause the temperature to drop. Watch the thermometer and wait until it drops between 250 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit (130 and 135 degrees Celsius).

, Stab each potato with a metal fork 8 to 12 times, spacing the marks evenly around the surface of the potato.


This step should be done while the smoker is preheating.
Piercing the skin of the potato allows steam to escape from the spud during the cooking process. While rare, potatoes can theoretically explode while being cooked if the skin is left intact.

, Brush or rub the melted butter evenly over each potato. Season well with salt and pepper.


Use enough butter to coat the entire surface of each potato.
The salt and pepper amounts provided here are only estimates. You can actually use as much salt and pepper as desired.

, Spread the soaked wood chips over the bottom of the smoker.


If you removed the rack when fueling the smoker, return the rack to its appropriate position now.
When using a gas smoker, it is recommended that you place the wood chips in a foil packet instead of laying them directly on the bottom of the appliance. Use a fork to poke holes in the top of the packet six to eight times, then place the packet near the heat source.
Wait until the wood chips begin to smoke before proceeding.

, Once the smoker and potatoes are all ready, carefully arrange the potatoes over the smoker rack.


Keep the potatoes in a single layer and try to keep at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between them. Better air flow will result in better, more even cooking.

, Close the smoker and smoke the potatoes for roughly 60 minutes.


The vents should be partially closed while you smoke the potatoes.
When ready, the potatoes should have the same tender consistency as a baked or microwaved potato. They should ""give"" a little when squeezed without completely falling apart.

, Remove the finished potatoes from the smoker and serve within several minutes.


Enjoy the smoked potato in the same way you would enjoy a baked potato. Slice it open and add butter, sour cream, cheese, chives, bacon, or any other desired toppings.

Soak the wood chips.,
Separate the coals.,
Light a fire.,
Prick each potato with a fork.,
Season with butter, salt, and pepper.,
Add wood chips to the coals.,
Place the potatoes on the grill grate.,
Smoke the potatoes until soft.,
Serve warm.",How to Smoke Potatoes2," Cover 2 cups (500 ml) of untreated wood chips with water. Keep the chips submerged for 30 minutes.


Mesquite chips work well with potatoes, but alder wood chips are another good choice.
This step is only necessary if you are using dry wood chips. Pre-soaked chips do not need to be soaked a second time.

, Create two even piles of charcoal on either side of the grill. Separate the two piles by placing a foil drip pan in the center of the grill.


You will likely need to remove the grill grate while filling the grill with coal. After putting everything in place, return the grate to its proper position.

, Use a lighter to start both piles of charcoal on fire. Allow the charcoal to burn down until it is covered by white ash.You may need to sprinkle the coals with lighter fluid before setting them on fire.
It can take 10 to 20 minutes for the coals to burn down significantly enough. Prepare the potatoes as you wait.

, Use a metal fork to pierce the skin of each potato 8 to 12 times. Space the piercings evenly around the entire potato.


You should do this step while the fire is burning down.
Piercing the skin of each potato allows steam to escape from inside the potatoes during the cooking process.

, Brush the skin of each potato with enough melted butter to completely coat the surface. Generously season with salt and pepper, if desired.


The salt and pepper amounts can be altered to suit your own tastes.

, Once the potatoes are ready and the coals have burned enough for ash to form, evenly spread your soaked wood chips over the surface of your charcoal piles.


You'll need to spread about 1 cup (250 ml) of wood chips over each separate pile.
You do not need to spread any wood chips over the drip tray.

, Position the potatoes over the center of the grill grate. Keep each potato over the drip tray and not over either pile of coals.


The potatoes must also be arranged in a single layer with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space separating them. Both precautions will allow for more even cooking.

, Cover the grill and smoke the potatoes without turning for 60 to 75 minutes.


Check the potatoes after the first hour. If they are not sufficiently tender, add 12 fresh coals and 1/2 cup (125 ml) pre-soaked wood chips per side, then continue cooking.When ready, the potatoes should be soft enough to squeeze and pierce with a metal skewer. The consistency should be similar to that of a baked potato.

, Take the cooked potatoes off the grill and serve them within a few minutes.


Smoked potatoes can be served in the same way as baked potatoes. Split each potato open and cover with the toppings of your choice. Popular options include butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, and green onions.

Prepare the potatoes.,
Place the potatoes on the grill.,
Cover and smoke until tender.,
Serve warm.",How to Smoke Potatoes3," If you plan to use wood chips with your gas grill, submerge 2 cups (500 ml) in a bowl of water. Let the chips soak for 30 minutes.


Only use wood chips if your grill has a separate smoker box or smoker pouch. Do not worry about wood chips if your grill does not have a smoker attachment.
Only use untreated wood chips.
If using pre-soaked wood chips instead of dry ones, you can skip this step.
Mesquite and alder wood chips are both good choices for smoked potatoes.

, Turn on all the burners of your grill, setting them to high heat. Wait until the burners are fully preheated before continuing.


If there is no light or indicator to let you know when the burners have preheated, wait at least 10 minutes before moving onto the next step.

, Switch off the center burners, then place a drip pan in the center of the grill over the burners you just turned off.If your grill only has two burners, turn one off and place a drip pan over that burner.

, Reduce the heat of the remaining burners to medium or medium-low. Wait approximately 10 minutes for the temperature inside the grill to drop.


If the grill has a thermometer inside or on the lid, wait for the internal temperature to read 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius) before proceeding.

, If your grill has a smoker attachment, fill it with your soaked wood chips now.


Continue preheating the grill until you see smoke coming from the attachment.

, Pierce each potato several times with a metal fork, the season with melted butter, salt, and pepper.


Pierce each potato 8 to 12 times, spacing the holes evenly around the surface. Doing this lets steam and pressure escape from the potato during the cooking process.
Brush enough melted butter over each potato to completely coat the surface.
Use as much salt and pepper as desired to satisfy your own tastes.

, Arrange the prepared potatoes over the drip tray placed in your prepared grill, keeping them in a single layer.


Try to keep 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them, if not more. Good air circulation will result in better cooking.
The potatoes must be over the drip tray regardless of whether that tray is in the center of the grill or along one side.

, Cover the grill and smoke the potatoes for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.


You do not need to turn the potatoes as they cook.
When ready, the potatoes should be roughly the same consistency as a baked potato. You should be able to squeeze the center with your fingers, but the potato should not completely fall apart when you do so. You should also be able to easily pierce the potato with a metal skewer.

, Remove the smoked potatoes from your grill. Let them cool slightly for 2 to 5 minutes, then serve and enjoy.


Serve smoked potatoes like you would serve baked potatoes. Slice each potato open and add butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, green onions, or any other toppings you may desire.

Pour extra-virgin olive oil into a skillet.,
Sautee vegetables and/or fruit.,
Add meat.,
Mix in latkes.,
Add eggs.",How to Use Leftover Latkes1," Use one tablespoon of oil in a medium or large pan over medium heat. Once the oil has begun to warm, it will look shinier and begin to spread. Lift the pan from the heat and swirl the pan around horizontally. You should have enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.The oil shouldn’t smoke or burn. If it does, turn the heat down a bit.;
, Think about what you would like in your breakfast scramble. Cook the fruit or vegetables for five to seven minutes, or until softened. Produce will shrink down a little bit, but aim for bite-sized chunks when you chop fruit or veggies to add to your scramble.The oil should be warm enough that the food you place on it sizzles. If not, turn up the heat a bit.
You may want to add white onions or green onions. Other vegetables to consider are kale or spinach. Fruit, such as apple, strawberries, blueberries or banana can add an interesting twist.

, If you want to add meat, cook it completely in a separate pan first. For example, make breakfast sausage or bacon. Cut up meat into bite-sized pieces. Transfer the meat only (not the grease) into the skillet with your vegetables, once the produce has become soft.


If you’re making bacon, you may want to absorb some of the grease before adding it to your scramble. Place the bacon aside on a paper towel-lined plate. Press a paper towel on top of the bacon strips. Let it sit for a few minutes.

, Tear them into bite-sized chunks and put them into the skillet. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to stir the contents. Then push the mixed contents around so that there are several empty pits, one for each egg you want to use., Crack one egg into each “pit” you created. Cover the skillet and allow the eggs to cook, until you’re satisfied with their consistency.

Cook the gnocchi.,
Serve the gnocchi.",How to Turn Mashed Potatoes Into Gnocchi," You'll need 2 cups (650 g) of prepared mashed potatoes. You'll have an easier time rolling out the gnocchi dough if the mashed potatoes are at room temperature. You should also run the mashed potatoes through a strainer if they seem lumpy.Avoid using mashed potatoes that have bits of the potato peel in them.
You can use garlic mashed potatoes for a slightly flavored potato gnocchi.;
, Clear a large space on your counter to combine the dough. You'll also roll out the dough on this space, so it should be large enough to comfortably make the gnocchi. Put 1/2 cup (62 g) of the flour onto the counter. You can spread the flour out to about a 12-inch (30.5 cm) circle.You can use plain or all-purpose flour for the potato gnocchi.

, Scoop the mashed potatoes directly onto the flour circle. You don't need to mix the flour and mashed potatoes at this point. Instead, scoop a little well in the center of the mashed potatoes so you can add the beaten egg.Don't worry if your work space gets a little messy or if the mashed potatoes fall over the flour. You'll soon be mixing the dough.

, Beat one egg in a small bowl with a whisk or fork. Pour the beaten egg into the mashed potato well and sprinkle it with 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup (62 g) of flour over the beaten egg.You may need additional flour when you roll out the dough, so keep your flour out.

, Use your hands to mix the flour, mashed potatoes, eggs, and salt together. Knead the dough so that it comes together. It should take you a few minutes to get the dough to come together into a ball. Sprinkle a little extra flour if the dough is too sticky to handle.If you don't want to use your hands for this step, you could use a bench scraper to mix it together.

, Use your hands to form the dough into a circle. Use the bench scraper or a sharp knife to cut the circle into four even pieces. If the dough is still sticky, you can dip the bench scraper or knife in flour in between cutting the slices. This will keep the dough from sticking to the blade.Dividing the dough will make it easier to roll out the gnocchi.

, Take one piece of the dough and roll it into a ball. Roll the ball into a log by rubbing your palms back and forth against the ball. The dough will roll into a long cylinder. Keep rolling the cylinder until it's about 3/4-inch (1.9 cm) in diameter. Repeat this for each piece of dough so you have four cylinders.Keep in mind that you'll need to move your palms along the cylinder so that it's even.

, Use your bench scraper or sharp knife to carefully cut each cylinder into pieces. The pieces should measure 3/4-inch (1.9) so that the gnocchi will be bite sized. Do this for each cylinder of dough.If you choose to adjust the size of the gnocchi, keep in mind that the recommended cooking time may be different.

, For the simplest shaping technique, just press the center of each piece with your thumb. This will make a basic indentation on each gnocchi. For another shaping method, you could roll each piece across the tines of a fork. This will give your gnocchi distinctive lines.Shaping the gnocchi will help the smooth gnocchi hold sauce.

, If you want to store the gnocchi for later, individually quick freeze the gnocchi. Sprinkle flour on a rimmed baking sheet and set the gnocchi on it. Place the sheet in the freezer and freeze them until they're completely hard. Remove the sheet and transfer the frozen gnocchi to a freezer-safe container.


You can freeze the gnocchi for up to one month. Don't bother defrosting the gnocchi when you're ready to cook them., Heat a five-quart pot of salted water on high. When the water boils, carefully add the potato gnocchi and stir them. Let the gnocchi boil until they're cooked. This should take about two minutes. Drain the gnocchi.The potato gnocchi will float when they're completely cooked.
If you're cooking frozen gnocchi, you may need to boil them for an extra minute.

, Potato gnocchi can be served simply with a little melted butter, salt, and pepper. Or heat your favorite marinara sauce to pour over the cooked potato gnocchi. You could also serve the gnocchi with:Creamy white sauce

Serve.",How to Prepare Mashed Potatoes1," After you wash the potatoes thoroughly under cool water, use a sharp knife or a potato peeler to peel off the skin. You can also keep the skin on Yukon Gold or red skin potatoes, if you like, but baking potatoes should be peeled., First, boil the water by itself, adding a pinch of salt. The pot should be large enough to comfortably hold the potatoes without crowding them. Once the water begins to boil, add the potatoes and cook them covered for 15-20 minutes, or until they are soft. To test them, put a fork in them and see if they are tender enough to slide right off the fork. When they're done, drain the water from the pot and transfer them to a plate., Begin to mash the potatoes and add 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml). of melted butter and 1/2 cup of milk along the way. This will make them taste richer and creamier and will make them easier to mash as well. A potato masher is ideal for mashing potatoes, but you can also use a large fork, a whisk, or a wooden spoon.


You can also mash potatoes with the following tools: a wire masher, a stainless steel masher, a ricer, or an electric mixer.

Do not mash potatoes with a food processor, or you'll end up with a gooey mess.

Substitute half and half for sour cream or cream cheese.",How to Prepare Make‐Ahead Potatoes1," Mashed potatoes are a staple for many holiday dinner parties, but they can be quite labour intensive. To prepare make-ahead mashed potatoes, thoroughly wash and then chop up 5 pounds of potatoes (serves 8 to 10 people). Try to make sure the pieces are approximately the same size. Place them in a pot on the stove top. Fill the pot with cold water until the potatoes are just covered. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat and let simmer for 15-20 minutes.Yukon gold and Russet potato varieties are the best for making mashed potatoes.Depending on your personal preference, you can peel the potatoes before cooking or leave the skin on.
When the potatoes are finished cooking, a sharp knife should be able to easily glide through the potatoes.;
, Approximately 5 minutes before the potatoes will finish cooking, slowly heat 1 cup (237 millilitres) of salted butter in one pan, and 2 cups (473 millilitres) of half-and-half in another pan. Make sure you heat them at a low temperature so that they do not burn.You can use salted or unsalted butter.
For a richer and creamier flavour, you can use full cream instead of half and half.

, When the potatoes are finished cooking, remove them from the heat and drain them in a colander in the sink. Return the drained potatoes to their original pot and mash them using a potato masher or ricer. Once mashed, add the heated butter first and stir in with a spoon. After the butter is absorbed, stir in the heated half and half.It may seem creamy at first, but the potatoes will absorb the dairy, resulting in creamy and delicious potatoes.

, If you are making your mashed potatoes a few days ahead of serving them, you can substitute the traditional half and half for sour cream or cream cheese. These thicker and creamier ingredients will help to keep the mashed potatoes moist for a longer period.Alternatively, you can try mashing them with traditional butter and cream and then add liquid to moisten them when reheating."

Refrigerate pre-made potatoes.,
Vacuum seal mashed potatoes.,
Freeze mashed potatoes.,
Keep mashed potatoes warm.",How to Prepare Make‐Ahead Potatoes2," Store pre-made potatoes in a refrigerator until you are ready to serve. Typically, mashed potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for anywhere from 24-48 hours without impacting the consistency and taste too much. If you store mashed potatoes for longer, they will likely dry out and the flavour will become more starchy.Let potatoes cool before storing them in the refrigerator.
Cover the potatoes with plastic wrap to keep them fresh. Push the plastic wrap against the surface of the mashed potatoes in order to prevent a film from developing.

, You can also store pre-made potatoes in a vacuum sealed pack to keep them fresh. Potatoes stored this way can last up to 48 hours without losing their quality. Once you have finished cooking your potatoes and have added all ingredients, vacuum seal the potatoes. This can be done using a special vacuum sealing device. If you do not have a vacuum sealer, you can still remove all of the air from a zipper-lock bag:Place the food in the zipper-lock bag and seal the bag, leaving a small opening at one end.Dip the bag into a tub of water. The water pressure will push any excess air out of the opening you left.
Before the bag is completely submerged, seal the bag and lift out of the water. Now the food is sealed in an airtight bag and can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer.

, Place mashed potatoes in plastic wrap in an airtight container or heavy duty freezer bags. Once frozen, potatoes can be stored indefinitely at a consistent temperature of zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).When you are ready to eat frozen potatoes, remove them from the freezer and thaw them in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Then re-heat them on the stove top or in the oven. Add extra dairy if they become watery., If you have decided to make the mashed potatoes a few hours before serving them, you will need to keep them warm. There are a few different ways that you can keep the mashed potatoes warm without drying them out.Place them in a slow cooker on the lowest heat/warm setting. Add extra dairy before serving if they have dried out.
Keep them in the pot you cooked them in and move them to the back of the stove. Place them over a pot of gently simmering water to keep them warm.
If you only need to keep them warm for a very short period of time, you can place them in a bowl and cover it with a towel until you are ready to serve.

Add more dairy before serving.,
Reheat mashed potatoes in the oven.,
Use an immersion circulator to heat potatoes.",How to Prepare Make‐Ahead Potatoes3," This will add extra moisture and will breathe new life into the potatoes. The best way to add dairy to the recipe is by heating cream or milk (depends on the recipe you are using) in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the cream or milk has come to a boil, add the pre-made mashed potatoes to the saucepan and mix into the cream or milk. The potatoes will warm up on the stove and the additional cream will give the potatoes a light and fluffy texture. Once heated, the potatoes are ready to serve.Place the potatoes in a serving dish.

, Remove the dish from the refrigerator and let them stand on the counter for approximately an hour. This will help to remove some of the chill from the potatoes before you heat them. Heat the casserole in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 20 to 30 minutes.Remove from the oven, let cool slightly for 15 minutes, and then serve.
Additional dairy is not necessary.

, If you have stored your potatoes in a vacuum-sealed pack, then you can reheat them using an immersion circulator. This method does not require the stove top or oven and can save you space for other items that you may be cooking. To use an immersion circulator, fill a pot with water, insert the device and set the temperature to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius). Place the vacuum-sealed potatoes into the pot and they will heat up nicely.When you are ready to serve, remove the sealed bag from the water, cut the bag open, and place the potatoes in a serving dish.
Additional dairy is not necessary.
Immersion circulators, such as the sous vide cooker, can be purchased for around $200 from any kitchen supply store.

, Wash 3 medium-sized sweet potatoes and use a sharp knife to slice each of them in half lengthwise. Put the sweet potato halves into a medium-sized bowl that you can place in the microwave. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water into the bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Poke a few holes in the plastic wrap, so steam can escape. Microwave the sweet potatoes on high for 5 minutes.Cooking the sweet potato halves in the microwave before roasting them cuts down on the roasting time.

, Carefully drain the hot water out of the bowl of sweet potatoes. Place each sweet potato half on a cutting board and carefully cut away the tips of the potatoes. Discard the tips. Cut each sweet potato half into 4 wedges and return them to the bowl.Cutting the wedges into uniform pieces will ensure that they cook evenly.

Roast sweet potatoes.",How to Parboil Potatoes," The ideal potato is firm and smooth. It's not sprouting and doesn't have any green coloration – this indicates that it is starting to produce toxins and could have an undesirable taste and even lead to headaches or diarrhea.Be wary of potatoes with soft spots or blemishes, too.


As for the type of potato, that's ultimately up to you. There are waxy potatoes, starchy potatoes, and all-purpose potatoes. Waxy potatoes (Rose Finn Apple, Russian Banana, Red Thumb) hold their shape better and are great for boiling or roasting. Starchy potatoes (Russet, Jewel Yam, Japanese Sweet Potato) are great for baking and frying.;
, Check to see if the recipe requires them peeled or unpeeled and peel them if needed.


If they don't need peeled, scrub them under running water until they're about as clean as they're going to get.
If they do need peeled, with your potato peeler or a sharp knife (be careful!), peel them above a bowl or the trash. This makes clean up a lot easier. Wash them after peeling for good measure.

, Potatoes take a long time to cook, hence why you're parboiling them, right? To make sure they all cook at the same rate, cut them to the same size. If some potatoes are larger than others, they may not be done at the same rate as the smaller ones.


And, in general, the smaller the potato, the quicker it'll cook. If you have really big potatoes, cut them into quarters just to cut down on your parboiling time.

, You want enough water to reach about 1"" (2 cm or so) above your potatoes. This way they'll all cook evenly.


Make sure your potatoes are clean and to size! You want to do them all at once, if possible, to make sure they're all the same level of doneness.

, Boil small to medium potatoes for approximately 7-10 minutes; boil larger potatoes for approximately 12-15 minutes.


Some people swear on bringing the potatoes to a boil and immediately turning it off, leaving the potatoes in the hot water on the hot burner. This method generally takes a solid 15 minutes, but is better for ensuring you don't overcook your potatoes.

, If you're not sure how ""done"" the potato is, stick a fork into it. Preferably there should be a cooked outer edge and a raw middle; the potato should still be firm and your fork should meet resistance after the initial edge lets it through easily


You can also take your knife to the edge of the potato. Do the edges come off all nice and fluffy-like? When you get to the center, is it whiter, harder, and clearly a bit uncooked? That's perfect.

, This stops the cooking immediately. They are now ready to be used as required in your recipe.


Parboiled potatoes will not keep for very long time – aim to use them within a day or two, at most. Keep them in the fridge in a bowl, not a plastic bag (this causes them to sweat, softening them).

, One of the best ways to use parboiled potatoes is for roasting. When your potatoes are parboiled and then roasted, you get this great, crispy outside and soft inside that satisfies all the taste buds.


If you're a fan of the crispy, try wikiHow's How to Make Extra Crispy Roast Potatoes recipe.

, Another reason for parboiling is that potatoes take so much longer to cook than other vegetables. With parboiled potatoes, you can throw them right in with the rest of your stir fry and it will all take roughly the same amount of time!

, A little-known secret for homemade potatoes? Parboil them first. Just like roasted potatoes, this makes them crispy in the right places and soft in others. Put down the frozen hash browns from your grocer's freezer and try making them yourself.

, In addition to regular ol' potatoes, sweet potatoes can be parboiled, too. In fact, any starchy vegetable can be parboiled, including carrots. Once you see the magic that is parboiling with potatoes, expand your repertoire with the rest of the starchy, root veggie family.

Swap in a sweet potato.,
Make a better baked potato.,
Decrease calories in traditional mashed potatoes.,
Make your own homemade french fries.,
Bake your own potato chips.,
Stuff your potatoes with healthier ingredients.",How to Prepare Healthy Potato Dishes1," Although many people go for the regular white baking potatoes, using a sweet potato can help increase the overall nutrition of your potato dishes.


These bright orange spuds tip the scales with over 100% over your daily recommended intake of Vitamin A.
Sweet potatoes are also higher in Vitamin B6, thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, and the carotenoid group of antioxidants. Plus, they're lower on the glycemic index compared to white potatoes.Don't like the sweet flavor of the sweet potato? Try purple potatoes. These brightly colored potatoes also have more nutritional benefits. They're high in the antioxidant group called anthocyanins which are known to be cancer fighting compounds.;
, Baked potatoes are actually quite healthy — especially when they don't contain a bunch of toppings. Be mindful of what you put on your baked potato to make them a healthy addition to your meal.


One trick you can do is to rub the outside of the potato skins with a little bit of olive oil before baking. This makes the skins crispy when they're served. You want to eat the skins of the potato, as this is where many of the nutrients (especially fiber) are.When topping your baked potato, there a couple of swaps you can do to keep the calories more moderate. Try using plain yogurt or greek yogurt instead of sour cream, a drizzle of heart-healthy olive oil instead or butter, and use smaller amounts of cheese.
You can add some more flavor by topping your potato with some minced scallions, chives or adding a sprinkling of ground pepper or smoked paprika.

, Mashed potatoes are one of the best potato dishes. However, they're typically very high in calories due to the cream and butter that is typically used to make them.Instead of full fat cream that's typically used for mashed potatoes, consider using 2% milk or fat-free half and half. You still add some creaminess to your potatoes but with fewer calories.
You can also add little bit of yogurt to add creaminess and a little tang. Butter is OK, but only add a tablespoon per serving or two to help keep the fat at a moderate level.
You may also want to consider adding roasted garlic. You can roast a whole head and squeeze the nutty, creamy cloves and mash them into the potatoes. This adds a ton of flavor and nuttiness with very little added calories.
Another way to decrease the calories and carbs in traditional mashed potatoes is by swapping out half of your potatoes for steamed cauliflower.

, French fries are another popular potato dish. But because they're deep fried, they can rack up calories.Try making french fries at home. You can bake or roast them with very little added fat which can help you control the calories. Plus, you can lightly coat them in heart healthy olive oil.
You can either make traditional fries by slicing a potato in thin strips or you could make potato wedges by slicing a potato into thicker wedge like pieces.
Coat your fries or wedges in a little olive oil, salt, pepper and any other spices you'd like. Bake or roast until cooked through and crispy.

, Crispy, crunchy and salty, potato chips are a delicious snack. But like french fries, these are typically fried and coated in a lot of salt.


Making your own potato chips at home can help you control not only the fat and calories, but also the total sodium. Like fries, you can also toss in olive oil for some heart healthy fats.
Slice potatoes very thin. You can use a knife or a mandolin for easy prep. Toss them with some olive oil and bake until crispy and slightly golden brown.
Once your potato chips are fully baked, sprinkle lightly with salt or other spices you enjoy.
For a fun twist, you can slice up both regular white potatoes, sweet potatoes and even purple potatoes for a colorful snack.

, Whether you're having a twice baked or a stuffed baked potato, be careful with the ingredients you choose. These stuffed spuds can top the scales with calories.Instead of filling potatoes with sour cream, cheese, bacon bits or other high-calorie toppings, consider switching your toppings and ingredients to something a little more nutritious.
Try loading up your stuffed potato with vegetables for a low calorie, high fiber addition. You can try tossing broccoli with low fat cheese, sautéed peppers and onions, steamed asparagus and ham, or spinach and artichokes.

Bake your potatoes.,
Try roasting your potatoes.,
Boil potatoes.,
Grill potatoes.,
Stir fry potatoes.",How to Prepare Healthy Potato Dishes2," Baking is a type of cooking method that doesn't require you to added calories to your foods. This helps you control the total calories of your meal.Baking cooks foods by circulating the hot dry air of your oven around the food.
For baked potatoes, you can just put the potatoes on the rack of your oven and bake until easily pierced with a fork.
You do not need to add any oil or added fats or seasonings to baked potatoes just to cook them. You only would add those when serving for extra flavor, or to add crispiness to the skin.

, Roasting is very similar to baking, but generally conducted a much higher temperatures. You can also control the amount of fat and total calories of your foods by roasting them.Roasting also uses the dry heat of your oven to cook foods thoroughly. However, the higher temperature promotes more browning and caramelization on the outside of the foods.
Roasting is great for potatoes since you're not adding much fat and the outsides of the potatoes become browned, crispy and much more flavorful.
For roasted potatoes, you will need to add a small amount of fat. A tablespoon or two of olive oil or canola oil will usually do the trick.

, A very common and quick method for cooking potatoes is boiling them. This cooking method requires no added fat.


Water or other flavorful liquid heats the potatoes and cooks them thoroughly without adding any extra calories.
Boiling potatoes can leave them bland — especially when boiled in water. Consider adding a little bit of salt or boiling them in a broth to help give your potatoes more flavor without any added calories.
Once you've cooked your potatoes thoroughly, you can use these low fat spuds in many dishes including mashed potatoes, potato salad or just served plain with some salt and pepper.

, Although grilling may not be the most traditional cooking method for potatoes, it's a creative way to cook them with little to no added calories. Plus, it'll give your potatoes a lot of great flavor.


Grilling uses direct heat, usually fairly high heat, to cook foods thoroughly.In addition, the parts of the food that come into contact with the grill get deeply caramelized or charred which adds a lot of great flavor to your foods.
Grilling does require a little added fat, but very minimal amounts. Tossing sliced potatoes with a little olive oil usually does the trick and gives you another chance to use a heart healthy fat.
To add even more flavor, with minimal calories, toss your potatoes in a marinade before grilling.

, Stir-frying is a traditional Asian method of cooking. Like the other cooking methods, stir-frying also requires little added fat and allows you to control the overall calories of your dish.Stir-frying works best when your pan is extremely hot. You only need to add a very small amount of oil to the pan. This method cooks foods extremely quickly as well.Cutting potatoes in small pieces or slices helps them cook quickly and all the way through if you're stir-frying. They'll get a nice crispy crust from this method of cooking as well.

Limit the dairy products.,
Use a limited amount of salt.,
Be wary of sweetened toppings.",How to Prepare Healthy Potato Dishes3," One of the main reasons potato dishes can be unhealthy or high in calories is the use of high calorie dairy products. Limit these to help make your potato dishes healthier.


Butter definitely pairs well with potatoes. But monitor how much you use as one tablespoon racks up 100 calories.Go for a drizzle of olive oil instead for some heart healthy fats.
Also beware of using too much cheese. 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar can end up to be an extra 110 calories.Try limiting how much cheese you use or consider sprinkling on some nutritional yeast for a low calorie, yet cheesy tasting alternative.
Sour cream is also another source of a lot of calories. Just two tablespoons is about 50 calories.Go for yogurt over the sour cream so you have the added benefit of extra protein.

, Many tasty potato dishes contain a lot of salt. Anything from french fries to potato chips or crispy potato skins can end up being quite high in sodium as well as calories or fat.If you're making your own homemade french fries or potato chips, be mindful of how much salt you add. Salt sticks well to the outside of ""just-cooked"" foods. Sprinkle on 1 teaspoon of salt for 4 servings of chips or fries.
You may also want to consider using some salt-free seasonings mixes or blends. They can add a lot of flavor without any of the sodium.
Another good seasoning option is a mix of smoked paprika or a dusting of cayenne pepper for a little smoky spice.

, Although many of your favorite potato dishes may have a salty, savory flavor, there are plenty of potato dishes that have a sweet flavor.


Holiday potato dishes especially, can be high in in sugar and calories (instead of the typical salt). Whether it's marshmallows or brown sugar, be wary of these sweet side dishes.
Calories in sweet potato casserole with marshmallows and brown sugar can get to over 400 calories per serving.Keep sweet toppings to a minimum. Use just a few marshmallows or a dusting of brown sugar instead of larger amounts to help minimize these sweet toppings.

Garnish and serve.",How to Make Twice Baked Potatoes," Turn your oven on to “bake” and set it to 400 degrees. As it is heating up, run through your ingredients to make sure you have everything you need. For an average serving of twice-baked potatoes, you’ll need 4-5 large russet potatoes, olive or canola oil, milk, butter, sour cream, bacon, sharp cheddar cheese and diced green onions.This recipe will serve approximately 8-10 people.
Use more potatoes and increase the amount of other ingredients proportionately to serve more people.;
, Start by washing the potatoes and removing any dark or bruised spots. Coat the outside of the potatoes with a liberal amount of olive or canola oil. Oiling the potatoes will allow them to cook faster, and will also make the skins crispy. Arrange the potatoes on a large baking sheet.The shells of twice-baked potatoes are packed with nutrients and can be eaten along with the rest of the potato, much like potato skins., Put the potatoes in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake them for one hour or slightly longer until they are cooked through. Since you’ll be scooping out the contents of the potatoes to make the filling, they’ll need to be done and slightly soft. The outside of the potatoes should give a little to the touch when they’re fully cooked.Larger potatoes will need to cook longer, whereas smaller potatoes will get done faster. For this reason, it’s better to test the potatoes by feel rather than simply timing them.
To make the best use of your time, begin cooking the bacon, shredding the cheese, dicing the onion or preparing other dishes as the potatoes are baking.

, After the potatoes have finished, take them out of the oven. Let them sit for a few minutes to cool until they’re ready to be handled. When the potatoes have cooled sufficiently, use a sharp kitchen knife to cut each of them in half lengthwise and place them back on the baking sheet, skin-side down.Each potato will produce 2 twice-baked potatoes after it’s been halved and stuffed.

, In a large mixing bowl, combine 4 tablespoons of butter, ½ cup of milk and ½ cup of sour cream. Stir these together until the butter has melted. Together, the dairy components will give the potatoes a creamy texture.You can add more butter or sour cream to taste, as long as you don’t use enough to change the consistency of the filling. Avoid using too much milk, as this can oversaturate the filling with liquid and make it soupy.

, Use a serving spoon to scrape the insides of the potatoes out into the mixing bowl. Try not to damage the skin, as you’ll be refilling them later. Use a potato masher or electric hand mixer to combine the potatoes with the dairy ingredients. For best results, the mixture should be blended but still slightly chunky.Leave a small amount of potato in the shells to ensure that they’re sturdy enough to withstand refilling and baking.
Mash the ingredients more thoroughly or use an electric mixer on a higher setting to give the potatoes a smoother consistency. Just don’t mix them too much, as this can cause the starches to separate and make them pasty., Take ½ to 1 full cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and add it to the potato mixture. Cook 4-6 strips of bacon and crumble them into the mixing bowl. Mash everything together again until the cheese has melted and the bacon pieces are evenly distributed throughout the filling.You can also use pre-cooked bacon bits if you’re in a pinch, but the flavor and texture may not be as good as freshly cooked bacon.
Set aside some cheese and bacon to add to the tops of the potatoes before baking them a second time, or simply grate or cook a little more.

, Add salt, cracked black pepper and/or seasoned salt or garlic powder to the filling mixture until it tastes the way you want. Be careful not to oversalt. The filling will be quite salty on its own due to the butter, bacon and cheese. Mix the ingredients together once more after seasoning.A little salt and pepper is all you’ll really need to season the filling. Otherwise, you risk overpowering and losing the flavor of the potato.

, Spoon the completed filling back into the potato shells. The potatoes should be full enough for the filling to rise above the edge of the shell. Repeat until each potato has been stuffed. Pack any leftover filling onto the top of the potatoes.You’ll likely have filling remaining after stuffing the potatoes. This is because adding the other ingredients changes the volume of the filling. Extra filling can be refrigerated or frozen to be used later, or simply eaten plain.

, As an optional step, keep a little bacon and cheese set aside to cover the potatoes before you put them back in the oven. As the potatoes bake, the toppings will form a crisp outer crust and their flavors will cook into the filling. Once the filling is done, additional toppings are up to your discretion—pile each potato with cheese and bacon to your heart’s content!, Reduce the temperature of the oven to 350 degrees. Place the potatoes back in the oven and let them bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until they’re heated through. Keep an eye on the potatoes as they bake. They likely won’t need to stay in the oven long since they have already been cooked.Sprinkling a little extra cheese on the top can also be a good indicator of when the potatoes are done. Once the cheese is melted and forms a crust on the potatoes, they’re ready to eat.

, Remove the potatoes from the oven. The outer shell and filling will be extremely hot, so let them sit for a couple minutes before serving. If you want, you can dice a fresh green onion and use it to garnish the potatoes for added zest and color. Dig in!Some people prefer to mix in the green onions with the other filling ingredients, although this can make them chewy if they bake too long and may not please picky eaters who don’t like onions.

Slice a shallow slice from the top of each cooked potato.,
Scoop.,
Add the stuffing of choice.",How to Make Stuffed Potatoes1," Do not overcook them or you'll be making mashed potatoes instead.


If microwaving the potatoes, pierce the skin of each potato with a fork first. This will prevent the skin from splitting.





;
, Use a sharp knife and slice in the direction away from you.

, Use a teaspoon to scoop out the potato flesh about two-thirds of the way down. Always leave enough potato to form a solid base and avoid taking so much out that the sides collapse.


Depending on the recipe, the scooped out flesh is often needed to form part of the stuffing, or it may be discarded if the stuffing is too filling already. If discarding the leftover potato, try to use it in another dish or as leftovers, so as not to waste it.







, Follow the recipe you've chosen to add stuffing in the right order. Most of the time you will be asked to reheat the entire potato so that it cooks completely and the stuffing is also properly cooked.

, Be aware that there is some debate about whether it’s sweet potatoes are safe to eat raw. Obviously, you can find plenty of recipes that include it online, so people presumably survive eating it long enough to write and rave about it. However, keep in mind that research on the subject suggests that regular, frequent consumption can have ill effects, so don’t make it a daily habit. Limit your intake to every once in a while.Avoid them entirely if you suffer from kidney stones, since raw sweet potatoes can make your condition worse."

",How to Make Twice Baked New Potatoes," First, preheat your oven to 425°F (218°C). While that heats up, wash all twelve potatoes with running water to remove any dirt or chemicals from the skins.Dry them with paper towels or a clean cloth when finished. Then poke each one with a fork a few times along one side.Poking holes through the skin and flesh enables the oven’s heat to reach the insides quicker. This helps cook the whole potato more evenly.;
, Coat them lightly with olive oil by spraying, drizzling, and/or rubbing it into the skins.Set them in a baking pan and place them in the oven. Set a timer for about 45 minutes. Bake until the flesh is tender, returning the pan to the oven for an additional ten to twenty minutes if needed.A longer baking time helps ensure that the flesh will be tender enough for you to scoop it out easily. Since you will be baking these twice, however, you can try removing them after 25 minutes or so if you’re pressed for time.If you are going to include bacon in your pulp, use this time to cook ½ pound (227 g) in a pan on the stovetop. Then chop or crumble the slices once they are cooked.

, Once the potatoes’ skins have grown a little crisp and the flesh tender, remove from heat. Let them sit for ten minutes or so. Allow them to cool down.You’re going to be handling them with your fingers next, so test them with your fingertip before moving on. Make sure they’ve cooled enough for you to hold without burning yourself.
Remember: you’re going to be baking these a second time once you’ve made your filling, so keep the oven on.

, While the potatoes are cooling, combine your other ingredients in a large mixing bowl. For a simple recipe with few ingredients, add ¾ cup (85 g) of shredded cheese, ½ cup (115 g) of sour cream, ⅓ cup of fresh minced chives (16 g), 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika. Stir them together until evenly mixed.If you’d like a more complex flavor, combine 1 cup (113 g) shredded cheese, ½ cup (115 g) of sour cream, 3 ounces (85 g) of cream cheese, ⅓ cup (53 g) of chopped scallions, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, 1 minced clove of garlic, ½ teaspoon of salt, ¼ to ½ teaspoon of pepper.Monterey Jack cheese is perhaps used the most often for twice-baked potatoes, but feel free to use provolone, Swiss, cheddar, or whatever else you have around or like the most.

, First, slice each one in half once they have all cooled off. Then use a spoon or melon baller to scoop out the insides. Add the scooped up flesh to your mixing bowl.Don’t scoop all of the flesh out of your potatoes, however. Leave enough in each half to form a bowl that is strong enough to stand on its own.
If one or more potatoes seem too small to split into two substantial halves, serve it “whole” instead. Choose one side to be the top and only slice enough off that so you can still scoop out the inside., Use a potato masher to combine the scooped-out flesh with the other ingredients in your mixing bowl. Alternately, you could use an electric mixer, but set the speed to “low” since the potatoes are pretty thick. A higher speed may fling chunks of potato right out of the bowl.If you’re making the bacon recipe, add your bacon bits and stir them in once you have combined the other ingredients., Now that your filling is done, spoon it back into your potato halves. Fill each one evenly, doming the top. If the potato halves are too rounded on the bottom to stand up straight, slice a little bit of the bottom off so it has a flatter base.When slicing off the bottom, be careful not to slice so much off that you cut away all the flesh, leaving an open hole at the bottom of your bowl. That said, it’s not the end of the world if this happens.

, If you shut the oven off, heat it back up to 425°F (218°C). Otherwise, place your potato halves back in your baking pan (or split them between two pans if you don’t have one large enough to fit them all). Set a timer for 15 minutes. Bake until the potatoes and filling turn light brown, leaving them in for another five minutes of so if needed., Once they’ve baked, crisscross the top of each half with more shreds of cheese if you’d like to dress it up a bit. Put them back in the oven for a couple more minutes to melt the new cheese. Then dust each half with more chives or scallions. Or, simply serve them up as is, straight out of the oven, and dig in!

, These vegetables will run you about a dollar, max.

, Begin by boiling two pots of water and pour one sliced potato into the boiling water. One bag of potatoes runs around $3.00, so one potato will cost about 25 cents, which is cheap for something that is really tasteful and filling.


You can use half of a red and half of a russet potato to create a better texture for the final product.

Allow it to boil and turn it down to simmer for 20 minutes.
Poke it with a fork to ensure it's done boiling--if the fork goes through easily then it's time to take it out!
Drain the potato and add in milk, butter, salt and pepper. You can now begin to mash them!



,,,


Don't leave the vegetables in for longer than eight minutes if you want to avoid the vegetables from becoming too mushy. The longer you boil the vegetables, the softer they will be.

,

Take a little salt and pepper and sprinkle it onto the steak.






Rub it into the meat to ensure better flavor. You can then flip the steak over and do the same thing to the other side.







, Then set your heat to high. The best way to cook steak is to sear it and seal in that flavor because you want all of the juices to stay in there. If you flip it more than once than all of the juice will come out and it will end up being a really dry steak.

, When the oil beings to pop it means it's time to put your steak on the pan. You'll be able to hear it sizzle.


To handle your meat, use a pair of tongs because if you pierce it with a fork the juices will be able to escape. One of the best tips to making a good steak is to keep all of the flavors locked in.







,


The best way to know how firm your steak should be is to touch your index finger and thumb together and to feel the firmness of your thumb mussel (right below your thumb). This would be the firmness needed for a rare steak.






Touch your thumb to your middle finger and test out the firmness of your thumb muscle to determine what a medium-rare steak should feel like.






Now touch your thumb to your ring finger and that's a medium steak.






If you put your thumb to your pinky finger you'll feel how a well-done steak should feel like.







, Don't give in to the alluring temptation and take it off too soon--allow the juices to sizzle and give the meat more flavor.

, Try a little bit of garlic powder, onion powder, and/or crushed red chilli

Boil the potatoes.,
Drain and mash the potatoes.,
Add a blend of garlic and olive oil.,
Slowly mix in olive oil and lemon juice.,
Serve warm or at room temperature.,
Try similar variations.",How to Make Skordalia1," People make skordalia from potatoes, bread, or nuts, with no version more authentic than another. People who prefer the potato version enjoy its smooth texture and fresher flavor.This recipe takes 25 to 35 minutes to make, significantly longer than other versions.
This version is gluten-free.;
, Scrub the potatoes under running water. Peel them and chop roughly into even pieces. Roughly 1–2 inch (2.5 to 5 cm) cubes are best for a quick cooking time.


The skin is easier to peel after boiling. Try this if you don't have a vegetable peeler.

, Place the potatoes in a pot of cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium. Continue cooking until a fork easily penetrates to the center of a potato piece, about 15 minutes for small cubes.


Starting the potato in cold water instead of hot cooks the potato more evenly, for a smoother texture., Drain the potatoes, but reserve ½ cup (120 mL) of the water for later.Mash the potatoes with a fork or potato ricer. Keep at it until the potatoes are as smooth as you can make it.


Never use a food processor or blender, which can make a gluey mess.If this happens, switch plans and cook potatoes au gratin instead., Puree garlic and half the olive oil in a blender, then stir it into the potatoes while they are still hot.If you don't have a blender, crush the garlic with a pestle, or mince it and scrape it repeatedly to form a paste.


A blender will create a silkier texture than a food processor., The skordalia base absorbs flavors quickly. It's best to mix these in a small portion at a time, tasting in between. The amounts in the recipe are suggested; go slowly so you can adjust to suit your preferences.Mix until well-combined, in this order:


Mix in more olive oil 15 mL (1 tbsp) at a time, until smooth. Mix in a pinch each of salt and pepper at the same time.
Mix in lemon juice 5 mL (1 tsp) at a time, tasting in between. Aim for a tart flavor without overpowering other flavors.
If the mixture is too thick, reheat the reserved potato water and stir it in a little at a time. Skordalia should be about the consistency of hummus.Mix in more salt and pepper if desired.

, Cover the skordalia and let it rest at room temperature for a couple minutes, then serve.Greek cooks often serve skordalia with fried fish or roasted beets.


For an attractive presentation, create a well in the skordalia using a spoon. Fill the well with olive oil and crushed garlic.

, These optional ingredients add pizazz to the skordalia. You can add them alone or in any combination:


Ground almonds or finely chopped walnuts add a rich flavor. Puree in olive oil before stirring into the mix. Save a little to sprinkle on top.
Vinegar can be added in place of the lemon juice, or in addition to it. Apple cider or red wine vinegar add the most flavor.
Top with chopped black olives, or fresh Italian parsley.

Serve.",How to Make Skordalia2," You can make skordalia in just a few minutes using this recipe, but it tends to be a little grainy. Since this base has less flavor than potatoes or nuts, some cooks enjoy how this skordalia shows off the garlic and vinegar flavors.


Unlike the potato version, this recipe never turns out too thick and gluey.

, White bread is the cheapest and most common option. You can use other types of bread if you like, but most of the flavor will come from the other ingredients.


Save the crusts for serving, if you plan on using skordalia as a dip.

, Drop a slice of bread in a small bowl of cold water and vinegar. Remove after a few seconds, and squeeze out the excess water by hand. Repeat for each slice.

, Toss the bread in a food processor or strong blender. Add garlic and half the olive oil. Pulse until evenly combined.


If you don't have a food processor, crush the garlic and combine all ingredients with a mortar and pestle or fork.

, Gradually add more oil and continue blending, until the mixture thickens.

, Many people enjoy skordalia as an appetizer dip for crusty bread. You can use the trimmed crusts from earlier, or serve with toasted pita.

Waxy potatoes such as red skinned and fingerling don’t get as crispy as other varieties.
Starchy potatoes such as russet and sweet potatoes are mildly crispy when roasted.
All-purpose potatoes such as Yukon Gold and purple potatoes get crispy on the outside but stay creamy on the inside.;
, Hold each potato under cold running water and scrub it with a soft vegetable brush. This will remove any dirt or debris on the skin of the potato.


Don’t use soap when washing vegetables.If you don’t have a vegetable brush, rub the potato vigorously while you rinse it.

, If your potato has a thick, fibrous skin, you may consider peeling it to improve the texture of the finished product. However, many people enjoy the texture of roasted potato skins and leave them on.


Alternatively, peel the potatoes and roast the skins separately for a crunchy, salty snack.Use a vegetable peeler to easily peel potatoes.

, The larger the pieces of potato, the longer the cooking time will be. If you’re trying to make a quick snack, cut the potatoes into small pieces. If you’re making a hearty side dish, cut the potatoes into larger chunks.


If you’re using small thin-skinned potatoes, you can leave them whole.
Larger, thick-skinned potatoes can be halved, quartered, or cubed.
Roast diced potatoes for a crunchy, salty hash.

, Many people decide that parboiling is a hassle and skip straight to the roasting. However, parboiled potatoes take less time to roast.Additionally, the potatoes will have a crispier skin and a creamier interior.When a vegetable is “parboiled,” it is softened but not completely cooked.
If your potato pieces are smaller than 1 x 1 inches (2.25 x 2.25 centimeters,) don’t parboil them. They may become overcooked.

, Choose a large, deep pot. Add the pieces of potatoes to the pot. Fill the pot with cold water until all of the potato pieces are submerged. Next, add a large pinch of salt and stir the mixture.If you don’t salt the water, the potatoes may taste bland.

, Place the pot on your stove over medium high heat. Allow the water to come to a boil and cook the potatoes in the water until they’re soft on the outside. The surface of the potato should flake easily, but it should be slightly difficult to pierce the potato with a fork.


Large pieces of potato need to boil for ten minutes.Small pieces should be boiled for five minutes., Place a large metal or plastic colander in your sink. Pour the potatoes and water into the colander, draining the potatoes. Let the hot potatoes cool to room temperature before seasoning and roasting them.


Once the potatoes have cooled, consider scoring the tops with a fork. This will help create a crunchy crust on the finished product.

, Set your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius.)Let your oven preheat for about ten minutes while you prepare the potatoes.


Some ovens indicate when they’re finished preheating by beeping. This may take more than ten minutes, depending on your oven.

, Place your potatoes in a large bowl. Drizzle them with your oil of choice and sprinkle on some seasonings. Use a large spoon to toss the potatoes, coating each piece completely. There are a variety of delicious seasoning options for roasted potatoes. For example:


Create an herbaceous rosemary seasoning by drizzling on 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of black pepper, and ½ teaspoon of dried crushed rosemary.Toss the potatoes with 4 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 ½ teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, and 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley.Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of garlic powder, ½ teaspoon of paprika, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper to make cheesy garlic potatoes., Spread the potatoes onto the baking pan in a single layer to allow each piece to become crispy.Line the pan with parchment paper or foil for easier cleanup.


For extra crispy potatoes, use a large metal roasting pan.
If you don’t have a metal roasting pan, use an oven-safe glass casserole pan or a cast-iron skillet.

, The cooking process will take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the potato pieces. Check the potatoes every ten minutes to see if they’re done cooking. Signs of a properly roasted potato include:


A crispy, golden-brown crust on the surfaceA fork can easily penetrate the potato
The potatoes smell buttery and fried

, Remove the potatoes from the oven and allow them to cool slightly. Transfer them to a serving dish and serve them immediately. Roasted potatoes are excellent side dishes that pair well with a variety of main courses. For example:


Serve roasted potatoes with leftover meatloaf.
Eat several vegetable sides with roasted potatoes for a hearty vegetarian dinner.
Dice leftover roasted potatoes and sprinkle them over a salad."

",How to Make Scalloped Potatoes," Use a vegetable peeler or sharp, small paring knife to peel the skin off the potatoes.


Use the tip of the utensil to dig out any black spots or eyes.
Only peel off a thin layer of potato. The idea is the remove just the skin, with as little of the flesh attached as possible.
This does not need to be perfect. A few small specks of skin can remain without loss to the flavor or quality of the dish.
You could skip this step and leave the skin on, if desired, but you will need to thoroughly scrub the skin with running water and a vegetable brush if you do so.;
, Rinse the peeled potatoes under cool running water, scrubbing them with your fingers to remove any dirt.


The majority of the dirt is on the skin, so with the skin removed, you will not need to spend as much time scrubbing the potatoes. Some dirt from the skin will likely get onto the potato flesh as you peel, though, making it important to rinse the potatoes before using them.
Pat the potatoes dry with clean paper towels.

, Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the potato widthwise into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) slices.


You could also use a mandoline to slice the potatoes into thin slices. To use a mandoline, rub the end of the potato against the blade to create a slice. Continue to pass each potato over the blade to finish slicing it up.

, Spray a 9-by-9-inch (23-by-23-cm) glass baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.


A 9-inch (23-cm) oval casserole dish may be used, instead.
If you do not have cooking spray, grease the dish with butter or shortening.
Spread the cooking spray, butter, or shortening around the pan using a clean paper towel to coat the dish completely.

, You should spread out about one-third of your sliced potatoes on the bottom of the dish.


The entire bottom should be covered.
The potatoes may overlap into more than one layer, but make sure that they are evenly distributed over the bottom of the dish.

, Evenly spread one-third of your heavy whipping cream over the potatoes in your baking dish.


You could use 35% cooking cream if you do not have whipping cream.
Slightly shake the dish from side to side after adding the cream to make sure that all the potatoes are coated.

, Sprinkle 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper, 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) parsley, and 1 tsp (5 ml) minced onion over the contents of the baking dish.


Distribute these seasonings as evenly as possible.
Note that you are essentially using half of your seasonings here.
If working with dried parsley instead of fresh, only use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml).

, Arrange another layer of sliced potatoes over the seasonings.


Make sure that the potatoes are evenly distributed.
Use roughly one-third of your potatoes, or half of the potatoes that are left.

, Pour another 1/2 cup (125 ml) of cream over the potatoes and add the remaining seasonings.


Give the dish a slight shake from side to side to evenly distribute the cream.

, Layer the remaining potatoes on in an even layer before pouring the remaining cream over them.


Give the dish one last gentle shake from side to side to settle the ingredients.

, The potatoes should be tender when pierced with a fork.


The top of the potatoes should also be slightly browned.
Leave the dish uncovered as it bakes.

, Remove the finished potatoes from the oven and only let cool for a couple of minutes before serving.

, Prepare a 9-inch (23-cm) baking dish by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.


You can use a square or oval dish.
If you do not have cooking spray, use butter or shortening.
Spread the baking spray, butter, or shortening around the dish using a clean paper towel to ensure that the dish is well coated.

, Add the butter to a medium skillet with high sides and heat over medium heat.


Wait until the butter is melted before proceeding to the next step.

, Add the onion to the melted butter and cook, stirring frequently, until it softens.


The onions may also begin to turn translucent, but they should not be allowed to brown or caramelize.
Use a spatula or mixing spoon to stir the onions as they cook.
Note that this should only take 2 minutes or so.

, Sprinkle the flour over the onions and whisk the ingredients together. Cook for 2 additional minutes.


Cooking the flour at this stage prevents the taste of the raw flour from affecting the taste of the sauce.
Evenly sprinkle the flour over the onions to minimize the risk of clumps forming.

, Whisk the milk into the skillet, combining it thoroughly with the onions and flour. Continue cooking until the sauce thickens and bubbles.


It should only take a few minutes for the sauce to thicken. Stir frequently with your whisk to check the texture and prevent the sauce from burning to the bottom of the pan.

, Remove the skillet from the heat and add the cheese. Use a mixing spoon to stir it into the sauce until it melts and distributes itself evenly.


Season with salt and pepper, if desired, mixing the seasonings into the sauce thoroughly.

, Place half of your sliced potatoes in the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with additional salt and pepper, if desired.


The potatoes will not be in a single layer, but the layers in the bottom of the dish should be even in order to ensure even cooking.

, Spoon half of your prepared sauce over the potatoes in the baking dish.


Spoon the sauce over the potatoes as evenly as possible.
Give the baking dish a slight shake from side to side to help settle the sauce in between the potato layers.

, Layer the remaining sliced potatoes over your sauce and pour the remaining sauce over them.


Both the potatoes and sauce should be distributed evenly.
Give the dish a slight shake from side to side to settle the contents.

, Evenly distribute the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) shredded cheese over the top of the dish.


You can use shredded or grated cheese. Grated cheese will melt into the sauce more, while shredded cheese will create a layer of cheese over the dish.
Cheddar cheese is a popular choice, but most other varieties will also work. For instance, you could use Parmesan cheese or a commercial blend of Mexican cheeses and spices.

, Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in your preheated oven until the potatoes are tender.


If you want the cheese to brown on top, remove the foil during the last 5 to 10 minutes.

, Let the potatoes cool for a couple of minutes after you pull them out of the oven, but serve them while still hot and bubbling.

, Toss the ingredients together in a 2-qt (2-L) glass casserole dish with a loose lid.


If desired, you can spray the dish with nonstick cooking spray first or wipe the bottom and sides down with butter to prevent the potatoes from sticking.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and salt until well-combined.


All-purpose flour works best for this recipe.
Use anywhere from 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) salt.

, Evenly sprinkle the flour mixture over the potato mixture in your microwave-safe dish. Toss the vegetables gently to coat them with the flour and salt.


You can use clean hands to toss the contents of the dish, but an easier and cleaner alternative is to use a fork to stir the ingredients together.

, Pour the milk over the potatoes in your dish, covering all the other ingredients evenly.


Give the dish a gentle shake from side to side in order to distribute the milk more evenly and settle the contents of the dish.

, When done, the potatoes should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.


Cover the dish with a loose lid or clean paper towel to prevent splattering. Do not use a tight lid.
Stir the contents of the dish every 5 minutes as the potatoes cook.
If the microwave does not have a rotating tray, turn the dish 180 degrees during the middle of the cooking time so that all sides cook evenly.

, Let the potatoes rest for 5 minutes after they finish cooking. Sprinkle the parsley and paprika over the finished potatoes and enjoy.

, Ham is a traditional pairing for scalloped potatoes. You can prepare a ham and scalloped potatoes casserole adding cooked slices or chunks of ham to a recipe for baked scalloped potatoes.

, If you love scalloped potatoes but have recently adopted a vegan lifestyle, or if you are cooking dinner for a vegan, you can create a vegan version of this dish using soy milk.

, Stovetop cooking is simpler, quicker, and makes your kitchen a little less warm. As a result, stovetop scalloped potatoes are a perfect option when you need a fast alternative.

, Scalloped potatoes and au gratin potatoes can be prepares in a slow cooker. The dish takes a long time to prepare when cooked this way but is remarkably simple.

, Once the potatoes are cooked through, take them off the stove. Place a colander in the sink, then pour the potatoes into it. Shake the colander gently to remove any excess water, then place the potatoes back into the pot.

, You can do this with a potato masher or with a fork. Keep mashing the potatoes until they are smooth. And lumps or clumps will end up clogging your piping bag., For extra flavor, add in some Parmesan cheese. Mix everything together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until evenly combined., Place a piping bag into a cup and fold down the top over the edge of the glass. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to scoop the mashed potato mixture into the bag. Tie off the top and snip off the bottom of the bag.If you want to, you can fit the piping bag with a large, round tip.
No piping bag? No problem. Fill a plastic bag with the potato mixture, tie off the end, then snip off the bottom corner.

, Fill a large skillet about 1inch (2.54 centimeters) deep with oil. Turn on the stove to medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat up to to 375°F (191°C)., Move the piping bag from center-out to create a tight spiral shape. Try to keep the spiral as flat as you can. The spiral will unravel slightly as they cook to form a looser spiral. You should be able to fit at least three spirals in your skillet., This should take about 2½ to 3 minutes.Once they turn golden, flip them over with a spatula, and cook them for a few more seconds., Use a spatula to transfer the spirals from the skillet to a paper towel. As they drain, you can make more spirals., You can serve them as they are, or you can garnish them further with salt and/or dried herbs. Eat them on their own, or serve them alongside your favorite fry dip, such as ketchup or mustard.

, Don't worry about making them perfectly smooth. You actually want there to be some lumps and clumps.

, Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined. Remember to go easy on the salt because the onion salt will already have added some saltiness.

, Do not add the other two eggs; you will be using them for coating the croquettes.

, You will need about ¼ cup (80 grams) for each croquette. Roll the croquettes into oval-shaped balls first, then lightly flatten them with your palm. You don't want them to be completely flat. They should be plump, but flat enough so that they don't roll around.

Consider frying the cooked pierogi.",How to Make Potato and Cheese Pierogi," You'll need to wash 1 1/2 pounds (675 g) of russet potatoes to remove any dirt. Peel the potatoes and discard the peels. Carefully cut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces and place them in a 4-quart saucepan.Avoid using waxy potatoes like Yukon golds which aren't as starchy as the russet potatoes.;
, Fill the saucepan with enough cold water to completely cover the pieces of potato. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let the potatoes bubble lightly. Simmer the potatoes for about 15 minutes. They should be tender if you poke them with a fork.For extra flavor, you can add a few pinches of salt to the water that you boil the potatoes in.

, Wear oven mitts and drain the water out of the saucepan. Place the potatoes back into the pan and turn the heat on medium. Let the potatoes cook for about three minutes so they dry out a little. Turn off the heat and use a potato masher to mash the potatoes in the pan. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a mixing bowl.The mashed potatoes should be completely smooth since it may be difficult to fill the pierogi with lumpy mashed potatoes.

, Melt 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter or olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot and the butter is melted, add 3 medium onions that are finely chopped. You should have about 3 3/4 cups of chopped onion. Saute the onions for about 15 to 20 minutes. They should become caramelized and soft. Divide the sauteed onions into two portions.Set aside one portion to use as a garnish for the cooked pierogi. The other portion will be mixed into the filling mixture.

, Add one portion of the sauteed onions into the mixing bowl with the mashed potatoes. Add 10 ounces (280 g) of crumbled farmer cheese along with 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Stir the mixture so the filling is combined. Set the mixture aside.The filling should be at room temperature before you use it to fill the pierogi dough.

, Place 7 cups (2 pounds or 875 g) of unbleached all-purpose flour into a large mixing bowl. Add 1/2 cup (113 g) of the butter into the mixing bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour. Keep rubbing it until the flour and butter feel sandy or crumbly.Use butter that's cold or it will be difficult to rub the butter into the flour.

, Measure out 2 cups (475 ml) of warm water. Pour 1 3/4 cups (415 ml) of the water into the flour and butter mixture. Use your fingers to stir the mixture until it starts to form a dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, stir in the remaining 1/4 of a cup (60 ml) of warm water one tablespoon at a time.The dough will look like a shaggy lump once it's ready to knead.

, Sprinkle a counter or work space with flour and place the shaggy dough on the counter. Use the palms of your hands to gently knead the dough. Knead it until it's smooth and stretchy. Keep in mind that the dough won't be completely smooth so don't overwork the dough or it will be tough.If you want to make the dough ahead of time, you can cover the dough with a dishtowel for up to one hour.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper onto a large baking sheet. Sprinkle flour over the parchment paper. Take the pierogi dough and divide it into six balls. Each ball should weigh about 8 ounces (225 g). Set one ball on your work space and keep the others covered with a clean dishtowel.


Each ball of dough should be about the size of an orange., Use a rolling pin to roll a ball of dough into a large circle that's 10 to 11-inches (25 to 28 cm) wide. The circle of dough should be 1/8-inch (3 mm) thick. Work with one ball of dough at a time so they don't dry out.You may need to sprinkle more flour over your work space if the dough starts to stick.

, Dip a 3-inch (7.5 cm) round cookie cutter into flour. Use the cutter to cut small circles out of the large circle of dough. Place the dough circles on your prepared baking sheet and sprinkle them with a little extra flour. Lay another sheet of parchment paper over the dough circles. Continue rolling, cutting, and stacking the circles of dough.Stacking the dough circles between parchment will keep the dough from drying out.

, Brush the extra flour off of a dough circle and place it in the palm of your hand. Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the potato cheese filling onto the center of the dough and fold the circle over the filling. It should make a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges of the circle to seal in the filling. Place the filled pierogi back on the baking sheet. Do this for all of the dough circles.Keep the filled pierogi covered with a clean dishtowel or plastic wrap while you fill the remaining pierogi.

, Turn the oven on to 175 degrees F (80 C) while you bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Once the water boils, add 10 to 12 pierogi to the pot and stir them to prevent sticking. Boil the pierogi for about one to two minutes. They should float to the top of the pot when they're cooked.If you refrigerated the pierogi, you may to boil them for an extra minute or two. If you froze the pierogi, they should boil for 7 to 10 minutes.

, Use a slotted spoon to scoop out the cooked pierogi from the pot of boiling water. Set the cooked pierogi on a warm plate and place them in the preheated oven. They'll stay warm while you boil the remaining pierogi. At this point, you can serve the boiled pierogi.Let the water come back to boiling before you add the next batch of pierogi to the pot. This will ensure they cook evenly.

, For soft dumpling-like pierogi, serve the pierogi after they've been boiled and drained. Melt 1/2 cup (113 g) of butter in a small saucepan or skillet over medium heat. Remove the warmed pierogi from the oven and sprinkle them with the sauteed onion that you reserved for the garnish. Pour the melted butter over the pierogi and season them with salt and pepper to taste.You can also serve the pierogi with a side of sour cream.

, For pierogi which a slight crunch, fry them in butter. Melt 4 tablespoons (56 g) of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 10 to 12 of the cooked and drained pierogi. Fry the pierogi for 4 to 5 minutes and then flip them over. Let them cook for another 4 to 5 minutes on the other side until they're crispy and golden brown. Repeat this for the remaining pierogi.You can also garnish the fried pierogi with the reserved onion and sour cream on the side.

, The smaller you chop up the potatoes the faster they will cook. However, larger chunks retain more moisture and have a texture similar to the inside of a baked potato with a crispy outside.

, You want finely minced garlic that is only a few millimeters thick.


You may substitute 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder if you don't have fresh garlic

, You want all of the potatoes to be well coated in the oil. As the oil heats up in the over it will fry the outside of the potato, getting it perfectly crispy.

, You don't want the potatoes to be stacked on one another or clumped together. Some overlap is fine, but use two sheets if you end up with 2-3 layers of potatoes overlapping.

, After 10-15 minutes, use a spatula to flip the potatoes, turning as many as you can onto a different side so that they cook evenly.

, The timing doesn't have to be exact, but you should try to flip the potatoes at least twice as they cook.

, The outside will be an inviting shade of golden brown. Using a fork, knife, or skewer, gently poke the side of a large potato. The fork should pass through the potato without much effort like it was a firm piece of butter.


This is usually after 25-30 minutes.

, Because they are so dense the potatoes will hold heat for a 5-10 minutes after coming out of the oven, so be sure to let them cool.

Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the potatoes into chunks, about 1-inch (2.5 cm) in size. Put them in a large pot.You can use other potatoes, like Yukon Golds, but they may not bind together as well in the waffles.;
, Fill the pot with cold water so that water completely covers the potato pieces. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low so that the water bubbles slightly. Simmer the potatoes until they're fork tender. Reserve a half of a cup (120 ml) of the water and drain the rest of the water out.Set the drained and cooked potatoes in a large mixing bowl.

, Pour ¼ cup (60 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil into a small skillet and turn the heat on to low. Peel and mince one small onion. When the oil heats up and shimmers, add the onion and saute it for about five minutes. It should soften and become translucent.You can omit the onion if you don't like the flavor or texture.

, Place the sauteed onions into the mixing bowl with the potatoes and pour in ⅔ cup (160 ml) of warm milk. Use a potato masher to combine the onions, milk and potatoes. Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the reserved water from the potatoes and keep mashing until the potatoes are smooth and almost runny. Taste the mashed potatoes and add salt and pepper to your liking.You want the mashed potatoes to be thinner than you'd usually serve on their own. This is because you'll be mixing in flour and eggs which will thicken the mashed potatoes.

, Crack two eggs into your mashed potatoes. Use a hand or electric mixer to beat the mixture on low speed until the eggs are completely incorporated. If you beat the eggs on a higher speed, they may fly out of the mixing bowl.The eggs will help bind the waffle ingredients together as they cook.

, You can easily crumble up about 1 cup of bacon and add it to the batter for a smoky, meaty flavor. You can also add grated cheddar cheese or chives for a loaded baked potato taste.You can replace up to 1/2 cup of the mashed potatoes with leftover stuffing.
You could use cooked and crumbled sausage instead of bacon.

, Place 1 cup (120 g) of all-purpose flour and 2 teaspoons of baking powder in a small mixing bowl. Whisk them together and pour the dry mixture over the mashed potato mixture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the dry ingredients into the mashed potatoes using a circular twisting motion with your wrist.If you overmix the mashed potato waffle batter, the waffles will be dense and chewy.

, Turn on your waffle iron and spray it with cooking or baking spray. If you don't plan on serving individual waffles immediately after they cook, turn your oven on to 200 degrees F (93 C) so you can keep them warm as you cook all the batter.You probably won't need to spray the waffle iron again, unless the waffles begin sticking.

, Once the waffle iron is ready to use, measure out 1/2 cup of batter and spoon it onto the center of the waffle iron. Use the back of a spoon to gently push the batter across the surface of the waffle iron. Close the lid and let the waffle cook until it's brown and crispy.Avoid opening the waffle iron while the waffle is cooking. This will prevent the waffle from crisping up. Instead, only check the waffle once steam is no longer coming out from the iron.

, You can serve the mashed potato waffles immediately after they come off of the waffle iron. If you need to make a batch of them before serving, lay them in a single layer on a rack in the preheated oven. Consider serving the mashed potato waffles with one of these toppings:Cranberry sauce

A crisp skinned baked potato starts with the correct potato. When properly cooked, a russet potato will have the crispest skin, in part due to the starch content of the potato. A red skinned potato will also gain a crispy skin when cooked correctly. Other potatoes can be baked but the skin won't be as crispy. Choose potatoes without blemishes or sprouts and those that are firm and hard to the touch.;
,

Potatoes should always be washed prior to cooking. Rinse the potato under running water and use a brush if there is dirt that is difficult to remove. Then dry the potatoes with paper towels.






Pierce the potatoes several times with a fork to allow the steam to escape. Then, coat the potatoes in a light coat of olive oil. The oil will not adhere to the potato as well if they are wet or damp. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper.







,


Baked potatoes will become crispiest when baked at a high heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the potatoes on a baking sheet or in a shallow pan so that they're not touching. Bake them for about 45 to 75 minutes, depending on the size of the potato.

,


Carefully remove the potatoes from the oven. Using a clean kitchen towel to protect your hands, carefully squeeze the potato. If the potato feels soft and yielding then it is done. If it still feels firm and hard then it requires more cooking time.

,


Slice the baked potato open and allow it to cool for 1 minute, then top it with your favorite toppings and enjoy your crispy skinned baked potato.

You can roll them in the foil and pinch the sides closed or fold the foil over them and fold the sides.

, Turn on your grill and adjust the heat to high. Spread your foil wrapped potatoes out over the grill. Place them close together and on the hottest part of the grill.


If you are cooking many potatoes, you can pile them in even thickness over the hottest part of the grill. This way, once the bottom row begins to char, it will be time to flip them.

, Close the grill lid and let the potatoes cook for 40 minutes. If cooking multiple rows of potatoes, flip half way through cooking time. When you first try this method, you might want to use slightly shorter cooking times and check the potatoes (unfold the foil with tongs; the steam will be hot enough to burn). If they are not fully cooked, rewrap them and grill for a few more minutes.


If they're too charred but not done in the middle, put them back on, away from the hottest part of the grill, and cover the grill.
The amount of heat and the size of the potatoes determine their cooking time. Generally, when grilled with the lid down, whole foil wrapped potatoes take 30 to 45 minutes to cook through.In the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, you can remove the potatoes from the foil and return them to the grill, unwrapped. This will brown the skins.

Remove from heat and season.",How to Cook Fingerling Potatoes1," First, wash your hands. Then use your thumbs and fingers to scrub the potatoes under running water. Only use water, never any sort of soap. Wash them even if you intend on peeling the skins, since your peeler may shift dirt and chemicals from the skin to the flesh when you peel unwashed potatoes., First, peel 1.5 lbs (680 g) of potatoes, if desired. Decide whether to serve them whole, halved, sliced, diced, or smashed. If you choose sliced, diced, or smashed, cut your fingerlings now with a clean knife. If you plan on serving them as halves, you can either halve them now or after boiling, when they are softer. Transfer to a pot when finished.For smashed potatoes, dice them up into small bits., Fill the pot with enough water to cover the potatoes. Place the pot on a burner. Set the burner to medium or high. Once the water starts to boil, lower the heat to simmer and let your fingerlings sit for ten minutes.If you enjoy potatoes with a vinegary taste, try substituting the water entirely with either white or malt vinegar. For a milder taste, use an equal mix of vinegar and water., After they have simmered for ten minutes, poke a potato with your knife. If the skin still offers resistance, let your fingerlings simmer for another minute and try again. Repeat until the knife slides smoothly through the skin and flesh without any difficulty., Turn off the burner. Hold a colander over the sink. Empty the pot into the colander slowly to avoid any splashback of scalding water. If you are going to serve them as halves but haven’t cut them in two yet, do so now. Combine 2 tablespoons of melted butter with your seasonings in a bowl, add your potatoes, and toss.If you are smashing your potatoes, either toss them in the bowl with the butter and seasonings in the bowl first or simply use your masher to mix them in. If you need more moisture, add butter, cream cheese, sour cream, and/or cream in a tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency."

For this recipe, new potatoes are already small enough to cook fully, so they do not need to be cut into smaller pieces.
If using red new potatoes, only scrub the skins with your fingers, not a vegetable brush. These skins are fairly thin, so scrubbing with a vegetable brush will cause the skins to flake off.

, Add these ingredients to the slow cooker and toss together to disperse evenly.


You may want to spray the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or use a special slow cooker liner before adding the ingredients. Otherwise, some of the cabbage and onion may stick to the bottom and sides of the appliance.

, Spread the potatoes out over the cabbage and onions in a single layer.


Season with salt and pepper, if desired.
Do not stir the contents of the slow cooker at this point.

, The cabbage should cook down completely and may even look brown. The potatoes should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.


Do not remove the lid as you cook the cabbage and potatoes. A slow cooker relies on the build-up of heat to cook the contents evenly. If you remove the lid too often during the cooking process, too much of this heat could escape, and the cooking time might be thrown off.

, Once done, spoon the cabbage and potatoes into individual cooking dishes and enjoy.

Sprinkle them with the seasoning of your choice, such as salt and pepper, ranch dressing powder, oregano, or garlic powder. Toss the pieces to coat., Cover the dish tightly with a lid or plastic wrap. Do not vent, as the steam trapped inside will cook and brown the potatoes. Microwave on high for 5-10 minutes., Starting at 5 minutes, check the potato pieces to see if they're cooked by piercing them with a fork. If you can pierce through the potato pieces effortlessly, they are done. If the pieces still seem hard and under-cooked, return them to the microwave and continue checking at 1 minute intervals.

",How to Cook a Potato in the Microwave3," Wash and dry a large potato, making sure to scrub the skin thoroughly. Place it in a microwaveable dish. Do not peel or pierce the potato.Russet potatoes work best, but other kinds of potatoes with thick skin are also good option (e.g. Yukon Gold, sweet potatoes).

, Cover the dish with plastic wrap, leaving a corner open. Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Remove, uncover, and check the potato to see if it's cooked. If not, continue microwaving for another minute and check again., Remove the potato from the microwave-safe dish with an oven mitt or kitchen tongs. Run it under cold water for 15 seconds to cool. Make a cut on the side of the potato and slowly remove the skin entirely., Place potato in a bowl and add a half cup (4 oz.) of milk, half cup (4 oz.) or sour cream or plain yogurt, and one tbsp. (0.5 oz.) of butter. Mash the potato using a masher or large fork, continuing until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.,"

Squeeze potatoes for firmness.,
Check for cuts and blemishes.,
Smell potatoes before buying them.,
Buy sprouting potatoes only if you're going to eat them immediately.,
Don’t buy wrinkled potatoes.,
Avoid potatoes with green skin.,
Don’t buy potatoes with darks spots or bruises.,
Pick starchy potatoes for dry or oil-based cooking.,
Go with waxy potatoes for steaming and boiling.,
Opt for an all-purpose potato when you don’t know what you need.,
Use new potatoes when you want to cook a whole potato.,
Choose russets for oil-based cooking methods.,
Transfer potatoes to a paper bag for storage.,
Store them in a dark place.,
Pick a slightly cool location for storage.,
Store them in a dry, ventilated location.",How to Choose Potatoes," The best potatoes are ones that are firm and that don’t give when you squeeze them. Getting soft is one of the first indications that a potato is going bad, so avoid potatoes that feel squishy or soft when you squeeze them.Although soft potatoes are safe to eat if you already have one at home, avoid buying them from the store unless you plan to cook them immediately.;
, Cuts and blemishes can lead to decay, and they can also provide a place where bacteria or mold can get into the potato. When choosing potatoes, turn them over and inspect all sides for gouges, dents, cuts, and other open spots in the skin.Potatoes with minor surface blemishes are safe to eat, as long as you cut away the affected area. You'll get more potato for your money if you buy potatoes that are clean, smooth, and unblemished.

, Because potatoes are grown in the ground, it’s normal and natural for them to smell faintly of soil. Before adding a potato to your cart, put it up to your nose and inhale.


Although potatoes should smell faintly of soil, the skin should be relatively clean and free of dirt., Potatoes that are growing eyes have started to sprout. While these are still safe to eat, they should be eaten right away. Don’t buy sprouting potatoes unless you're going to cook them within a day or two.


Before cooking, dig out any eyes that are growing from the potato with a spoon or cut them off with a knife., Wrinkles in a potato can be a sign of many things, including mishandling (which also leads to bruises), moisture loss, and the potatoes being stored in too warm a temperature.


Instead, look for potatoes that are smooth and plump., Potatoes grow underground, so if they're exposed to the sun, it means they're vulnerable to predators. To protect themselves, potatoes produce a chemical called solanine, which makes the potato taste bitter and unappealing. When eaten in large quantities, solanine can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, and hallucinations.


Potatoes with a shallow layer of green buildup are safe to eat, as long as you cut away the affected portions. You'll get more for your money if you avoid green potatoes., Dark spots and bruises should be cut away before a potato is eaten, so it’s best to buy potatoes that don’t have any such flaws. Turn the potato over in your hand and look for black spots, dark areas, and bruises that would have to be cut away.Bruising is typically a sign of rough handling, but dark spots can also be a sign of blight or fungal infection.

, Potatoes that are high in starch absorb lots of liquid, so they tend to fall apart in soups, stews, and when boiled. But they're great for dry cooking methods like baking and roasting, and oil-based cooking methods like frying. Starchy potatoes can also be mashed, and they pair well with butter, gravy, sour cream, and other sauces. Starchy potatoes include:Russets
Sweet potatoes
Idaho

, Waxy potatoes contain low amounts of starch. They don’t absorb liquid the way starchy potatoes do, so they don’t fall apart when boiled, steamed, or cooked in soups and stews. These are also great potatoes for potato salad, chowders, and casseroles, because they hold their shape when cooked. A few waxy, low-starch potato varieties are:Fingerlings
Yukon Gold (low to medium starch level)
Carola
LaRette
Austrian Crescent

, All-purpose potatoes contain medium amounts of starch, so they’ll absorb water when cooked but also hold their shape better than high-starch varieties. These potatoes can be steamed, boiled, baked, fried, and cooked in soups and stews, but they're ideal for gratin and roasting.Medium-starch all-purpose potatoes include:Goldilocks
Kennebec
Onaway
Elba
Red potatoes
Purple potatoes
All Blue

, New potatoes are potatoes that are harvested before they fully mature. They have a tender and thin skin, so they don’t need to be peeled before they're cooked. Because these potatoes are smaller and have a thinner skin, they're ideal for boiling or steaming whole.Once cooked, whole new potatoes are often tossed with butter, oil, and seasonings like salt, pepper, garlic, and herbs.
The term new potato can refer to any kind of potato, because “new” refers to the age and maturity of the potato, not the variety.

, When you eat French fries, most of the time they’ll be made with russet potatoes. This variety of potato works great with oil-based cooking methods like frying and sautéing. Other dishes where russets are ideal are:Hash browns
Latkes
Potato wedges

, Potatoes will last for several months when stored properly. The best way to store potatoes is in an open paper bag, or a paper bag with several holes punched into it. This allows the air to circulate and prevents moisture from building up inside the bag.Plastic bags are not recommended for storing potatoes, because they trap moisture and can lead to premature rotting.

, Potatoes that are exposed to the sun will begin to produce solanine, so it’s integral to keep potatoes in a dark location away from sunlight. Countertop storage is not recommended. Good places to keep potatoes include:Root cellars
Pantries
Cupboards
Closets
Cabinets

, The ideal temperature for storing potatoes is between 45 and 50 F (7 and 10 C).This is why root and cold cellars are best for potatoes, but dark pantries and cupboards will also work.


Do not store potatoes in the refrigerator, because the excessive cold will cause the starch to convert to sugar, changing the flavor of the potato.
Potatoes that are stored at room temperature will only last for one to two weeks, as opposed to two to three months.

, Moisture can cause potatoes to spoil quickly, so you need to find a dry location where they can be kept. A dry location that’s also cool, dark, and well-ventilated will prevent sprouting and early spoilage.For houses with wet basements, a cupboard or pantry will be more suitable for potatoes.

Keeping the potatoes whole (not peeled or cut) will prevent them from absorbing too much water. It will also help preserve their flavor and texture.;
, Depending on the size of the potatoes, this can take as little as 30 minutes to as long as 45 to 50 minutes. The potatoes are done if you can easily pierce them with a sharp knife or fork.

, You can leave the skins on, if you wish, or you can peel them off. To do this, simple hold a potato in a potholder, then use a paring knife to pull the skin off; it should peel off easily., Heat the butter in one saucepan, and the milk in another. For extra flavor, add the remaining salt to the milk. You will be adding the butter first, then the milk. This will help improve the texture of the potatoes.

, You can do this using a potato masher directly in the pot you cooked them in. This will also help keep them warm and you won't have to clean as many dishes. If you find mashing them difficult, cut them into smaller pieces using a knife first.

, Keep stirring until the butter is mixed evenly throughout. Overtime, it will get absorbed into the potatoes. When that happens, you are ready for the milk.

, The potatoes will appear liquidy at first, but they will eventually soak in the milk. If you are concerned about this, however, you can pour in the milk a little bit at a time, and add more after the potatoes have finished absorbing it.

, At this point, you can add extra salt, pepper, and butter. For extra flavor, add 1 tablespoon of any of the following: chopped chives, fresh dill, garlic, paprika, fresh chopped parsley, fresh rosemary, or fresh thyme.If you choose to use dried dill, rosemary, or thyme, reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon; taste, and add more if needed.

, Transfer them into a serving dish, and serve them while they are still hot. If you have any leftovers, cover them, and store them in the fridge.

Select a good boiling potato.,
Always boil similar sized potatoes together to ensure even cooking.








",How to Boil Potatoes1," While it is possible to boil any potato you happen to have, some potatoes are better boiled than others (namely, the waxy ones), while some potatoes (namely, the floury ones) are not ideal for boiling and will often turn to mush. Knowing which potato to choose makes all the difference:









Choose waxy potatoes for boiling. Waxy potatoes have a high water content and a low starch content. This helps the potatoes to keep their shape. This is particularly useful if you're making potato salad.
Choose new potatoes (also known as chats) for boiling. New potatoes are lovely boiled, and they don't need to be cooked for too long.
Good potato choices for boiling: Bintje, Desirée (fair), Kennebec, Kipfler, chats (new potatoes), Nicola, Patrones, Pink Eye, (Red) Pontiac, Pink Fir Apple, Sebago (good rather than excellent), Sequoia etc.;

Preheat the oven to broil.,
Pierce the sweet potatoes with a fork.,
Microwave the sweet potatoes until mostly done.,
Cool and cut into slices.,
Arrange the slices onto the prepared baking sheet.,
Broil until golden.,
Serve while still hot.",How to Cook a Sweet Potato in the Oven2," Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.


When using the broiler, it is important that you prepare the baking sheet with foil rather than greasing it with nonstick cooking spray or oil. Due to the intensely high temperatures of the broiler, using excess oil can actually be a little dangerous, since the heat can actually cause the fat to smoke and, on rare occasions, even catch fire.
Most broilers only have “on” and “off” settings. If yours has “low” and “high” settings, however, switch it to the “low” setting.

, Use the prongs of a fork to pierce each sweet potato about 6 to 10 times, spacing the piercings apart in a relatively even manner.


Piercing the sweet potato allows more heat to penetrate the inside of the vegetable while also preventing pressure from building up inside.

, Place the sweet potatoes on a microwave-safe plate and cook for about 16 minutes, or 4 minutes for each potato.


Pause and turn the potatoes after each 4-minute mark to prevent them from cooking unevenly over overcooking.
When done, the sweet potatoes should be soft but not quite falling apart. If the sweet potatoes are soft enough to fall apart, you will not be able to cut them into clean slices before broiling them.

, Let the sweet potatoes cool for a few minutes, or until they have cooled enough to touch with your bare fingers. Cut each sweet potato into 1/4-inch (0.625-cm) slices.


You can cut the sweet potatoes into crosswise slices or lengthwise slices, but either way, you should try to aim for a thickness of 1/4 inch (0.625 cm).
You can peel the sweet potatoes with a paring knife or vegetable peeler if you are not a big fan of the skins, but the skins contain extra fiber and other nutrients, so it is actually healthier if you keep the skins on.

, Place even pats of butter over the slices and sprinkle the sugar on top.

, This should take about 5 to 8 minutes. The sweet potatoes should be golden-brown, and the sugar should be bubbling and gooey.


Keep the sweet potatoes about 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) away from the upper heat source of the oven.

, Let cool for a couple of minutes, just until you can touch the sweet potato slices with your bare skin. Enjoy while still warm and gooey.

Cut each sweet potato into cubes.,
Season with oil and spices.,
Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.,
Roast for 40 minutes.,
Serve immediately.",How to Cook a Sweet Potato in the Oven3," Prepare a baking sheet by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.


If desired, you could coat grease the baking sheet with a little oil or cover it with a sheet of nonstick aluminum foil instead of using the cooking spray.

, Use a sharp knife to cut each sweet potato into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices, and then cut each slice into 8 or 9 cubes.


The cubes should have sides that are roughly even in size, and each cube should be about the same size as the other cubes. The pieces need to be similarly sized so that they cook within approximately the same time frame.

, Place the sweet potato cubes in a large mixing bowl and drizzle the oil over them. Add the salt, pepper, and paprika (or cayenne pepper). Toss gently to coat the potatoes evenly.


The oil helps the spices stick to the sides of the sweet potato cubes. If the cubes still seem “dry” and the spices are not sticking well, you might need to try slowly adding a little more oil, adding no more than 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) at a time.

, Place the seasoned sweet potato cubes on your prepared baking sheet and spread them out into an even, single layer.

, When done, the edges should be golden brown and the centers should be tender and flavorful.


Use a spatula to turn the cubes after the first 30 minutes. Doing so will promote even cooking and even browning.
After the 20-minute mark, you should check on the sweet potatoes every 5 minutes or so. They can overcook and burn quickly, so if the edges start to look a little too dark before the full time is up, you will need to remove them from the oven early.

, Transfer the sweet potato chunks to a warmed serving dish and enjoy while still fresh and hot.

If desired, you could coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or grease it with a little oil instead of using foil.

, Use the prongs of a fork to pierce each sweet potato about 6 to 10 times, spacing the piercings apart in a relatively even manner.


Piercing the sweet potato allows more heat to penetrate the inside of the vegetable while also preventing pressure from building up inside.

, This should take about 75 minutes. The insides will need to be very soft.


With an oven mitt, gently squeeze the sides of the sweet potatoes. They should feel notably “soft” and should indent easily with the pressure of your fingers when done.

, Let the sweet potatoes cool enough to touch with your bare fingers. Use a sharp knife to slice a thin slice from the top of each potato and dig out most of the pulp with a metal spoon. Place this pulp in a mixing bowl.


The “top” in this instance should be taken from a long side, not from one of the short ends. Cut off a slice no bigger than 1/4 inch (0.625 cm).
Make sure that you do not accidentally strip away any skin from the sides of the sweet potato as you scoop out the pulp. You need enough skin to maintain the general “shell” form, but most of the pulp should be scooped out.

, Add the cream cheese to the sweet potato pulp and use a potato masher to mix them together until evenly blended.


For super-creamy sweet potatoes, use an electric mixer to quickly blend the sweet potatoes and cream cheese together instead of a standard potato masher.

, Stir the brown sugar and cinnamon into the mashed sweet potato until evenly blended.


Even if you used an electric mixer to mash the sweet potatoes, you should mix the sugar and cinnamon manually, using a fork or spoon.

, Place the mashed sweet potato back into the sweet potato skins, dividing it among the remaining skins evenly. Top with chopped pecans.

, Place the sweet potatoes back into the oven, still heated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.


Leave the dish uncovered so that the sweet potatoes and pecans both have a chance to turn a little more golden and more fragrant.

, Let the sweet potatoes cool for a minute or so but enjoy while still steaming hot and fresh from the oven.

Source your watercress from a farmer’s market or well-stocked supermarket to get all the health benefits and flavor this green has to offer.Fresh watercress is important, but don’t be tempted to pick wild cress. It may carry bacteria, or even liver flukes.If you can’t eat your watercress right after you get it, you can keep it fresh for a few days. Wrap it gently in a damp paper towel, seal the roll in a plastic bag, and refrigerate.;
, When you’re ready to eat your watercress, only the best leaves will do. Examine the stalks, and use kitchen shears to snip off dead or damaged leaves and stems. These will be yellow, brown, or shriveled-looking.Snap or snip off the tough lower parts of the stalks, as well., Hold the fresh leaves and stems under cold running water for a few seconds. This step is to rinse off dirt and potential contamination.Keeping the water cold is important, in order to avoid wilting the watercress before its time.

There’s no need to use soap to wash the greens--in fact, it might leave unpleasant residue on them., This step is optional, but if you’ve had your watercress for a couple of days and it seems a little floppy, you can perk it up. Fill a bowl with cold water and a couple of ice cubes, and place the leaves in it for 10-15 minutes. Remove the leaves, and dry them., Gently dry the cress leaves by patting them with paper towels or clean tea towels. Make sure not to apply too much pressure. It’s better to have slightly dewy cress than sad, crushed cress., The easiest way to celebrate the summery qualities of watercress is to base a salad around it. Use light dressings and toppings to avoid overwhelming its delicate texture and peppery taste.


Celebrate spring flavors with a watercress and shaved fennel salad.Use a large quantity of chopped watercress to perk up a potato salad. Make sure to fully cool the potatoes before you add the watercress, to keep the leaves from wilting., Watercress sandwiches are a famous dainty food, but you can think outside the box here--after all, you can put anything you can imagine on a sandwich. Stick to the classics, or experiment by using watercress in place of more traditional greens like lettuce or spinach.

Let cress steal the show in a classic tea sandwich. Spread two pieces of white bread thickly with your favorite butter, then pile on the watercress.Try cress in a a ham and cheddar sandwich, too! It may add an interesting dimension to an old favorite., If you’re making a summery pizza, watercress can make even more fresh-tasting. It pairs well with creamy cheeses like goat cheese or mozzarella. Toss the leaves on on in the last couple minutes of baking, or even after baking, to avoid overcooking them., If you’re eager for a cooked vegetable, you can very quickly wilt watercress. Saute it in a bit of good oil for just a minute or two. Don’t saute for any longer than that, or you’ll cook out the vitamins.Add salt, garlic, or pepper for flavor., If you’re making a broth-based soup, you can add a few handfuls of watercress at the end of the cooking time. Don’t let the soup sit too long on the heat after this, or it’ll go bitter. If you want something more creamy and blended that puts the cress flavor front and center, try a classic French veloute soup.."

Some people prefer to keep the skin on for added nutrients. This does make the blanching process a bit longer. However, if you prefer the skins, you can skip the peeling process.;
, You should dice your potatoes to blanch them, usually cutting them into small cubes. Depending on your recipe or preference, these cubes can be bigger or smaller. If you're making something like french fries, you should cut the potatoes into wedges rather than cubes.Use a sturdy knife and a large, wooden cutting board. Place your potato on the cutting board to start.
Slice it in half lengthwise, making sure the knife cuts all the way through the potato. Some potatoes may be slightly harder to cut, so do not hesitate to use some force.
Take each half, and cut it into thirds lengthwise, creating large wedges. From here, you can cut these wedges into cubes. If you're making french fries, you can simply blanch the wedges.

, Before adding the potatoes in the pot, it’s important to wash them to remove any starch. Get a colander and place the cut potatoes inside. Run the potatoes under water in the sink for a couple of minutes, until all potatoes have been thoroughly washed. If there are any bits of dirt or discoloration on the potatoes, make sure to wash them out.


You can usually just wash potatoes with running water. If you notice any stubborn bits of dirt or grime, you can rub these out with your hands. Just make sure to wash your hands beforehand.

, For blanching potatoes, you want to start with room temperature water. Pour some lukewarm tap water into a pot. Wait a few minutes for the water to reach room temperature.You can usually test the water just by placing your finger in it, although you should wash your hands first.
Lukewarm tap water is usually around room temperature, so it should not take long for your water to get to the right temperature to blanch potatoes.

, Take your sliced potatoes. Place them in the pot of room temperature water.For some vegetables, the water is salted prior to the blanching process. It is not necessary to salt water when blanching potatoes, however.

, Once the water begins to simmer, reduce the heat right away. You should avoid overcooking your potatoes during the blanching process, as this can cause them to burn easily when you cook them for a recipe. Lower the heat until the water is barely simmering. You will usually have to keep the stove at medium or low heat.Check your potatoes periodically. How long the process will take depends on how many potatoes you're blanching.
To avoid accidentally cooking the potatoes, err on the side of caution. Keep the stove more towards the low setting than the medium setting.

, You need to cool the potatoes in an ice bath after the simmering process. This will stop them from cooking, and can also preserve some of the color. Take a bowl big enough to fit all your potato slices. Fill it with water and add a few ice cubes until the water is chilly to the touch.As always, wash your hands before touching the cold water.

, It should take around 12 minutes for your potatoes to reach the right temperature. At this point, test them with a fork or knife.The potatoes should be soft on the exterior, but you should not be able to easily pass a fork or knife through the potatoes. The tip of the knife or fork should just barely go into the surface of the potato. If the fork or knife can cut through the potatoes with ease, the potatoes are cooked and not blanched. You will have to start the process over.

, If the potatoes are so hard you cannot get the tip of the fork or knife in, cook them for a couple more minutes and check again. Be vigilant about checking, however, as you do not want to accidentally cook the potatoes.

, Once the potatoes are blanched, strain them over the sink using a colander or strainer. Then, transfer the potatoes to the ice bath. Leave the potatoes in the ice bath until they're cool to the touch.Potatoes will cool quickly in the ice bath. Check them every few seconds and remove them as soon as they cool down adequately.

, Remove the potatoes from the ice bath, straining them over the sink using a colander or strainer. Set them out on a few pieces of paper towel and pat them dry., If you're using the potatoes right away, you can proceed right to the cooking process. Blanched potatoes should roast or fry quicker than regular potatoes. You can simply start cooking according to your recipe's instructions.Add spices to your potatoes. Potatoes can be a bit bland on their own, so experiment with different spices. You could go for spicy potatoes with something like cayenne pepper, or go for a savory taste with garlic salt.
You can purchase spice packets at your grocery store. You can, for example, by a cajun spice packet and pour this over the potatoes after cooking them.

, Blanching is often used prior to freezing vegetables to extend their shelf life. If you're freezing your potatoes, pack them into a sealable plastic container. Make sure to leave a half inch of space between the potatoes and the container's lid.You can also use a Ziplock bag. Just make sure to squeeze out as much air as you can.
For best results, freeze potatoes in a very cold freezer. This will help preserve them for the longest.

Wash the beets.,
Trim off the leaves and bottom tip.Use a sharp kitchen knife to slice off the majority of the leafy stem as well as the very tip of the lower root end.,
Cut large beets in half.Most beets do not need to be cut, but if you want to speed up the cooking time for extra large beets, consider cutting them in half from top to bottom using your sharp kitchen knife.,
Consider wrapping whole beets in foil.,
Preheat the oven.,
Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil.,
Place the beets on your baking sheet.,
Drizzle the beets with olive oil.,
Add salt and pepper, if desired.,
Cover the beets with more aluminum foil.,
Roast the beets for 50 to 60 minutes.,
Let the beets cool slightly.,
Rub the skin away.,
Slice and serve.,
Store beets for up to one week.",How to Roast Beets," Rinse the beets under running water, scrubbing them with a vegetable brush to remove any caked-on dirt.


Beets are a root vegetable, so they naturally have a lot of dirt and debris on them. You can scrub the surface with your fingers if you do not have a vegetable brush, but you must get as much dirt off as possible before continuing further in the cooking process.
Dry well before roasting the beets. Use paper towels to pat the beets dry.
You can use red or gold beets. Both can be roasted using the same procedure.;
,


Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of the leafy stems attached in order to make it easier to handle the beets.
The beet greens or leaves can be saved for salads and other recipes.
Only trim away the very bottom of the tip or tail. You can roast beets with the tips still attached, but removing them will make it easier to wrap the beets later when you roast them.

,


Note that smaller beets tend to be sweeter and more tender. If using smaller beets, use 6 small beets instead of 3 medium beets. You can also use larger beets, but the larger the beet is, the tougher the center will be.
Beets tend to range in diameter from 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm).

, You can also wrap entire beets in aluminum foil and roast them in the same baking sheet as smaller beet pieces. Put in some oil and herbs before sealing the foil packet closed., Set it to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).If you're using the oven for another dish, preheat according to that recipe and plan to roast the beets at the same time. The cooking time will change, but the beets will still roast fine, especially if the oven is between 350º and 450ºF (177 to 232ºC).

Beets that are cooked at higher temperatures are more likely to scorch, so you should check them more frequently as they roast.

, Choose a baking sheet with a shallow rim or lip to prevent olive oil or beet juice from oozing off the side.


For best results, use nonstick aluminum foil to prevent the beets from sticking.

, Line the beets up on the foil-covered baking sheet, spacing them apart evenly. Try to keep at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space in between each beet.


The beets will roast evenly enough even if they are not spaced apart, but leaving a little room in between the beets will allow you to wrap them more snugly with aluminum foil in a later step.

, Evenly distribute the olive oil over the tops of the beets. Use your hand to rub the oil over the surface of each beet, coating each beet completely.


You can technically roast beets even without the use of olive oil, but the oil prevents the beets from sticking to the foil and may also prevent them from scorching. Moreover, olive oil adds more dimension to the flavor of the beets.

, Salt and pepper are not necessary, but sprinkling a pinch of each over each beet can enhance the flavor of the vegetable.


More recipes call for the use of salt than pepper, even though both can be used. Salt is thought to draw out more of the natural flavors in food, so even if you decide to skip the pepper, you should still consider adding the salt.
If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to add, start with ¼ tsp (1.25 ml) salt and ⅛ tsp (0.6 ml) ground black pepper.

, Spread another sheet of aluminum foil over the beets and cover them tightly. Make sure to avoid gaps, since you want to trap in heat and moisture.


Use your hands to gently press the aluminum foil around the top of each beet, creating a snugger, more secure cover.
Using nonstick aluminum foil will prevent the foil from sticking to the beets as they roast.

, Cook the beets until tender, checking them by inserting a fork into the center of each beet. When the fork glides in easily, the beets are tender enough to remove from the oven.Check the beets every 20 minutes or so to make sure that they have not begun to scorch. If they show signs of scorching, drizzle 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water over each beet before returning them to the oven.
Large beets may need to cook for more than 1 hour. If a beet is not tender, return it to the oven and check again in 15 to 20 minutes. Some beets may need up to 2 hours to cook fully.

, The beets must be cool enough for you to handle with your hands.


Red beets have a tendency to stain, so you may want to wear food-grade plastic gloves when handling them. Only use food-grade gloves to prevent accidental contamination.

, Hold one beet with a paper towel. Scrub this beet with the edges of the paper towel until the skin peels and flakes off. Repeat with the other beets.


You can rub the skin away with your bare fingers just as easily as you can with a paper towel, but using a paper towel prevents the beets from staining your hands, especially if you cannot wear food-grade plastic gloves while peeling.
If desired, you could also peel the skin away using a small paring knife. Note, however, that skin which refuses to peel away easily could be a sign that the beets have not yet finished cooking. If the skin is notably difficult to peel, you should consider returning the beets to the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes.

, You can cut the roasted beets into slices or wedges depending on how you plan to eat them. Roasted beets can be added to other dishes or enjoyed on their own.


If slicing the beets, consider cutting them into slices that are 1/4 inch (mm) thick. This is an easy-to-manage size that works well with most dishes or when enjoyed alone.Goat cheese is a common accompaniment to roasted beets.
Other common accompaniments include sweet strawberries, orange segments, pine nuts, walnuts, and chopped mint leaves. These additions are especially popular if you end up adding your beets to a leafy green salad.
If you plan on using your beets in a salad, consider cutting them into wedges. For sandwiches, use slices. Beets enjoyed on their own can be cut either way.

, Any roasted beets you cannot eat immediately should be placed in an airtight container and stored in the refrigerator for 4 to 7 days.Roasted beets can be stored whole or in wedges and slices.
Use an airtight plastic container or plastic bag to store your beets. Note that roasted red beets can stain the container.

An alternate way to cut the yams is to wash and leave the peel on the yams. Slice the yams into medallions, as narrow or wide as desired.Eating the peel provides extra nutrients and aids in digestion.Just make sure to wash extremely well if you are going to eat the peeling.

, First, drizzle oil over the potatoes.If you do not want to cover the yams in oil, brush them with butter instead.Decide if you would like a sweeter dish or a savory dish, or a mixture of both.


For a sweeter dish, drizzle the yam chunks with honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Alternately, add brown or white sugar.
For a savory dish, sprinkle salt, pepper, and paprika over the yams.

, Place into the oven. Cook until tender, or the yams start to crinkle around the edges. Start testing the potatoes when they've been cooking for fifteen minutes.

, Since the peeling will be left on the yams, make sure to wash them thoroughly. Cut the yams into thin slices.


For potato wedges instead of fries, cut into eighths. The yams will be in long wedge shapes.

, Place fries into a large bowl or a plastic bag. Toss the fries with salt, pepper, and olive oil.


You can also season the fries with other spices. Try garlic, paprika, cumin, chili powder, curry, or seasoning salt in any combination.To make the fries as a paleo or clean eating dish, use coconut oil instead., Spread the fries on a baking sheet. Bake them for 20-30 minutes, turning them over at least once while baking. Depending on the oven, it may take more or less time. Bake them until the fries are crispy and golden brown.Don't place the fries too closely together or stack them too high. You want them to crisp up.

Serve and enjoy!",How to Roast Sweet Potatoes1," When buying sweet potatoes remember that they can be called both ""sweet potatoes"" and ""yams"" in the grocery store. Usually those called ""yams"" are have bright orange flesh and are sweet when roasted, while those called ""sweet potato"" are a starchier variety that has light yellow flesh.Garnet sweet potatoes, with their bright orange flesh and sweetness when cooked, are a great choice for roasting in pieces.;
, The skin is edible, but can be rough and fibrous, so if you are concerned with texture you should peel the skin off.







, The most important thing is to aim to make them all the same size. This will ensure that they'll cook evenly.









Thick wedges are a common shape, but there are no strict shape requirements. Many people enjoy making sweet potato fries by roasting sweet potato that has been cut into a thick julienne.
Small cubes will take a more caramelized flavor, as you will have more surface area exposed to the heat of the over. Thinner wedges can become crisp if cooked longer at a lower temperature.

, Add seasonings to either highlight the sweetness of the sweet potato or the savoriness of the sweet potato.









If you want to highlight the sweetness of the sweet potato dust them lightly with cinnamon or allspice and then mix them with the zest and juice of one orange (for four portion sized amounts). You can even add honey, brown sugar, sweet chili sauce or a similar glaze but they require a slightly lower temperature and more frequent checking to ensure the sugars don't burn.
If you want to highlight the savoriness of the sweet potato, add one clove of crushed garlic and one teaspoon of a combination of thyme and rosemary.

, Stir well to ensure that all pieces are coated evenly. Doing this will assure that their surface becomes nice and caramelized during the roasting process.








, If you have access to a good reliable non stick baking tray or metal casserole style pan, these are ideal.


Make sure it is large enough that most of the pieces are spread out and not on top of each other. This will allow for more browning of each piece.
Sweet potatoes contain a lot of sugar and water, so they're liable to stick to unlined trays.

, Remember that you need a baking tray which is large enough so the hot air can circulate around the separate pieces of potato (approx 1cm or 1/2 inch or a little more is fine). If they are too densely packed, they may go soggy and cook unevenly, but too far apart may make them become dry and leathery.

, After the first 15 minutes, turn them and move them around the tray so they roast evenly and develop a nice, even colour.

, Not all seasonings should go on before roasting. Lighter and fresher flavors should be added after cooking. For instance:


1 tablespoon (16 g) balsamic vinegar (or salad dressing) and salt and pepper, added just before serving.
Chopped fresh parsley or basil, chili and a sprinkling of lemon juice.

, Serve while still warm, along with other meal items, or add to another recipe.


Apart from serving them as they are, roasted sweet potatoes can also be used in in a variety ways: mashed and added into soups, stuffed in other vegetables or chicken, served with a rich gravy sauce or a stew, or used cold or warm in salads.

Peel the sweet potatoes.,
Cut the potatoes into chunks.,
Place the sweet potatoes in a steam tray.,
Boil the water.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Make Steamed Sweet Potatoes1," This is generally easiest to do with a conventional potato peeler. You can also use a sharp knife.


Throw the peelings into a compost bin to avoid waste. Better yet, cut the peels into long strips, leave a little flesh on them, and make sweet potato skins
;
, The exact size isn't important — cutting each potato into three or four slices is usually fine. What matters is that all the chunks are about the same size so that they cook evenly.

, Steaming the sweet potatoes means exposing them to hot steam without submerging them in the boiling water below them. To do this, first put your potato chunks into a steam tray, which is a metal device that sits in a pot above the boiling water. Put the full steam tray in a large pot with two cups of water at the bottom.


If you don't have a steam tray, you can improvise one from a small metal strainer. You can even put a clean cooking rack at the bottom of your pot.

, Put the pot + steam tray on the stove over high heat. Cover the pot. When the water reaches a strong boil, reduce the heat to medium. Let the potatoes cook this way until soft all the way through.


Depending on how big the sweet potato pieces are, cooking times will vary from about 15-20 minutes. A good policy is to check the potatoes for done-ness after about 12 minutes. You can do this by prodding them with a fork. If the fork slides in easily, the potato is cooked. If they still feel hard, cook for another 5 minutes.
Remove the pot lid carefully — the escaping steam can burn you.

, When the sweet potatoes are soft, they're ready to eat. Turn off the heat and transfer them to a serving plate. Serve immediately. Season as desired.


Sweet potatoes are (obviously) naturally sweet, so you can enjoy them as-is if you wish. In the next section, however, we've provided a few easy serving suggestions if you don't want to eat them plain.

Prepare the jars.",How to Pickle Cauliflower1," Place the florets in a colander and thoroughly rinse them under cool running water. Allow the excess water to drain off the cauliflower before proceeding.


You should also cut off any brown marks or undesirable blemishes using a sharp knife.

, Fill a stockpot halfway with water and boil the water over medium-high heat. Place the glass jars and lids you intend to use inside the boiling water to sanitize them.You will need one quart (liter) jar, two to three pint (half-liter) jars, or four to five half-pint (quarter-liter) jars for this process.
If you are canning the pickles instead of making refrigerator pickles, the canning jars you use will also have bands. Place the bands inside the boiling water, as well.
Remove the lids from the water after 30 seconds and let them dry on a clean kitchen towel on the counter.
Remove the jars and bands from the water after 10 minutes and let them air-dry on the same kitchen towel.

Peel the sweet potatoes.,
Use a sharp knife to cut the ends off your sweet potatoes.,
Cut the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise.,
Cut the halves into quarters.,
Slice the quarters into equal wedges.",How to Make Sweet Potato Fries1," Place the blade of a sharp knife or vegetable peeler at the top of on sweet potato and drag it down the length of the potato peeler, applying just enough even pressure to remove the skin. Continue peeling off strips of skin until the entire potato is skinless. Repeat with the other two potatoes.






;
, Do not cut off much; a small 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (1/2 to 1 1/4-centimeter) slice on both ends of a potato should suffice. Doing so will prevent your fries from having small, pointy tips, which is important because these little pointed tips tend to burn quickly and taste bad.









, Use a sharp knife to cut each sweet potato into two equal halves, cutting from the top tip to the bottom, leaving you with six halves.








, Use a sharp knife to cut each half in half crosswise, cutting from side to side instead of from top to bottom.








, Each wedge should ideally be around 1/4-inch (1/2-centimeter) thick and 1/4-inch (1/2-centimeter) wide, but the length of the wedges can vary depending on personal preference. Wedges between 3 and 4 inches (7 1/2 to 10 centimeters) in length are usually a pretty good size. Regardless of what you choose, however, try to keep the majority of your wedges uniform in size.









Note that you can also use a crinkle cut knife to produce crinkle cut sweet potato fries. Similarly, you can use a knife or mandolin to cut the sweet potatoes into disks.

Remove the sweet potatoes from oven and serve.",How to Roast Sweet Potatoes2," When shopping for sweet potatoes remember that they can be called both ""sweet potatoes"" and ""yams."" Usually those called ""yams"" are the variety that have bright orange flesh. These are sweet when cooked. Those usually called ""sweet potato,"" which are white on the inside, are a starchier variety that has light yellow flesh.Covington sweet potatoes, with their bright orange flesh and sweetness when cooked, are a great choice for roasting whole.The white variety of sweet potatoes are great in stews and soups, applications where sweetness is not of central concern.

, Use a small scrub brush to remove any dirt from the surface. Be sure to also remove any spots on the sweet potato that have gone bad with a small paring knife.

, This will allow steam to escape easily while it is roasted, assuring that the sweet potato does not burst open.

, If you have access to a good reliable non stick baking tray or metal casserole style pan, these are ideal.


Sweet potatoes contain a lot of sugar and water, so they're likely to stick to unlined trays.

, Sweet potatoes can stand up to a variety of temperatures, so if you are cooking something else, go ahead and put the potatoes in at a different temperature, just make sure to adjust your cooking time.

, If cooking at 350ºF, roast for about an hour. Check on the potatoes after about 45 minutes. Puncture the surface of the sweet potato with a fork. If it punctures easily, your sweet potato is done.

, Roasted whole sweet potatoes can be served just like a baked russet potato, simply sliced open with a pat of butter and salt and pepper. You can also peel the skins off (once they've cooled a bit) and mash them up with any number of seasonings.


In order to amp up the sweetness of mashed sweet potatoes, try adding just a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon, along with a pat of butter. This will make your mashed sweet potatoes into a delectable and snazzy side dish.

Eat with butter, salt, and pepper.,
Try savory garlic sweet potatoes.,
Cook with onion.,
Season with your favorite spices.",How to Make Steamed Sweet Potatoes2," This classic combination tastes just as good on sweet potatoes as it does on normal potatoes. It's not fancy, but it's always a fine choice.


If you wish, you can simply toss the potatoes with butter, salt, and pepper once they finish steaming. However, if you're dining with picky eaters, you may want to serve the potatoes plain with butter, salt, and pepper on the side so everyone can have as much as they want.

, Garlic may not seem like a good accompaniment for sweet potatoes, but its zesty flavor actually compliments the vegetable's smoothness well. Don't use too much, however, as it can overpower the mild flavors of sweet potatoes easily. Here's just one way to make a garlicky sweet potato dish:Steam the potatoes as normal.
Add olive oil, chopped garlic, and rosemary to a serving bowl with the potatoes. Stir well to combine and coat the potatoes evenly.
Garnish with ground pumpkin seeds for presentation.

, Onion is another savory vegetable that pairs well with sweet potatoes. Like garlic, it's something you won't want to add too much of or you risk overpowering the potatoes. For best results, use white, yellow, or sweet onions — red onions have a little less sugar, so they're less sweet.Adding onions to a sweet potato dish is easy: just chop half an onion into small bits and steam them in the pot along with the potatoes.

, Adding just the right spices to sweet potatoes can make them taste like a dessert without adding any extra calories. Sweet, pungent spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves tend to go best with sweet potatoes.


Sprinkle very lightly at first — you can always add more, but you can't take the spices off once you've already added them.

Toast the seeds.Place the mustard seed and celery seed in a medium saucepan and set the saucepan on the stove over medium heat.,
Add the vinegar and other seasonings.,
Pack the cauliflower in a jar.,
Pour in the hot liquid.,
Let cool.,
Refrigerate for a few days.,
Store in the refrigerator.",How to Pickle Cauliflower2," Toast the seeds for about 2 minutes, or until they are fragrant and lightly browned.


Swirl the pan or stir the seeds continuously to prevent the seeds from burning.
Toasting the seeds first draws out their natural flavor, thereby improving the taste of the dish overall.;
, Pour the vinegar into the saucepan, followed by the sugar, garlic, salt, peppercorns, turmeric, red pepper flakes, and water. Continue heating the contents of the saucepan until they reach a boil.


Once the solution reaches a boil, drop the heat to medium so that the solution simmers gently as you prepare the cauliflower florets. The solution needs to be hot when you add it, but it does not need to be at a rolling boil.

, Place the florets into a clean quart (liter) sized jar, packing them in as tightly as possible.


Any size jar will work for this method: quart (liter), pint (half-liter), or half-pint (quarter-liter). The jars do not need to have bands, but they do need to have tight lids.

, Pour the hot pickling solution over the cauliflower inside the jar. Make sure that the solution seeps all the way down to the bottom of the jar, and leave roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 ml) empty headspace at the top of each jar.


The headspace will prevent the glass from cracking or breaking as the liquid expands and contracts.

, Keep the jar on a counter or table until the solution drops down to room temperature. After the temperature drops, cover the jar securely with its lid.


Do not place the jar directly in the refrigerator. The glass will be hot after you pour the hot liquid in, and a sudden shift in temperature can cause the glass to crack.

, Place the jar inside your refrigerator and let the pickling solution do its work. The cauliflower should begin to absorb the flavors within a few hours, but for maximum flavor, leave the jar alone for two or three days., Store the sealed jar of pickled cauliflower in your refrigerator, taking what you need whenever you need it. When prepared in this manner, pickled cauliflower can last anywhere from two weeks to three months.

Store at room temperature.",How to Pickle Cauliflower3," Fill a large saucepan halfway with water. Bring it to a boil over high heat, then add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) canning salt to the water. Let it return to a boil before continuing.


You could add the salt to the water before it boils, but doing so will cause the water to reach a boil more slowly.
The salt will help draw out and enhance the natural flavor of the cauliflower.

, Add the cauliflower florets to the rapidly boiling water. Let them cook for 3 minutes, then immediately remove the pan from the heat source.


The cauliflower needs to soften slightly, but you do not want it to become completely tender.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a colander to drain the hot water. Rinse the cauliflower under cold running water for 1 to 2 minutes to cool the florets and stop the cooking process.


Alternatively, you can dump the drained cauliflower into a large bowl of ice water for 3 minutes to cool it down instead of rinsing it under cold running water. You will need to drain the ice water by pouring the contents of the bowl through a colander.

, Place the mustard seed and celery seed in a medium saucepan. Heat the spices over a medium setting on your stove, swirling the pan continuously, for about 2 minutes. The seeds should become fragrant and should start taking on a brown tint.


Continuous stirring prevents the seeds from burning.
If you're short on time, this part of the process can be skipped. This step draws flavor out of the seeds, though, making your pickled cauliflower tastier when done.

, Pour the vinegar and another 1 cup (250 ml) of water into the saucepan with your toasted seeds. Add the sugar, garlic, peppercorns, turmeric, red pepper flakes, and another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) pickling salt, as well. Bring the solution to a boil, then drop the temperature and let the solution simmer for 5 minutes.

, As the pickling solution simmers, tightly pack your cooled cauliflower florets into clean glass canning jars. Leave as little space as possible.


For this method, it works best if you use half-pint (quarter-liter) or pint (half-liter) sized jars instead of full quart jars. The processing times provided here are for jars of this size.

, Distribute the solution evenly into each jar of cauliflower. Make sure that the solution fills each jar to the very bottom, and leave at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar.


Wipe the rims of each jar with a hot, damp towel before covering the container with a lid. Fasten the lid in place by tightly screwing on a corresponding metal band.
The headspace is necessary since the contents of the jar can expand during the canning process. If you do not have the headspace, the pressure inside the jar can actually cause the glass to break.

, Place the jars evenly along the bottom rack of a boiling-water canner. Pour enough water inside the cover the jars by 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more. Turn on the heat source.


If you do not have an actual canner, place the jars inside a large stockpot fitted with a metal rack. Heat the stockpot on the stove over high heat.

, Start the clock once the water inside your canner has reached a boil. The process time will vary depending on your altitude.For altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 and 305 m), process the jars for 10 minutes.
For altitudes between 1000 and 6000 feet (305 m and 1830 m), process the jars for 15 minutes.
For altitudes above 6000 feet (1830 m), process the jars for 20 minutes.

, Remove the jars with tongs or a special jar lifter, then place them on a kitchen towel spread over your counter or table. Allow the jars to cool and dry for six hours.

, Store the jars of pickled cauliflowers in a cool, dark place. When made in this manner, pickled cauliflowers should last for up to one year.


Note that you will need to refrigerate these pickles after opening the jar.

, Mix the wedges into the oil using your hands or a large wooden or plastic baking spoon. Keeping mixing until you can see that each wedge is coated in oil.








, If you are on a low-sugar diet, you can skip this step, but sugar does enhance the sweetness of the sweet potatoes. Sugar also helps to caramelize the fries.








, Salt and pepper are fairly standard, but you can leave out the paprika and cinnamon if either taste does not appeal to you. Try to sprinkle your spices over the top of your fries evenly to make mixing them easier.








, You can use your hands, but you may find that your hands attract the oily spices, robbing your fries of them. Instead, use a plastic or wooden baking spoon to reduce the amount of spices lost during the mixing process. By the time you finish mixing, you should be able to see spices coating each wedge.









, Spread them out into a single layer. Fries that overlap one another will not cook evenly, so if you have too many fries to fit onto one baking sheet, it is better to use a second baking sheet than to allow your fries to pile up.









, At this point, the tops should begin to look slightly browned. Take the fries out and flip them with a flat spatula or hamburger flipper before returning them to the oven and baking for another 5 to 15 minutes.








, Test one of the fries by breaking it open. The inside should be fairly tender. You can taste one to determine its doneness, but make sure that it has some chance to cool before doing so to prevent your mouth from getting burned.

Remove the potatoes when they are golden and crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.You can pierce a wedge with a fork to see if it's done--the inside should be soft and offer no resistance to the fork.",How to Make Potato Wedges," High-starch potatoes (like russets and most sweet potatoes, including the jewel yam) are highly absorbent with a light, fluffy texture.Medium-starch or all-purpose potatoes (such as Yukon Gold, red gold, white, blue, and purple potatoes) have more moisture than high-starch potatoes and are less likely to fall apart.Potatoes should feel firm and heavy. Look out for green spots, wrinkles, sprouts, blemishes and soft spots--these are signs of a bad or bitter potato.If you are using potatoes you already have at home and discover a green spot, make sure you chop it off an discard it. The green parts of a potato are mildly poisonous and will upset your stomach.Store your potatoes in a cool, dry space. Try not to store them anywhere too cold (like the refrigerator), as the starches will begin turning into sugar, which will alter the taste.;
, Potatoes grow in the dirt and, though they are rinsed before you buy them, dirt may still be hiding in the little dimples (or ""eyes"") on the potato.Don't scrub so hard that the skin begins to peel off. Be gentle with your potato.


Even organic foods are treated with pesticides, so be on the safe side and make sure you're washing all your organic produce, too.You don't need to use a special solution of veggie wash to clean the potato--running water should do the job., This will give you six wedges per potato.Try to cut the wedges into equal sizes so they all bake at the same rate. If you have a mixture of thick and thin wedges, the thin ones may burn while you wait for the thick wedges to bake all the way through.Six wedges per-potato should give you a thick, but not too thick, slice. If wedges are any thicker, they may be crispy and gold on the outside, but completely underdone inside.If you are not baking the potato wedges right away (if you have to prep the rest of your meal or wait for the oven to preheat), put them in a bowl of cold water with a squirt of lemon juice or vinegar. This will prevent discoloration.Don't let the potatoes soak in the bowl for longer than two hours--the potatoes will absorb the water and may begin to lose some of their vitamins.You may peel the potatoes before slicing if you don't want to eat the skin, but they may not hold their shape as well when you bake them. The skins are more vitamin-rich than the flesh, so the potato would lose some of its nutritional value without it., The oil will help the spices stick to the potatoes.Make sure the spices and oil are distributed evenly and your wedges are fully coated.


Make sure your hands are clean before handling the food.
If you want to add additional flavors--like minced garlic, chopped rosemary leaves, spicy cumin, or thyme--add it to the bowl and mix with the rest of the ingredients.

, Position a rack on the middle or lower level of the oven.If your oven runs a little cool, use the lower rack so the wedges get hot enough to crisp. If your oven tends to over-bake things, use the middle rack instead.


If you are baking sweet potatoes, make sure you have a rack on the middle or upper level of the oven, to prevent the starch from caramelizing too quickly and burning your wedges., Make sure your wedges are only a single layer deep, not piled on top of each other. Piling and crowding the potatoes on the pan will cause them to steam, not roast, and they will end up soft and soggy.If you are worried about your potatoes sticking to the lining, use non-stick spray or drizzle with a little extra olive oil. The oil on the potatoes should keep them from sticking, but take this extra step if you want to.
Lay the potatoes so that one of the cut sides is flat against the pan, with the other cut side exposed. Wedges should not be on their backs (the side with the skin), with the entire cut part (or the flesh of the potato) exposed., You can burn your arms on the top of the stove if you try to reach in and flip the potatoes without first removing the pan.


If you are cooking two pans of wedges at once, make sure you change their positions on the rack when you turn the potatoes. The pan that was closer to the bottom should move to the higher rack, and vice-versa. This way both trays will bake evenly and should be done about the same time.,


You can top the fries with additional salt or a garnish like chopped chives or parsley.
Serve with a side of ketchup, hot sauce, lime and chipotle mayo, malt vinegar, or any other dipping sauce you'd like to try.

Season and serve.",How to Make Simple Mashed Potatoes1," There are a few basic options when it comes to buying potatoes: baking, boiling, and all-purpose potatoes. All have different qualities when it comes to flavor and texture.Baking potatoes, such as Russets, are high in starch which creates light and fluffy mashed potatoes.
Boiling potatoes, such as red potatoes, are considered waxy which means they hold their shape and may create lumpy mashed potatoes.
All-purpose potatoes, such as Yukon Golds, fall in between boiling and baking potatoes in terms of texture. They do offer a butterier flavor than Russets.;
, Use cold water and gently scrub the entire potato. Look for dark patches where dirt might have settled. If you wash the potatoes in a bowl of water, be sure to rinse them before cutting.


You can use a small brush specifically designated for cleaning potatoes or produce. This will help scrub away any dirt that's firmly stuck.

, You can cook the potatoes with the skins on or you can peel them before cutting them. Simply cut your potato into quarters or cubes.


Leaving the skins on will give your mashed potatoes more texture. For this reason, you should consider using Yukon Golds, which have a thinner peel than Russets.

, Place your prepared potatoes in a large saucepot and fill with cold water. The potatoes should be covered by an inch or two of water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to a lively simmer and cook for 10 to 20 minutes. The potatoes are done when you stick a fork into them and they start to fall apart.


You can salt your water for extra flavor, just as though you're cooking pasta. The potatoes will absorb the salt as they cook.Avoid using hot water and covering your pot with a lid. This will make the potatoes cook unevenly and can lead to gluey potatoes., While the potatoes are cooking, heat up chicken stock or milk until warm and get some butter out of the fridge.


Use chicken stock if you'd like the potato flavor to really shine. Milk, ranging from skim to whole, will make creamier potatoes.
Heating your liquid will keep the mashed potatoes hotter for longer. Warm liquid is also absorbed better by the potatoes.

, Use a strainer or lift the potatoes out with a slotted spoon. Return the cooked potatoes to your pot on the stove. Add your room temperature butter and start mashing the potatoes.


The best tool for mashing rustic potatoes is a simple potato masher. Avoid mashing too much or you'll be left with more of a puree. You may want to leave small chunks and skin somewhat intact.

, Gradually add some of your warm stock or milk. Stir gently and add a bit more liquid if your potatoes are still loose. Keep adding liquid gradually until the potatoes bind together.


Avoid adding all your liquid at once. You could end up with too much liquid which makes mushy mashed potatoes. Your potatoes will need more or less liquid depending on potato type and level of starchiness.

, Taste the potatoes and add salt, pepper, and/or more butter, as you like. Serve while they're still warm or keep covered until ready to eat.

Wash the citrus.,
Dry the fruit thoroughly.,
Choose the right tool for the job.",How to Zest a Citrus Fruit1," Before you get started, run the fruit under a stream of cool water, then buff it gently with a clean cloth or paper towel. A light rinse will help remove the natural waxy residue on the outside of the fruit. You can also give the citrus a quick soak in a shallow bowl of water.It’s important to wash citrus fruit any time you’re zesting, since the outside is the part that will actually be going into your food.
Be sure to remove any stickers or labels so they that don't end up in the zest.;
, After rinsing or soaking the fruit for a few moments, shake off the excess water and pat it with a towel. Make sure the citrus is completely dry—you’ll be holding onto the fruit by hand, and you may slip if the peel is too wet.A microfiber towel will help remove more moisture from the outside of the peel.

, Graters, peelers, and paring knives will perform the same basic function, but one may produce a zest that’s better suited to your culinary needs than the other. A microplane grater is the way to go if you want a finely shredded zest that blends seamlessly into sauces, desserts, and other recipes. With a peeler, you’ll end up with slivers of a uniform size and thickness. Slicing citrus fruits by hand will result in an irregularly shaped peel, but offer you more control over the depth of your cut.Any knife with a short, sharp blade will work just fine when you don’t have a more expedient zesting tool on hand.When using a peeler or paring knife, you’ll need to go back and chop the peel to an appropriate size later on.

Wash the lime under cool, running water.,
Place your microplane above a cutting board at a 45-degree angle.,
Gently push the lime across the surface of the microplane.,
Rotate the lime to zest the rest of the fruit.,
Collect the zest and place it in a small bowl.,
Rinse the microplane immediately or leave it in a warm location to dry out.",How to Zest a Lime1," Rub the limes gently with your fingers to remove grime or waxy substances, even if there is no visible dirt on the lime. Pat dry with a clean towel to clean the lime further and make it easier to grip.






;
, A microplane grater is a flat or curved metal kitchen tool with tiny, sharp holes across its surface. It can be used to produce finely grated lime zest with little effort.









If you have a grater with several sizes of holes, use the smallest size. It may or may not be a microplane, but can be used as a zester nonetheless.

, Rest your lime on top of the microplane, near the base. Push the lime gently across the blades. This should shave the skin into a fine zest, which will fall onto the cutting board for you to collect.









Notice that the blades are angled in one direction. Pushing the lime against the cutting edges of the blades will produce zest, while pushing it in the opposite direction will have no effect.The cutting edges of the blades should be facing up toward the ceiling.
If you are using a fine grater instead of a microplane, push as gently as possible to avoid digging into the bitter, white pith beneath the skin.

, Zest the first area until the colored skin has been removed. Once the white pith beneath the skin is revealed, rotate the lime to rub a new section of the colored skin over the microplane in the same way.









Be careful not to remove the bitter white pith beneath the skin.

, Once the whole lime has been zested, or you have as much zest as you need, set aside the lime for later use. Use a knife to scrape the zest off the cutting board and into a small bowl, or directly into the dish you are cooking as instructed by the recipe.









You don't need to spend the effort getting every last piece of zest out of the lime. The ends of the lime may be difficult to zest, for instance.

, If you allow the zest residue to dry in the tiny holes of the microplane, it can be difficult to clean out later. Use running water to wash it out immediately, scrubbing with a thick-bristled brush. Alternatively, try using no water at all and setting the microplane near a stove or on a sunny windowsill. The heat may be enough to dry out the stuck pieces until they can be easily brushed off.

The basic idea is to remove only the brightest colored part of the fruit’s exterior.If you’re using a box grater or microplane with multiple blades, use the smallest set of holes to ensure that the zest comes out with a fine texture.Applying too much pressure can cause you to cut down to the tough white pith beneath the peel. Pith has a bitter taste that can throw off the finished flavor of a recipe., Scrape the loose zest into a separate bowl, or transfer it to a plastic bag or airtight container and place it in the freezer for later. It will best when used right away while the oils are at their most potent.Use a sprinkle of finely-grated citrus zest to add tart, zippy notes to cake batter, cookie dough, sauces, or marinades.Store the leftover citrus in the refrigerator until you have use for the fruit or juice.

"
"
Grip the fruit in one hand.,
Drag the zester along the outside of the citrus.,
Turn the fruit as you go.",How to Zest a Citrus Fruit3," Cup the citrus in your palm to expose as much of the outer surface as possible. Squeeze the sides of the fruit with your fingers to hold it steady. To avoid sending the zest flying everywhere, you may find it easiest to start on the underside of the fruit.Be sure to keep your fingers clear of the moving blades of the zester.
Holding the fruit yourself, as opposed to placing it on another surface, will give you more control.

, Run the zester lengthwise across the outside of the fruit using short, quick strokes. For best results, hold the fruit away from your body and pull the zester towards you. When forced through the tiny holes of the zester, the peel will curl into thin ribbons, perfect for garnishing desserts or placing around the rim of a cocktail.Position the zester over a cutting board, plate or paper towel to keep the zest shavings together.
Only grate the brightest part of the citrus, and stop before you reach the bitter pith., After every few strokes, twist the citrus around and renew your grip. Repeat this process until you’ve gone over the entire peel or gathered as much zest as you need.Don’t try to rotate the fruit as you grate, or you could end up scraping your own fingers.
Once you’ve got enough zest, place the leftover citrus in the refrigerator for storage. Alternately, you can go ahead and grate the entire fruit and store the zest if you suspect you’ll use it for other dishes in the near future."
"
Make a shallow cut in the peel.,
Run the knife or peeler down the length of the fruit.,
Finish cutting the peel by hand.",How to Zest a Citrus Fruit4," Dig into the peel with the blade of the peeler or knife just enough to get it started. You’ll then be able to apply just enough pressure to strip the peel while steering clear of the pith.Slice both ends off of the citrus to give yourself a more convenient starting point.
A brief soak in lukewarm water can help soften fruits with tough rinds, such as limes.

, If you’re using a peeler, simply pull it towards you to remove the peel one strip at a time. If you’re using a knife, you’ll need to carefully guide the blade around the outer edge of the fruit in a spiral motion. Pause to rotate the citrus after each section of peel you remove.It can be tricky at first to zest a citrus fruit with a veggie peeler. The more times you do it, the better you’ll get at using just the right amount of force.
Angle the blade of the knife downward into the fruit to keep from slipping and cutting yourself., After peeling the citrus, you’ll be left with a pile of strips of varying sizes. These strips might be a little too unwieldy as-is, but you can easily reduce them to a more usable size by chopping them with a sharp knife. Add the zest to drinks, dinner or dessert while it’s still fresh to get the most out of the potent oils.Slice the strips into long, thin slivers for garnishes, pastry fillings, stir fries, and anything else where you want to highlight the bold flavor of the citrus.Try kicking up the taste of salad dressings, remoulades, and aoilis with a hint of fresh citrus zest.

Wash and dry the lime.,
Get out your cutting board and zester.,
Pull the zester along the surface of the lime.,
Rotate the lime and repeat the process.,
Chop the strips of zest finely (optional).",How to Zest a Lime2," Hold the lime under a stream of cool water and rub gently. Pat dry with a towel.

, A zester is a kitchen tool with several tiny blades or sharp holes, which creates long, curling ribbons of lime zest, perfect for garnishing. Alternatively, these strips can then be chopped finely for use in cooking.

Some refer to this tool as a ""traditional zester"" and call microplanes ""microplane zesters.""

, If you are creating a garnish for a cocktail or dish, remove part of the white pith along with the colored zest in order to keep the curl intact.If you are using the zest for cooking, try to only remove thin strips of the colored zest.

, Once the strips have been removed and the white pith beneath is exposed, rotate to an untouched section of the lime. Continue to pull the zester over the lime until you have the amount of zest you need for your recipe.


The thickness of lime skin varies more than most citrus fruit, so it is difficult to predict how much zest is produced by one lime. If the recipe calls for ""zest from one lime"" without specifying the variety of lime, use approximately two tsp (10 mL) of zest.

, If you are using the zest as a decorative garnish, skip this step. If you are using them in a recipe, use a sharp knife to cut the zest into fine pieces."
"
Use this method only if you don't have other tools.,
Rinse and dry the lime.,
Place the lime on a cutting board and hold it with your non-dominant hand.,
Position the vegetable peeler or paring knife.,
Methodically peel the zest from the lime.,
Trim the white pith from the zest unless using strips for garnish.,
Chop the zest into small pieces (optional).",How to Zest a Lime3," When you don’t have a microplane or a zester, then a vegetable peeler or paring knife will get the job done. This process isn’t recommended if you want uniform curls or a very fine zest., Hold the lime under running water and rub off grime with your fingers. Pat dry with a clean towel.

, Set a clean cutting board on a stable surface. Place the lime on top of the cutting board and hold it firmly in place near the base.

If you are right-handed, hold the lime with your left hand. If you are left-handed, hold it with your right hand.

, Hold the peeler or knife against the top of the lime, with the blade facing you. Do not try to point the blade away from you, as zesting this way provides less control and increases the odds of cutting yourself.

, Pull the peeler or knife toward you, pressing lightly into the lime's skin. Ideally, only remove the colored zest portion of the peel, not the white pith underneath. However, press deeper into the pith if it helps keep the knife steady and controlled.

, Use your paring knife or any sharp, small knife to remove large pieces of white, fleshy pith from the underside of the peeled zest. This is highly recommended if using the zest in recipes, as the pith adds a bitter taste. However, if you are using the zest strips as garnish or in a cocktail, you do not need to remove the pith.

, Use the same knife to chop the zest into fine pieces. It is now ready to be added to recipes. As for the rest of the lime, wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for later use.

Avoid lids that create an air-proof seal. If the lid to your dish creates a tight seal, leave the lid slightly askew on the top of the container to allow the contents of the dish room to vent.;
, Cook the cauliflower on full power in the microwave until it becomes tender.


Once ready, the cauliflower should be tender enough to easily pierce with a fork.
If it is still tough after 5 minutes in the microwave, you can continue microwaving it up to 5 minutes longer, going at intervals of 1 to 2 minutes each.

, Before you mash the cauliflower, let it cool down for about 5 minutes, or until it feels cool enough to touch.Drain any excess water from the dish before proceeding. The cauliflower needs to be fairly dry.

, Add the chicken broth, sour cream, salt, and pepper. If the cauliflower is too large to fit into the food processor, cut it into chunks using a kitchen knife.


You could use a blender if you do not have a food processor. Note that the cauliflower will need “steam” room, though, so if you use a blender, cover the top of the blender with a heavy, clean kitchen towel.

, Blend the ingredients together until you get the texture you desire. Scrape the sides with a spatula, as needed, to ensure even blending.


For creamier mashed cauliflower, blend the ingredients together at a high speed for a few minutes.

Adding salt to the water will draw out more flavor from the cauliflower. You could add it before the water reaches a boil, but doing so will cause the water to take a little more time to reach its boiling point. As a result, you may find it more beneficial to add it after the water has already begun boiling.

, Cook the cauliflower, uncovered, until it becomes tender.


The cauliflower must be tender enough to pierce with a fork.

, Once the cauliflower is adequately cooked, pour the contents of the stockpot or saucepan through a colander to separate the water from the vegetable.


Throw the drained cauliflower back into the still-hot saucepan. Let it sit, removed from the heat of the stove, with the lid on for 2 to 3 minutes.

, Place the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and heat, uncovered, for about 1 minute on full power.If you are concerned about food splatters, lightly cover the top of the bowl with a paper towel before you microwave the coconut milk mixture. Doing so will prevent most splatters without interfering with the heating process.
Note that you could also heat these ingredients in a small saucepan on the stove for the same amount of time.

, Meanwhile, transfer the cooked cauliflower to a food processor and puree on medium to high speed until whipped and smooth.


As you process the cauliflower, you may need to scrap down the sides of the food processor with a spatula periodically to ensure even blending.

1 tablespoon of sherry vinegar
2 teaspoons of hoisin sauce
2 teaspoons of sugar
1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil;
, Wash 1 medium head of cauliflower that weighs about 1 3/4 pounds (790 g). Peel off and throw away the leaves. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the cauliflower into medium-sized florets. Cut off and throw away the thick, tough end of the cauliflower stalk. Cut the rest of the usable stalk into 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) pieces.You can use any type or color of cauliflower that you like.

Look for yuzu fruit or juice at your local Asian market.,
Choose 100% yuzu juice instead of concentrates.,
Swap other citrus juices for yuzu in dishes like ceviche.,
Use a few drops of yuzu juice to add tang to desserts.",How to Use Yuzu Fruit1," Fresh yuzu fruit is hard to come by outside of East Asia. Depending on your location, you might be able to find fresh fruit at a nearby Asian grocery store. Bottled yuzu juice, also available at your Asian grocery store, is more widely available., You will likely find both pure yuzu juice and concentrated products. Concentrates or seasonings containing yuzu are far less potent than pure juice so, in general, you should choose 100% yuzu juice.After opening, you can refrigerate bottled yuzu juice for up to four weeks.

, Yuzu is less acidic, but more intensely flavorful than other citruses, like lemon or lime. It’s potent enough that just one drop goes a long way. Try using a few drops of yuzu juice wherever you’d use a teaspoon of citrus juice, such as in ceviches or seafood marinades., Yuzu, like other citrus fruits, works well in both savory and sweet dishes. You can add a dash to sweet recipes, such as jellies, custards, or meringues.Try making an easy yuzu glaze for cakes by mixing 2 cups (480 mL) of confectioner’s sugar with two teaspoons of yuzu juice. Add more juice for more intense citrus flavor and, if necessary, to thin the glaze’s consistency."

Measure out a quarter ounce of zest and place it in a mortar.When making essential oils, use a ratio of a quarter ounce (7 g) of zest to one cup (240 mL) of carrier oil. Your carrier oil should be a neutral oil, like jojoba or grapeseed. Avoid olive oil, which is too viscous and fragrant.

, Pour in just enough oil to cover the grated zest. Use a pestle to grind the zest and oil together and release the zest’s essence. Continue to macerate the zest for at least 15 minutes, then add the rest of the oil to the mortar., After adding the rest of the oil, cover the mortar tightly and let it stand out of direct sunlight for at least two days.If you’re making multiple batches, transfer the macerated zest and oil to a lidded jar or container so you can reuse the mortar for the next batch.

, Use a string or rubber band to secure cheesecloth to the top of a jar. Make sure it has some slack so it can catch the zest when you sift the oil. After at least two days, uncover the oil and pour it slowly through the cheesecloth into the jar.Let as much oil drain through the cloth as possible, then unfasten it from the top of the jar, but keep the zest in the cloth.. Squeeze the cloth over the jar to extract as much oil as possible from the zest.

, If you plan on using the oil within a month, just keep it tightly sealed when you’re not using it. Use yuzu essential oil for personal fragrance, add a few drops to a bath, or use it in a fragrance diffuser.You can also freeze extra batches of your yuzu essential oil for up to six months.

This is due to their high starch content, which yields extra fluffy baked potatoes. If you don't have Russets, the next best thing are yellow-fleshed potatoes - such as Yukon Gold - which are moderately starchy and yield a creamy, slightly dense baked potato.





;
, It is important to give your potato a good wash before microwaving, especially if you're planning on eating the skin. Be sure to remove any stubborn dirt. If you have one, a bristled scrubbing brush is great for cleaning potatoes. After washing, pat the potato dry with a clean paper towel.








, Rub a little olive oil into the skin of the potato, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. This gives the potato a little extra flavor and will help to crisp up the skin.








, This allows steam to escape and prevents the potato from exploding in the microwave. You should aim to prick the potato three or four times on each area: top, bottom, and two sides. Alternatively, you can cut a deep ""X"" onto the top of the potato, using a knife.








, If you want, you can wrap the potato in some wet paper towel first. This will help to keep the potato moist and prevent it from shrinking, but it will also result in softer skin.








, Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the potato and the power of the microwave. Most medium to large potatoes will take between 8-12 minutes to cook at full power.








Try putting the potato in for 5 minutes to begin with, then take it out and turn it over so that both sides cook evenly. Place it back in the microwave for another 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft it is already. After that, if it still doesn't feel fully cooked, continue to microwave it in 1 minute bursts, checking after each minute.If you are cooking multiple potatoes at once, you will need to increase the cooking time by about two-thirds. For example, if one large potato takes 10 minutes to cook, two large potatoes would take between 16-17 minutes.
If you prefer crispy skinned potatoes, you can cook the potatoes in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, then transfer to a baking sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 400 °F (204 °C) for 20 minutes. This method is great if you want oven-crisp potato skins, in less than half the normal cooking time!, You can check if a potato is cooked by sticking a fork in the center; if the fork goes in easily, but the center is still a little firm, the potato is ready. When in doubt, it is best to err on the side of undercooking, as an overcooked potato may burn or explode in the microwave.








, This allows the core of the potato to finish cooking using the heat that is trapped in the inner layers. It also helps it to become fluffy on the inside without over-drying on the outside. Wrapping it in aluminum foil after taking it out of the microwave will speed up this process. Just be careful when touching the potato - it will be extremely hot!









If you are saving a potato for someone who's running late, wrapping the potato in aluminum foil will keep it warm for a remarkably long time. Just be sure to do this as soon as it comes out of the microwave, to conserve as much heat as possible.

, Cut the potato open and garnish it with your favorite toppings. Keep it simple with butter, salt and a little grated cheese, or jazz it up with some sour cream, green onions or chives and some crispy bacon. For a more complete meal, top the potato with a generous helping of chili con carne or some fluffy scrambled eggs.

Reduce the heat and cook.",How to Make Cauliflower Curry2," Dice an onion and mince garlic and ginger. Heat coconut oil in a wok or Dutch oven and add the diced onion and minced garlic.Cook the onions and garlic for five to seven minutes on medium-low heat or until fragrant.


Cooking till fragrant means allowing the contents to simmer until you can distinctly smell the aroma.

, Most spices should come pre-ground. If you need to grind yours, add them to a mortar and pestle with some brute force. Once these spices are powdered like a conventional dried spice, add them to the sauted onions, garlic and ginger. Stir the onion mixture for a minute or until they too are fragrant.Garam masala is a spice blend traditionally used in curry. While it can be made at home, it contains ten varieties of spices. It is often less troublesome and expensive to purchase it premixed., Break the cauliflower down into smaller, bite sized florets.Stir the cauliflower in with the other remaining vegetables and coconut milk. Increase your heat until the mixture is boiling.When searching for chickpeas, look in the canned vegetable aisle of your local grocery store. One can of chickpeas is approximately 15 ounces, or just under two cups. If you choose to use canned chickpeas, always rinse and drain well., After the curry mixture begins to boil, give it a good stir and adjust the heat to keep it simmering and cover it. Every so often, give it a stir but allow it to cook for at least 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, uncover the curry and allow steam to boil off. Allowing steam to boil off thickens your mixture.Thicken the curry to your preference.


Before serving your curry, add salt and pepper to your liking. You can also pour the curry over rice and use diced cilantro as a bright garnish."

Check the cantaloupe once the color changes.Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe.,
Look for a crack around the stem.The melon is usually ready to harvest when it is ""full slip."",
Harvest the cantaloupe.,
Know what to expect.,
Place the melon in a brown paper bag.Use a brown paper bag that is large enough to fit the cantaloupe with a little extra room.,
Consider placing a banana or apple in the bag.,
Leave the melon out at room temperature until ripe.Usually, the process will only take about two days, if not quicker.,
Check the stem end.If you purchased a cantaloupe instead of harvesting one from your own garden, first verify that no part of the actual stem is on the melon.,
Look at the netting on the skin.,
Note the color.,
Use your sense of touch.,
Sniff the cantaloupe.,
Finished.

",How to Ripen a Cantaloupe," Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.


Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.
Even if the melon is not quite ripe, however, noting the color will give you an idea of whether or not the fruit is close to being ripe.
You must allow the cantaloupe to mature completely on the vine. Unlike other fruits, melons do not develop any sugars once they are harvested, so the cantaloupe will not become any sweeter after you remove it from the vine. The color and texture may change afterward, but the taste will not.;
, This means that there will be a small crack that completely encircles the stem where it is attached to the cantaloupe.


If you aren't sure whether or not the crack is deep or complete enough, test it by applying pressure to the side of the stem.Place your thumb directly next to the stem and apply pressure to the side of the stem. You should only need to use a little force, and the stem should begin to separate easily.

, As soon as the color is right and the crack around the stem is complete, the cantaloupe is ripe. It should be harvested right away.


Do not wait too long to harvest a ripe cantaloupe. If the melon falls off the vine on its own, it has likely become overripe, and both the taste and texture will be distorted as a result.

, As noted earlier, the taste of the cantaloupe will not change when you ripen it off the vine since its flesh does not contain starches capable of converting to sugars. The texture, color, and juiciness of the fruit can improve, though, so this process is still beneficial if you have a freshly harvested mature melon or one that is only slightly unripe.

, The fruit should not be squeezed into the bag too tightly. Ideally, you should leave a little room for airflow inside the bag.


Make sure that you close the top of the bag when you are ready to let the melon begin ripening.
The closed paper bag traps the ethylene gas produced by the cantaloupe as it ripens. The production of ethylene gas increases in the presence of additional ethylene gas, so keeping the gas concentrated within the space of the bag speeds up the ripening process.
You need to use a paper bag instead of a plastic one. Paper bags are porous, so carbon dioxide can escape and oxygen can enter. Without at least this much airflow, the cantaloupe can begin to ferment.

, If you place a ripe banana or ripe apple in the bag, even more ethylene gas will be produced inside the space of the bag, and the ripening process will speed up even more.


Bananas and apples produce notably high amounts of ethylene gas once they ripen, making them better options than most other fruits.

,


Make sure that the place you store the melon is neither excessively cold or excessively hot. You should also avoid areas that are heavy in moisture or particularly drafty.
Check on the progress of the cantaloupe throughout the process to make sure that it has not ripened early.

, If it is, you should give up on that cantaloupe now, since it suggests that the melon was harvested before it was able to fully mature on the vine. A cantaloupe like that will never ripen.


Also check the rind around the stem end of the cantaloupe. If there are any tears in the rind, those could also suggest that the fruit was picked too early.
Make sure that the stem end is slightly indented since this indicates that it was easily plucked off the vine. If the stem end protrudes, that could be another sign of a premature harvest.
You should also avoid cantaloupe when the stem end has notably soft, moist spots around it. That could suggest that the fruit is actually over-ripe.

, The rind should be covered with a thick, coarse netting that appears well-defined over the entire surface of the melon.


That netting can, however, stand out more easily on some areas than it does in others. Do not expect it to be perfectly uniform throughout.

, If you did not harvest the fruit yourself and are growing it from a second party, check the color of the rind before you make a purchase. The rind should be tinted gold, yellow, or tan.


A green-tinted rind indicates that the fruit is unripe.

, Gently press on the blossom end of the cantaloupe. When you do, it should yield slightly. If it feels hard, you should allow the melon to ripen at room temperature for another day or so.


On the other hand, if the cantaloupe yields too much or feels mushy, the fruit is likely over-ripe.
Similarly, you should pick up the melon as you check it over, as well. When ripe, the cantaloupe will feel heavy for its size.

, Take a whiff of the fruit at its blossom end, rather than at the stem end. The ""button"" of the fruit should be just below your nose as you inhale, and you should be able to sense the familiar fragrance of a ripe cantaloupe when you breathe in.


If you cannot smell anything yet, try ripening the cantaloupe for another half a day or so.
If you are unfamiliar with the smell of a cantaloupe, simply sniff for a notably sweet scent.
The blossom end is where the softening begins and the aroma first develops, so the scent will be strongest and easily noticed there.

Strain the oil and store in a lidded container.,
Repeat the process if desired or store your oil.",How to Use Bergamot Oranges3," Use a citrus zester or grater to peel and finely grate the rind of a Bergamot orange. Place a quarter ounce of zest in a mortar.To make one batch of essential oil, you'll be using a ratio of a quarter ounce (7 g) of zest to one cup (240 mL) of carrier oil. Grate as much zest as you'll need for the number of batches you want to make, and separate them into quarter ounce portions.

, Pour enough carrier oil into the mortar to cover the grated zest. Use a pestle to grind the zest and oil together. Continue for 15 to 30 minutes, then add the rest of the oil to the mortar.Your carrier oil should be a neutral oil, like jojoba or grapeseed. Avoid olive oil, which is too viscous and fragrant.
If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can use a plastic baggie and mallet to break down the zest.

, Tightly cover the mortar with plastic wrap. Let it stand out of direct sunlight for at least two days.If you’re making more than one batch of essential oil, transfer the zest and oil to a lidded container so you can use the mortar for the next batch.

, Secure cheesecloth to the top of a jar with a rubber band or string. Leave enough slack so the cloth can catch the zest when you strain the oil. Uncover the oil after it’s rested for two days and pour it slowly through the cheesecloth into the jar.After straining the oil and collecting the zest in the cloth, unfasten it from the top of the jar, keeping the zest in the cloth.

Choose the freshest lemons you can find; hand pick, if possible.,
Sort the lemons into two groups, and then wash and dry them.,
Store whole, blemish-free lemons in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.,
Cut around blemished sections of the lemons.The ""cut into lemons"" will need to be used first for your project, or stored in the refrigerator until you use them.Blemishes are not always terrible, but if you are going to be making something like jelly and or sugared lemon, you'd probably not want to eat an unsightly dark spot on a piece of lemon, so it's best to just dispose of them.",How to Preserve Lemon Peel1," Some people are lucky enough to have lemon trees in their yards, or live next to someone who does.


Sometimes lemon trees and shrubs have sharp spiky thorns, so wear protective clothing and gloves.If you have a very tall tree, use a lemon picker.Or, better yet, grab a friend and get two lemon pickers (or more).;
, One group is those with only superficial blemishes on the skin and the second group is those with deeper bruises or blemishes.This is an important step if you have a large supply of hand-picked lemons.
Separate them into two bags, or bowls. If you have help, have one person wash one group while you wash another, discarding any lemons that appear moldy or infected.
Pat the lemons dry or let them air dry in an area with good air circulation, because they can start to rot if they sit in water too long.

, If you are using the lemons right away, you can skip this step.


Lemons last longer in a plastic bag in the refrigerator, nearly four times as long as being left out at room temperature.,
If you want, juice the cut lemons right away. See Making and Freezing Lemon Juice, below.

Save the pith for pectin by freezing in a plastic bag., The volume of your mason jar minus the volume of your lemon peel is the approximate volume of salt/sugar mixture you will need.The volume will change depending on the size of mason jar you are using.

, These are spices that will break down and diffuse into the sugar/salt/lemon mixture., Repeat layers, to top., Since you have only peel in this mixture, the sugar and salt work together to break down the skin and to preserve it, without making it overly salty or overly sweet.

You've heard the saying ""Squeezing lemon juice on a paper cut""? That's exactly as painful as it sounds, plus the citric acid really does eat away at the skin.

, Rolling the lemon on a cutting board with the palm of your hand starts to separate and break down the fiber in the lemon, making it easier to juice., Most lemon juicers require that you slice the lemon in half in order to provide an open surface for the juice to escape.

, See Freezing Fresh Lemon Peel and Dry Preserving lemon Peel, above.


You can either use a sharp potato peeler for large ribbons of zest for use in cocktails or to infuse olive oil or a citrus zester for smaller pieces of zest for use in cooking and baking.,, Straining the juice allows you to filter out the tiny seeds and other fibrous material so that the lemon juice is smooth and has no particles.Use either a double or triple layer of cheesecloth over a measuring cup, or a fine metal mesh strainer.

,


These leftover fibrous parts are chock full of pectin, which is what makes jelly jelly-like, so use them instead of buying packaged pectin at the store for making jellies.Store pith in the freezer in a plastic bag or plastic storage container, if you are not making jelly or preserves now., Freezing lemon juice allows you to preserve it for up to one year.For a useful lemonade variation, heat lemon juice and sugar (to taste) over a medium flame until sugar is dissolved.

Cut the lemon lengthwise instead of crosswise.,
Juice the lemon with the assistance of a fork.,
Use a juicer.",How to Get More Juice out of a Lemon," Lemons that sit out at room temperature are easier to work with than cold lemons, so you should be able to squeeze more juice out. Cold temperatures cause the membranes inside the lemon to constrict and solidify, making the fruit more rigid. A room temperature lemon, by contrast, has a softer texture that makes it easier to squeeze.;
, Warm lemons are even softer and produce more juice than room temperature lemons. Fill a small to medium bowl with warm water. The water should be warm enough for you to feel the warmth coming through the sides of the bowl, but it should not be boiling or steaming. Place the lemon inside the water and allow it to sit for 30 seconds up to several minutes. You should pull the lemon out once the skin feels warm to the touch and before the water cools off.

, Take a whole lemon and roll it on a firm countertop. Apply enough force to squeeze down on the lemon, causing minor distortion to its shape, but do not smash the lemon so hard that it breaks. Rolling the lemon in this manner breaks the membranes in the flesh of the lemon, causing the juice to spill out more easily.

, This method can produce up to 30 to 40 percent more juice. You can either leave the fruit whole or cut it in half to expose more of the flesh, but leaving it whole prevents any moisture from getting absorbed by the microwave. Heat the lemon in the microwave for 10 to 20 seconds, pulling it out once the skin is warm to the touch. The lemon should not be made too hot to hold, though. The excited water molecules make the flesh softer and weaker, which makes the lemon easier to squeeze and the membranes holding the juice easier to burst.

, Extremely cold temperatures cause water to expand and change into ice. This expansion can weaken and even break the membranes containing the lemon's juice. Since solid lemons are impossible to squeeze, though, they need to be warmed up afterward. Stick the frozen lemon into the microwave for 30 to 60 seconds until it is soft enough to cut. The molecules, now excited after being heated, can break out of the membranes almost effortlessly.

, Cutting your lemon from top to bottom or tip to tip can produce three times as much juice. When cutting a medium lemon crosswise or side to side, you can usually squeeze out 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of juice by hand. Cutting the lemon lengthwise can produce up to 1/3 cup (83 milliliters) of lemon juice. The larger amount of surface area exposes more of the pulp. Juice can get trapped inside a thick layer of pulp, but with more of the pulp exposed, the juice is less likely to get trapped.

, After cutting the lemon in half, insert the tines of a fork into the pulp of one half and squeeze the lemon half as you usually do. Once the flow of juice starts to slow, rotate the fork to a new position and continue squeezing. Rotate and squeeze until no more juice comes out and repeat the process with the other half. The process uses the same principles applied by a lemon juicer. The pressure and sharp tines of the fork help pierce the membranes, allowing the liquid to flow freely out.

, You do not need anything too fancy; a simple, hand-held press juicer should be enough to accomplish the task at hand. Slice the fruit in half and place one half onto the juicer with the cut side facing down. Use the handle to press down on the lemon half with as much force as you can apply. The pressure should be enough to burst most of the membranes and squeeze more juice out than you might expect to get when squeezing by hand.

, Chop 3-5 strips of bacon into manageable pieces and place them in the pan. As the bacon cooks, the fat will begin to “render” and melt into liquid grease. Frying the bacon first will release its flavors so that they can be absorbed the cabbage and other ingredients.Bacon should be cooked until the fat renders, not until the meat becomes dark. Otherwise, you risk overcooking it.

, Combine the chopped onion with the bacon and oil or butter and fry it until it loses its firmness. Add the cabbage, along with salt, pepper and any other spices you prefer to taste.

If the mixture is too thick after incorporating the tomato paste, try adding a few ounces of water and covering the pan to let the liquids set up. This will also prevent the frying vegetables from burning or sticking.

, Cook the mixture together, uncovered, for approximately 15 minutes. This will allow time for the sauce to thicken up and the flavors of the individual ingredients and seasonings to mingle.

Finish with sesame oil and/or seeds.,
Finished.

",How to Fry Cabbage3," Begin heating a deep pan or wok over a medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of canola oil. The wok should be hot for stir frying, so make sure the oil has begun to sizzle before you add the main ingredients.Make sure the pan you’re using is deep enough to keep sizzling oil from splattering on you while you cook.

, Place the chopped onion and minced garlic and ginger in the hot oil. Toss or stir these together lightly until they begin to caramelize. This should only take 1-2 minutes. Searing will release the pungent flavors of the onion, garlic and ginger so that they can be absorbed by the cabbage.The edges of the onion should just begin to brown once it is caramelized.
The process of unlocking aromatic flavors from pungent herbs and vegetables is the first step in preparing many Chinese dishes., Throw in the head of sliced cabbage and toss or stir repeatedly to mix all ingredients together. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, pour in 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar. Stir fry for another 3 minutes until the cabbage has just begun to wilt. Be sure to keep the ingredients moving in the pan or they’ll be more likely to stick due to the intense heat.Stir frying is a very fast cooking method because the ingredients are all cooked together over high heat.
Be careful not to overcook the cabbage. It should be soft and tender but still retain a little crunchiness.

, Remove the stir fry from the heat and plate it with an entree, or on a separate dish if it to be served as a side. Drizzle 2 teaspoons of sesame oil over the top and garnish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Eat it while it's hot!In China, food is thought to be freshest when it's still steaming from being cooked. This impressive, appetizing gust of steam is known as wok hay, or ""breath of the wok."","

Wash the cantaloupe.,
Cut the cantaloupe in half and scoop out the seeds.,
Cut each half into four pieces.,
Peel each slice.,
Cut each piece into half inch (12mm) thick slices.,
Bake the cantaloupe in the oven.,
Put the slices in a food dehydrator.,
Use the sun.,
Secure the dried cantaloupe slices in an airtight container.,
Wrap the container in a brown paper bag.,
Keep the container cool and dry.",How to Make Dried Cantaloupe," Put the cantaloupe under cool tap water, turning it around in your hands. Use a produce brush to brush dirt out of the cantaloupe’s rough skin. Finish by drying the fruit with a paper towel or a dry cloth.

You don’t need to use soap to clean the cantaloupe: water and a brush are sufficient.;
, Use a serrated knife to cut the cantaloupe lengthwise. Make sure to keep your fingers away from the knife to prevent injury. Then, use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and liquid sitting at the center of each half., Always cut lengthwise through each piece’s center. You’ll effectively be cutting each half two more times, into smaller halves, until you have eight total pieces., Holding one end of the slice between your fingers, bring a serrated knife to the opposite end, where the peel meets the rest of the fruit. Carefully slice back and forth, following the curve of the fruit and slowly cutting off the peel. As the knife gets closer to your hand, bring your fingers lower on the piece of fruit, grasping the peel. This will allow the knife to pass over your fingers safely as you finish peeling the fruit., Using a similar movement as when you peeled the fruit, slice from one end of the cantaloupe to the other, following its curve. Cut slices at half inch intervals to create long, thin cantaloupe strips. Do this with each eighth of the cantaloupe.

If you’re unsure about where to start cutting, you can use measuring tape to guide your blade., Lay a cheesecloth directly on the oven rack and place the fruit slices on top of it. Make sure to scatter them well enough that they don’t touch. Set the oven to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 Celsius). Leave the oven door slightly ajar to allow steam to escape.

You’ll need to check on the fruit pieces periodically to determine when they’re ready. Your definition of “ready” might vary; some like their cantaloupe completely dry and crispy, whereas others prefer them a bit more pliable.
It may take up to eight hours for the cantaloupe slices to be dried.
If you have pets or small children, you should avoid using this method., Scatter your cantaloupe slices on the dehydrator tray. Set the dehydrator to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (57 Celsius) and let it sit for about 16 hours. Depending on the texture you prefer, you might want to leave the slices in the dehydrator for up to 18 hours.

Note that trays will vary in shape and size depending on the dehydrator you’re using, which might limit the amount of slices you can dry at one time.
Instructions might vary depending on your specific dehydrator; when in doubt check the owner’s manual., This isn’t achievable in every climate. If you live in an area where the temperatures easily reach or exceed 100 degrees Farenheit (38 Celsius) and it’s not too humid, you’ll be able to dry your cantaloupe slices in the sun. Cover a cookie sheet in cheesecloth and place the cantaloupe slices atop it. Then leave the whole thing outside in direct sunlight.

Turn the fruit slices over once a day so they’ll dry evenly.
Bring the tray in at night to avoid dew forming on the fruit.
It should take two to four days for the cantaloupe slices to dry completely. You may want to check the forecast to guarantee a sunny period of four days before attempting this method.You can protect drying fruit slices from insects and birds by covering them with a bug screen or cheesecloth., This can be anything from a sandwich bag to a mason jar. You need to make sure the seal on the container you choose is airtight; this will prevent moisture from mingling with your fruit slices and keep them dry., This will keep the fruit slices out of direct sunlight, which can cause discoloration. Your fruit slices will stay edible for longer if they’re protected from sunlight., Excess heat or humidity will be absorbed by the fruit slices; keeping them dry will keep them edible longer. If stored properly, you can eat your cantaloupe slices up to a year after you packaged them."

Place lemons in a zip lock bag.,
Put the bag of lemons in the freezer.,
Submerge lemons in cold water for 10 minutes to defrost them.",How to Freeze Lemons1," Put your lemons into a zip lock bag. Zip the bag 3/4 of the way and force all excess air out of the bag. Once there's no air in the bag, zip it all the way. Forcing out the air will help keep your lemons fresh and free up space in your freezer., Let your bag of lemons sit in the freezer until they are fully frozen. Depending on the temperature of your freezer, this could take anywhere from 2 hours to overnight. Use fresh lemons for meals that you are making later in the week, and freeze the other lemons well in advance of when you need to use them.

, Whole lemons that are defrosted will often be mushy, and you'll be unable to slice them. This softness makes them unsuitable as a garnish. However, you will still be able to use the zest or juice of the lemon.Lemons will stay good for three to four months in the freezer."

Cut your lemon into slices or wedges.,
Lay your lemon slices on a cookie sheet and place in freezer.,
Transfer the lemons to a zip lock bag.",How to Freeze Lemons2," Cutting your lemon into pieces before you freeze them will circumvent the soft consistency of the lemon so that you can use it in things like cocktails and garnishes. Cut the lemon on a cutting board width-wise about a 1/4 of an inch (6.35 millimeters) to create lemon slices. To cut the lemon in wedges, make one cut lengthwise and one cut width wise. This will create four same-sized lemon wedges.You can also cut lemon slices in half to create crescent-shaped lemon slices.

, Ensure that the lemon slices have free space in between them. Putting your lemon slices on a cookie sheet will allow them to freeze individually. If you skip this step, your lemon slices or wedges will freeze together in one block. Keep the slices of lemon the freezer for 2-3 hours, or until the lemons are frozen completely.

To extract the lemon's zest, use a kitchen tool to get the yellow peel off of the surface of the lemon.You can also remove the zest from the peel of the lemon after you freeze whole lemons.

, Once you're done zesting your lemons, transfer the zest to a zip lock or freezer bag. You can use the rest of the lemons in recipes that you make during the week, or you can slice them and freeze as well.

, Allow the zest to sit in the freezer for a couple of hours or overnight until it all freezes. When you are ready to use it, you can take out what you need and place the rest back into the freezer.


Zesting lemons after they are frozen will help keep the rind oils from spraying onto your cutting board."

Juice your lemons.,
Measure 1 cup (236.5 milliliters) of lemon juice.,
Pour the lemon juice into ice cube trays.,
Place ice cubes in the freezer and allow them to freeze.",How to Freeze Lemons4," Juice your lemons using a reamer or juicer that you can pick up at many department stores. If you don't have a reamer or juicer, you can quarter the lemons and push down on the pulp with a fork to extract some of the juice.The goal is to squish the pulp and extract the liquid that is in the fruit.

, Pour your lemon juice into a measuring cup carefully over a sink. Measuring out your lemon juice will allow you to keep more precise measurements for recipes.Make sure to remove any seeds that may have come loose when you juiced your lemon.

, As you pour your lemon juice into the ice cube trays, make sure to take note of how many ice cubes constitute a full cup. This will enable you to make more accurate measurements when you have to use the lemon juice in particular recipes.


These lemon juice ice cubes can also flavor water., Allow your ice cubes to sit in the freezer until they fully freeze. If you don't freeze freshly squeezed lemon juice, it can go bad in two to four days.Keeping your lemon juice frozen in ice cubes will allow you to keep the lemon juice fresh for a longer period.

Serve.",How to Grill Corn on the Cob1," Look for the freshest, most barely-ripe corn available, preferably at a farmer's market. Choose bright green husks, tightly attached to the ear. The stalks should be a light yellow and the ends of the silks a light brown. While you are at the market, don't be afraid to peel back the husks just enough to reveal a few rows of kernels. They should be white or pale yellow, look nice and plump and be tightly packed into straight rows from one end of the cob to the other.Fresh, young corn is full of natural sugars which will caramelize beautifully over the heat of the grill. As the corn ages, these turn into much less flavorful starches.If the ear has an unusually thick layer of husks, remove the outermost two or three before you continue.;
, Preheat your grill to a medium-high heat, about 350–400 °F (177–204 °C). For a coal grill, arrange coals in an even layer and heat until grey.The best way to heat a gas grill is to fire it up on high, then lower it to the desired temperature. This ensures a hot rack.

, At this point, you may soak the ears of corn in cold water to increase juiciness and reduce the amount the husk burns.Submerge the ears completely, soak for about 15 minutes, then shake off excess moisture.


If you hate the smell of burned corn husk, soak for 30–60 minutes instead. (Many people do not mind this smell, or even enjoy it.)

, There's no real flavor difference between adding spices now, versus waiting until it's cooked.If you go with the first option, peel back the husks just enough to expose the kernels. Brush on olive oil or room-temperature butter with a pastry brush, and season with salt, pepper, and/or savory herbs (or try these fancy options). Pull the loose husks back up over the kernels.Tear off the silk and discard it just before seasoning.
Don't melt the butter first. This can make it more difficult for herbs to stick., Tie a piece of string or loose husk over the tip of the husk to keep it on the corn. Place the corn on a lightly oiled grill rack, either just above the coals for a shorter cooking time, or high above the coals to lower the risk of charring.Close the grill and cook for about 15–20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes or so. Check the corn ready when the husks start to get kernel-shaped char marks and pull away from the tip.If the kernels don't feel tender when poked with a fork, it's fine to leave the corn on until the husk chars black.


Be careful not to overcook your corn or it will become soft and mushy. If you can flex the corncob easily in your hands, it is probably overcooked.You can cook corn directly on the coals instead. In this case, the corn will be ready when the husk is completely charred.Check frequently to avoid burning.

, Using a pair of tongs or an oven mitt, remove the corn from the heat. Cover both hands with oven mitts or a dishtowel, and peel back the husks from the tip down. Serve the corn while it's still hot.


Be careful. The corn inside the husk will be extremely hot.
If you didn't season the corn in advance, serve alongside butter, salt, and pepper.
If any ashes get on the corn, just rinse them off in warm water.

Grill the corn.,
Serve.",How to Grill Corn on the Cob2," The aluminum foil will keep the corn hot for a long time. If you're grilling for a large party, grill foil-wrapped corn first, then leave them wrapped while you finish the rest of your cooking.

, Some cooks like to soak their corn before grilling. If you choose to soak your corn, completely immerse the whole corn cobs in a pot or bowl of cold water for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. This allows the corn kernels to soak up additional moisture, making them plump and juicy. Once they've finished soaking, pat off excess moisture with a paper towel.

, Starting at the top, strip all the husks and silks away from the ears of corn and discard them. If there's any dirt on the kernels, rinse it off.

, Preheat your barbecue grill to a medium high heat, about 350–400 °F (177–204 °C).

, Brush the kernels with butter or olive oil and season with salt and pepper, or these gourmet options. Roll each corn cob in a square of aluminum foil, twisting the ends to secure, like a candy wrapper.


If you prefer, you can wait on the butter and herbs until the corn is cooked.

, Place each aluminum-wrapped ear of corn on the preheated grill/ Cover and allow to cook for approximately 15-20 minutes. Turn occasionally, using a kitchen tongs, to prevent the corn from charring on one side.


You can test if the corn is done by piercing a kernel with a fork. It should feel tender and shoot out clear liquid.

, Remove the corn from the grill using oven gloves or tongs. Carefully remove the aluminum foil; it will be very hot! Serve the corn immediately.

Follow this recipe for a smoky flavor.,
Heat the grill to medium-hot.,
Shuck the corn.,
Grill until golden brown spots appear.",How to Grill Corn on the Cob3," Corn grilled without a wrapper will never be as juicy as the other options, and there's a risk of charring it into oblivion. When done correctly, however, the kernels will pick up plenty of flavor from the grill, caramelizing into smoky sweetness.


This is also the fastest method of grilling corn.

, A medium temperature is the best option for your first attempt. Once you've got a feel for how the corn should end up, you can fire it up to very high heat for a quicker grill.

, Strip away the husks and silk. The silk will burn off on the grill, so you don't need to get every strand., Place the corn on an upper rack if you have one, to prevent charring. Keep a close eye on the corn, turning occasionally. The kernels will brighten in color, then turn brown as they caramelize. The corn is ready when there are many light brown spots, but most of the corn is still yellow."

Preheat the grill as the corn soaks.,
Partially husk the corn.,
Remove the silk.,
Butter the kernels.,
Place the corn on the preheated grill.,
Move the corn to indirect heat.,
Remove the corn when the husks get dark.,
Clean off the cobs.,
Serve hot.",How to Grill Corn1," If the corn cobs have thick layers of husks attached, peel off the first few layers, leaving only a few left to protect the corn and prevent it from burning.;
, Make sure that the corn is completely covered with water. If the cobs of corn float, turn them occasionally to make sure that all sides get exposed to water. The water provides extra moisture, which prevents the corn from drying out as it gets grilled. You should let the corn soak for a minimum of 15 minutes, but it can sit in the water up to 3 hours.

, The grill should reach medium heat. If using a grill with a thermometer, allow the grill to reach roughly 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).

, After it has soaked, pull the corn out of the water and shake off excess water. Pull the husks back to expose the top half of the corn, but do not remove the husks completely.

, After exposing the corn, pull away the silky threads from the side by grasping them and yanking them up.

, You can use melted butter or olive oil. Roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) per cob should be sufficient.

, Position it so that it sits on direct heat. Allow it to sit on the grill for 30 to 60 seconds on each side in order to brown but not burn. Rotate as necessary to prevent the corn from burning.

, This can either be the side of your grill or along a top shelf. Close the cover and allow the corn to cook for 15 minutes.

, The kernels will also pull away slightly from the tip of the cob. If the corn begins to bend in your hands or if the kernels feel soft and mushy, it has cooked too long. Use tongs and oven mitts to prevent yourself from getting burned.

, Grab the uncovered portion of the corn cob with one hand, using an oven mitt or clean dish towel to prevent yourself from getting burned. Peel the remaining husks off and pick off the remaining silk threads. Rinse the corn under warm, running water to remove any ash that has fallen onto the cob.

, Allow the corn to cool just enough to prevent yourself from getting burned as you eat it. Season with salt, pepper, and additional butter to taste.

Combine the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, chives, and basil in a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking pan. Stir with a spoon or fork to thoroughly combine.






Allow the corn to marinate in the mixture. Add the corn to the baking pan and toss, using a fork or spatula, until evenly coated. Cover the pan with plastic cling wrap and keep in the refrigerator for approximately three hours.







, You can you a gas grill or charcoal grill, but a charcoal grill generally works better for use with wood chips.


Pre-soak wood chips, if desired. The right kind of wood chips can enhance the flavor of the corn as it grills. Soak the chips in clean water for one or two hours before you plan to start the grill.To add a sweet flavor to the corn, try applewood, alder wood, cherry wood, or maple wood. Maple wood has a mild sweetness, while applewood is moderately sweet and also contributes a fruity smell.
For a bold, smoky flavor, try hickory wood or pecan wood. Hickory wood is considerably stronger.
Drain the chips before starting the grill. You do not want them completely dry, but if they are dripping wet, they will hinder the fire. Place the chips in a colander to drain or pat off excess water with a dry dish towel.
Sprinkle the still-damp wood chips over the grill. Only use a handful of chips unless you already know what sort of flavor to anticipate with that type of wood. Allow the wood chips to begin steadily smoking.



, Stir the corn to redistribute the coating.

, You might be able to keep the corn in the baking pan you marinated it in, but more of the smoky grill flavor will be transferred to the kernels if you remove them to a fine-mesh grilling basket or grilling griddle with small perforations.

, Distribute the kernels evenly between six sheets of aluminum foil, laying the kernels in a pile at the center of each sheet.

, Make sure that there are no loose or open gaps in the seal.

, Doing so creates small perforations that the corn cannot escape through, but it also allows the smoky flavor to seep in.

, Cover the grill. Keeping the grill covered allows the corn to cook faster, but it also traps the smoke from the wood chips inside, giving the corn a stronger flavor as a result.

, After this time has passed, open the grill and stir the corn. If the corn is wrapped in foil packets, use an oven mitt to gently grab the packet and give it a quick, light shake. Put the lid back on the grill and continue cooking.

, At this point, the corn should begin to sizzle. Uncover the grill and remove the corn.

, Allow the corn to cool slightly, but for the strongest flavor, serve it while it is still fairly hot to warm.

Serve or cook with acidic flavors.",How to Cook Beet Greens1," The stems are edible, but not everyone likes their bitter taste. If you’re not willing to try them, cut off the stems just below the leaves. You can remove the thick stem base from the largest leaves as well, cutting them out in a V pattern.Like all greens, these will sauté down to a much smaller volume. You can cook a large mound at once, as long as it fits in your skillet.;
, Bunch the leaves together and roll them into a cylinder. Chop them into bite-size pieces, at roughly ½–1 inch (1.25–2.5 cm) intervals.If using the stems, chop them into chunks of similar size.

, You can use a salad spinner, or submerge the greens in a bowl of water and rub off any noticeable dirt. Leave it for a couple seconds to let grit sink to the bottom. Lift out the leaves and repeat if necessary until the water comes out clear. Move the leaves to a separate bowl, leaving them damp.


If using the stems, wash them in a separate bowl.

, This will preserve the bright, green color, but the beet greens will cook fine without it. Here's how to go about it:


Prepare an ice bath: a bowl of cold water and ice.
Submerge the greens in boiling water for one minute.
Remove the greens with tongs or drain them into a strainer. Place them in the ice bath until cold.
Drain into a strainer.

, Add enough extra-virgin olive oil to coat the base of your skillet or frying pan, about 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL). Heat over medium heat until the oil shimmers, or a drop of water sizzles when flicked onto the oil.

, If using the chopped beet stems, add them to the pan first. Sauté for 4 minutes, or until slightly softened.

, Dice two cloves of garlic and add them to the pan. Cook for about one minute, or until the garlic turns translucent.


Optionally, add a diced shallot and/or ¼ tsp (1 mL) red pepper flakes.

, Add the chopped leaves and ad them to the pan without stirring. Cover and let wilt to a much smaller mound, about 1–3 minutes.


The water from the rinsing should be enough to steam the leaves slightly. If the leaves don't start shrinking within 30–60 seconds, or if the garlic starts turning brown, add a couple more spoonfuls of water.

, Vinegar or lemon juice cuts the bitter flavor of the beet greens. Provide lemon wedges to squeeze over the greens, or remove from heat and splash them with your favorite type of vinegar.


For a more intense acidic flavor, add 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) vinegar to the pan along with the juice of one orange. Simmer for an additional 2–3 minutes or until liquid has boiled away. Serve topped with orange zest.Beet greens are high in sodium already, but you may add a pinch of salt and pepper if you think the dish needs more flavor."

Finished.

",How to Cook Bok Choy," You can use any kind of bok choy you like for this recipe, including baby, mature, or Shanghai bok choy. To prepare the bok choy:Cut off the very end of the stem that’s keeping the leaves together.
Separate the bok choy, but leave the center leaf bulb intact.
Wash the leaves and stems by running them under cold water. Make sure you rub the bottom of the stem well to remove dirt from around where the roots were. Pat dry with a clean towel.
If you aren't using baby bok choy, cut the leaves off the stems, keeping the two pieces separate. Cut the leaves and stems into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.
Baby bok choy is already bite-sized and has more tender stems, so it doesn’t have to be cut up.;
, Peel the skin off the cloves of garlic and the fresh ginger. With a sharp knife, carefully mince the garlic and ginger together.









You can also use a microplane grater or garlic press to mince these two ingredients.
To peel garlic more easily, shake the cloves in a tin can for 10 seconds to loosen the skin., Heat a wok or sauté pan over medium–high heat and add your cooking oil. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until they become fragrant and turn a light golden brown, about two minutes.









Don’t cook the ginger and garlic for too long, because the garlic will burn quickly and become bitter.The best oils for this dish are peanut, vegetable, or canola., Start by cooking the stems first if you're working with Shanghai or mature bok choy. Cook them for one to two minutes, until the stems start to become translucent.








Add the leaves and toss the bok choy in the oil for 15 seconds.

, Then cover the bok choy with a lid and cook it for one minute. Remove the pan from the heat after that time and remove the lid.









Instead of vegetable broth, you can also use beef or chicken broth, water, white wine, or rice wine vinegar.

, You can season the bok choy with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes, to taste.Toss the bok choy to coat it with the seasoning, then transfer it to a large serving platter.


This recipe makes enough to serve about four people.

, Run the bok choy under cold water to wash off dirt. You can cut the baby bok choy in half lengthwise, if you wish, but you can also leave it whole. Steam the bok choy for about six minutes, or until the base is tender and can easily be pierced with a fork or knife.There are many ways you can steam greens, including:


With an electric steamer. Fill the bottom with water as recommended by the manufacturer. Replace the steamer basket, then put in the bok choy. Put the lid on and turn the machine on.
With a saucepan and steamer insert. Fill a saucepan with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the metal steamer insert into the bottom of the pan. If the water comes up through the holes in the steamer bottom, pour some out. Bring the water to a boil, then place the steamer basket full of bok choy into the bottom and put the lid back on., Peel the garlic and ginger. Then mince them using a sharp knife, garlic press, or microplane grater.


Heat the oil over medium heat in a small frying pan. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for one minute.Remove the pan from the heat.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, sesame oil, soy sauce, and lemon juice. When the ingredients are combined, whisk them into the garlic and ginger mixture.

, Remove the bok choy from the steamer and transfer it to a large bowl. Pour the dressing over top, and toss to coat the bok choy.


Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds onto the bok choy. Divide the salad into four portions and serve.

, You can use an electric grill, charcoal grill, or barbecue. Heat it on medium–high heat.


To make the miso butter, simply mix the miso and butter together in a small bowl with a fork.
You can also use margarine or coconut oil as an alternative to the butter.

, Cut the leaves off the stems of the bok choy. Cut the stems in half lengthwise. Wash the stems and leaves under cold running water, and then pat them dry with a towel.


Cut the leaves into long strips and set them aside in a heat-proof bowl.
Use a butter knife to coat the bok choy stems with the miso butter., Place the bok choy stems cut-side down on the grill and close the lid. Cook for about five minutes, then use tongs or a metal spatula to flip them over.


Cook for another five or six minutes, until both sides are golden brown, tender, and slightly crispy.

, Drizzle oil and lemon juice over the bok choy leaves and toss to coat. Remove the stems from the grill and place them on top of the leaves.


Let the grilled bok choy sit on the leaves for a few moments before serving. This will wilt the leaves and make them tender and warm.

, Add salt and pepper to taste, then divide the grilled bok choy into four servings.,"

Boil the cauliflower for three minutes.,
Immediately submerge the cauliflower in the ice bath.,
Dry the cauliflower once cooled.,
Freeze any cauliflower you do not use immediately.,
Serve the blanched cauliflower or finish cooking it later.",How to Blanch Cauliflower1," Rinse the cauliflower under cool, running water to remove traces of dirt and pesticides. Rubbing the vegetable with your fingers while rinsing makes the process much more effective.;
, Use a sharp knife to remove leaves and thick portions of the main stalk. Cut the florets into pieces about 1 inch (2.5 cm) across so they blanch at a consistent rate.

, Fill a pot 2/3 full of fresh water, allowing at least 1 gallon of water per pound of cut cauliflower (4 liters per 0.5 kg).Set it on the stove at high heat. While waiting for it to boil, move on to the next step.


Using less water than the recommended amount may result in mushy, overcooked cauliflower since the water will take longer to return to a boil once the vegetables are added.

, Fill a large bowl or a second pot with cold water and ice. This will be used to rapidly cool the cauliflower, and will work best if kept at 60ºF (16ºC) or below.Leave enough space in the bowl to avoid overflowing once the cauliflower is added.


If you do not have ice, try cooling tap water in the freezer while the water on the stovetop boils.

, Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the cauliflower pieces. Cover the lid to keep the water hot, so it returns to a boil as quickly as possible.


If you have a wire basket that fits into the pot, this can make the cauliflower easier to remove. If the cauliflower is loose in the water, locate a slotted spoon so you can remove the cauliflower once boiled.

, Optionally, you may add salt to the water at this stage, using 4 teaspoons per gallon of water (5 mL per liter).This may enhance the flavor, but is not recommended if you plan to freeze the cauliflower as salt can break down the cell walls and make the vegetables soft and less flavorful., As soon as the water has returned to a boil, set a timer for three minutes, or note the time on a clock. Once three minutes have elapsed, remove the cauliflower with a slotted spoon.


The cauliflower should emerge partially cooked, but still firm. If it has become soft or mushy, it may not retain its flavor or nutrients for long.
Alternatively, you may drain the cauliflower over a colander or sieve to remove it from the water. However, this prevents you from using the water for an additional purpose, such as blanching the next batch or cooking pasta.

, Place the hot cauliflower florets into the ice bath. This rapid cooling seals in the flavor and nutrients of the vegetable, as well as the color if you are preparing colored cauliflower.

, Once the cauliflower is cold to the touch, remove it from the ice bath and pat dry with a paper towel. Excess water on the surface may break down the cauliflower once it freezes into ice crystals, making this step especially important if you plan to store the cauliflower long term., Once blanched, the cauliflower can typically maintain its high quality for at least 12 months in the freezer. Freeze the pieces on a flat tray first so they do not stick together, then keep them in airtight containers in the freezer.


There is no need to leave additional space in the containers, as cauliflower does not expand in the freezer.

, Though some people enjoy eating blanched cauliflower plain or lightly flavored with salt, the crunchy texture of blanched cauliflower may make it especially suitable as a salad ingredient. If you wish to make the cauliflower softer, boil it for a few minutes longer or add it to a recipe during cooking.


Thaw the cauliflower before thawing or cooking unless you are adding the pieces to a stir fry.

Soak for 10 minutes.,
Dry the chard with a cloth.",How to Clean Swiss Chard1," Fill a large bowl of water with cool water. Carefully wash off each leaf, removing all dirt and grit. Make sure to get into the nooks of the leaves and the stem.Try not to be too rough with the leaves so you don’t tear or bruise them.;
, If you don’t want to fill a bowl, wash the chard in the sink. Turn the water on and stick the leaves under the faucet. Make sure the pressure isn’t too high. Rinse the greens until all dirt and grit is removed., Another way to rinse the chard is with a salad spinner. If you want to cut the chard in small pieces instead of cooking the whole leaves, you can chop it before washing. Take the edge of the chard leaf and roll it into a long tube. Chop the chard into small ribbons. Place the smaller pieces of the leaf into a salad spinner and fill it with water. Let it soak and then pull the basket out. Pour out the dirty water.Replace the basket and spin it to get rid of some of the excess water.

, If you have some time before you have to start cooking, fill your sink with warm water. Submerge the chard in the water. Move it around with your hand and let it soak for a few minutes., If you want to add an extra bit of cleaning, soak the chard in a food acid, like apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, or lime juice.

Serve.",How to Cook Beet Greens2," Start with one bunch of greens, roughly 4 ounces (113 g). Cut off thick stems, or leave a few short pieces if you want bright red streaks in the pesto.Rinse off dirt.


Optionally, add a bunch of fresh basil leaves for a more familiar pesto taste, or a bunch of radish greens for a peppery flavor., This will make the greens and stems a bit less tough. Get your kitchen tongs ready and blanch as follows:


Prepare a bowl of cold water and ice.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then drop the leaves in for 1 minute.
Transfer the greens to the ice bath until cool, then remove.

, Pine nuts or walnuts are the most common options, but you can try pistachio for a more unusual flavor. Shell them, then toast in a dry, hot pan over medium heat, stirring frequently. The nuts are ready when golden brown and aromatic.If the nuts have skins, rub them after toasting with a clean cloth to remove them.


Pine nuts take about 5 minutes.
Walnuts take 10–15 minutes.
Pistachios take 6–8 minutes., Add chopped garlic and toasted nuts to a food processor with a metal blade. Pulse until coarsely ground.

, Tear the leaves into pieces and add them to the processor. Add Parmesan and pulse until coarsely ground. Continue blending as you pour in a thin stream of olive oil, until you get the thick, homogenous texture of pesto.Taste, then blend in salt and pepper as desired.


You may need more or less olive oil than the recipe calls for.
Optionally, complement the pistachio version with 1½ tbsp (22 mL) fennel fronds, 3 tbsp (45 mL) fresh parsley, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) lemon juice., Dip crusty bread into this bold pesto, or add a dollop to creamy soups. Thinned with water, you can use it as a pasta sauce. On homemade pizza, use it instead of tomato sauce and top with slices of roasted beets or other pizza toppings.Store leftovers in the fridge for up to one week.

Serve raw beet greens in salad.,
Add sautéed greens to soup.,
Bake leaves into crisp chips.",How to Cook Beet Greens3," Raw beet greens have an even stronger flavor, so they're best paired with other powerful ingredients. Mix with feta, Romano cheese, goat cheese, or anchovies. Tahini, strawberry vinaigrette, or another strong or acidic dressing complements this salad well.


Beet greens become more bitter and tough as they age. When serving raw, it's best to stick with the young greens sold in late spring or early summer., Sauté with other aromatic ingredients, then mix it into the soup for the last couple minutes of simmering. This works well in thick soups made from lentils or a cream base.

, These chips are a little thicker and taste a bit ""plantier"" than other leaf green vegetables. But if you've converted to the beet green fans and want them on the go, this is a great recipe:Preheat oven to 350ºF (175ºC).
Cut off stems, wash and pat dry the leaves.
Toss leaves with a light coating of olive oil. Add salt and pepper if desired (taste first; beet greens are already salty).
Bake on parchment paper-lined pans for 15 minutes, turn, and bake for 10 more minutes.

Check whether blanching is necessary.,
Begin when the head of the cauliflower is about the size of a chicken egg.,
Blanch when the plant is dry.,
Gently bend the outer leaves over the curd.,
Tie the leaves loosely in this position.,
Check on your cauliflower plants daily to make adjustments.,
Harvest the plants.",How to Blanch Cauliflower2," If you are growing purple or green cauliflower varieties, you do not need to blanch the plants. Some white varieties, including Snow Crown and Early Snowball, are ""self-blanching.""In these plants, the leaves should grow over the edible white section naturally, and only need to be blanched manually if this fails to occur.

, The edible head, or ""curd,"" of the cauliflower plant, typically reaches this stage four or more weeks after planting.But check every one or two days as different varieties develop at different rates. Once the white curd is approximately the size of a chicken egg, or about 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) in diameter, move on to the next step.

, If possible, blanch during dry weather and warm, sunny conditions when there is little or no moisture on the curd.Too much moisture trapped on the curd can cause rot or fungal infection.

, Take the largest, outer leaves and bend them over the curd. Shade the curd from most of the sun, especially directly above the curd, but allow small gaps between the leaves for air circulation, to prevent moisture. Curve them around the plant in a rounded ball shape. Tuck the leaf tips underneath leaves on the opposite side when possible, to help keep them in position.


Bunching them together in a vertical position, rather than using the correct rounded shape, can cause rainwater to collect between them and rot the plant.Don't worry if the leaves snap partway through while bending.

, Use soft twine, large rubber bands, or gardening tape to hold the leaves over the developing, white curd. Keep this relatively loose to allow for growth, but tight enough that the leaves won't easily slip out.


Avoid the use of wire or other sharp material, which may cut through the leaves.

, You may need to tie a cauliflower plant again if the leaves slip out, which may occur as the curd grows. You may need to keep checking less developed plants for curd growth as well, and blanch those once they reach the correct size.

, While the exact conditions for harvesting depends on the cauliflower variety, as a general rule the plant is harvested once the curd reaches 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.Cut the stalk beneath some of the outer leaves, taking care not to bruise the curd. Soak in lightly salted water for 30 minutes to drive out insects, then store in a closed container in the refrigerator.Growth may take anywhere from four days to 21 days after the curd first appears. The warmer the weather, the faster it should grow.

Clean right before eating.,
Keep refrigerated for a week.,
Cut away the stems.",How to Clean Swiss Chard2," Some people wash the Swiss chard before storing it in the refrigerator. However, it might be best to clean Swiss chard right before you plan to cook it. This keeps any excess moisture from accumulating on the leaves, which can lead to wilting and mold., Swiss chard can be stored in your refrigerator for five to seven days after washing. Store it in a plastic bag in the vegetable bin. To make Swiss chard last longer than seven days, make sure it is completely dry so it will last longer or don't wash it before placing it in the fridge. You also can store it without washing to make it last longer. Chard can last up to two weeks if stored properly.If you wash the chard before placing it in the refrigerator, let it drain in a colander or dry it with a cloth to remove the moisture.

, Prepare the chard after washing so it will be ready to cook later in the week. Cut off any spots you see on the leaves. Fold the leaf in half and cut away the stems. Then store it so it will be ready when you want to cook it.The stems are edible and can be quite tasty. They are tougher than the leaves, so they require a longer cooking time. This is why separating the stems and leaves is important.

Collard greens are large in size, usually at least 10 to 12 inches long, with oval, flat leaves.In comparison to kale, the leaves are usually wider and the stems are thicker.If you are unsure about which greens in your store are collard greens, look for signage to indicate or markings on the ties that keep bunches of collards together. You can also feel free to ask someone who works there.;
, Many grocery stores will carry collard greens on a regular basis in the produce section, close to other greens, such as kale or Swiss chard. They should be located in a chilled area, which will keep them firm.


Look for the freshest collards to show up in your store in winter through spring. They will also be at their lowest price during these times of year., If you can't find collard greens in your normal grocery store, you may need to go to a specialty store. Stores that cater to African Americans are likely to carry collard greens, as they have an important place in African American food culture.There are other cultures that use collard greens in their cooking. Collards can be found in dishes all across the globe, from Ethiopia to Portugal, so they may be available in a wide variety of specialty stores., The leaves of collard greens should be a very dark green. However, the leaves will have light colored veins and stems.


The leaves of collard greens can have almost a waxy finish, which is a natural way they deter insects., Good collard greens are firm and crisp.Firmness will show you that the collard greens are relatively fresh and that they have been stored properly in the store, as well as while being transported from the field to the store.


Pick up the greens and bend them a little bit. They should be firm and not floppy.

, Discoloration is a sign that the collard greens are past their prime. Even though you may be stewing the greens, buying collard greens that are discolored will result in a sub-par finished product.


In a bunch of collard greens there may be one or two leaves that were slightly damaged and thus are a bit discolored. It's also not uncommon to have a few holes in collard greens due to hungry bugs. If the majority of the leaves look good, however, then the collards are probably just fine to purchase., Once you purchase the collard greens, you will want to store them in a plastic bag in your refrigerator. This keeps them nice and firm, as the plastic bag prevents dehydration.Do not wash the collard greens before you put them in the refrigerator. This will promote decay.

, Collard greens are known for being relatively dirty and gritty when they are harvested. Because of this, you will need to clean them thoroughly before cooking them. To do this, soak then in a sink full of water and rub them vigorously to remove any dirt and debris.Don't just neglect looking at each individual leaf. Make sure each individual leaf is cleaned or you may end up with dirt and girt in your meal.

, There are a variety of ways that you can use collard greens, but most traditionally they are stewed or boiled in water with a piece of bacon, ham hock, or pork and some salt.This process takes quite awhile, some recipes state upwards of two hours, so that the collards become nice and silky and so that they take on the flavor of the pork.


Before you cook the greens you will need to cut them into smaller pieces. Remove the stems from the center of the leaves. Then roll up the remaining leaf pieces and cut them into one inch wide ribbons.There is a wide variety of other ways you can use collard greens.To begin experimenting with them in your cooking remember that any way you would use cabbage or other greens, such as kale, in a recipe, you can use collard greens instead.

Know that lemons will never truly ripen once you take them off the tree.,
Try placing an under-ripe lemon in a bright location in your kitchen.,
Understand that color is not a good indicator of ripeness.,
Don't let an under-ripe lemon go to waste.",How to Ripen Lemons1," They may turn more yellow and grow softer, but they will not necessarily become sweeter or juicier. If you get an under-ripe lemon and leave it on your counter, it may turn more yellow but it will still taste bitter.;
, The ideal place would be on your kitchen counter, away from direct sunlight. After a few days, the lemon will turn more yellow. Keep in mind, however, that this will not actually ripen the lemon on the inside; the lemon may still taste bitter and under-ripe even though it is yellow. It will, however, still work well as a garnish if you want to add some color to a dish or drink.

, A greenish lemon does not necessarily mean that it is not yet ripe. You can still have a ripe lemon, even if it looks a little green.This is because lemons ripen from the inside out. The flesh ripens first, then the skin.If you find yourself with an under-ripe lemon, try cutting it open anyway and tasting it. You could also follow the steps listed in this method for determining whether or not a lemon is ripe.

, Instead, consider using it to clean, or as an air fresher.


You can make an effective rust and tarnish busting scrub by mixing salt and lemon juice into a paste.
Add a few slices of lemon into a pot of simmering water. You can also add a few other fragrant herbs to compliment the lemon, such as rosemary.

Serve.",How to Blanch Broccoli1," Wash and cut the broccoli down to the desired size. Try to make all of your florets the same size to ensure they will all cook at the same rate.






;
, Fill a large heavy pot 2/3 of the way full with water. Cover the pot and place it on the stove over high heat.









Once the water has begun to boil add 1 tablespoon of salt to the water. Adding salt to boiling water not only adds some seasoning to the water, but it also increases the boiling point of the water. This in turn assists in cooking your food more efficiently!, While you are waiting for your pot of water to boil, fill a large bowl with cold water and a few ice cubes. Set it aside.








, Once your pot of water begins to boil, carefully place the cut broccoli into the boiling water. Begin counting blanching time once the water returns to a boil.









For florets that are approximately 1½"" across, cook for about 3 minutes. Adjust cooking time accordingly for different sized florets.
The broccoli should be bright green and firm (though slightly softened) when you remove it.

, Either remove the broccoli with a slotted spoon or small sieve or drain the broccoli in a colander. Immediately place the broccoli in the ice bath to stop the cooking process.









Remove the cooled florets from the cold water after 30 seconds and strain them again in the colander.

, As with other vegetables, blanching your broccoli can be the primary cooking method or it can be the first step before sauteing or stir-frying.









Secondary cooking methods (such as sauteing) primarily add flavor to vegetables and don't usually cook the vegetables as thoroughly as needed. Blanching is a great way to pre-cook vegetables to be added to sauté and stir-fry's.

Cut the lemon in half.,
Cut a very thin layer off the base of the lemon half.,
Cut around most of the top edge of the lemon half:


Use a paring knife or citrus cutter to peel away a small 5mm/ 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) strip of lemon peel from the top edge of the lemon half.,
Tie the strip into a neat knot.,
Done.",How to Cut a Lemon Half with a Knot,";
, This is to enable the lemon half to sit unaided.

,
While cutting, angle the knife or cutter slightly inward.
Don't cut the whole way––leave the peeled strip intact when you reach the other side of the circle.

, Curl the peel around and make the knot as for any knot. Don't pull it tight––leave a large loop above the knot, sticking into the air above the lemon half. The loose end should be neatly tucked below the lower half of the knot. The end result looks like half a vertically tied shoelace.

, The garnish is now ready to add to a plate for display and use on the food. Repeat as many times as needed for the remaining lemon halves you wish to use.

Know what your tree requires to be healthy and bear healthy fruit.,
Be aware that lemons may take a while to ripen.,
Make sure that the tree is planted in a warm, sunny location.,
Make sure that the soil is well-drained.,
Check the pH of the soil.,
Water the tree well, but allow the soil to dry before you water it again.Plan on letting the first 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters) of soil dry out first before you water the tree again.,
Feed the tree regularly with plant food.,
Know that indoor trees also need to be pollinated.,
Check for disease.",How to Ripen Lemons2," Is your tree bearing fruit, but they are not ripening? Lemon trees need plenty of sunlight and lots of water. They also need to be pruned to allow for better air circulation. Without these, the fruit won't ripen. This section will give you some tips on how to get your tree's fruit to ripen. It will also tell you when you can expect the lemons to ripen.

, Plan to pick lemons at least four months after the flowers bloom.Some lemons may take up to nine months to ripen. Once a lemon is ripe, however, it can stay on the tree for several weeks.Lemon trees need to mature before they can bear ripe fruit. Some lemon trees may bear fruit sooner, but the fruit won't be ripe. In general, lemon trees produce ripe fruit after they are three years old.If your tree is bearing fruit, but they never ripen, check the tree's age.
Expect lemons to be ripe between late November and mid-January. Try to harvest your crop before mid-January, or you will risk hampering the following year's harvest., Not only does the tree need sunlight to grow, but the fruit need sunlight to turn yellow. If you are growing your tree indoors, consider keeping next to a window, ideally a south-facing one. Lemon trees need six to eight hours of sunlight each day.Lemon trees also need warmth, and grow best when temperatures average at 70°F (21°C) during the day and 55°F (13°C) at night. Keep in mind that they will usually go into dormancy when temperatures fall below 55 F. (13 C.), Lemon trees love water, but they do not like to stand in it. Make sure that the soil is well-drained. You can also plant the tree on a slight mount. This will prevent water logging., If the lemons have been green for a long time, it could be a sign that the tree is not healthy. Check the pH using a pH testing kit, which you can purchase from your local nursery or gardening shop. Lemon trees need a soil that has a pH of 6.0 to 7.5., Avoid over-watering the tree, and do not let it sit in water. This could encourage rot, mold, and disease.For the same reasons, do not mulch lemon (or any citrus) trees. Mulch will only hold moisture against the roots, increasing the probability of root rot. Most home citrus gardeners also keep the area under the drip line of the tree free of weeds and grass to promote better evaporation of any standing water.

, Choose a plant food made specifically for citrus trees, as it will have all the necessary nutrients. Lemon trees use up a lot of energy to grow and to produce leaves, flowers, and fruit. An under-nourished lemon tree won't have the energy to produce healthy fruit, which could prevent the tree from ripening.


Lemon trees need a lot of nitrogen to grow. The fertilizer should contain more nitrogen than phosphorus or potassium., Lemon trees growing outside get pollinated by birds and insects. A tree growing in your home won't have that opportunity, and it may not produce ripe fruit, if any at all. To pollinate your indoor lemon tree, use a Q-tip to move pollen from one flower to the next one., If your tree's lemons just aren't ripening, you might want to check your tree for other signs of stress or disease. Check the tree for any signs of dead leaves or branches. Also, check the leaves for any signs of fungus or mold; they usually appear as black or white blotches. Another sign of disease is yellow blotches on the leaves.

Look for a lemon that has a bright, yellow color.,
Choose a lemon that is heavy for its size.,
Check the firmness.,
Look for lemons that have a smooth or glossy texture.,
Know how to pick lemons off of trees.,
Taste the lemon to test whether or not it is truly ripe.",How to Ripen Lemons3," Because lemons don't really ripen once they are picked, it's best to pick the right lemon from the start. This section will give you a few tips on what to look for when selecting lemons. Once you know what to look for, you will be less-likely to choose and be stuck with an under-ripe lemon.

, Keep in mind, however, that lemons ripen from the inside. This means that the lemon's skin will be the last part to ripen. You can still have a lemon that is ripe and juicy on the inside, and greenish on the outside.Myer lemons will have a deeper yellow color; some might be more orange.

, This means that the lemon is filled with a lot of juice. Most lemons will be between 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long., The ideal lemon should be firm, yet somewhat tender. A lemon that is too hard will be either under-ripe or shriveled inside.Myer lemons have a thinner skin than regular lemons. They are ripe when they are soft. If you can push the skin of the lemon in more than ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) it may be over-ripe., Lemons that have too much of a bumpy texture will be under-ripe or not juicy enough. Another thing to look for is a waxy shine on the surface of the lemon.Watch out for wrinkling. This is a sign your lemon is overripe.

, If you are harvesting lemons from a tree, you might want to put on a pair of gardening gloves; lemon trees often have thorns that can scratch you if you are not careful. Find a ripe fruit and grasp it in your hand. Gently twist it.The lemon should come off easily If it doesn't come off easily, then it probably is not ripe yet.

, If you are looking to harvest a bunch of lemons, but aren't sure whether or not they are ripe, you can always cut one in half and taste it. Most lemons will have a sour, but not bitter, taste to them. Meyer lemons, however, will be a little more sweet and less sour.


Use a refractometer if you don’t want to test by taste, sight, or touch. Squeeze a drop of juice from the lemon onto the refractometer and look at the Brix scale. Pick lemons that have a sucrose level between 6 and 12, with 8 to 12 percent being the best.

Clean and prepare your broccoli.,
Prep for steaming.,
Time your steam cooking.,
Stop the cooking process.,
Complete the blanching.",How to Blanch Broccoli2," Cut the broccoli down into consistently-sized florets for uniform cooking.








, Fill a large pot with 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of water and bring to a boil. Place your vegetables in a stem basket that sits above the water line. Cover the pot and prepare an ice water bath, as above.









Try to arrange the florets in a single layer to ensure the steam reaches all parts of the broccoli evenly.

, When steam begin to escape, begin counting your blanching time.









Steam blanching broccoli takes approximately 5 minutes.
About half-way through the cooking time, remove the lid and make sure the broccoli is not clumping together and that it is all cooking evenly.

, Once your broccoli has been blanched, remove the steam basket from the pot and immediately place the broccoli into the ice water bath.








, After the broccoli has cooled in the ice water, drain the broccoli in a colander and allow the florets to dry before eating or packing for freezing.

If your oven runs a little hot, set your oven to 350°F (177°C), and if it runs a little cool, set to 375°F (191°C). Preheating usually takes about 15 minutes., Coat the bottom and sides of your casserole dish or roaster pan with cooking spray. Spread your cabbage evenly in the bottom of your dish. Drizzle olive oil over the cabbage. Lightly toss the cabbage to evenly distribute the oil., Arrange 1 to 2 pats of butter on top of the cabbage. Encourage a better distribution of butter by breaking pats into chunks and spreading these over the cabbage, or by using more pats of butter. Add salt and pepper to taste.


To give your baked cabbage some kick, lightly sprinkle some crushed red pepper flakes over the it. Toss the cabbage to distribute the flakes., This will prevent the cabbage from becoming too dry while it bakes. Do not overfill the pan.

Pick out fresh corn with the husk still on.,
Trim the corn, if necessary.,
Place the ears in the microwave.,
Microwave the corn.,
Remove the corn from the microwave and let it rest.,
Remove the husk and silk.,
Dress your corn.",How to Microwave Corn on the Cob1," You will find fresh ears of corn with the husk on in grocery stores during the summer. You can also try a farmer's market or even grow your own. Make sure each ear still has the husk around it and that it is ripe. Here's how you can check for ripeness:









Look for corn with tassels, or strings, that are brown and sticky instead of dry and yellow. Brown, sticky tassels means the corn is ripe.Squeeze the ear gently to feel the kernels through the husk. They should feel plump and firm, but not hard as little pebbles.
Try to buy only what you can eat within a few days, and keep it refrigerated so that the sugar in the corn kernels does not have time to get starchy and overripe.If you have too much corn on hand after a harvest, you can always freeze it.;
, Trim the ends to make sure that the corn ears will fit easily in the microwave. Remove any very loose or dry leaves. Snip off excess silk. You may also want to take a damp paper towel and wipe dirt from the leaves although these will be removed later.








, Most microwaves will fit up to three ears at at time. If you have a very large microwave, you might be able to fit a few more. In order to ensure that the corn cooks evenly, each ear should be near the center of the microwave without touching the other ears.

To ensure even exposure and heating of each ear, arrange the ears in a triangle for three ears, or a square for four ears.
Make sure the ears are not touching each other. Do not pile them up or let them overlap, or you may end up with under-cooked corn.

, Microwave the corn on high for three to five minutes, depending on how many ears you have. If you have just one ear, start with three, and if you have up to four ears, cook them for five minutes.









If you are cooking several ears at once, you can stop the cooking halfway through and turn the ears over to make sure they cook evenly.
Depending on the size of the corn, you can factor in two to four minutes cooking time per ear.

, Allow the corn to sit in its husk for a minute or so it is cool enough to handle, distribute its heat and continue to cook.









The husk itself contains little water, so it will remain relatively cool.

However, the water in the corn will be steaming hot and can burn you. Be cautious and use oven mitts or tongs to handle hot corn.
Check that it is done by peeling back the husk and feeling or even nibbling a few kernels to test the temperature and the springiness of the kernels. Lay the husk back down and return it to the microwave to cook longer if necessary.
If the corn is scorched or mushy, it is overcooked – use less time in the future.

, The corn ear and its dense, watery stalk will be hot after cooking, staying hot inside the husk. Peel the corn carefully so as to avoid burning yourself. The husk and silk will come right off.








, Roll it in butter and season it with salt and pepper if you like. Allow it to cool before eating. Alternatively, sprinkle some grated cheddar or cotija cheese across its surface. Sour cream with a sprinkle of red pepper is another tasty topping









Microwaved corn is fresh and delicious; it can be eaten with your hands or using special corn cob tools.
Alternatively, you can remove the kernels for a side dish or to use in another recipe. Stand the corn on its end and run a knife down the sides to remove the kernels.

"
"
Select fresh corn whenever you can.,
Look for bright green husks.,
Check the corn kernels.,
Try to buy corn from a local grower.",How to Boil Corn on the Cob1," When corn is not in season, you can buy it frozen at the grocery store, but for best results, boil corn when it is fresh.






;
, Husks are the papery outer covering. They should fit the ear of corn and not be falling off or pulling away.








, They should be in tight, symmetric rows. Ripe corn will have plump kernels that are yellow and white.








, If you do not have a farmer's market or access to freshly picked corn, check the selection at your grocery store.

They will stay together for neat disposal. Pick off the individual strands of silk that remain stuck to the corn. Another way to shuck the corn is by cutting the harder end of the corn which makes the husk come away automatically.









Do not dispose of the husk and silk in a garbage disposal, since they are so fibrous. Throw them in the trash or compost them.
A fun craft for children or the young at heart are creating corn husk dolls.

Either Leave the stem on for a handle, or tear it off with the husk.

, You may cover the corn with a wet paper towel or put it in a dish with a microwave safe lid. You can also use a clean tea or kitchen towel.









Add a teaspoon of water to the dish to prevent the corn from drying as it cooks.
At this stage you can add flavors or toppings that will cook right into the corn. Try shredded cheese, lemon or lime juice, or any number of spices.
You can soak the paper towel with liquid flavorings like lemon or lime juice to gently enhance the flavor of the corn without making a mess.

, Arrange the ears in a single layer with space between the cobs for even cooking. Microwave the corn on high for up to five minutes, depending on how many ears you're cooking. Each ear requires two to four minutes of cooking time, with more time added if you're microwaving several ears of corn.








, This typically takes 5-10 minutes., Alternatively, sprinkle some grated cheddar or cotija cheese across its surface. Sour cream with a sprinkle of red pepper is another tasty topping.

Husk the corn just before you boil it to ensure freshness.,
Peel the green husks away from the corn.,
Take off the silk, which is the thin, silvery hairs that are attached to the corn.",How to Boil Corn on the Cob2,"









Try not to husk the corn at the grocery store. Most retailers set up large trash bins for you to husk the corn and take it away with its kernels exposed. Unless you are going to boil it as soon as you get home, keep the corn in its husk.

, There might be several layers to take off. You can discard these or add them to your compost pile if you have a garden.








,









Wipe down the corn with a damp paper towel. This will help you remove the silk, which can be time consuming and frustrating because they are so thin and determined to cling to the corn.

Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil.








,
Place the corn in the pot and wait for the water to return to a boil.,
Remove the corn from the water with tongs as soon as it begins to boil again.",How to Boil Corn on the Cob3," Make sure you use a pot that can accommodate the amount of corn you plan to boil.









Add a little sugar to the water if you want to sweeten your corn while it cooks. Never add salt to the water you use to boil corn on the cob. Salt will make the corn tough.

,,









Cover the pot while you wait for the water and corn to boil. This will help the water heat faster and it will also contain the corn, which tends to float to the top of the pot.

, This usually takes from 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the size of your pot.









Resist the temptation to let the corn sit in the boiling water for a while. This will result in overcooked corn. You want your corn on the cob to be crisp and tender, not soft and mushy.
Allow the corn to boil for up to 10 minutes if you prefer a soft corn. People with dental issues might prefer corn that is more pliable and easy to chew.

Bring a saucepan filled with water to the boil.,
Place the corn in the water for 2-3 minutes.,
Strain the corn over the sink.",How to Cook Frozen Corn1," Take a saucepan and fill it at least half way full with water. You will need a large amount of water in order to be sure that the corn is fully submerged. Place the pan on high heat until boiling, then reduce the heat until the water is simmering.


Be sure to season your water with a little salt, especially if this is the only method you will be using to cook the corn.;
, Once the water is simmering, place the corn in the saucepan. Stir with a wooden spoon to make sure the corn does not stick together and will cook evenly.Remove a kernel or two from the water with the spoon after 2 to 4 minutes to check that the corn is tender.

, Take a sieve and place or hold it over your sink. Pour all of the contents of your saucepan through the sieve, letting the boiling water drain and the cooked corn remain in the sieve. Once strained, season as you desire.

You can use the knife to squeeze out the juices., In a small bowl, mix the sugar and flour together. You can also add the salt and pepper at this point. Add it to the corn and mix., Add the cream and water to the corn, and mix it again., Put the grease into a skillet, and heat it over medium heat. Pour in the corn, and reduce the heat to medium-low.It's difficult to find a substitute for bacon grease in this recipe, as it has such a unique flavor. To make bacon grease, simply cook a strip or two of bacon. The grease is the fat that renders out of the bacon while you cook.However, you could substitute more butter for the bacon grease. If you do, consider also adding a tablespoon or two of Parmesan, along with a dash or two of liquid smoke. That way, you get both the saltiness and smokiness of the bacon. You could use some smoked paprika in place of the liquid smoke, as well., Heat the mixture until it thickens. Add the butter before serving."

Enjoy.",How to Cook Corn on the Cob in the Oven1," Meanwhile, place one of the interior racks into the center position of the oven.Note that you do not need to prepare a baking sheet for the corn. For this method, you'll need to place the ears of corn directly onto the oven rack. Do not cover the oven rack in aluminum foil, either.;
, Quickly clean the outer husks by rinsing them beneath cool, running water. Use your fingers to scrub away any visible dirt or debris.


Do not remove the husks from the ears of corn.
If there are any silks hanging out of the ends or leaves peeling away from the sides, use clean kitchen scissors to trim them away.

, Arrange the ears of corn in a single layer directly on the center rack. Cook the corn until it becomes tender.If there's another oven rack above the center rack, you can let it remain in place as long as it does not come into contact with the corn. If it does, you should remove it completely or move it to a position beneath the center rack.
Try to keep the corn in a single layer. If you need to stack it, you may need to increase the overall cooking time. You'll also need to make sure that the pile of corn does not touch the upper heating element of the oven.
To check for doneness, gently squeeze the sides of the ear. It should be firm, yet soft enough to press through the husk.

, Remove the finished corn from the oven and let it cool for several minutes. When the husks are cool enough to touch, carefully peel them down from each ear.


Consider holding the base of each ear with an oven mitt before peeling down the husks. Also note that the steam escaping from the corn will be very hot, so you should never point the ears directly at your face.
You can wrap the husks around the base of each ear to serve as a handle or remove them completely. The choice is yours to make.

, Brush the corn on the cob with melted butter or olive oil, if desired, and consider seasoning it with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley to taste. Serve the finished corn on the cob while it's still hot.

The hot fat will make sure that your corn cooks in the fat rather than absorbing it., Add the corn once the fat is hot and begin to stir with a wooden spoon. This method of cooking frozen corn will require you to stir frequently to avoid burning the corn., Stir the corn in the skillet until tender or until the corn has achieved the desired color. Frozen corn should become tender in a skillet in only a few minutes, however, you may need to continue cooking the corn, for about 10-12 minutes, if you would like to brown, or caramelize, the corn., Place a paper towel on a plate or cutting board. Pour the cooked corn onto the paper towel to further remove any of the excess butter or oil. Draining the corn should only take 1-2 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare four sheets of aluminum foil, sizing each so that it is 1-1/2 times as large as any one ear of corn.If there's another rack sitting above the center rack, you can leave it in place as long as it will not block or touch the ears of corn once they're in the oven. If this problem does occur, you'll need to remove the top rack or place it beneath the center rack.

, Peel the husks down from each ear of corn, removing them completely. Snap off the stem at the base of the ear.


Rinse the exposed cobs of corn under cool, running water while using your hands to gently scrub the corn and remove as many silks as possible. Dry with clean paper towels when finished.

, Center each ear of corn over one sheet of aluminum foil. Brush the corn with butter or oil, then add salt, pepper, and chopped parsley as desired.


Melting the butter beforehand may make it easier to spread evenly over the ear of corn, but doing so is not strictly necessary since the butter will melt over the corn as it roasts.
Sprinkle any seasonings over all sides of each ear to distribute them evenly.

, Loosely fold the foil around the corn, then fold and pinch the sides together to create a seal.


Arrange the wrapped corn on an uncovered, ungreased baking sheet. Keep the corn in a single layer; if possible, do not stack the ears.

, Place the corn in the preheated oven and bake the ears until they feel thoroughly hot and tender-crisp.


After the first 10 minutes, rotate the baking sheet to promote even cooking on all sides of the corn.
Check the corn after 20 minutes by carefully squeezing the sides of the foil. Wear an oven mitt as you do this to protect your hands. When ready, the corn should give a little through the foil without breaking or feeling mushy.

, Remove the finished corn from the oven. Allow it to cool for several seconds, then carefully unwrap the foil from around the ears.


The foil will likely release very hot steam as you unwrap it. To protect yourself against burns, do not hover your face or arms over the corn while removing the foil.
After unwrapping the corn, poke one of the kernels with your fingernail or a fork. When ready, the juice should shoot out from the kernel when pierced.If this doesn't happen, you may need to loosely wrap the corn and return it to the oven for another few minutes.

, The roasted corn on the cob should be ready to serve. Eat it while it's still hot to enjoy the best flavor and texture.

Preheat the broiler.,
Peel and wrap the husks.,
Coat the corn with oil and seasonings.,
Broil for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Enjoy.",How to Cook Corn on the Cob in the Oven3," Switch on the broiler setting of your oven and allow the heating element to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes.


Some broilers only have on and off settings, while others also have high and low settings. If yours is the latter, switch the broiler onto high.
Place the upper oven rack roughly 6 inches (15 cm) away from the upper heating element of the oven. This upper heating element is the only portion that turns on when you use the broiler.

, Peel the husks back, revealing the entire ear of corn, but do not remove them. Instead, use scissors to cut the husks down to a length of roughly 4 inches (10 cm), then wrap the hanging husks in aluminum foil.


Pick away any hanging silks during this step, as well.
Wrapping the husks with foil is a necessary step. If you don't do this, the husks will quickly burn under the intense heat of the broiler and may even catch on fire.
If you don't wish to use the husks and stem as handles while serving the corn, you can remove them completely.

, Arrange the ears of corn in single layer on a baking sheet, then drizzle them with olive oil. If desired, you may also season the corn with salt and pepper.


You can cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.
Note that olive oil is a better choice than butter for this method since it has a higher smoking point and will be less likely to overheat in the broiler.

, Place the ears of corn under the preheated broiler. Watch the corn carefully, and rotate the ears each time the kernels on that side begin charring.


You'll need to rotate the after the first 3 to 5 minutes, then twice more every 3 to 5 minutes after that. When ready, the corn should be lightly and evenly charred, and tender throughout.
Note that you can also remove the foil from around the husks during the last 2 minutes, if desired, so that they can char lightly without burning.

, Remove the corn from the oven and sprinkle it with chopped parsley, if desired. Serve it while it's still hot.

Preheat the broiler.,
Cut each ear into four sections.,
Brush the corn with oil and sprinkle with seasonings.,
Broil for 6 to 10 minutes, flipping once.,
Enjoy.",How to Cook Corn on the Cob in the Oven4," Turn on the broiler portion of your oven and allow it to preheat for at least 5 minutes.


If your broiler has high and low settings, switch it onto high. Note that some broilers only have on and off settings; in this case, the general on setting is fine.
Make sure that the upper rack of the oven is about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the top heating element., Completely remove the husks and all visible threads from the ears of corn. Use a knife to chop each ear into four equal sections.


Depending on the thickness of the corn, it may be possible to break the ears apart by hand instead of using a knife. Doing so will give you less control over the size of the sections, though, making it harder to keep the sections even.

, Arrange the corn cob sections on a large baking sheet covered with aluminum foil. Lightly brush each section with oil or melted butter, and sprinkle the corn with salt and pepper (if desired).


Since olive oil has a higher smoking point than butter, it's usually the safer option for the broiler. Since the corn should cook quickly when sectioned, though, you should also be able to use butter without much trouble.

, Place the corn beneath the preheated broiler. Cook the cob sections for 3 to 5 minutes, or until some of the kernels begin to char, then flip them over to their other sides. Continue cooking until the other sides char, as well.


Consider brushing the other sides with additional oil and butter before returning them to the broiler. Note that doing so may result in more splatter inside your oven, though.

, Remove the corn cob sections from the oven and let them cool slightly. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley, if desired, and serve the corn hot.

Set up to four ears of corn in the microwave.,
Microwave for at least three minutes.,
Let the corn cool.,
Shuck just before serving.",How to Cook Corn in the Microwave1," Cooking whole, raw corn on the cob is a cinch. Gather your corn (husks on) and set them in the microwave. You may place them on a paper towel or a microwave-safe plate, but as long as the husks are on and your microwave is clean, this isn't required. If you're cooking more than four ears, limit yourself to batches of four at a time — many microwaves will have trouble heating more than four at once.Don't take the husks off yet. If you've already done this, your corn isn't ruined, but leaving the husks on will help keep the ears moist and delicious.You can wrap the ears in a paper towel if desired to duplicate the effect of the husks.;
, Set your microwave to ""HIGH"" or its default cooking setting for between three and five minutes. Depending on the number of ears you're cooking, the precise cooking time can vary — one online source recommends three minutes for one or two ears and four minutes for three or four ears.Because microwaves can vary in terms of cooking strength, you may find that it's a good idea to cook a little less time than you think you need to, then check on the corn. You can always cook the corn for an extra minute or two if needed, but you can't ""undo"" the damage once it's overdone.

, After a few minutes in the microwave, the ears' outer husks may not feel terribly hot, but the insides are likely piping hot. To avoid injury, set the corn (husks still on) on a wire cooling rack for about five minutes to cool. You're ready to proceed when the silks (the stringy part inside the husk) and the tops of the leaves are cool enough to handle with your bare hands., One of the benefits of leaving the husks on (besides preserving the internal moisture of the ears of corn) is that they act like insulators, keeping the kernels fairly warm. As soon as you take the husks off, however, the kernels will start to cool much more rapidly, so wait until right before you're ready to eat to do your shucking.


Be careful while you shuck the corn — the insides can still be hot. If you're unsure, peel back the husk a little bit and carefully feel the kernels with the back of your hand. For a step-by-step guide, see our corn-husking article.

Cover and cook for approximately four minutes.,
Remove from microwave, stir, and serve.",How to Cook Corn in the Microwave2," Cooking corn off-the-cob (whether it's from a can or cut from the cob itself) is easy with a microwave. Start by draining the corn of any excess liquid — you want your finished product to be soft, delicious corn kernels, not corn soup. See below for instructions.



Canned corn: Open the can with a can opener until the lid is connected by just a small piece of metal. Tip the can into the sink, keeping the lid on, and let the excess liquid drain. Remove the lid and pour the corn into a strainer, then rinse with water and allow to drain.

Refrigerated corn: Draining is less of an issue here because there will usually be less excess moisture. Toss the corn lightly in a strainer or use a slotted spoon to drain the corn.

, Season your corn now for a delicious taste as soon as it comes out of the microwave! Salt and pepper give the sweet corn kernels an excellent savory dimension, while butter keeps them moist and gives a smooth texture.


You may use as much salt, pepper, and butter as you wish. If you're unsure, adding about one tablespoon of butter for every 12-ounce can of corn (the equivalent of about 1.5 cups of loose corn) and salt and pepper to taste should give great results.

, Making sure that your corn is in a microwave-safe container, transfer it to the microwave and cook it on ""HIGH"" or your preferred setting for about three minutes. Stop the microwave and stir every minute or so to ensure the butter and seasonings are combining well.


Don't use an airtight cover or lid — you want to keep the moisture in, but if steam builds up in an airtight container, it can cause an explosion. Leave the lid oven a crack to allow excess steam to escape.

, Carefully remove the corn from the microwave, take the lid off, and check to see that the corn has heated evenly. If so, stir the mixture and serve immediately. If not, feel free to return it to the microwave for a minute or two.


If you are cooking a large amount of corn (more than a can or two), be ready to microwave for a little extra time. In general, the more food you microwave at once, the longer it will take to cook.

Enjoy!

",How to Cook Corn in the Microwave3," Open your packet of frozen corn and pour it into a large microwave-safe bowl. If you like, you can break up any clumps of frozen-together kernels to ensure the corn cooks more evenly, but this is not required.

, At this point, you can add a small amount of water to the bowl if you would like your corn slightly softer when it's done. The extra water will boil and steam the corn as it cooks, breaking it down a little more than it would from ordinary cooking and giving it a softer texture.


You may add as much or as little water as you want — you can always drain excess water after you're done if you add too much. A good general rule is to use about two tablespoons of water for every pound (16 ounces) of frozen corn you use., Set your microwave to ""HIGH"" or your preferred cooking setting and let the corn heat for about four or five minutes. Every minute or two, pause the microwave and stir the corn to ensure even heating.



Note: These directions assume you're using about one pound (16 ounces) of frozen corn. If you're using significantly less, you may want to shorten this cooking period to about two or three minutes to ensure your corn does not burn or dry out., After the first cooking period, check your corn. Depending on how much corn you used and the strength of your microwave, it may or may not be evenly-heated at this point. If you detect cold spots, stir the corn and return it to the microwave to cook in two-minute intervals. Repeat this pattern until your corn is all the way cooked.

, When your corn has heated evenly and no icy spots remain, it's ready to eat! At this point, you can add whatever seasonings you want and enjoy.


For one pound of corn, about a tablespoon and a half of butter and salt and pepper to taste will give an excellent ""classic"" savory flavor.
There may be some excess water at the bottom of your corn from the melted ice when you finish microwaving. If this is the case, you can carefully pour it into the sink (taking care to avoid touching it, as it will likely be hot) or toss the corn in a strainer to remove it.

",How to Cook Fresh Cauliflower," The florets shouldn’t have gaps, and the leaves should extend over the top. White cauliflower stays colorless because the leaves cover the florets, keeping them away from the sun.;
, Avoid any curds that are browning or discolored in spots. This is an indication that they have been on the shelf too long.


If you are buying a purple, green or orange variety, look for browning on the leaves and base of the curd.
The brighter green the better.

, Use a sharp knife to peel the tough skin away from the turnips. If the turnip is already peeling or the skin is cracked, then you will need to peel the older layers away to expose the newer, fresher surface underneath. This is similar to the method for peeling an onion.

Remove it from heat.,
Serve.",How to Cook Broccoli1," If you bought your broccoli at a commercial grocery store, a thorough rinse is fine. If you grew your own broccoli or bought it at a farm stand, soak the broccoli in salted water for 10 minutes, then rinse it thoroughly.


Garden-fresh broccoli is prone to cabbage loopers, a common garden pest. In their larval stage, cabbage loopers are green, approximately 1-inch-long worms. Though they're harmless, they can be a real appetite killer. The worms die in the salt water. The cabbage loopers will float to the top of the surface of the water where you can skim them off and dispose of them.;
, This is the thickest part of the broccoli. The stem of the broccoli is completely edible, but the last inch or so will be a bit tougher and not as tasty. You can eat the stem, or discard part of it.

, Cut the trunks of each floret, or little bunch of broccoli, until you break the florets into several smaller pieces that are easy to work with. If you're not a fan of the stalks, cut just below the crown. If you want to get more mileage from your broccoli, cut farther down the stalk closer to the main stem of the broccoli bunch.

, Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water, insert a steamer basket, place a cover on the pan, and place the pan on a burner over medium heat. Bring the water to a boil.

, Remove the lid from the pan, place the broccoli florets in the steamer basket, and replace the lid on the pan.

, Allow the broccoli to steam for 3 - 5 minutes, depending on how much broccoli you are cooking.

, Remove the pan from the burner, and remove the lid immediately. Otherwise, the broccoli will continue cooking and will quickly get soggy.

, You can serve the broccoli plain, with sauce or seasoning, or you can incorporate it into another recipe.

Use a sharp knife to cut off the approximately 2- to 3-inches (5- to 7.5-cm) at the base of the vegetable.Because the bok choy’s base is tough and has dirt trapped inside, you should discard it.;
, Once you’ve removed the bottom of the base, you need to separate the stalks. Use clean hands to gently pull off each stalk at the base of bok choy and place them in a bowl.When you cook the bok choy or mix it into a dish, you may need to cut the leaves and stalks into separate pieces. Do that after you’ve cleaned it.

, After you’ve separated the bok choy stalks, add enough water to the bowl to cover it. Make sure to use cold water to avoid wilting the leaves.If you’re cleaning a large number of bok choy, you may want to place the stalks in a clean sink and cover them with water so they aren’t all overlapping too much.

, Once you’ve covered the bok choy with water, use your hands to gently swish the stalks around to loosen any dirt. Next, let the bok choy sit in the water for about 10 minutes so all of the dirt and sediment has time to settle at the bottom., After the bok choy stalks have sat in the water for several minutes, use your hands to lift them out. Transfer them to a strainer or colander and shake well to remove an excess moisture.Don’t pour the boy choy into the strainer. That will mix the dirt and sediment back in with them.
If you have a salad spinner, you can use it to get rid of the excess moisture from the bok choy.
Check the water after you’ve removed the bok choy. If it is extremely dirty or cloudy, dump it out and repeat the process of soaking the boy choy until the water is mostly clear when you remove it.

, Even after you’ve strained the bok choy, it may still be slightly damp. Use paper towel to gently pat them dry before cooking or mixing the bok choy into a dish.You can use a clean kitchen towel to pat the bok choy dry.

Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath. Add about 1 cup (250 ml) of ice to a medium mixing bowl, then fill the bowl halfway with cold water. Allow the ice to cool down the temperature even further as you work on the remaining steps.;
, Use a sharp knife to slice the root end off each cipollini onion. If any of the skin starts peeling away when you remove the root, use your fingers to peel off as much as possible.


At this point, you do not need to worry about removing any skin that does not lift off the onion on its own.
Note the difference between the root end and the stem end. The stem end will be marked with a cluster of thin, paper-like skin extending past the top of the onion. The root end will have a thick root that is visible above the skin layer of the onion. For this method and this step, you only need to remove the root end.

, Quickly dunk them into your prepared ice bath and keep the onions there for two to three minutes—the same amount of time you used when blanching the onions.


If you do not have a slotted spoon, you could also drain the water by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander or sieve.

, Grab each cooled onion at its stem side. Squeeze the papery peel, pushing up against the onion as you work. The cipollini onion should gradually pop out of the skin as you push.


Repeat this step as many times as needed until you remove all the skins off all the onions.
As you squeeze the onions out of their peels, make sure that you direct them toward a bowl or container that you can catch them in.

Talk up the health benefits of kale to family members who will listen.,
Consider not reasoning with the family over eating their kale.,
Purchase only fresh, young kale.,
Plant a garden that includes kale.,
Integrate kale slowly as well as talking about why it is healthy.,
Investigate how to combine kale with the types of ingredients your family responds to most.,
Vary the kale presentation.,
Integrate kale into at least one meal a week.",How to Convince Your Family to Eat Kale," For younger kids, simply let them know it'll help them grow strong and stay healthy. For everyone able to understand the benefits of good health, make this anti-cancer, vitamin rich super-food more relevant by talking about why you want to stay healthy and how easily good nutrition can assure this. Some reasons to help you convince your family of why it's important to stay healthy through good nutrition include:


To avoid being sidelined from their social life. Even toddlers don't want to miss a play date, so telling your children and teens that eating healthy will ensure that they don't miss their “appointments” may help them to appreciate why you are putting it on their plate.
Keeping their brain healthy. While there is no cure for diseases like Alzheimer’s, many physicians and researchers believe that a preventative diet that includes foods like kale can reduce the risk of contracting the disease (along with daily exercise). Kale's vitamins A, E, K and C (also found in all darkly colored fruits and vegetables) have been known to prevent damage caused by free radicals.
May help improve eyesight. Not interested in getting glasses? Eat your kale and let the dietary carotenoid Zeaxanthin go to work, keeping your eyes bright. Carotenoids protect the eyes through mopping up free radicals that could otherwise harm the macular region of the eye.
Any vegetarians or vegans in the family? Research has shown that the calcium in kale is particularly well absorbed.It tastes good. Okay, you're getting to this part. They need to trust you on this...;
, Simply exercise the cook's prerogative and serve it up anyway. You can bring the health benefits up after they've enjoyed the ways in which you've made it! (See below for enjoyable ways to serve kale.)

, The fresher any vegetable, the better it is going to taste to the diner. In the case of a vegetable that causes some people to turn up their nose, this factor is even more important!


Buy or harvest young kale; mature leaves are very bitter (unless you like that).
You might like to buy organic kale if you believe that organic produce has higher levels of nutrients than conventional produce.
Store kale in a cool spot in the refrigerator.
Cook the kale within a few days of buying it so it doesn’t wilt or go bad. Also, cook kale quickly, both to maintain its nutrients and its flavor. See How to prepare kale for more details.
As with any vegetable, don’t serve it if has become mushy or has a sour smell.

, One of the best ways to encourage your family to eat the vegetable is to get them actively involved in cultivating it. Kale is remarkably easy to grow and tends to be forgiving of a range or soils and temperatures. Moreover, it tends to be prolific! Create a vegetable garden and make sure that kale is one of your new crops.


See How to grow kale for details.
Be aware that kale takes up a lot of space in the garden and is a slow grower. However, it's great when there is nothing much else fresh available in the garden.
Getting the kids involved will give them a sense of pride, accomplishment and interest in eating their crops. Your child will proudly point to the homegrown bushel of kale and tell people that he or she grew it. When it comes time to harvest the crop, your gardener child be more inclined to try it since the kale was his or her “baby.”

, Understanding how kale grows and being familiar with what it looks like can provide familiarity. One problem families often run into is trying to eat foods they don't see on a regular basis or have never had any connection with. Unfortunately, if processed foods are more often on the table than fresh, your family may shriek in horror if you suddenly begin to serve garden fresh food. A gradual introduction of kale into the diet can help ease the initial dislike of it.

, At all costs, avoid steamed or boiled kale on its own when first introducing it into your family's diet. Kale can be voluminous, its new texture can seem chewy or stringy to a newcomer and these issues may be exacerbated by serving it up as a vegetable in its own right. Instead, begin by cooking it with familiar ingredients. Fortunately, hearty kale can be combined with a variety of ingredients, meaning that it can accommodate numerous flavors and textures and be ""hidden"" away at first.


How do you prepare and serve other vegetables? Consider how your family eats other vegetables. Do they like them with a little cheese or does the family typically respond well to garlic and olive oil? Any types of spices and seasonings hit the spot such as oregano or basil?
Consider mixing kale with other dishes like lasagna or even hiding it in spaghetti sauce. Be a sneaky chef and puree it into sauce or layer it into a vegetable lasagna. In many cases, the other ingredients may mask kale’s flavor and your family may not even know kale is in the dish.
Don't cook it. Instead mix it into a salad with other leafy greens such as lettuce, Swiss chard, baby spinach leaves, endive, arugula (rocket), dandelion greens, etc. Mix and match greens is a very creative way to serve up greens.

, You don’t have to eat kale the same old way every time; in fact, you can experiment with kale to create healthy snacks such as kale chips. Here are some more kale dish suggestions:


To make kale chips, lay freshly washed leaves on a cookie sheet and drizzle olive oil over each leaf. Bake at 400ºF/200ºC on a middle rack for 12 minutes (turn chips halfway through cooking)––you’ll have a fabulous substitute to potato chips.
Sesame kale
Braised kale with bacon and onions

Kale and chickpea (garbanzo) soup and Chorizo, potato and kale soup

Warm potato, carrot and kale salad

Kale in a green smoothie.
Kale is also excellent chopped and used in the same way you would use spinach or cabbage such as in soups (a kale known as Cavolo nero is a key ingredient in minestrone), cooked in quiches, in a host of stirfries, in curry and Indian side dishes such as Aloo palak, kale and cheese pastries like spanakopita, in mashed potato including colcannon or bubble and squeaks.

, The more your family sees kale on the table, the more they will become comfortable with it. You don’t have to serve it every day to glean the health benefits––try offering it at least once a week as either a side dish or integrated into the main course. On other days, give your family a variety of leafy green vegetables so that ""nature's best protection"" becomes the norm for eating in your house.


Let each family make a dish featuring kale. Let your spouse and kids take a swing at making a delicious kale dish. Each week let one member of the family make a kale dish, which may give them a greater appreciation for the leafy green. For small children, act as an assistant (cutting and cooking) but let them call the shots. If you get everyone on board with your kale initiative it may catch on.

Place the onions in a large bowl.,
Boil water.Fill a kettle or small saucepan with enough water to cover the onions.,
Pour the water over the onions.,
Drain.,
Cut off both ends.,
Peel away the exposed skin.",How to Peel Cipollini Onions2," Stack all of the cipollini onions in a large, heat-resistant mixing bowl. Make sure that there is enough empty space at the top of the bowl for 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of water.


Make sure that the bowl you use can withstand extremely hot temperatures. Most glass, metal, and thick plastic bowls are safe, but some thin plastic bowl can start to weaken or melt when exposed to high heat. Styrofoam should not be used. Also note that metal and glass bowls will become very hot during this process, so if you use a metal or glass mixing bowl, you may need to handle it with oven mitts.

, Place it on the stove over high heat, keeping it there until the water reaches a rolling boil.



Boiling the water in a microwave is not recommended since the water can super-heat, causing its container to burst apart. If you do boil the water in your microwave, though, keep it in a microwave-safe dish and place a non-metal chopstick or spoon in the dish to break the surface tension. Heat the water in brief intervals of 30 seconds or less until it reaches 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius).

, Allow the onions to sit in the hot water for two to three minutes.


Make sure that all of the onions are completely submerged.
The hot water should help loosen the skin, making it easier to remove from the onion. The fact that the water is no longer actively boiling reduces the risk of accidentally cooking the onions, however, which is why many prefer this method over the blanching method.

, Pour the contents of the bowl through a colander to drain the water. Return the onions to the bowl.


Use clean, dry paper towels to dry both the onions and bowl after you drain the water.
Alternatively, you could scoop the onions out of the water with a slotted spoon. Place them on a clean cutting board when done.

, Use a sharp knife to cut a thin slice from both the stem and root end of each onion.


As you cut off either end, you will likely notice some of the skin peeling away with the slice of onion you're removing. Use your fingers to peel off as much of this attached skin as possible since it will still be the easiest to remove.

, At this point, the remaining skin should be loose enough to grab and peel away with your fingers. Continue doing so until all of the skin has been removed from all of the onions.


If you need a little extra help, you can lift the top of the skin off using the tip of your knife. After loosening the edge of one section of skin, grab this edge with your fingers and peel it off.
The process will be complete at the completion of this step.

"

Peel away a strip of skin.Slide a small, sharp paring knife underneath a section of papery skin at the stem end of each onion.,
Repeat as needed.,
Cut off both ends.",How to Peel Cipollini Onions3," Glide the knife down that strip of skin, peeling the strip off from stem to root.


Recognize the difference between the stem end and the root end. You should notice a cluster of papery skin extending past the top of the top of the actual onion. That end is the stem end. The root end, on the other hand, has a tough cluster of root that grows on top of the skin at the bottom of the onion.
Unlike the other two methods, this method does not involve any hot water.

, Continue lifting and peeling away small strips of peel from the onion using your paring knife. Repeat this initial step as often as needed until the entire peel has been removed.


Since the papery skin is so thin, you might have difficulty grasping it and removing it by hand. For most people, using a knife will be easier than using your fingers, but if you have difficulty maneuvering the knife, try using your fingers, anyway.

, Use a sharp knife to cut off a small slice from both the root end and the stem end of each cipollini onion.


The stem end and root end are tough and flavorless, so you will generally want to remove them before preparing the onions.
The process is finished at the completion of this step.

, Leaving the end barely attached will make the shallot easier to peel.

,, This should pull off a large section of the peel and leave other parts of the peel showing so that they can be easily grasped.

,,, Keeping the wide end down on your cutting board will keep the shallot more stable.

,, You will create two wide, relatively flat halves.

,, You will create a series of long vertical strips that are about 1/8” (2 mm) wide. Keep the strips close to one another on the cutting board.

, The top end of the knife should slice the vertical strip farthest from you, while the bottom end of the knife will slice the strip closest to you. This will allow each vertical strip to be sliced in one single motion.

,, Because the minced pieces are of a uniform size, the minced shallots will cook more evenly.

The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged.
Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed.
To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers.
Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.;
, Cover the pot and let it return to boiling.


Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns.
If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.

, The corn should be ""tender-crisp"" when done.


""Tender-crisp"" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy.
The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.

, Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving.


The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it.
Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.

Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot.
Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers.
Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.

, Cook for 8 to 12 minutes.


Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns.
The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn.

Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.

, You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired.


Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.

, Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil.


If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.

, Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes.


Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.

Dip each slice into the milk and egg wash.,
Dredge the onions in panko crumbs.,
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Set the oven to convection and allow it to heat up as you finishing preparing the onion rings. ,
Arrange the onion rings on a nonstick baking sheet.,
Bake the onion rings for 15-20 minutes.,
Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.",How to Make Oven Fried Onion Rings," Start by using a sharp kitchen knife to remove both ends of each onion. Aim for the fibrous white or brown eye on either side, and try to minimize the amount of vegetable you take off with it.Make sure you’re using a solid cutting board, as you may need to apply quite a bit of force to get through larger, tougher onions.
For a more efficient cut, slice the onions with a smooth lever action rather than a crude sawing motion.;
, Pull off larger sections of the flaky husk by hand to expose the rubbery skin underneath. The simplest way to remove this skin is to cut the onion in half down the center (widthwise—the way you’ll be slicing the rings), then peel away the entire skin in one motion.Be careful not to cut the onion the wrong way (lengthwise), as this will ruin the rings.
If the skin is being especially stubborn, heat the onion momentarily in a warm pan to loosen it up.

, Make each cut as consistent as possible so your onion rings will all come out roughly the same width. Once you’ve sliced the onions, separate each individual ring by hand. Your onion rings will vary in size due to the layering of the rings, giving them some added visual appeal and diversity.Keep in mind that that each slice will produce four to five onion rings. Depending on how big a batch of onion rings you want to make, you may only need to use a single large onion.
You can make the onion rings as thick or thin as you desire, though thicker onion rings may take longer to cook all the way through, and may have more of a raw crunch as a result.

, Use about two cups of flour, along with four teaspoons kosher salt, two teaspoons ground black pepper and a generous pinch of paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder or any other spices of choice. Sift the flour and seasonings together to make sure they’re evenly distributed.Stir the flour and seasonings with a whisk or fork to break up lumps.
Some other spices you can use to enhance the flavor of your onion rings and add your own unique touch include seasoned salt, lemon pepper, chili powder or Cajun seasoning., Crack four whole eggs into the bottom of a separate bowl. Pour in two cups of whole fat milk or buttermilk and use a whisk to beat the ingredients together until they’re fully incorporated. This milk and egg wash will serve as your binding agent for getting the dry breading to stick to the onion slices.For more tender onion rings, soak the onion slices in buttermilk for two to five hours before breading.The higher the fat content of the milk, the heartier and more flavorful the breading will be.

, Drop the onion slices into the flour and seasonings and mix them around until they’re lightly covered. Alternatively, you can place the onion slices in a gallon freezer bag with the flour and shake them together for better coverage. You may have to do this in batches until all of the onion slices have been coated.Coating the slices in flour before you dip them in the wash will ensure that the natural moisture of the onion doesn’t cause the breading to slough off.

, Briefly submerge the slices so that the dairy mixture clings to the outside of the flour layer. Let the excess liquid drain off.If the wash isn’t clinging well enough, whisk in a small amount of flour to thicken it up.
In addition to holding the breading together, the egg in the wash will protect the onion from the heat of the oven as it cooks to prevent it from drying out or getting too done.

, Transfer the wet onion slices to a final bowl containing the panko crumbs. Run the slices through the breadcrumbs on each side, shaking the bowl to help them to coat more evenly. The onion rings will now have an extra thick layer of crispy breading and are ready to go in the oven!Panko crumbs are made from light, airy flakes of bread that don’t absorb fats as easily, meaning they’ll retain their crunchiness better than regular breadcrumbs.Some varieties of panko crumbs come pre-seasoned. If you’re using seasoned panko crumbs, be sure to account for this by adjusting the amount of other seasonings you use in your recipe.

,, Grease the sheet liberally with cooking spray, or line it with a few sheets of parchment paper for ease of cleanup later on. Make sure you leave a little space between each onion ring. This will allow them to cook more evenly and prevent them from sticking together.The type of oil you use to grease the baking sheet is up to you. Olive, canola or sunflower oil will make for a lower calorie indulgence. For richer tasting onion rings, go with vegetable, peanut, or coconut oil.
If you’re running out of space, place the smaller rings inside the bigger ones. Just make sure there’s still some room remaining between the rings., Slide the baking sheet onto the center rack and keep an eye on the onion rings as they bake. At the halfway point, flip the onion rings over and allow them to finish cooking on the opposite side. This will ensure that they come out with just the right golden-brown finish.Baking cuts down significantly on the amount of oil you use, making oven-fried onion rings a healthier but no less delicious alternative to the traditional fried variety.
Use a fork or pair of tongs to flip the onion rings over so that you don’t risk burning yourself.

, Let the onion rings cool for a few minutes after you take them out of the oven. Finish with an extra sprinkle of salt, a pinch of shaved Pecorino cheese or a dash of truffle oil. Place the onion rings on a separate plate or serving dish, set out a few cups of ketchup, ranch, honey mustard or red pepper aioli (if you want to get fancy) and dig in!These onion rings make a great companion for a juicy burger fresh from the grill, or are good enough to enjoy on their own.
Put uneaten onion rings in an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator. Leftovers should stay good for four to five days. Reheat in the oven to preserve the flavor and crunch.

To clean your grill, put some vegetable oil on a paper towel, and wipe each rod down, one by one. You can also put the oil directly onto the grill and scrape off the grime with a grill spatula or other tool if necessary.
Some grills have a ""cleaning"" setting. If the above isn't enough, you may wish to use this option if you have it.;
, Oil not only cleans your grills, but prevents food from sticking to it. Be sure to this before you turn the heat on, otherwise it will cook away.


Any kind of oil is fine. This is not the oil that will be going on your onions, so a cheap vegetable oil will be perfect for the job.

, Barring circular slices of onion, it's easiest to grill onions with some sort of device to make sure all sides get cooked and that they don't fall through the grates. A tin foil tent, basket, tray, or skewer inserted through the onion will all work well.


You could also just use a piece of tin foil over the grate, with holes poked through it to let out heat.
If you do use skewers, make sure they're soaked in water first so they don't catch on fire.

, If you have none of the above items on hand, you'll need to stick to large slices or whole onions. Large, circular slices are going to be easiest as it's difficult to grill a whole onion evenly – inevitably one side gets more cooked than the others.

, Olive oil, salt and pepper, and your favorite seasoning blend are staples of grilled onions. Some people also like to use butter and beef bouillon granules, too. Here are some other ideas you could use, regardless of the shape of your onion:


Honey mustard
Balsamic vinegar
BBQ sauce
Worcestershire sauce
Steak seasoning

, Vidalia onions are a popular choice based upon their size and flavor. Sweet onions are the most popular, and red sweet onions are very common, too.


Any onion, so long as it's large and fresh, will do the trick. In the case of whole onions, symmetrical is best, so one side doesn't naturally rest on its bottom, getting cooked unevenly.

, Remove any of the loose, dry outer skin that is thin like paper and is peeling. Inspect the next layer of the onion for any shriveling or damage, and remove if necessary. You should be able to tell when you hit the meat of the layers.

, To make slices, hold the onion at the root end, and place it sideways on the cutting board. Your hand and the root should be horizontal to the board. Cut the onion into thick slices, generally half an inch thick (1.3 cm).


To cut into wedges, don't cut all the way to the bottom of the onion. If you do, they'll fall apart. Wedges should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide, and a good-sized onion will yield 4-6 wedges.These are just recommendations. You can cut the onion however you like, from thick wedges to whole slices. Just know that the smaller your onions are, the more likely they'll be to fall through the grate – for small onions, you'll need equipment to keep that from happening.

, Add any seasonings you like, such as salt, pepper, or garlic powder, too. A list of possibilities is discussed above, but olive oil, salt, and pepper is a general standard. Make sure you get both sides!

, Place the onion slices directly onto the grill surface. Alternatively, use your grill basket or a tent made out of aluminum foil. Allow them to cook for approximately 3-5 minutes or until you can see black grill marks. Larger, thicker onions may take up to 7.To make a foil tent, simply place a couple of onion slices on a piece of foil. Turn the long sides in, covering the onions, and then roll up the sides, enclosing them in.
Skewers are easiest for wedges, if you're worried about them falling apart. Again, just make sure they were soaked in water before use, or they may start a fire.

, Allow the other side to cook for another 3-5 minutes or until you see grill marks. If you want to re-season or add more olive oil, do so now.


Give the edge of one a taste test. Does it have a hint of a crunch initially, but is still soft and getting caramelized? That's exactly when you know they're done.

, Grilled onions make their own delicious side dish, but they're also great added to salsa, relish, baked beans, curries, and any other vegetable dish.

, Inspect the next layer of the onion for any shriveling or damage, and remove if necessary. If it doesn't look like you want to eat it, keep peeling.


Keep the bottom side – the part with the roots or the hair – intact. It's the base of your onion.

, Start by cutting off the top 1/3 of the onion and discard. Then, you need to core the onion. To do this, insert your knife into the edge of the core, stopping before you hit the bottom (or it won't be a whole onion anymore). Do this around the core until you can pry it out, leaving the bottom intact.


Slice from the hole you just made into the layers, stopping before you hit the outside of the onion (again, you want a whole onion, not wedges). This allows your seasonings to soak through each layer.Alternatively, you can use your knife tip, and puncture small holes around the middle section of the onion. Instead of in the core, these holes are where you would put the seasoning.

, Most people start off with butter or olive oil for their base. Then you can add any flavors you like, such as salt, pepper, or garlic powder. A short list is discussed in the first section, though whatever speaks to you is best!


Use a combination of herbs and spices, or a pre-prepared seasoning (like a steak seasoning) to get a full-bodied taste that complements the natural taste of the onion. Keep in the mind the dish it's being paired with (if that's the case) when you're debating between a sweet or savory touch.

, Place the onion pouch onto the grill surface on medium to medium-high heat, and allow it to cook for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Check it only periodically to keep the heat sealed into the pouches.


Some onions (and some grills) can take up to 45 minutes. If your onion is taking longer than 20 to 30 minutes, don't fret. This is normally, especially for larger onions. If in doubt, give it a little longer – if it's not quite done, the insides may only be warm.

, Grilled whole onions are almost a meal in themselves – a small salad and a slice of fresh bread and you're set. But they're also great in stews, curries, or with any other hot vegetable dish.

Make sure to dry mushrooms immediately after rinsing them. Use a dry paper towel and dry them one by one. You don't want to cook mushrooms that are still damp.;
, You can add a light amount of butter or oil to your skillet to cook the mushrooms. Most people use butter or oil to keep the mushrooms from sticking, but mushrooms do release oil when cooked. If you want, you can do what's called a dry sauté.In a dry sauté, you would just add your mushrooms to the skillet without any oil. Sautéing mushrooms dry can produce a more roasted flavor. It also lowers the fat and calorie content.

, If your mushrooms did not come pre-cut, you should cut them before sautéing them. Mushrooms will cook best when cut into thin slices. Use a knife to trim a corner from each end of the mushroom. Then, cut each mushroom into halves or quarters. You should be left with two to four thin slices of mushrooms. Repeat until all your mushrooms are cut into slices.The size of your slices depends on personal preference and the dish you're making. If you want chunkier mushrooms, choose halves. If you'd prefer thinner ones, choose quarters.

, You will need a large pan to cook mushrooms. The mushrooms should be spread over the pan without any mushrooms overlapping. Overlapped mushrooms will not cook evenly. Select a pan that's big enough to comfortably fit all your mushrooms.If you have one, go for a skillet or sauté pan. These tend to have a big surface area.
If you can't fit all your mushrooms in one pan, you may have to cook them in batches.

, Briefly heat a small amount of oil or butter over medium-high heat. As mushrooms produce oil when cooked, only one to two teaspoons of butter or oil is necessary. Mushrooms also absorb excess butter and oil, so too much could give them a soggy taste and texture., When the oil or butter is ready, it will shimmer slightly or produce bubbles. At this point, you can add the mushrooms to the pan.Make sure to spread the mushrooms on the pan. You do not want your mushrooms to overlap, as this will affect the evenness of the cooking.
If cooking dry, just heat the pan for a few minutes over medium-high heat and then add the mushrooms., Make sure to stir the mushrooms continually as they cook. You want to make sure they cook evenly. Use a spoon or spatula to occasionally turn the mushrooms.Make sure to keep the mushrooms from overlapping as you cook them.

, When they're getting close to done, the mushrooms will begin to release oil. You should see some liquid at the bottom of the pan. The mushrooms will also look slightly shiny from the moisture released.When done, the mushrooms will have a light brown color and be tender. Usually, it takes between four and five minutes to cook mushrooms., You will need to sauté three cups of mushrooms to cook them bistro style. Then, stir in 1/3 cup of dry red wine or sherry, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and two teaspoons of thyme. For three minutes, allow the mushrooms to simmer in this sauce. Then, add salt and pepper to taste., You can add sauté mushrooms with vegetables. This can be used in a filling for dishes like quesadillas. It can also be used as a side dish on its own.Onions and sweet peppers tend to go well with mushrooms.
If you want to serve your sautéed mushrooms with onions, sauté your onions separately and mix together when both the mushrooms and onions are finished.

, Bistro style mushrooms, or mushrooms sautéed with other herbs and flavors, can be used as an addition to other foods. You can place them over meats, like steak and pork chops. You can also add sautéed mushrooms to an omelet or pasta dish such as spaghetti."

Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully mixed.You can substitute any coarse salt for the kosher salt.;
, Add 2 cups (473 ml) of milk, 2 large eggs, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of white wine vinegar, and ¼ teaspoon (1 ml) of hot sauce to a separate large bowl. Whisk the mixture together until it is completely combined.You can substitute ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground cayenne pepper for the hot sauce, but you should add it into the dry ingredients in the first step.

, Once you’ve mixed the wet ingredients together, pour them into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Whisk the mixture until it is just blended.Be careful not to overmix the batter or you may wind up with tough, chewy fritters.

, After you’ve mixed up the batter, add 2 large Vidalia onions that have been sliced lengthwise from top to bottom to the bowl. Mix the onions in well so they’re fully coated.You can substitute any type of onion that you like for the Vidalias, but sweet onions, such as Maui or Bermuda, usually work best.

, Once you’ve mixed the onions into the batter, let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. When you remove it from the fridge, the mixture should be just a bit thicker than heavy cream.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap before putting it in the fridge.
If the mixture isn’t thick enough, stir in a little more flour.
If the mixture is too thick, stir in a little more milk.

, When the batter mixture is nearly done resting, you should preheat the oven to ensure that it is hot enough to keep the fritters warm when you’re frying in batches. Set the temperature to the lowest setting, and allow it to fully preheat., Place a large, heavy-bottomed pan on the stove, and pour in approximately 4-inches (10-cm) of vegetable oil. Set a deep fryer thermometer in the pot, and heat the oil on medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F (190°C).If you don’t have a deep fry thermometer, you can substitute a candy thermometer.

, When the oil is hot enough, begin dropping the batter into the pot by the tablespoonful (18 g). Allow the fritters to cook until they are golden brown on both sides, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Only add 3 to 4 fritters to the oil at a time .
The fritters will have an irregular, spider-like look when you drop them into the oil. It’s normal for some loose pieces of onion to fall free too.You can tell that a fritter is done by breaking it open and making sure the center is done. If it’s not set, allow it to cook for another minute.

, After the first batch of fritters is finished frying, use a slotted spoon to lift them out of the oil onto a paper towel lined plate to drain for a minute. Next, place them on a cookie sheet in the preheated oven to stay warm.It’s a good idea to sprinkle a little more salt over the fritters after you’ve drained them to ensure that they’re properly seasoned.

, While the first batch stays warm in the oven, add a new batch of fritters to the hot oil. Continue working until you’ve used up all of the batter., Once you’ve made all of the fritters, use tongs to transfer them from the cookie sheet to a platter. Set them out as an appetizer or side dish while they’re still warm.Pair the fritters with your favorite dipping sauce. Ranch dressing, ketchup, barbecue sauce, or garlic aioli are all tasty options.

White button mushrooms are a good choice for this dish. They are easy to find in almost any grocery store and they hold up well to the heat and the marinade.;
, You will need to add a variety of spices to flavor the mushrooms.

, You will need normal cooking utensils, such as a bowl and knife, as well as a way to grill the mushrooms. The grilling can be done in an oven, on a grill pan, or on a barbecue, whichever you have available.

, Mushrooms are notoriously hard to clean and, because they grow so close to the dirt, they are usually quite dirty. Be delicate when cleaning them but be sure to get all the dirt off. Once clean, place them in a bowl.


If you prefer smaller pieces in general, slice the mushrooms into half lengthwise.

, Add the spices, flour, and oil to the bowl, except for the chaat masala and the lemon juice. Mix the whole thing so that the mushrooms are covered completely with the seasoning.


Let the mushrooms marinate for at least a half hour.This will give time for the spices to really absorb into the mushrooms.

, Don't pack them too tightly together. They should have a little separation so that the heat can get to all the sides of the mushrooms.


You can use wood or metal skewers. If you use wood skewers, soak them in water for an hour before using. This way they will be less likely to burn during the grilling process.

, This can be done in the oven, on a fry pan, or on a barbecue, if you prefer.


To grill the mushroom skewers in the oven, simply place the ends of the skewers over the ends of a baking pan, so that the mushrooms are elevated in the middle of the pan. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and bake until the mushrooms look brown, about 25-30 minutes.To pan fry the mushroom tikka, heat a grilling pan on medium-high heat and put in coat in with oil. Cook the mushrooms until they are light brown in color, turning them over in the pan once to make sure both sides get browned.
To barbecue the mushrooms you will need to preheat your grill to medium high heat and grease the grate before placing the mushrooms on. Cook them until they are brown and softened a bit. Keep an eye on them, as cooking times will vary.

, Once on a plate, sprinkle them with the chaat masala and the lemon juice.You can serve the mushrooms over rice or as a side dish for any meal.


Mushroom tikka also makes a wonderful hors d'oeuvre.To make them into individual bites that you can serve at a party, place the mushrooms on a tray with an individual toothpick in each one.

, You can easily use the mushrooms to prepare another dish, such as mushroom tikka masala. Simply use the cooked mushroom tikka to replace the protein in a recipe you already love or try a new recipe for masala sauce and add the mushrooms to it at the end.

Acquire morel mushrooms in-season.,
Purchase morel mushrooms online or at a farmer’s market.,
Pick morel mushrooms yourself, at your own risk.,
Refrigerate fresh, unwashed mushrooms for two to three days.",How to Saute Morel Mushrooms4," Morel mushrooms can be found across the US, but are most plentiful in the midwest.Their peak season is short, and the timing depends on your region and the temperature. Thus, for accuracy, check the overnight and daytime temperatures to find out when morel mushrooms are in season in your region, particularly if you plan to look for them growing wild.These mushrooms grow when the overnight low temperature is above 60 °F (16 °C) for at least three nights in a row, and will continue growing until the daytime high temperature reaches 80 °F (27 °C) to 84 °F (29 °C) or higher for three consecutive days.
For example, in the midwest peak season is the last week in April through the first week in May. In Alaska, peak season is mid-June to late July. In other areas, morel mushrooms may be found as early as March., Expect a hefty price, since morel mushrooms are a delicacy with a short growing season. However, purchasing them is generally safer and easier than hunting them down on your own. You can find dried morel mushrooms year-round, although they taste best fresh.For example, an ounce (30 g) of dried mushrooms costs about $35.95. Three ounces of dried mushrooms is the equivalent of about a pound (450 g) of fresh mushrooms.Fresh morel mushrooms typically cost between $30 to $75 a pound (450 g).

, Some species of mushrooms resemble morel mushrooms, so be careful and don’t pick them if you’re not sure.Bring an experienced person with you if you’re new to picking mushrooms. Take a nylon mesh bag along to store the mushrooms in. Look in places where morel mushrooms typically grow.Morel mushrooms particularly like to grow near certain types of trees: cottonwood, ash, tulip poplars, oak, dead elm trees, and in fruit orchards that aren’t well maintained.Try checking in forests with rich soil, slopes that face south, and near riverbeds.
Consult with at least two field guides to verify that mushrooms are edible before eating them. Then eat just a small bit and wait a full 24 hours to make sure there are no negative effects before you eat larger amounts.

, For the best taste, cook fresh mushrooms as soon as possible. If you must refrigerate them, wrap them in waxed paper or a paper bag. Refrigerate them between 34 °F (1 °C) to 35 °F (2 °C).Don’t refrigerate morel mushrooms in plastic bags, which can cause deterioration.

Grill your eggplant slices.",How to Grill Eggplant1," Large globe eggplants (with a deep purple color) are the most common variety, and are what you will find in most supermarkets. You should select an eggplant that is firm and glossy and which also has a nice heft to it.You should also examine the stem of an eggplant before selecting it: choose those which have bright green, fresh looking stems and caps.In the past, eggplants had a bit of bad reputation as being a bitter vegetable, but most varieties available now have been bred to be much more mild. Even so, many chefs recommend that you select smaller, younger eggplants to ensure that your final dish will not be bitter.;
, Other varieties you might want to experiment with include Italian eggplants, which are quite similar to the large purple globes, but which tend to be smaller and slimmer.You can also find Japanese eggplants (a small purple variety) or Chinese eggplants (also small, but which are a paler violet color) at specialty markets or farmer's markets.If you can find them, try the very small Thai eggplants, which are green, round, and well-suited to being cooked whole., Eggplants perish fairly quickly. Thus, it's not a great idea to purchase large quantities at once while shopping. Once you bring them home, you should store them whole in the refrigerator and use within two days.Eggplant will become more bitter the longer you wait between picking/selecting it and cooking it., You can choose to preserve some of your garden bounty by freezing it, but plan on using that for soups, stews, sauces and even for frying.Grilled eggplant is an easy, quick, and delicious way to use up fresh eggplant.

, Some recipes do call for you to peel the eggplant, and this may be a good idea if your eggplant is older or very large—the skin may be tough or bitter.Peel with a paring knife or a sharp vegetable peeler, and be prepared to cook the eggplant fairly soon after (the flesh will quickly discolor once peeled).If you've chosen a smaller, younger eggplant, then toughness and bitterness should not be a problem. The skin lends a heartiness to the dish as well as a pleasing color contrast.

, While the eggplant as a whole is a very nutritious vegetable, there is a higher concentration of the beneficial antioxidant nasunin in the skin.Similarly, the skin contains the phytochemical chlorogenic acid, which recent studies have indicated may help promote glucose tolerance., You should give your eggplant a good scrub, particularly if you do not plan on removing the skin.

, Trim the ends of the eggplant, and then slice it with a very sharp knife. Your slices should be between ½-1inch thick. Experiment with different slicing techniques: the easiest preparation is to cut the eggplant into rounds.


You can also cut the eggplant in half length-wise and grill the two halves (or planks). This will work best on eggplants that are not too large and thick. Once halved, you should make shallow cuts with your knife on the flesh side of the eggplant.This will help ensure that the eggplant halves cook evenly throughout.

, The oil will add flavor to your eggplant (the eggplant's interior acts like a sponge) and will also help keep it from sticking to the grill., Sprinkle your slices with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. This is the basic, foundation recipe for grilling eggplant, and you'll end up with a surprisingly tasty result using only olive oil, salt and pepper.


Once you've masted the basic technique, you may want to begin experimenting with different herb, spice, and flavor combinations. We offer some tempting suggestions later in this article.

, For a charcoal grill, place your eggplant on the rack over medium hot coals. Leave the grill uncovered, and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally until the center is soft and the skin is crisp.For a gas grill, preheat the grill and once hot, reduce the heat to medium. Place the eggplant slices directly on the grill, cover, and cook for 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally until the center is soft and the skin is crisp.Remove the eggplant from the grill, taste a piece, and if necessary add more salt and/or pepper. It's ready to serve!

Grill a Lebanese eggplant dish: Start with your 1/3 cup olive oil and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic base.",How to Grill Eggplant2," This is a good method if you want to use your eggplant to make a dip or spread, and the preparation is even simpler: just wash the eggplant and place it on a high heat grill.


Turn the eggplant occasionally and leave it on the grill until the skin has blackened and collapsed.This should take about 20-30 minutes, but will vary depending upon the size of your eggplant and the heat of your grill.
Once cooled, cut the eggplant in half and drain any liquid. Remove the peel and mash the flesh of the eggplant (or use a food processor to get a smooth consistency).The interior should be soft, with a smokey roasted flavor that will serve well as the basis of a Mediterranean dish like Baba Ghanoush.

, If you'd like your eggplant dish to be a bit more nuanced, it's very easy to take the standard olive oil, salt and pepper flavor base and kick it up a notch or two. After you've washed and cut your eggplant slices, prepare a garlic-infused olive oil mix by blending 1/3 cup of olive oil with 1 tablespoon of minced garlic.Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of finely minced fresh herbs to this olive oil mixture. You can use whatever you have on hand, but good options are parsley, rosemary, thyme, or basil (or any combination).
Brush the oil mixture on your eggplant slices and sprinkle with a large-grain salt and give the slices a generous dusting of freshly ground black pepper. Then proceed to grill according to the above directions.

, Because the eggplant is such a neutral-tasting vegetable, and because it is available nearly world-wide, it is featured in many different cooking styles. You can take your basic olive oil and add seasonings to introduce a bit of worldly culture to your dinner table. For a Greek-style marinade:


Mix 1/3 cup olive oil with ¼ cup minced olives or tapenade, brush this over the eggplant slices, and then grill until the flesh is soft and the skin is crisp.
Once off the heat, add crumbled feta cheese to taste and more olives, if desired., Mix 1/3 cup of olive oil with 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and ½-1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Add salt to taste. Brush this on the eggplant slices before grilling, and once off the grill, grate parmesan cheese over the hot eggplant.Consider adding an additional topping of fresh diced tomatoes and basil after you've removed the eggplant from the grill.
You could also place slices of fresh mozzarella on the eggplant in the final few minutes of grilling. Cover with a lid to ensure that the mozzarella melts completely.
If you're adding cheese to the dish, you may want to cut down on the salt when you initially season the eggplant (the cheese will impart a bit of saltiness to the dish).

, Begin by brushing your eggplant slices with plain olive oil or vegetable oil. Heat ¼ cup miso, 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of mirin, and 2 tablespoons of sake in a saucepan. Once the sugar dissolves, add 1 tablespoon of grated ginger. Brush this mixture over your eggplant halfway through the grilling process., Mix 1 tablespoon of sesame oil with 4 tablespoons of hoisin sauce, 1 teaspoon of rice-wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, a dash of chili powder and a dash of minced ginger.Brush this mixture over the eggplant slices and grill.

, Blend 3 tablespoons of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of honey and 1 tablespoon of ground cumin. Sprinkle with salt if desired, and grill.


Serve this eggplant dish with red onion slices (grilled or raw), tomatoes (optional) and cooked ground beef or lamb., Add salt if desired, and grill.


In the last few minutes of grilling, brush the slices with a coating of thick plain yogurt which has been blended with freshly squeezed lemon juice (add as much or as little lemon juice as you'd like). Sprinkle the final dish with finely chopped mint to taste. "

Rub your hands with stainless steel.,
Rub salt into your hands.,
Cleanse your hands with baking soda.,
Wash your hands with coffee grounds.,
Rub your fingers in vinegar.,
Apply dry mustard to your hands.,
Coat your fingers in mint toothpaste.",How to Get Rid of Onion Smell1," This is one of the most commonly used home remedies for getting rid of the pesky onion smell from your hands. After you've finished handling the onion, grab a stainless steel spoon. Run your hands under warm water while rubbing your hands and fingers with the curved area of the spoon. The sulfur in the steel helps draw out the odor in your skin and can eliminate the smell.


You can use any object that is stainless steel. Knives and other utensils are often made of this material. You can also rub your hands along your sink or faucet because they are often made of stainless steel as well.
They also make stainless steel shaped like soap that you can buy to keep in your kitchen.;
, Take about a palm full of coarse salt. Wet your hands slightly with warm water. Rub the salt all around the areas that smell. Then, rinse your hands with warm water. This should help draw the odor out of your skin.


You can also add a little bit of lemon or lime juice to the mixture. This will help reduce the odor and leave your hands smelling citrus fresh.
This method has the added bonus of being a natural exfoliation technique. Not only will your hands smell fresh, they will feel smoother and softer., One of the most widely used odor eliminators is baking soda. Whether it is your smelly refrigerator or shoes, baking soda helps get rid of odors all over your house. Your hands aren't any different. Mix baking soda with a small amount of water, forming a paste. Rub the baking soda paste into your hands, gently scrubbing the most odorous areas. Rinse and dry your hands well., Fill your hands with a generous amount of used coffee grounds. Slightly wet your hands. Wash your hands with the grounds like you would with soap. Rinse and dry your hands. Not only can this help reduce the smell of onions, your hands will smell delicious like coffee.


Make sure you do this method with used coffee grounds. Fresh grounds won't have the desired effect., Take a small amount of vinegar. Rub it into the skin that smells like onions. Rinse your hands under hot water and dry them. The acid in the vinegar can help draw out the odor in your hands.


Your hands may smell too much like vinegar after you do this. The good thing is that, unlike onions, the smell of vinegar will come out if you wash your hands with soap and water., Sprinkle dry mustard into the palm of your hand. Wet the area, mixing water with the mustard to make a paste. Rub it on your hands. Rinse and dry your hands. The components in the mustard can help draw out the scent in your hands.Make sure you use the right kind of mustard. Don't use a dried clump of bottled mustard. The kind of mustard you want is dry mustard. It is a yellow powder that is used in many recipes. It can be found with the spices in most grocery stores.

, Toothpaste often has baking soda and other odor fighting ingredients. Much like it helps eliminate bad breath caused by onions, the toothpaste may help with the smells on your hands as well. Put a dollop of toothpaste about the size of a pea in your palm. Rub it in to the odorous areas of your hands. Rinse and dry your hands.


Make sure you use the white paste kind of toothpaste and not the gel kind. The gel toothpaste does not have the same kind of properties as the white kind.
This method will also leave your hands smelling minty fresh."

Boil cinnamon sticks.,
Slow cook baking soda.,
Simmer lemon water.,
Bake a dessert.,
Use vinegar and vanilla.,
Burn candles.",How to Get Rid of Onion Smell2," Take one or two cinnamon sticks and place them in a pot of water. Put the water on high heat, bringing it to a boil. Let the mixture boil for a while, releasing the scent of the cinnamon into the air. The cinnamon will help disguise the odor in your kitchen and house.Make sure you watch the water levels in your pot. You want to keep plenty of water in your pot so it doesn't burn and cause more unpleasant smells in your kitchen.

, Just like it eliminates odors on your hands, you can use baking soda to reduce odors in the air as well. Take a few tablespoons of baking soda and combine it with a generous amount of water in a slow cooker. Turn the slow cooker to low heat and leave the top off. The heated baking soda will help pull the odors from the air.Instead of just eliminating odors, you can turn this method into an air freshener as well. With the baking soda, try adding a few drops of vanilla, a few teaspoons of your favorite spices such as cinnamon or clove, some essential oils, or a few slices of lemon. The baking soda will still eliminate the smell and the extra ingredients will replace the smell of onion with a fabulous new fragrance.

, This method will leave your house smelling citrus fresh. Slice a lemon and place it in a pot full of water. Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low, simmering the mixture. The acid in the lemon will help pull the odor out of the air and leave a nice scent behind.You can also try this with oranges or limes. The acidic content in each fruit is similar and will have a similar effect.
Make sure you watch the water levels in your pot. You don't want your mixture to burn.

, A good way to chase out the scents left behind by onions is to bake something to replace the smell. Try baking cookies or a cake. Anything that has a naturally pleasing aroma will help cover up the odor of the onions and exchange it for the smell of baked goods. The added bonus is that you will have a yummy dessert after you're through., Before you start chopping your onion, mix some vinegar with a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Sit it next to your cutting board or work area while you cut the onion. The mixture can help soak up the smell coming from the onion and keep it from making your entire kitchen smell.


Move it next to the stove if you plan on cooking your onions. This way, it can help reduce the smell coming from the cooked onions as well., Burning candles can make a room smell great, but you can also use them to help reduce the scents left behind from cooking. Burn a candle in your kitchen to help reduce the odors left behind from chopping and cooking onions. Try scents that have citrus or vanilla in them. The extracts used to make these scents will help reduce the odors that remain in the air in your kitchen and around your house."

Peel the skin.,

Rinse the onion.",How to Extract Juice from an Onion1," Use a sharp serrated knife to cut a small slice, no larger than 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters), from the root end of the onion. Slice through the onion until you reach the skin on the other side, but do not cut through the skin. Grab the partially cut end and pull it down, past the length of the onion, to draw back a portion of the skin. Grab the remaining skin with your thumb and first two fingers and draw it back to remove it.






;
, Use the same knife to remove another slice, about 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters), from the other end of the onion. Doing so will make it easier to cut or chop the onion, so this step is especially important if extracting juice using a blender or juicer.









If extracting juice using a grater, you may skip this step. Keeping the opposite end intact may actually make it easier to grate the onion.

, Run the peeled onion under a lukewarm tap to remove any small specks of skin or dirt. Dry it with a clean paper towel.

Rub the whole onion against the fine side of the grater.,
Rest a strainer on top of a medium to large bowl.,
Press the onion pulp through the strainer.,
Put the remaining pulp inside a square of cheesecloth.",How to Extract Juice from an Onion2," You need a container with sides, but the mouth must be wide enough for you to fit a box grater, also called a cheese grater or flat bottomed grater, and at least one of your hands inside since you will need to grate the onion inside it.

, Press down on the grater using even pressure to keep it steady, preventing it from sliding around as you attempt to grate the onion.








, Grab the rounded end of the onion, if left intact, with your free hand. Press the flat end that once attached to the root to the top of the fine side of the grater. Move the onion in a downward motion over the holes to grate it. Continue to press the onion against the grater, moving it up and down over the holes, until you have grated the entire onion.








, This bowl should have higher sides but must have a wide enough mouth to accommodate the entire diameter of the strainer. If possible, rest the strainer over the lip of the bowl. If the strainer is too small, however, hold it with your hand.

, Place the grated pulp from the other container into a fine mesh strainer. Use a spoon or rubber spatula to push the pulp into the strainer, separating most of the juice while keep the majority of the solid pulp out of the second bowl. Continue pressing until most of the juice has been separated, but do not press so much that you begin pushing the pulp through the strainer.








, Place the pulp into the center of the cheesecloth and bring all the corners of the cloth together, effectively wrapping the pulp inside. Push down on the pulp to squeeze out more juice into the second bowl. Continue pressing and pushing until no further juice drips out.

Repeat blending as necessary.,
Position a strainer over the mouth of a bowl.,
Lay a piece of cheesecloth inside the strainer.,
Press the blended onion through the cheesecloth and the strainer.",How to Extract Juice from an Onion3," Use a sharp serrated knife to rough chop the onion into medium pieces. You do not need to mince or finely chop the onion, but small to medium pieces work better in a blender than large pieces do.








, Use a medium-high to high speed and blend the chopped onion for about 1 minute, turning the onion into a thick puree.








, Blending the onion for 1 minute should be enough to puree the onion, but every blender works a little differently. If you still have notable pieces of onion in your blender, stop the blender, open the lid, and push the pieces down toward the blades using a rubber spatula. Replace the lid and continue blending at 30 second intervals at high speed until completely blended.

, The strainer should be small enough to fit inside the bowl, but if possible, large enough to rest on the lip of the bowl. Otherwise, hold the strainer over the mouth of the bowl with one hand.

, The thinness of the cheesecloth will make it easier to filter out the juice while trapping the solid pulp.








, Transfer the onion from the blender into the center of the cheesecloth. Use a spoon or rubber spatula to push the onion pulp into the cheesecloth and the strainer and into the bowl. Continue pressing the pulp until you no longer see juice dripping out from the bottom of the strainer.

Cut the onion into quarters.,
Choose the right type of juicer.,
Place a bowl under the spout of the juicer.,
Press each quarter through the juicer.",How to Extract Juice from an Onion4," A whole onion will be too large for many juicers to work with, but small chunks or chopped onion will be too small for you to push through. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut your onion into quarters, lengthwise, for the best results.








, Use an electric centrifugal juicer with a chute and a spout. A hand juicer, or a juicer that requires you to press the fruit or vegetable against a bump to extract the juice, only works with soft fruits like lemons, oranges, and limes. To extract juice from hard vegetables like onions, you need a juicer with a spout that you can feed pieces of the vegetable into.

, Some juicers come with a glass collection container, but for many strainers, you will need to place a bowl or drinking glass beneath the dispensing spout before you begin since the juice will pour out as you work.








, Wait until each quarter has finished being juiced before inserting the next quarter into the chute. The juice should automatically filter out through the spout while the pulp will be collected into a separate compartment. No additional straining should be necessary.

Mix in the leaves and saute the mixture for another couple of minutes.,
Season the ramps with salt and pepper and serve.",How to Cook Ramps1," For the sauteed ramps, you’ll need ½ pound (227 g) of ramps. To prepare them for cooking, use a sharp knife to cut off the roots. Next, run the ramps under cool water at the sink to remove any dirt or debris.To ensure that the ramps are dry, it’s a good idea to place them in a colander or sieve after you rinse them. Shake them well to remove any excess moisture.;
, When the ramps are trimmed and cleaned, use the knife to separate the white bulbs from the green leaves. Leave the bulbs in tact, but cut the leaves in half or thirds horizontally.If any of the leaves appear tough or overly large, discard them. They are usually too chewy even after sauteing.
If you notice any translucent skins, which are similar to those that you find on green onions or scallions, peel them away and discard.

, Place a nonstick skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of extra virgin olive oil, and allow it to heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute butter for the olive oil.

Look for the whitish stalk that is about 6 inches (15 cm) long, with a large, round bulb and white, sac-like volva, a remnant of the tissue that protected the mushroom's gills while it grew, at its base.,
Measure the cap of the mushroom and look for a green or yellow color.,
Dig down a bit into the soil to find the lower part of the mushroom's stalk.,
Look at the flat, wave-like edge of the cap.,
Look for many crowded, white gills underneath the cap.,
Look for a white spore print by placing the mushroom cap on a piece of paper with the gills facing downward and leaving it overnight.,
Smell the mushroom's flesh.",How to Identify a Death Cap Mushroom,";
, The cap should be about 2.25 to 6 inches (6 to 15 cm) wide and can be olive green, pale green, or yellow, and sometimes white or brown, with 1 or more patches of thin white veil tissue.

, The lower part of the mushroom's stalk, including the bulb and volva, is often buried in the soil around the tree it is attached to. The bulb may also break away or fall apart over time, so if it isn't present, the mushroom could still be an Amanita mushroom.

, The cap is convex in younger specimens, but flattens as the mushroom ages, developing a wave-like edge.

, The Death Cap, and other Amanita mushrooms, display white gills on the underside of the cap that are densely crowded together but do not extend all the way to the stem. The gill color is another way to distinguish a Death Cap mushroom from the Paddy Straw mushroom and other edible mushrooms. The Paddy Straw's gills are pinkish brown. Other mushrooms, such as those of the genus Agaricus, also have pink gills, although theirs later turn brown.

, A Death Cap mushroom will leave a white spore print, while a Paddy Straw will leave a pink print.

, A Death Cap mushroom smells slightly like rose petals; this test can be used if you can't tell from its physical appearance whether the mushroom is a Death Cap or other variety.

Allow the water to come to a full boil.You should add enough salt to the water so it tastes like sea water.

, For the pesto, you’ll need the leaves from 2 dozen ramps. When the water has come to a boil, add them to the pot and allow them to boil for 1 minute., Once the ramp leaves have boiled for a minute, remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon. Immediately dump them into a boil of ice water to stop the cooking process. Let the leaves sit in the water until they are cooled. Make sure to set up the bowl of ice water beside the stove before you begin boiling the ramp leaves, so you can transfer them to it right after boiling.

, After you’ve dropped the ramp leaves into the ice water bath, transfer them to a colander. Shake the leaves well to remove the excess moisture, and then squeeze them with paper towel so they’re as dry as possible.You can use a tea towel to dry the ramp leaves if you prefer.

, After you’ve dried the ramp leaves, use a sharp knife to chop them. They don’t need to be finely chopped, though, because they’ll be shredded further in the food processor., To begin the pesto, add 3 roughly chopped garlic cloves and ¼ cup (35 g) of toasted pine nuts to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the mixture until the ingredients are finely crushed.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender or mortar and pestle to make the pesto.

, Once the garlic and nuts are crushed, add 3 tablespoons (15 g) of grated pecorino romano cheese and the chopped ramp leaves to food processor. Pulse the mixture until the leaves are fully chopped and the mixture is completely blended.You can substitute parmesan or asiago cheese for the pecorino romano.

, When the nuts, garlic, cheese, and ramp leaves are combined, start streaming up to ½ cup (118 g) of extra-virgin olive oil into the mixture as you pulse the food processor. Continue mixing the pesto until it reaches your desired consistency.The proper amount of oil depends on the consistency you want for the pesto. If you plan to use it as a spread, add less oil. If you are using it as a sauce, add more oil.

, When you’re finished mixing the pesto, give it a taste. The cheese often adds enough salt, but if the seasoning is lacking, stir in some salt and/or pepper before using or serving the pesto.Ramp pesto makes a delicious pasta sauce, but you can also use it as a spread for sandwiches and bread.
You may also want to mix the ramp pesto into your favorite soup recipe or use it top fish or poultry dishes.

Transfer the mushrooms to cold water.,
Drain the mushrooms and freeze in sealed containers.",How to Freeze Mushrooms1," While steaming may preserve more flavor in frozen mushrooms, blanching or parboiling will still keep the mushrooms fairly high quality for up to 12 months, although experts disagree on the effects of exposing mushrooms to water.This method requires no equipment other than a pot of water and a heat source, and the mushrooms will stay tasty for up to a year in the freezer afterwards.


This method is especially useful if you intend to use the frozen mushrooms for soup, since the slightly soggier texture will go unnoticed.;
, You'll need enough water to cover the mushrooms, plus a little extra because some will boil away. If you'd like to preserve the mushrooms' color, you can add a teaspoon (5 mL) of lemon juice for each quart (L) of water., While your water is heating, you may chop your mushrooms in quarters or slices. Do this if the recipes you plan on using call for chopped or sliced mushrooms.


While you may wash the mushrooms under running water to remove stuck-on dirt, the boiling water should clean the mushrooms during cooking., Because the mushrooms are room temperature, the water will probably stop boiling when you add them. Wait until the water boils again, then turn off the heat after 1 or 2 minutes of boiling. Do not fully cook the mushrooms, as this may make them soggy.

, Prevent the heat from overcooking the mushrooms by placing them in a container of cold water. Wait until they are cool to the touch.

, The containers should be freezer safe, sealed, and have a small amount of air inside them in case the mushrooms expand during freezing. The mushrooms should retain their quality for up to 12 months.Add the frozen mushrooms directly to the dish you are cooking. If making mushroom soup, add 20 minutes before the soup is ready."

Serve.",How to Make a Mushroom Snowman," Button or very round white mushrooms are the best choice for this. The top mushroom needs to be the smallest (preferably a button mushroom), while the two descending mushrooms need to be larger than the head mushroom but either similar in size to each other, or one slightly larger than the other. All mushrooms should be rounded to help give the impression of a snowman. Large, flat mushrooms just won't work.;
, Remove any dirt or marks from the mushrooms, so that they can be eaten without concern. One washing method is to place in a colander and gently dip into a bowl of water, removing any dirt with your fingers.

, Remove the stems from the two larger mushrooms. The button mushroom that forms the head needs to keep his stem, as it forms a ""hat"" when arranged.

, On the small button mushroom, create the face as follows:


Turn the mushroom upside down. Select the ""front"" where the face will go. Choose an unblemished part with enough room to add all the facial features.
Poke two evenly spaced eye holes into the mushroom.
Stick two little raisins or similar food pieces inside each eye hole.
Carve a small hole in the middle of the face. Insert the tip of the carrot in for the nose.
Carve a small smile on the face (optional but cute).

, Arrange as follows:


Place the base mushroom onto the plate first, open part facing downward.
Balance the next slightly smaller or same-sized mushroom on top of the first mushroom, again open part facing downward.
Balance the head mushroom on top. Place the button mushroom on the middle mushroom, upside down with the stem sticking up to the ceiling.

, Make small holes in the sides of the middle mushroom where the arm sockets should be. Insert the skinny celery arms. Wiggle in a bit to ensure they stay in place.

, Place amid a plate of salad vegetables and give to the kids. Hopefully they'll be so impressed that the mushrooms all disappear without coaxing.

The sizes include large and fat eggplants, skinny small long eggplants and small round eggplants.
The colors include: Purple, dark purple, green, cream, yellow and colors in between.;
, If there is any softness, this indicates that the flesh is already starting to go off.


Softness in some spots can be salvaged by cutting around those areas but since it reduces the amount of flesh you'll end up with, ensure that you get them for a total bargain if they're like this.

, There should be no rough or brown patches anywhere on the fruit. If bruised or scarred, do not buy.

,, This is also known as the calyx. This should be sitting tightly, looking fresh and mold-free.

, Eggplants are bland and inedible raw. Their virtue lies in their ability to absorb other flavors, distribute the flavors through a dish and offer a meat-like texture that makes the dish substantial. In Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Indian cooking, they are often accompanied by tomatoes, onion and varied spices.

, Eggplants are best enjoyed when they marry well with the foods they're being cooked with. Eggplants are a great match for the following:


Dairy: Cheesy or creamy dishes; sour cream
Herbs: Basil, coriander/cilantro, garlic, mint, parsley (pesto on eggplant is especially tasty)
Spices: Coriander/cilantro, cumin, ginger
Oils: Olive oil (lots of it!)
Other: Tomatoes
Meat: Lamb, beef, mince.

, Some great ones include:


Baked eggplant
Fried eggplant
Grilled eggplant

Stuffed eggplant.

, Degorging is the process of salting and draining the eggplant, which is needed in older and bigger fruits due to their bitterness and also reduces the amount of oil absorbed by the eggplant flesh. The eggplant can also be blanched, if needed; follow the instructions of your recipe.

, This is used for larger and older eggplants and to reduce the uptake of too much oil during cooking. (Note: The eggplant will still absorb plenty of oil, just not as much as without the salting.)

Clean the eggplant.
Cut it into slices. The thickness should reflect the end use in the recipe.

Note that for roasting, you're more likely to use halves instead and cut cross-hatches across each half. The rest of the method here still applies.


Line the slices inside a colander.

, Use a damp or dry cloth to wipe your mushrooms clean. Remove the stems. You can discard the stems or chop them up and cook them.


You can also slice your mushrooms if you prefer.
To remove stems, hold the cap of the mushroom in your dominant hand and gently twist the stem with your other hand.
You can scrape out the gills with a spoon if you prefer.

, In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 2 1 clove minced garlic, 1 chopped shallot, salt and pepper to taste, and a sprinkling of fresh or dried herbs. Whisk together until mixed.

, Place your mushroom caps (and stems if desired) in a large Ziploc bag. Pour your marinade mixture into the bag and gently work it around the mushrooms. Seal the bag and lay it flat in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. If you marinade your mushrooms for longer, they can soak up more marinade than they can handle and become mushy.


It helps to flip the bag occasionally.

, Using metal tongs, gently remove your mushrooms from the bag and place them on a baking sheet sprayed with non-stick cooking oil. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, use metal tongs to flip the mushrooms and cook for an additional 10 minutes.

Freeze for up to 12 months.",How to Freeze Mushrooms2," Most mushrooms should be cooked before freezing to keep them firm. Raw mushrooms contain a significant amount of water, which may turn them into mush after the mushrooms are frozen and thawed. While you may use any cooking method, steamed mushrooms will retain the most flavor, preserve a moderately firm texture, and can be used in most mushroom recipes.Steamed mushrooms can be frozen for up to 12 months., Rinse the mushrooms under running water. Check for dirt on the surface of the cap, under the cap, and the stem. Rub dirt off with clean fingers or scrape off with a knife.


You may remove the stem and wash them separately if you wish, or discard them and freeze only the mushroom caps.

, You may steam and freeze whole mushrooms, chop them into quarters, or slice them. Whole mushrooms will take a couple minutes longer to cook, but the main purpose of slicing the mushrooms is for use in recipes. Frozen mushrooms are added directly to recipes without thawing, so you may wish to cut large mushrooms into smaller pieces for easier use later.


If you will be using a steamer basket or a double boiler, make sure the mushroom pieces aren't small enough to fall through the holes.

, The only purpose of this step is to preserve the mushrooms' color, which will otherwise darken during cooking. If you would like to do this, cover the mushrooms in 1 pint of water mixed with 1 tsp lemon juice (or 500 mL water and 5 mL lemon juice). Let sit 5 minutes, then remove.Experts disagree on whether soaking, or even rinsing, your mushrooms harms their texture or flavor.If you are concerned about this, you could reduce the possible effect by brushing the mushrooms with the lemon juice and water mixture instead.

, To steam mushrooms, you'll need a way to hold the mushrooms above the surface of the water, so they only come into contact with the steam. You can use a double boiler or steamer, but it's easy to make your own as well:


Select two pots. One must be able to fit completely inside the other. You can also use a steaming basket instead of the smaller pot.
Use a metal ring, thick jar lid, or other heat-safe object to lift the smaller pot off the surface of the larger pot. Place the ring on the base of the pot before the water is heated, then put the smaller pot on top of it.
Have a lid ready to cover the large pot. It doesn't need to be airtight, but it should trap most of the steam.

, If you have a double boiler, add this to the bottom pot. Otherwise, add it to the larger pot in the setup described above. It should only take a few minutes to boil this quantity of water.

, Put them in the raised steamer basket instead if you are using one. The smaller pot should not contain water.

, Place a lid over the pot to trap the steam and wait until the mushrooms are cooked. Most whole mushrooms will take about 5 minutes to cook, while button mushrooms or mushrooms cut into quarters will take 3 minutes 30 seconds. Slices will be ready in 3 minutes, or even less if thinly cut., The heat will continue to cook the mushrooms unless you cool them promptly. Place them in a pot or bowl of cold water until they are cool to the touch.

, Pour the water through a mesh or colander to drain the mushrooms. Putting the bowl of water directly in the freezer will form a mushroom popsicle, which is rarely used in recipes.

, You may use freezer bags, jars, plastic containers, or any other sealed container that won't crack at low temperatures. Leave about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space between the mushrooms and the top of the container, as they may expand slightly.Seal the container to make it airtight.

, Steamed mushrooms will retain their flavor and texture for up to a year. Try not to thaw mushrooms and refreeze them, as this will decrease their quality and lifespan.Add the frozen mushrooms to any recipe that involves heat, and they will thaw as they cook. Use sparingly in stir fries so as not to bring the temperature too low."

",How to Freeze Mushrooms3," This method will preserve the frozen mushrooms' flavor and texture for a shorter time than steaming and blanching. Various sources report a preservation time ranging from 1 month to 9 months, most likely varying with the type of oil or butter you use.However, this method will keep mushrooms firmer than other methods, and saves time compared to sautéing the frozen mushrooms each time you use them., Remove any dirt or moss from the mushrooms by running them under running water. Pat them dry afterward with a paper towel or clean cloth to prevent the water droplets from spattering the hot oil.

, You will be sautéing the mushrooms over high heat, so thick, whole mushrooms will cook on the outside but remain undercooked on the inside. Prevent this by cutting them into pieces of roughly equal size.

, You'll only be partially cooking the mushrooms and finishing the process when you use them frozen in recipes. Because of this, you don't have to be too exact in your measurements. Approximately 1–2 tablespoons of oil (15–30 mL) should be enough for a medium skillet.If you would like to add more flavor, add chopped garlic, onions, or spices to the oil.

, Fry the mushrooms in the oil until almost fully cooked. This should only take 3 or 4 minutes, and result in darker, more tender mushrooms.

, The mushrooms should cool to room temperature before you pack them for storage. The fats in the oil or butter will degrade in the freezer faster than the mushrooms, so you may wish to store or dispose of excess oil at this time as well.

, Press the mushrooms down into the container so there is no space between them to help prevent freezer burn.Mushrooms with surfaces exposed to air may change color and lose some flavor, but you should still leave a little space in the container before sealing. The mushrooms may expand during freezing, and the space allows them to do so without the risk of breaking the jar or bag.


Add frozen mushrooms to recipes as-is, or thaw in a frying pan or microwave if you are using a large quantity. Take care not to cook them in the microwave, or they could become rubbery.

",How to Bake Eggplant," An eggplant, whether you choose the large variety or the smaller baby eggplants, should feel firm, even when ripe. Find one with smooth skin that is dark purple or black without too many bruises or blemishes.;
, Rinse the eggplant thoroughly in cool water, making sure to scrub away any dirt from the surface of the skin. You may want to use a vegetable scrub brush, especially if your eggplant is from a farmer's market and still has bits of soil on it.

, Place the eggplant on its side on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut off the tip of the eggplant from the smaller end, taking care to remove the green cap and stem. Next, slice the eggplant according to your taste. Choose from the following common ways of slicing eggplant to prepare it for baking:


Slice it in half lengthwise. This is the simplest, most straightforward method, and is a great option if you're working with small eggplants. Each half of the eggplant will account for one serving. Place the eggplant on the cutting board and carefully slice it from tip to tip.






Slice it into discs. This is another popular method for preparing baked eggplant. Discs of eggplant may be baked by itself or used as the foundation for more complicated dishes, like stuffed eggplant. Place the eggplant on its side on the cutting board and use a knife to slice it into discs of equal width.






Slice it into cubes. Since eggplant breaks down when it bakes, slicing it into cubes results in a softer, creamier baked dish overall. To prepare it this way, slice the eggplant into discs, then slice each disc into quarters.







, Place the cut eggplant on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and use a liberal amount of salt on the open side of the eggplant slices. Salting helps draw out the extra water, so the baked eggplant will turn out less watery and mushy. It also prevents the eggplant from soaking up too much oil. You can skip this step if you're in a hurry, but it's worth doing if you want the texture of your eggplant to turn out perfectly., As the salt sits on the eggplant slices, you will see droplets of water begin to bead and drip from the fruit. If you don't see this occurring, sprinkle more salt on the eggplant.

, Carefully squeeze the water into a bowl or the sink, then pat the eggplant slices with paper towels to absorb the excess moisture. Be careful not to squeeze too hard and crush the eggplant.

,, Lay the eggplant cut-side up on a baking sheet. Drizzle the eggplant with olive oil or another type of vegetable oil. Use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to smooth the oil over the eggplant until the flesh is lightly coated all over. Sprinkle the slices with salt and pepper.

, Place the eggplant in the oven and bake it until the inside is creamy and the edges and surface have turned brown and crispy, about 20 minutes.


If you'd like cheesy eggplant, remove it from the oven and sprinkle it with Parmesan, cheddar, or goat cheese. Place it back in the oven for another 5 minutes, until the cheese is melted.
For another variation, try tomato garlic eggplant. Place tomato halves and garlic cloves around the eggplant slices and bake them together for 30 minutes.

Wash the eggplant.,
Cut off the end.,
Peel off a strip of skin.Hold the eggplant in your non-dominant hand, bracing the bottom against your cutting board at a sideways tilt.,
Remove the rest of the skin in the same manner.,
Redo sections of stray skin.,
Consider leaving the skin on.,
Peel the eggplant in a striped fashion.,
Peel only partially when cutting into slices.,
Remove the skin after you cook the eggplant.",How to Peel Eggplant," Rinse the eggplant in cool running water, then dry it with clean paper towels.


Even though you'll be removing the skin, you should still take the time to clean the dirt from it. Bacteria and grime from the skin of the eggplant can get on your hands as you handle it during the peeling process. That debris can transfer from your hands to the flesh of the eggplant post-peeling. By cleaning the vegetable before you peel it, you minimize this risk.
To the same end, you should also make sure that your hands are clean before you handle the eggplant. Wash your hands well with soap and water, then dry them off.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to remove the stem end of the eggplant. Cut off the stem end in a clean slice, positioning the slice just below the base of the stem.


The part of the eggplant connected to the stem and the leaves is naturally tougher than the rest of the vegetable, so removing it will improve the eggplant's overall texture.






Removing the stem also exposes the flesh of the eggplant, thereby giving you a cleaner, easier place to start your peeling.






If desired, you can also cut off the bottom end of the eggplant during this time. The peel can be tricky to remove at the very bottom of the eggplant, so some people prefer to remove a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) slice of eggplant from the bottom to avoid dealing with the skin there.







, Using your dominant had, position the blade of a vegetable peeler beside the skin on the top cut end of the eggplant. Draw the peeler down over the full length of the eggplant, taking a straight strip of skin with you as you go.

Always peel along the length of the eggplant (top to bottom) rather than peeling across the width (side to side). The eggplant is easier to handle when you peel along the length. As a result, the process will take much quicker and you are less likely to accidentally cut yourself.






The bottom of the eggplant should be tilted away from you or to the side. Do not tilt it toward you, and do not draw the peeler toward you as you work.






If you do not have a vegetable peeler, use a small paring knife, instead. Position the blade of the paring knife just beneath the skin at the top cut end of your eggplant. Draw the knife straight down the side of the vegetable, working carefully so that you only remove skin and do not remove any flesh from the eggplant.







, Place the blade of the vegetable peeler directly beside the bare strip on your eggplant. Draw it down the length of the vegetable again, removing another strip of skin and enlarging the bare spot on the eggplant. Continue working in this manner until the entire eggplant has been peeled.


Ideally, you should be able to remove the skin in clean strips, leaving none of it behind as you progress around the perimeter of the vegetable.

, Look over the eggplant. If you notice any small strips or patches of skin that you missed the first time around, draw the blade of the vegetable peeler over those patches to remove them. Repeat this step as needed until the entire vegetable is bare.


Continue to peel the skin away in lengthwise strips, rather than using crosswise strokes.
This step completes the standard peeling process. You can use the eggplant as called for in your chosen recipe from this point on.

, Many people prefer the taste and texture of a peeled eggplant to that of an eggplant with its skin left intact, but the skin is edible, so you may not need to peel it off.


The peel provides dietary fiber, so it is nutritionally beneficial.
Unfortunately, the skin is also tough and bitter, making it somewhat unpleasant to eat.
The necessity of peeling often depends on how the eggplant will be used. If you intend to roast or grill the vegetable in slices, leaving the skin on can help hold the flesh together. On the other hand, if you intend to cut the eggplant into cubes, quickly stir-fry slices of it, or bread it before cooking, the flesh should hold together even without the skin.
As a general rule, always peel older eggplants that are nearly over-ripe. As an eggplant ages, the skin gets tougher and becomes more difficult to cook. Young, tender eggplants can be cooked with the skin on or off., Doing this leaves some of the skin on the eggplant. The amount of skin that remains is enough to help hold the flesh of the eggplant together.To peel the eggplant in stripes, follow the standard peeling procedure with one exception: instead of removing the skin in side-by-side strips, skip over a 1-inch (2.5-cm) section of skin before peeling off your next strip. The end result will be an eggplant with stripes of skin still intact at relatively even intervals around the perimeter of the vegetable.

, If you intend to cut the eggplant into lengthwise slices or planks, leaving most of the skin on is advisable. You should still peel off a section of skin on the front and back of the eggplant, however.


Stand the eggplant upright on its end and remove a lengthwise strip of skin from one side. Remove another lengthwise strip of skin from the side directly opposite this first side, then cut the eggplant in lengthwise slices running parallel to these new bare spots. The sides of each slice should retain their peels, while the front and back of each slice should reveal the flesh of the eggplant.Doing this will allow the flesh to take on more color and flavor as you cook it.

, Even though the skin is usually removed before you cook the eggplant, you can separate the flesh of a cooked eggplant from its skin relatively easily before serving or consuming it.


You can use a paring knife to peel off the cooked skin. Wait for the eggplant to cool slightly so that you can handle it without burning your fingers. Use your non-dominant hand to hold the slice or section of eggplant in place, then use your dominant hand to carefully slice off the skin, removing as little flesh as possible in the process. The skin should separate from the flesh of the vegetable with relative ease at this point.
Depending on how soft the eggplant is after you cook it, you may even be able to peel the skin off using your fingers.
Alternatively, if you're the only one eating the eggplant and do not need to worry about serving a portion to someone else, you can separate the skin from the flesh by simply scooping the flesh out with a spoon or fork as you eat it, leaving the burnt, bitter peel on your plate.

Prepare the mushrooms for the dish they’re to be used in.,
Place the mushrooms in a colander.,
Run cool water over the mushrooms.,
Cut away any remaining dirt or mold.,
Pat the mushrooms dry with a paper towel.",How to Clean Mushrooms1," Get your mushrooms recipe ready by halving them, quartering them or removing the stems. Set the stems aside if they are to be used in the dish. Save all major chopping or slicing for after the mushrooms have been cleaned.Cutting mushrooms into slightly smaller segments increase their surface area, meaning more of the mushroom will get cleaned while rinsing.;
, Take a kitchen colander or strainer and put the mushrooms inside. Spread the mushrooms out to increase the amount of water they’re exposed to. A quick rinse under the faucet will be sufficient for cleaning most small, smooth types of mushrooms, like the white, button and leaf varieties.

, Turn on the faucet and wash the mushrooms under cool or room-temperature water at a medium pressure. Rinse the mushrooms thoroughly. Shake the colander or turn the mushrooms by hand periodically to make sure that all mushrooms have been rinsed.This method will be sufficient for quickly cleaning most varieties of mushrooms, save for those that have been dehydrated.
While rinsing mushrooms is sometimes frowned upon in culinary circles because it is thought to water down natural subtle flavors, recent culinary research has shown that rinsing mushrooms does little to increase their internal water content., Shake any excess water from the colander and lay the mushrooms out on a flat surface lined with paper towels. Use a sharp knife to slice off any part of the mushrooms that are still caked with dirt or have mold growing on them.


Because of their high natural water content and the places that they grow, a little bit of mold is normal on most mushrooms. However, if the mushrooms are especially moldy, slimy or have a dry, withered appearance, they are likely past their prime and shouldn’t be used.

, Once the mushrooms have been rinsed clean, press them gently with a folded paper towel to soak up lingering moisture. Separate the mushrooms into a single flat layer rather than a pile to help them dry faster. They're now ready to be chopped and cooked!


Take care not to mash or otherwise damage the mushrooms while drying.

Select firm, dry morels.,
Opt for smaller morels.,
Check the mushrooms for insects.,
Rinse the morels in cold water.,
Trim off the tough stems.,
Chop the mushrooms lengthwise.,
Avoid plastic bags for storage.",How to Cook with Morels1," When you’re buying morels, opt for mushrooms that firm and dry because they’re more likely to be fresh. Avoid any that are soft, wet, spongy, or shriveled because that’s usually a sign that they’re old.Stay away from morels that appear dried out or dehydrated too. They are probably old as well.;
, Large morels are more likely to be spongy and breaking down because they are older. Select smaller morels, which are usually fresh and firm.If you find large morels that are firm and dry, they are usually safe to buy. You may want to cut them down for recipes, though.

, Like other wild mushrooms, morels can sometimes have worms and other insects inside the crevices in their caps. You can still buy morels that have pests in them, but be sure to remove them when you’re cleaning the mushrooms.You can use a dry pastry brush to brush worms, insects, dirt, and debris from the outside of the morels.
If you notice silky threads that resemble mold on the morels, they may be fibers excreted by worms so check the mushrooms for pests.
While you can pick the worms out of the morels and still cook with them, it’s best to avoid any that appear heavily infested. You’ll usually wind up spending a lot of time cleaning them so they may be more trouble than they’re worth.

, There may be dirt and debris hidden in the morels’ crevices so it’s important to rinse them before cooking. Place the morels in a colander, and rinse them under cold water at the sink.After you rinse the mushrooms, shake the colander well and pat the morels dry with paper towel to remove any excess moisture.

, Morel stems are usually tough and dirty, so it’s not a good idea to use them when you cook. Use a small, sharp knife to carefully cut off the stems and discard them., For most recipes, you’ll want to cut the morels in half. However, you should cut the mushrooms lengthwise to open up their hollow centers. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut them down the middle lengthwise before cooking with them.In most dishes, cutting the morels in half is fine. However, if you like, you can quarter them lengthwise if you prefer.

, If you’re not cooking with your morels right away, you should store them in the refrigerator. However, you shouldn’t place the mushrooms in a plastic bag because they are airtight, which can cause the moisture to come out of the morels and make them slimy. Opt for paper bags for storage instead.Like plastic bags, plastic storage containers are a poor choice for storing morels because they’re airtight.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).,
Prepare the chanterelles.,
Arrange the mushrooms and onion in the prepared dish.,
Bake for 20 minutes in your preheated oven.,
Add the broth and cream.,
Bake for another 15 minutes.,
Add salt, pepper, and parley before serving.",How to Cook Mushrooms1," Meanwhile, prepare a glass casserole dish by coating the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray.


In a pinch, you could also use a metal baking dish instead of a glass casserole dish. The glass dish is less likely to taint the delicate flavor of the porous mushrooms, though.;
, The mushrooms need to be cleaned and cut before you can cook them.


Chanterelles can be intimidating to clean at first, but they are not overly difficult to clean once you know what to do. Use a soft toothbrush or nylon mushroom brush to scrub off any dirt or debris from the smooth surface of each mushroom. Then, brush out the gills of each mushroom with the same brush while holding the mushroom under cool running water.
Do not soak the mushrooms.
For this method of preparation, you should use a sharp kitchen knife to cut each chanterelle into halves or quarters. These mushrooms are meaty and best enjoyed in large chunks.

, Spread the mushrooms out in your prepared casserole dish and arrange the chopped onion over the mushrooms in an even layer.


The layers of mushroom and onion should both be even to ensure even cooking.
Onion is a good accompaniment to chanterelle mushrooms. The vegetable has a potent enough flavor to season the mushrooms but will not overpower the taste of the mushrooms like many other vegetables will.

, Cover the dish with aluminum foil and let the mushrooms and onion cook until the onions begin to turn translucent and the mushrooms begin to feel tender when pierced with a fork.

, Remove the dish from the oven and uncover it. Pour the chicken broth and heavy cream into the dish and stir the contents of the dish lightly to combine them.


The ingredients do not need to be thoroughly combined, but the mushrooms should all be coated by the broth and cream.

, Leave the dish uncovered and continue baking until the mushrooms and onion are both soft.


Note that the cream should not be allowed to boil. If it begins to bubble around the edges, remove the dish from the oven.

, Add these seasonings to your liking before serving these mushrooms as a side dish.

Dampen a paper towel with warm water.,
Wipe dirt away from the cap and stem.,
Set the mushrooms aside to dry.,
Use a brush to scrub textured mushrooms.",How to Clean Mushrooms2," Run some warm water over a paper towel. Wring out excess water and fold or crumple paper towel to create an edge you can grip while wiping the mushrooms.Using warm water will help loosen caked-on sediment.

, Use the damp paper towel to wipe along the outside of the cap and stem, including the underside. Pay particular attention to areas where dirt or discoloration appears thickest. Wet a fresh paper towel once the first becomes dirty. Wiping mushrooms down by hand can be useful if the type of mushroom you're cleaning has a broader surface area that would make working with a colander difficult.








This method works best on larger, smooth types such as porcini and portobellos that won’t require you to clean dozens of individual mushrooms by hand.
Many experienced chefs prefer wiping mushrooms to rinsing them, as they feel it better preserves the mushroom’s flavor.

, Place the clean mushrooms on a cutting board or sheet of paper towels to dry. Cut away any stubborn dirt or mold on the mushroom.

, If the mushrooms you’re cleaning have a ruffled or uneven texture, use a specially-designed mushroom brush or ordinary toothbrush to infiltrate deep crevices and scrub away dirt. Wet the bristles of the brush and use small, delicate motions to clean the cap and stem of the mushroom.








Mushrooms brushes have soft bristles and are designed specifically to scour dirt and grime from vegetables without damaging them.Should you decide to scrub mushrooms with a toothbrush, make sure it has never been used before, and has bristles soft enough to work on the bodies of delicate mushrooms.

Immerse dried mushrooms in liquid.,
Let the mushrooms soak for several minutes.,
Remove and touch up mushrooms.,
Strain and save the soaking liquid.",How to Clean Mushrooms3," Take the dried mushrooms out of their container and place them in a bowl of lukewarm water, wine, broth or oil. The mushrooms will float, so make sure to submerge them initially to ensure that the entire mushroom gets wet. Soaking will work for any small to medium-sized mushrooms, but rougher types may need to also be wiped or scrubbed before soaking, as their porous surfaces tend to hold more sediment.Dried varieties of mushrooms such as shiitake, porcini and morel will need to be soaked before being incorporated into dishes.These mushrooms typically boast bold, savory flavors and are wonderful for adding earthy tones to food.

, Leave the mushrooms to soak in the liquid for around 20-30 minutes. As they rehydrate, they will become soft and plump. Keep a close watch on the mushrooms as they soak—don’t allow them to remain in the liquid for too long.








Mushrooms that soak for too long can absorb more water than is desirable, rendering them soggy and deadening their flavor.

, Scoop the rehydrated mushrooms out of the liquid and lay them between layers of paper towels to dry. Do not try to press excess water out of the soaked mushrooms, as they will still be gradually absorbing moisture. Cut off any part of the mushroom that is still dirty or molded.









Mushrooms should be rehydrated immediately before cooking with them. You should never soak dried mushrooms only to store them for future use.

, The liquid that you soaked the mushrooms in will be infused with flavor. If you desire, you can save this liquid and use it to season or prepare other components of the dish. To do this, you must first strain out any sediment that has washed off of the mushrooms. Place a paper towel, coffee filter or cheesecloth over the opening of a container and pour the liquid from the soaking bowl into the new container. The dirt will be trapped by the filter and can then be disposed of.








Repurposing the soaking liquid will work best if you’ve used wine, oil or broth.
Mushroom liquid can be frozen and stored to be used later in other dishes.

Fill a small bowl with boiling water.,
Add the mushrooms and let them soak for at least 15 minutes.,
Drain the morels with a colander or sieve.,
Rinse the mushrooms if they still seem gritty.",How to Cook with Morels2," To rehydrated dried morels, you’ll need a small bowl that’s large enough to hold all of the mushrooms. Fill the bowl with enough boiling water to cover the morels.If you prefer, you can use warm chicken stock or cream to rehydrate the morels.
In most cases, 3 ounces (85 g) of dried morels usually equals a pound (454 g) of fresh mushrooms.

, After you’ve filled the bowl with hot water, add the morels to it. Allow them to sit in the hot water for at least 15 minutes, or until they’re soft and pliable.You can also tell that the morels have soaked long enough if they no longer crack when you bend them.

, When the morels are finished soaking, dump the bowl out into a colander or sieve. Shake the mushrooms well to ensure that you remove the excess moisture.You may want to reserve the soaking liquid from the morels. It has plenty of flavor, so you can mix it into recipes for extra seasoning or use it as a base for soups and sauces. If the liquid has dirt in it, strain it through a sieve or coffee filter to remove the debris.

, After you’ve drained the morels, run your fingers over them. If they feel gritty, place them in a colander or sieve and rinse them under cool water before cooking with them.Be sure to dry the morels thoroughly before cooking with them.

Heat the oil on high until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.For the best results, use a cast iron or stainless steel skillet to saute the morels.
You can substitute canola oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer.

, Once the oil is heated, add 8 ounces (227 g) of morel mushrooms that have been cleaned, trimmed, and cut in half to the skillet. Allow the mushrooms to cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are well browned.Occasionally stir and toss the mushrooms as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly.

, When the mushrooms are browned, reduce the heat on the stove to medium-high. Mix in a small minced shallot and a minced medium garlic clove, and let the mixture cook until it becomes fragrant, which should take 45 seconds to minute.If you’re not a fan of garlic, you can leave it out of the dish.
If you enjoy a strong garlic flavor, you can increase the amount to 2 or 3 cloves.

, After the morel mixture has become fragrant, add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of low-sodium chicken stock to the skillet. Allow the mixture to cook until the liquid reduces and a creamy sauce develops, which should take approximately 1 minute.You can use store-bought or homemade chicken stock.
If you prefer, you can substitute water for the chicken stock.

, Once the morels are coated in a creamy sauce, mix in 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh parsley. Season the dish with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, and serve it while it’s still hot.You can substitute fresh chives or chervil for the parsley.

The oil should not begin to smoke, but if a few drops of water are splashed into the pan, they should immediately sizzle and evaporate into steam upon contact.

, Button mushrooms need to be gently cleaned and cut before cooking them.


Wipe each mushroom clean with a damp paper towel or moist, clean washcloth. Focus on the surface of each mushroom.
Button mushrooms can be left whole, if desired, or cut into halves, quarters, or slices using a sharp kitchen knife.

, Let the mushrooms sit and cook in the hot oil for roughly 2 minutes, or until you see that the bottoms have begun to caramelize.


Do not toss the mushrooms before they reach this stage of the cooking process. If you do, they will begin to steam, which is a sign that the have begun to release and lose liquid.

, After the bottoms caramelize, you should use a heat-resistant spatula to continually stir and flip the button mushrooms until they just begin to brown on all sides.

, Toss the butter into the skillet and stir it together with the mushrooms until you think that all the mushrooms have been coated. Continue cooking, stirring continually.


When done, the mushrooms should all be evenly and well browned on all sides.

, Add salt, to taste, and the minced garlic. Continue cooking for another 2 minutes to infuse the mushrooms with the flavor.


Stir the mushrooms frequently as they cook.

, Stir the ingredients into the mushrooms, coating them well. Cook for several more minutes or until the liquid has been mostly evaporated.

Coat the mushrooms.,
Deep-fry the mushrooms.,
Drain and serve.",How to Cook Mushrooms3," Add enough oil to fill the stockpot halfway. Heat the oil over high heat until it reaches a temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).


Monitor the temperature of the cooking oil using a candy thermometer.
You could also cook the mushrooms in a deep fryer or dutch oven.

, The mushrooms should be cut first before being cleaned and dried.


Use a sharp knife to cut off the stems. The lower part of the stems can contain debris from straw or wood, and the stems, as a whole, are too tough to eat and should be discarded.
Cut or tear the caps into small pieces for this method of cooking.
Clean the gills of each cap by running them under rapidly moving water. Debris and insects frequently like to hide in these spaces. Use minimal water since these mushrooms are generally very moist.
Dry by gently pressing the oyster mushrooms in between clean paper towels.

, Gently beat the egg with a fork until the yolk and white are mixed.

, Stir the cold water, flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt into the beaten egg. Continue mixing with a whisk until a thin batter forms.


You can use either pastry flour or all-purpose flour for this batter. Pastry flour is less dense and will create a lighter batter.

, Dip the mushroom pieces into the batter a few at a time, turning them with a fork to coat all sides.


When you remove the mushrooms from the batter, you should hold each piece above the mixing bowl for several seconds to allow excess batter to drip off.

, Add the oyster mushrooms to the hot oil in small batches and cook for several minutes, or until they turn a rich golden-brown.


Monitor the temperature of the oil as you fry the mushrooms. The temperature will fluctuate as the mushrooms are added and removed. Adjust the heat supply as needed to make up for this.

, Remove the mushrooms from the hot oil using a slotted spoon and drain them on several layers of clean paper towels. Serve them immediately.

Prepare the mushrooms.,
Score the cap.,
Mix your marinade.,
Marinate the portobello mushrooms.,
Preheat a grill to high heat.,
Grill the mushrooms for 10 minutes.,
Serve immediately.",How to Cook Mushrooms4," Portobello mushrooms need to be cleaned and trimmed before you cook them.


Wipe the mushrooms down with a clean, moist paper towel or kitchen washcloth.
Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut off the stems. The stems are fairly woody and fibrous, so you may discard them. Otherwise, save them for use in a flavor stock later on.
Scrape out the dark black gills. These are edible, but the appearance leaves much to be desired, so they are usually removed. Pry the gills out with the tip of a metal spoon. Do not use the side of the spoon. You should be able to dig the gills out in neat, small chunks and avoid staining the cap., Use a small paring knife to cut a light “x” onto the top side of each cap.


Scoring the caps will let the steam escape more easily. As a result, the mushrooms will cook more evenly, faster, and with minimal distortion or shrinkage.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, onion, garlic, and vinegar until thoroughly combined.

, Place the caps on a plate with high sides and pour the marinade over them. Let sit in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes.


Portobello mushrooms are one of the few mushrooms that take well to being marinated, but you should still avoid marinating them for more than 1 hour.
Place the caps top-side-down when arranging them on your plate.

, Oil your grill grate to prevent the mushrooms from sticking and preheat your grill to a medium-high or high temperature.


If using a gas grill, preheat most of the burners to medium-high or high. Give the grill a few minutes to heat up.
If using a charcoal grill, pile a thick pile of charcoal in the center of the grill, add your lighter fluid, and light them up. Allow the fire to die down and do not add your mushrooms until white ash begins to form on the top of the coals.

, Arrange the portobello caps on your preheated grill top-side-down. Cook for 10 minutes without turning them, or until the caps are well browned, tender, and somewhat shrunken.

, Remove the portobello mushrooms from the grill and serve as a light vegetarian meal.

Its color should be ivory, pale orange, or light yellow. The rind should be somewhat hard to the touch and resistant to scratching.You should also smell the squash near the stem end. A fresh squash will not give off a strong odor.;
, You want to start the process with a fresh, clean squash. To start, wash your squash under running water, turning it as necessary to clean the full surface. Remove any dirt and debris from the squash's surface before proceeding., Use a slow cooker big enough to fit the full squash. Place the squash in the cooker and then cover the cooker with the lid.Poke a few holes in the squash with a fork before placing it in the slow cooker.

, Turn your slow cooker to the high setting. Then, simply allow the squash to cook. How long this takes depends on the precise size of your squash and the power of your slow cooker. Usually, it takes around three hours, but a larger squash may need to be cooked longer., After three hours have passed, check your squash. When done, your squash's skin should dent when pressed firmly with your finger. It should also give off a sweet squash smell.If your squash is not done, let it cook for another half an hour and then check again. Keep adding time and checking until your squash is fully cooked.

, Once your squash is cooked, remove it from the slow cooker. Then, use a sharp knife to cut the squash in half lengthwise. Adding a bit of salt can help draw moisture out of the squash as well.You should use tongs and gloves when handling the squash. It will be hot.

, There should be two small holes on either side of the squash, both of which are filled with seeds. Use a spoon to gently scoop out all the seeds. Pluck out any remaining seeds with your fingers.Make sure you remove all the seeds. You do not want any seeds in your spaghetti.

, Take a small fork and gently scrape it against the inside edges of your squash. Dip the fork into the squash and then use gentle motions to pull upward. The sides of the squash should break into spaghetti-like strands you can set aside on a plate.Keep pulling strands out of the squash until you have used up most of the inside.

, Place your strands of squash into a strainer. Allow any excess moisture to drain. After it's drained, you can pat out any remaining moisture with a paper towel., Squash will not have a strong taste on its own. To add some flavor to your spaghetti squash, you can add herbs, like garlic and oregano. It also goes well with cheeses traditionally used in pasta, such as parmesan cheese.Add a bit of salt to taste in order to bring the flavor out.

, You can also serve your spaghetti squash with your favorite pasta sauce. If you're trying to cut back on carbs, you can swap regular pasta for spaghetti squash in a wide variety of recipes."

Clean the mushrooms you are going to dry.,
Cut the mushrooms.,
Place the mushrooms on a baking sheet.,
Preheat the oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 Celsius).,
Take the mushrooms out of the oven after an hour.,
Place the mushrooms back in the oven.,
Continue to check the mushrooms until they are fully dry.,
Allow the mushrooms to cool.,
Store the dried mushrooms in air-tight canisters.",How to Dry Mushrooms1," If possible, use a brush or dry paper towel to wipe any dirt off of the mushrooms. You want to avoid getting the mushrooms wet while cleaning them because the water could cause other competing fungi or mold to grow on the mushroom while they are drying or after they have been stored. This extra fungi or mold could, in turn, make you ill if you eat it.If there are renegade spots of dirt that won’t allow themselves to be brushed away, you can use a damp cloth or paper towel to scrub them off. Just make sure to wipe that same spot with a dry cloth or paper towel to absorb any moisture left behind.





;
, The thicker the mushrooms, the longer it takes for them to dry out. To speed up the drying process, cut the mushrooms into slices approximately 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) thick. They will still have enough flavor packed into the slices that they will be an excellent addition to any dish, but they will dry in a much shorter amount of time than whole mushrooms.

, Make sure that the mushrooms lay flat and side by side. None of the mushrooms should overlap, as this could cause them to fuse together while drying. Lay them out in one layer.


Do not oil the sheets, as the mushrooms will absorb the oil, changing their flavor and causing them to take longer to dry.







, Once the oven has reached the designated temperature, place the baking sheet with the mushrooms into the oven. Leave the mushrooms in for one hour., When you take them out, flip them over so that they dry evenly. At this time, blot any moisture that way have risen on their surfaces during the drying process. Use a paper towel or dry cloth to remove any of the moisture.

, Bake the mushrooms for one more hour or until they are completely dried.


When you pull the mushrooms out, check to make sure they they do not have any remaining moisture on their surface. If they do, turn them over and dab away any moisture with a paper towel, then return them to the oven.







, Repeat the baking and removing moisture process until the mushrooms are totally dry. A properly dehydrated mushroom should snap apart like a cracker., Once you have taken them out of the oven, allow the mushrooms to cool on the baking sheet.Do not place them in tupperware with a closed lid while they are still hot as the heat might cause condensation in the tupperware, thus ruining all of your efforts.

, Once they have cooled completely, place the mushrooms in canisters with working seals. Keep the canisters in a dark, cool location until you are ready to use your mushrooms in soup, a baked pasta dish, or a yummy risotto."

Bring the mixture to a boil and allow to cook for a couple of minutes.,
Reduce the heat and simmer the soup for at least 10 minutes.,
Divide the soup between bowls and serve.",How to Cook with Morels5," For the soup, you’ll need 1 pound (454 g) of fresh morel mushrooms. Place them in a large bowl, and drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lemon juice over them.Make sure that the morels are rinsed and clean before you begin cooking.

, Add 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter to a large saucepan. Heat it over medium-high heat until the butter melts, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute olive oil for the butter if you prefer.

, Once the butter has melted, add the morels and a large, chopped onion to the pan. Allow the mixture to cook until the morels and onion become tender, which should take 5 to 6 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture occasionally as you saute it to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, When the mushrooms and onion are tender, sprinkle 2 tablespoons (16 g) of all-purpose flour over the mixture. Stir well to thoroughly blend in the flour., Once the flour is mixed in, add 4 cups (946 ml) of milk, 3 teaspoons (8 g) of chicken bouillon granules, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried thyme, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of black pepper. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully combined.Whole milk will create the creamiest soup, but you can use 2% milk if you prefer.
If you like, you can also mix some dried sage into the soup.

, When all of the ingredients are combined, raise the heat to high. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then allow it to cook for 2 minutes.Be sure to stir the soup the entire time that it’s boiling.

, After you’ve boiled the soup for a couple of minutes, lower the heat to medium. Let the soup simmer for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the flavors to deepen., When the soup is finished simmering, ladle it into individual bowls. Serve it while it’s still hot.The soup pairs well with crusty bread or garlic croutons.

Find an experienced mushroom forager and ask to tag along on a foray.,
Check if chanterelles grow in your area.,
Learn to identify trees, such as hemlock and Douglas fir.,
Look carefully for slivers of orange peeking out from the ground.,
Cut the mushroom at the base.,
Verify your chanterelle's identity!,
Enjoy your harvest!",How to Pick Chanterelle Mushrooms," The best way to learn how to identify a mushroom is to go with someone knowledgeable and have them show you how to identify them. Many cities have a mycological society that you can join; sometimes they organize group forays. If the society has a forum, use it. There's a much better chance of an experienced forager agreeing to teach you his or her ways if you:


Offer to drive or pay for the gas.
Promise never to visit the spots they show you, ever.
Insist that you don't want to take any mushrooms home, you just want to learn and observe.;
, The chanterelle grows in many parts of North America. The 'summer' species of the chanterelles are a deep yellow color and are in the shape of a trumpet when full-grown. This makes them quite easy to spot in the forest once you have stumbled upon an area conducive to their growth.


The best seasons of the year to hunt the wild chanterelle are late summer and early fall, depending on the amount of rainfall the area has received. Mushrooms must have a good amount of rain in order to grow. So, if your hunting area has had a decent, wet summer, start your search in late August or early to mid September. If you go out and see small chanterelles peeking up from the moss, just give them a couple of weeks to mature, then return to the area to harvest.

, Chanterelles tend to grow from the roots of these trees. If the ground is grassy or if there is a lot of leaf litter (instead of pine needles), you will probably not find chanterelles in the vicinity.


Shown in this picture is a branch from a Douglas fir tree.

, Can you spot the chanterelles in this picture? If you find one chanterelle, there are probably more nearby. Check the area surrounding the closest tree. Look at the ground from as many different angles as possible. Step carefully so you won't crush any chanterelles.

, While experienced mushroom hunters may debate the merits of cutting versus pulling, most people cut. Set the harvested mushrooms in a mesh laundry or burlap bag, as this allows the spores to fall onto the forest floor.

, The poisonous ""look-alikes"" most likely to cause problems are Jack-O'-Lantern mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus. While these are easily distinguished from chanterelles by a sensible observer, carelessness can lead to a nasty set of digestive symptoms. In some locations, lethal Cortinarius species, which have true gills, may have similar orange coloration to the chanterelle. This can lead to dangerous confusion when someone attempts to identify a mushroom based solely on photographs.Chanterelles have deep wrinkles or ridges underneath their caps, but do not have plate-like gills. Omphalotus species have true gills. Note the ridges in this picture. They are thick and not clearly separated. The ridges combine and split, unlike in gills.
Chanterelles grow in soil. Omphalotus species grow on decaying wood - but the wood may be buried and almost entirely decayed.

Omphalotus species may attain an olive tinge in age, but this is not to be relied upon.


Other look-alikes include:








The False Chanterelle Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, which, like members of Omphalotus, has true gills. This mushroom may cause digestive upsets.

Gomphus floccosus is trumpet-shaped and ridged, like the chanterelle, but has a scaly, reddish-orange cap. Like Hygrophoropsis, it causes indigestion in some people.

, Some say that all the preparation chanterelles need is a brushing to remove debris, while others will rinse them. If you rinse the mushrooms, leave them out to dry. When cooking chanterelles, many people get the best results by dry sautéing them to release excess water. The flavor of these mushrooms is light; don't put them in a very rich or savory dish.

Clean and slice the mushrooms.,
Check the weather.,
Find a good location for drying.,
Arrange the mushrooms for drying.,
Place the mushrooms in the site you selected for the drying area.",How to Dry Mushrooms2," As listed above, you should only clean mushrooms with a brush or a dry towel. Don’t use water, as water logging the mushrooms may cause outside mold or fungi to grow. Cut the mushrooms into slices 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.

, Try this method for preserving mushrooms only on sunny days with very low humidity. If there is too much humidity in the air, it will take much longer for the mushrooms to dry and mold may begin to grow.

, Possibilities include sunny rooms, windowsills, or flat rooftops that have air circulation. Pick a spot where birds, animals, bugs, and moisture can't touch the mushrooms., There are two options for this. You can either lay the mushrooms on a drying rack, or you can string them up with cooking string.On a drying rack: Lay the mushrooms flat in one layer. Make sure that none of them are overlapping as they might get stuck together while drying, or may warp into weird shapes. Cover the mushrooms and drying rack in a ‘net tent’ which you can get at most kitchen supply stores. The net tent will keep the bugs away. If you don’t have a net tent, you can simply use a piece of mesh fabric draped over and under the dry rack and mushrooms.With cooking string: Lace the cooking string through the mushrooms. You can use a sterilized needle to do this. Simply run the needle through a flame to sterilize it. Then string the mushrooms along the string as if you were making a bead necklace.







, If you are using the cooking string method, hang them somewhere dry and in the sun. Allow the mushrooms to dry in the sun for one or two days. Check their progress several times each day.


Consider finishing the mushrooms in the oven if they aren't totally dry after approximately two days in the sun. Read Method One of this article to learn how to do this.

Lay a paper towel on a flat surface.,
Lay another paper towel down on top of the mushrooms.,
Slide these paper towel-mushroom layers into a paper bag.,
Place the paper bag in the freezer.",How to Dry Mushrooms3," Place cleaned and sliced mushrooms on the paper towel. They should only be in one layer, with none of the mushrooms overlapping. If they overlap, the mushrooms may fuse together. It is very important that the mushrooms be absolutely dry. If they have even a little bit of water on them, that water could turn to ice and spoil the mushroom.

, Continue to lay mushrooms down in single layers, and then placing paper towels over those layers, until you have used up all of the mushrooms you want to dry.

, It should go without saying that you should use a large-ish paper bag that can fit all of the paper towels and mushrooms. The paper bag will allow water vapors to pass through it as the mushrooms dry.

, Overtime, your mushrooms will begin to dry in the freezer. This is a much slower process than the other two methods listed above, but is effective--particularly if you are not planning on using your mushrooms immediately."

Wash before you slice.,
Wipe off with a damp towel.,
Scrape off dirt with a pastry brush.",How to Clean Crimini Mushrooms1," Sliced mushrooms absorb more water than whole mushrooms, so it is best to wash your crimini mushrooms before you slice them. If you bought them pre-sliced, check them carefully for signs of dirt. You may not need to wash them as they may have been washed before arriving at the grocery store., Wet a paper towel or a clean kitchen cloth with water, and wring it out. Gently scrub off dirt from the top of the mushroom. Make sure that you clean out the gills or the flesh on the bottom of the cap as well., If you are planning on eating the mushrooms raw, you should avoid using water unless absolutely necessary. Use a pastry brush or a similar tool to gently remove dirt from the surface of the cap.If the dirt is stubborn or crusted on, you can cut it off with a knife.
A clean and dry toothbrush also works well for this purpose."

Wet a folded paper towel with cool water.,
Scrub the cap and stem of the mushroom gently.,
Use a mushroom brush to clean especially dirty mushrooms.,
Set the portobello aside to dry.,
Remove the stem.,
Scrape away the black gills.,
Slice off the inner edge of the cap.,
Cut the mushroom as desired.,
Check to make sure the portobellos are fresh.,
Refrigerate uneaten portobellos in a breathable container.,
Use the mushrooms within three days.",How to Clean a Portobello Mushroom," Wring out the excess water so that the paper towel is just slightly damp. In most cases, a little bit of moisture is all you’ll need to clean a freshly picked and packaged portobello.








Because of the size and anatomy of portobello mushrooms, they should be cleaned individually to ensure that the receive adequate attention.
You can also use the soft side of a kitchen sponge.;
, Go over the outer surface of the portobello with the damp paper towel using smooth, quick strokes. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, or you could damage the mushroom, causing breakage or squishy bruised spots.








Let the mushroom rest in your palm rather than grabbing it by the cap or stem.
Pay particular attention to areas where dirt and debris is heaviest.

, There may be times when a paper towel won’t be enough to clear away every last trace of dirt. A soft-bristled brush will allow you to remove more dirt and grit from the surface of the portobello without the need for a lot of soaking or rinsing.








Mushroom brushes can usually be found at culinary specialty stores, as well as most supermarkets.
Soaking mushrooms causes them to wick up water like sponge, which can dull both their flavor and texture.

, Place the clean mushroom on a layer of paper towels. If you’re preparing multiple mushrooms, move onto the next one. Continue cleaning the portobellos individually until you have as many as you need.









The paper towels will absorb whatever added moisture happens to leach out of the mushrooms.

, The easiest way to do this is to simply grip the stem by the bottom, then give it a twist and pull sharply. It should pop right off with little resistance. You can also use a paring knife to cut the stems free.








The stems of portobello mushrooms tend to be tough and woody, and are best left out of most recipes.If you don’t want any part of the mushroom to go to waste, you can save and reuse the stems by finely dicing them and using them to flavor stocks, stews or sautés.

, Turn the mushroom over to expose the underside of the cap. Rake the tip of a spoon over the meshy gills until they come loose. Wipe the underside of the cap with a damp paper towel to clear away any remaining bits.








These gills have a bitter, unappetizing taste, which can negatively affect the flavor of the finished dish.

, After scraping out the gills, you may notice a narrow lip on the underside of the cap. Run the edge of a sharp knife around this lip while rotating the mushroom slowly. When you’re done, you should be left with a smooth cap that’s flat on one side and rounded on the other.








Removing this lipped edge will allow the cap to lie flatter, which will be helpful if you plan on grilling or stuffing the mushrooms.This is an optional step that will primarily enhance the presentation aspect.

, The portobello is now ready to be prepped for the dish you’re putting together. For soups and vegetables medleys, you can slice larger mushrooms into cubes or thin strips to make them more manageable. 








When it comes to portobellos, no cutting is necessary—many chefs prefer to leave the mushroom whole for steaming, grilling or frying to preserve its hearty flavor and texture.Lightly brush portobello caps with olive oil, sprinkle them with kosher salt and bake them for a veggie-friendly alternative to sandwich buns.

, Before you buy, inspect the cap and stem for any unsightly bruises or blemishes. These may indicate that the mushroom is past its prime. A good portobello will be between 4 and 6 inches in width, firm to the touch and have a uniform color.








If possible, buy your portobellos separately from a loose bin rather than in a package. This way, you can handpick the best looking mushrooms.The condition of the gills can also be a telling sign. If the gills appear moist, slimy or shriveled, the mushroom is likely old.

, Take the portobellos out of their original packaging as soon as you get home and transfer them to a paper bag or sheet of paper towels. Mushrooms give off moisture as they sit. When left in plastic, this can cause them to turn soft and spongy.








Proper ventilation is key to ensuring that the portobellos stay fresh until you’re ready to use them.
You can also trim and wrap the caps in a double layer of damp paper towels., Portobellos, like most other fresh produce, will be best when utilized right away. Always examine mushrooms carefully before putting them in the food you eat. If they appear colorless, feel mushy or develop a questionable smell, play it safe and throw them out.It’s usually best to buy ingredients like mushrooms fresh whenever you need them.
In rare instances, portobello mushrooms may last for up to a week when stored properly.

Mushrooms will absorb water if they are soaked and won't brown during cooking. This will also diminish their subtle flavor.
Wipe each mushroom with a damp cloth or with kitchen paper towel and only do this as need to remove dirt and debris.
You can also use a special mushroom brush.;
, Mushrooms have a distinctive flavor of their own that can be brought out with simple additions such as butter or olive oil. Mushrooms contain a lot of water, so they'll shrink considerably during cooking. Also be aware that they soak up fat readily, so always use quality butter or oil for cooking.Roast mushrooms to bring out their natural sweetness.

Use a clean cloth, dry paper towel, or soft-bristled brush if you prefer. Don’t worry too much about getting every bit of dirt.There are kitchen brushes designed to help clean delicate foods, such as shiitake mushrooms. While these can be helpful, they are not necessary.
Often, a quick rub with a dry paper towel is sufficient.;
, It’s true that mushrooms will absorb a bit of moisture, so you don’t want to expose them to too much water. However, a quick rinse will not noticeably affect their composition. Simply run the faucet with cold water and hold your shiitakes in the stream for a few moments.Some chefs prefer not to rinse shiitakes. If you know your mushrooms are free of chemicals, consider foregoing the use of any water at all.

, Shake the mushrooms by hand or spin them in a salad spinner to remove residual water. If water remains caught on the underside of a particular mushroom, hold it by the stem and shake more vigorously.Rinse again if visible dirt remains.

Avoid soaking the mushrooms.",How to Clean Crimini Mushrooms2," Turn the sink on a gentle flow with cool water. Rinse each mushroom individually, gently rubbing off dirt with your fingers. Pat dry with a paper towel when you are finished., If you own a salad spinner, you can put the mushrooms inside the basket. Run or spray water over them until all of the dirt runs off. Put the top back on, and spin the basket until the mushrooms are dry., Crimini mushrooms, like all mushrooms, absorb water easily, and this can make them taste spongy or rubbery. To avoid this, do not soak crimini mushrooms when washing them. Use only enough water to remove the dirt from the surface.Soaking mushrooms is really only a good option for mushrooms collected in the wild, such as morels or chanterelles.The vast majority of crimini mushrooms are raised commercially, and do not require soaking.

Clean right before using.,
Throw out bruised mushrooms.,
Remember to clean the bottom of the mushroom.",How to Clean Crimini Mushrooms3," Crimini mushrooms should be washed right before you plan to use them. Do not wash them before putting them into the refrigerator. They should be stored unwashed, as moisture can make them spoil more quickly., As you wash the mushrooms, examine each one to make sure that it is still fresh. A fresh mushroom has firm flesh. A spoiled mushroom may be spongy, soggy, bruised, or slimy. Toss these mushrooms as they may no longer be safe to eat., Make sure that you gently but thoroughly clean the gills and the rim beneath the cap. While some criminis may not have developed gills yet, it is important that you still clean the bottom of the mushroom thoroughly. This is the area where most of the bacteria on mushrooms lives."

Remove from heat.",How to Cook with Mushrooms2," It will make it easier to make your sauce quickly if you have everything on hand. You will need the following: Butter
8oz sliced mushrooms
1 finely diced shallot
3/4 cup beef stock
Fresh herbs

, Do this in a large skillet big enough that the mushrooms can be spread out in a single layer. Don't do this on too high a heat or the butter will start to brown.
Keep an eye on the melting butter, making sure it coats the bottom of the pan.
When the butter stops foaming it is hot enough to add other ingredients.

, Make sure the mushrooms aren't too crowded in the pan. Sauté the mushrooms until they are golden and soft.
Take care not to burn the shallots. Their flavor is very delicate.
Turn the heat to medium/high.
Add 3/4 cup of beef stock and simmer rapidly for 5 minutes. This make your sauce thicken.
Simmer at medium to low heat.
Stir the sauce occasionally to keep bits from sticking to the pan.
Watch it carefully to see that it doesn't boil over.

, Stir in 1 tablespoon butter and fresh herbs to your preference. You can add thyme or tarragon as a nice complementary seasoning to your mushrooms. Chives or basil are also good choices.

Purchase dried mushrooms.,
Rehydrate the mushrooms.,
Save the soaking liquid.",How to Cook with Mushrooms4," You can find these at most grocery stores. They used to be more expensive but they are going down in price. An advantage of using these is you only need a very small amount to pack in a lot of flavor to a mushroom dish. These generally come in two varieties: Asian mushrooms (such as shiitake and wood ear) and Euro-American (morels, porcini, trumpet etc.).
These will last a year if kept in a tight, dry container.
Dried mushrooms are often used with cheaper fresh mushrooms to boost flavor.

, You will need to do this to use them. There are advantages to this. The mushrooms themselves will rehydrate quickly by soaking in water and the soaking liquid has lots of flavor and can be used in many different recipes.
Before you start doing anything else in a recipe that calls for using dried mushrooms, start rehydrating them.
Use room temperature water. Cover the mushrooms generously.
Thinly sliced mushrooms should only need to soak for about 1/2 an hour.
Whole cap or thickly sliced mushrooms might need to soak 8 hours or more.
After soaking them, rinse the mushrooms to remove any grit. One of the pitfalls of using dried mushrooms is many varieties have an unpleasant grit to them. Rinsing them after soaking will help to remove this grit.

, This is full of flavor and a wonderful addition to recipes which call for stock. If you don't want to use this right away, put it in a container and refrigerate it. It will keep for several days.
You can also freeze it for longer periods if necessary.
The remaining liquid will have lots of the grit from the mushrooms in it.
You will need to strain it before using it to avoid the grit getting into your dish.

Know your mushroom species.,
Search for mushrooms in local wooded areas.,
Gather some mushrooms.,
Check for freshness.,
Buy mushrooms at the grocery store.",How to Cook with Mushrooms5," You will need a very good knowledge of which mushrooms are safe to eat, what they look like, and where they grow. Some popular varieties of wild mushrooms include morels, oysters, and lion's mane.
Be careful. Some species of poisonous mushroom can look very similar or just like some popular varieties of edible mushrooms
For example, the green spored lepiota mushroom is very toxic but resembles the white button mushrooms you can find in the grocery store.
Only eat a mushroom if you have a 100% positive id.
Even after identifying the mushroom's safety, only try a little to begin with to ensure that you don't react to it badly.
Use multiple field guides to identify a mushroom. If you aren't sure of an ID, ask an expert before you cook it.
When in doubt, throw the mushroom away.

, This activity is not for the casual forager. Poisonous mushrooms are highly toxic and can cause severe illness and death. Some mushrooms grow on fallen trees or roots, and others grow in the ground.
It is a good idea to carry a mushroom guide with you to help you identify areas where mushrooms will grow and what species they are.
Mushrooms have different seasons. The mushroom season is between late spring and early fall in most areas of North America.
The best time to look for mushrooms is after a rainy period. Mushrooms need a lot of moisture to grow.
If you're mushroom hunting somewhere new to you, ask locals for advice. Deadly twins exist, where a mushroom that is safe in one place may be poisonous in another even though they look the same.

, Make sure you keep each variety of mushrooms separate. If you accidentally pick a toxic mushroom, it could contaminate the rest. Grab a flat bottomed basket. You can also use a flat bottomed cloth bag reinforced with a piece of cardboard.
Avoid using grocery bags. These will allow too much moisture to build up and might diminish the taste and quality of your mushrooms.
Plastic grocery bags also don't offer enough protection. If you carry your mushrooms in these they might get bruised or ruined if you bump into anything.
Use a pocket knife to cut the mushroom at the base.

, You do not want any blemished or old specimens.Mushrooms are fresh if their caps are clean, bright, and have no blemishes or bruises.
The gills should be pale pink or not too dark.
If you doubt the freshness or integrity of a mushroom, don't pick it.

, If you don't want to go to the trouble or foraging for mushrooms or don't have the necessary knowledge to do so, mushrooms can be bought at the grocery store relatively inexpensively. Most chain grocery stores will at least carry white button mushrooms and portobellos.
Specialty stores will have rare and more expensive varieties of mushroom such as morels, chanterelles, truffles, and maitake.
Many stores are now selling rarer or imported mushrooms in dried form. These are often more inexpensive than fresh mushrooms and can be rehydrated for cooking.

Remove dried mushroom's stems before re-hydrating.,
Slice from the top of the cap.",How to Clean Shiitake Mushrooms2," While keeping the stem is a matter of personal preference when preparing many mushrooms, shiitake stems should always be removed. To remove a shiitake stem, tightly pinch it right where it meets the cap. Then slowly pry the stem away from the cap in the opposite direction the stem is leaning.For instance, if you’re holding the mushroom upside down and the stem is leaning towards you, pry the stem away from you.
Discard the stems or save them for use in soups and stocks.

, Dried shiitake mushrooms aren't quite as flavorful, but they can be good to keep on hand because they last a long time and are especially useful in some dishes. They do require a bit more prep work, however, as they need to be soaked in water prior to cooking. Just be sure to snap off the stems first, as it's much easier to do while they're still dry., Depending on how you wish to use your shiitake mushrooms, you may wish to cut them up. Thin slices are recommended. Place a cap right side up on a cutting board and carefully cut it into thin slices.If you’re comfortable doing so, you can stack one shiitake mushroom cap on top of another and slice them simultaneously in order to save time.

Select shiitakes from loose bins.,
Choose firm, dry shiitakes.,
Store mushrooms in the fridge.",How to Clean Shiitake Mushrooms3," Whenever possible, opt for mushrooms sold out of loosely packed bins, as opposed to plastic-wrapped containers. This will allow you to select the cleanest and best-looking individual mushrooms.Look for the mushrooms with the thickest caps.

, Both the stem and the cap of the mushrooms you select should be firm and dry to the touch. Mushrooms with domed caps that curl under are especially fresh. Avoid shiitakes that appear shriveled, or feel soft or slimy to the touch.The gills on the underside of the mushroom’s cap should be dry and firm too.
Dark spots or a wet appearance indicate that a mushroom is past its prime. This evidence will first show itself on a mushroom’s gills.

, Refrigeration can help keep your mushrooms fresh. Keep them in an open plastic bag, as they need access to air. If you purchase them fresh, they will last for a few days.If you want to preserve shiitakes in the fridge for a bit longer, cut off their gills. This will keep the rest of the mushroom fresh for about a week.

Keep the zucchini peel on also has health benefits. Primarily, the peel offers extra fiber, and dietary fiber can help regulate your digestive system.
Slice off one end of the zucchini so that you have a flat surface to place on your counter. Use a vegetable peeler to peel off the dark green skin, revealing the light green flesh beneath it.;
, You can make long, thin ribbon noodles using a vegetable peeler or mandolin.


Pass the peeler or mandolin over the side of the zucchini lengthwise to produce long, flat noodles. When you approach the seeds, turn the zucchini and begin slicing another side. The seeds will prevent the noodles from holding together, so you do not want to use the part with seeds in it.If using a mandolin, make sure that you use one of the smallest blade settings in order to produce small, thin noodles.

, For flexible yet thicker slices suitable for use as lasagna noodles, use a mandolin or sharp kitchen knife.


Cut slices of the zucchini off the vegetable lengthwise using a knife. The noodles should hold their form but still be fairly thin.
When you approach the seeds, turn the zucchini and begin slicing another side. The seeds will prevent the noodles from holding together, so you do not want to use the part with seeds in it.
If using a mandolin, use the thickest blade setting possible. Pass the zucchini over the blade lengthwise to produce long slices.

, Spaghetti style zucchini noodles can be made using a vegetable peeler, julienne peeler, or mandolin.


Pass the peeler or julienne peeler down one lengthwise side of the zucchini. Only catch a thin portion of the zucchini, no thicker than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm), for each pass in order to create thin spaghetti-like noodles. If using a julienne peeler, this thickness should already be preset, so no additional work will need to be done on your part.
If using a mandolin, make sure that the blade is set for a julienne style cut. Pass the zucchini over the blade lengthwise to create thin noodles.
When you approach the seeds, turn the zucchini and begin slicing another side. The seeds will prevent the noodles from holding together, so you do not want to use the part with seeds in it.

, Shredded zucchini noodles can be prepared using a grater.


Simply pass the grater over the zucchini, pressing firmly to create little rice-like shreds of vegetable. It is still recommended that you work lengthwise instead of widthwise, since you can avoid the seeds more effectively by working lengthwise.
When you approach the seeds, turn the zucchini and begin shredding another side. The seeds will prevent the noodles from holding together, so you do not want to use the part with seeds in it.

, You can cut spiral noodles a special spiral vegetable cutter.Press the zucchini against the blade of the spiral slicer and crank the handle of the simple machine. As you wind the handle and press on the zucchini, thin spirals should come out of the other end of the blade.

, Zucchini noodles can be enjoyed raw in salads or on their own, but you can also boil, sauté, and microwave them to make them more tender and more reminiscent of actual pasta.


Zucchini is rather moist, however, so you should drain them even if you plan to consume the noodles raw. Instead of “sweating” the noodles, as outlined in this article, you would be better off placing the noodles inside a colander and letting them drip dry for 15 to 20 minutes. When done, wrap the noodles in paper towels and squeeze gently to absorb as much excess moisture as possible.

, Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with paper towels.


Under normal conditions, you would not want to place paper towels in your oven. An oven uses dry heat, which could cause the paper towels to catch fire. Since zucchini contains a large quantity of water, though, the paper towels will quickly become damp enough to prevent them from drying out and catching fire in the oven.

, Spread the noodles out in as flat a layer as possible.


If you cannot create a single layer of zucchini noodles, consider using multiple baking sheets instead of just one. In order to properly drain, all of the noodles need to be touching the paper towel lining the pan. Otherwise, the noodles on the bottom may not dry out as evenly as those on the top.
Sprinkle the zucchini noodles with salt before putting them in the oven. The salt will help draw out some of the moisture.

, Place the zucchini noodles in the oven and let them bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the majority of the moisture inside the noodles has dripped or “sweated” out.


Sweating is an important part of the process when you plan to prepare a dish with zucchini noodles in it. It is the most effective way to remove moisture from the noodles, and if you do not remove as much moisture as possible before use, the noodles could actually cause your final dish to become watery.

, Wrap the paper towels around the zucchini noodles and squeeze the noodles gently to get any remaining moisture out.


Note that the noodles will be dry at this point but no longer soft. As a result, you will need to cook them further.

, Fill a medium saucepan between 1/2 and 2/3 full with water. Place it on the stove and heat it over medium-high until the water reaches a rolling boil.


Add salt. After the water reaches a boil, add a generous amount of salt to the water. The zucchini will absorb the salt as it cooks, thereby becoming flavored on both the inside and outside. You can add salt before the water reaches a boil, but doing so will cause the water to take a longer amount of time to reach a steady boil.

, Place the zucchini noodles in the boiling water and cook until they are tender but not quite falling apart.


The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on how soft you want the zucchini noodles and how dry they are when you start. If the noodles are still fairly moist, 2 minutes should be long enough. If they are very dry, however, you will need to cook them 10 minutes for al dente noodles and 15 for soft, silky noodles.The main thing to remember is simply to keep an eye on them. If the noodles start breaking apart, you need to stop the cooking process.

, Drain the water and transfer the zucchini noodles to individual serving plates.


Drain the water by pouring the zucchini noodles through a colander. Let stand for 5 minutes or so, just long enough for any excess water to finish dripping off each noodle.

, Add about 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of canola oil or your preferred cooking oil to a large skillet and heat on medium-high until smoother and glossier.


Carefully turn and rotate the pan to coat the entire bottom with the hot oil. When the oil is hot enough, you should be able to spread it in this manner with ease.

, Add the zucchini noodles to the hot oil and sauté them for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently.Keep a close eye on the zucchini noodles as they cook. If you allow them to stick to one spot for too long, they may begin to burn, stick to the pan, and fall apart.
This cooking method produces noodles that are tender yet slightly crispier than those created through the boiling method.

, Transfer the zucchini noodles to individual serving plates and enjoy.


You can save any leftover zucchini noodles after cooking them. They maintain their taste and texture for a day or so in the refrigerator, so they can be enjoyed cold or reheated for another meal.

, For this method, you should let the zucchini noodles retain some of their natural moisture so that they will cook without drying out completely in the microwave.


You can skip the sweating portion of the instructions altogether or simply skip the part in which you wring out extra moisture using the paper towels. That said, you may still want to let the zucchini noodles drain in a colander for 10 minutes or so before microwaving them.
If you do happen to dry the zucchini noodles out beforehand, you can still use this cooking method. Simply add 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of water to the dish with the zucchini noodles to provide the noodles with just enough moisture to keep from drying out.

, Arrange them in an even layer and cover loosely with a microwave-safe lid or piece of microwave-safe plastic wrap.


The seal should not be especially tight. If you use a lid, open any vents in the lid or leave it partially cracked open to vent the dish as it cooks. If you use plastic wrap, drape the plastic wrap over the top instead of securing it on tightly.

,


Keep a close eye on the zucchini noodles as they cook. If you overcook them, they could become soggy, hard, or otherwise gross.

, Drain the excess liquid and transfer the zucchini noodles to individual serving plates.


There will almost always be excess liquid in the dish after you make zucchini noodles in the microwave. You can drain the liquid easily using a colander.

, This means you should cut the squash along the middle. Make a long cut running from the top of the squash to the bottom.Be careful how you hold the squash when cutting. Make sure the knife's blade does not face the hand holding your squash. If you slip up, you could end up cutting your hand.

, You will find two circular crevices inside the squash. These crevices will be filled with seeds, which should be removed prior to eating the squash.Take a metal spoon and scoop out the seeds, as well as any pulp.
Seeds and pulp may be sticky or watery. You may have to scrape the surface of the squash with the spoon to remove leftover residue.

, Cut them in half width-wise rather than length wise. You should be left with four somewhat square-like pieces of squash. Two of the pieces with be slightly smaller. Two of the pieces will be rounder and larger., Work with one piece of squash at a time. Cutting lengthwise, cut the cube into six even slices.

Serve.",How to Make Stuffed Zucchini3," The first thing you should do to prepare the zucchini is to soak the zucchini in cold water for 30 minutes. As you soak them, you can scrub them to remove any dirt or grit. Soaking them will help soften them a bit. Then, use an apple corer to slice off both ends of the vegetable, and then hollow out the zucchini, trying to scoop out the centers so all you have left are little zucchini ""boats"" that will hold the meat stuffing.


Don't throw out the zucchini flesh. Instead, chop it up and set it aside to use for the stuffing later.

, Just pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the skillet and give it a minute to sizzle and be warm enough to cook the meat.

, Turn the ground veal as you cook it so it absorbs the oil evenly. Cook it for about 4 minutes, until it is golden brown or just slightly browned. Then, use a slotted spoon to move the veal to a bowl. Leave the remaining grease in the skillet.

, Now, place another tablespoon of olive oil the same skillet and cook 2 peeled and smashed garlic cloves in it. Give it about 2 minutes to turn golden, and then remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and discard it -- the garlic flavor will remain in the oil.

, Now, cook the zucchini flesh in the oil, which is infused with garlic and the grease from the veal, for about 5-6 minutes. Then, place the zucchini flesh in the bowl of veal.

, Mix the zucchini flesh with the veal and stir them well to combine the ingredients. Then, fill the zucchini ""boats"" with the stuffing.

, Place 2 more tablespoons of oil in a heavy skillet and heat it up over medium high heat. Once the oil is hot, after a minute or two, place as many stuffed zucchini as can fit in a single layer on the skillet. Wait for the zucchini to brown on all of their sides, and turn them when needed. This should take about 10 minutes. Once the zucchini are done, use the slotted spoon to move them to a platter. Repeat this with any remaining zucchini until they are all cooked.

, Cook it over medium high heat, stirring it until it becomes golden brown.

, Add 1/2 a cup of dry white wine to the pan and cook the zucchini there. The wine should bubble. While you cook the zucchini, sprinkle it with salt and pepper to taste. Then, add the seeded and peeled tomatoes to the pan. Alternately, you can used canned tomatoes if you want to save time.

, Turn the zucchini from time to time to make sure that they cook evenly. When they are tender, remove them from heat. Wait at least 5 minutes for them to cool a bit before serving.

Allow jars to cool undisturbed for 12 to 24 hours.",How to Pickle Okra," If possible, you should pickle okra within 6 - 12 hours of picking. Select tender, green pods of okra that are 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) long for pickling.;
, Trim the end of the stem off the okra, but leave the okra whole. Make the final okra everything that would you feel comfortable eating.

, In a large pot, arrange your canning jars onto a wire rack so that they don't rest on the bottom of the pot. Fill the pot with water, so that the jars are completely submerged. Turn the burner on and allow the water to come to a boil. Boil for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, turn the burner off.


Remove the canning jars with canning tongs and place them on a counter pre-lined with a clean towel. Do this so that the heat difference between the counter and the jars doesn't cause them to crack.
Dunk the lids and tops into the near-boiling water and leave them there for 5 minutes before removing and placing on a clean towel.

, Over low heat in a pan, combine all the pickling spices and toast until slightly brown and aromatic, about 2 - 4 minutes. Set aside.

, Combine the water, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pickling spices in a non-reactive pot and bring to a boil. Stainless steel, aluminum, glass, and enamelware are all appropriate for boiling pickling solutions. As soon as the solution reaches a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and keep warm.

, Before you pack in the okra, slice up a lemon into four more-or-less equal slices. Place each slice in the bottom of each canning jar you'll use. Then, pack the fresh okra into each of the four jars, being careful not to overcrowd.


Place the okra into the jars with their stem ends up.
Be sure to leave .5 inch (1.25 cm) headspace in each canning jar.
You can add a clove of garlic to each jar at this time for added flavor. A jalapeño or habanero pepper will add a little kick to the okra. Experiment with different additions in different jars!

, This may be easier to do with a canning funnel, but one is not necessary if you have a very steady hand. Leave .5 inch (1.25 cm) head space.

, Extra air can be a vector for germs and bacteria, increasing the likelihood of spoilage.

, Use the same water that you used to sterilize the canning jars in Part One. Make sure there is at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water over your jars during processing. Turn the heat to the highest setting and bring the water to a boil.


Load the jars into the canner rack and lower it into the hot water in the canner. Ensure that the water comes up at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the lids of the jars.
Put the lid on the canner and lower the heat so that the water stays at a gentle boil for 10 minutes.
If the water falls below 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the tops of the jars at any time, add more boiling water.
After 10 minutes, turn off the heat, remove the lid of the canner, and use a jar lifter to place the jars on a towel. Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between jars.

, Test the seals of the jars by removing the bands and looking at the lids. They should be concave in the center. If any jars have not sealed, you can reprocess them within 24 hours. Allow the jars to stand for several days to one week before use.


A rule of thumb is to allow your pickled okra to sit about 6 weeks before eating them.

Each pumpkin will yield a cup or so of puree.


Look for pumpkins with bright orange flesh, no big bruises or gouges, and a relatively uniform shape.
Heirloom pumpkins often have striated colors like yellow and green in addition to orange. These make great puree, too, but the color may not be the classic bright orange you're used to.
Avoid decorative baby pumpkins - these don't contain enough meat to make much pumpkin puree, and they aren't grown to be eaten.;
, Run them under cold water and scrub away any dirt or other debris, especially if you got the pumpkins from your garden or a pumpkin patch.

, Start by chopping off the stems, leaving as much of the body intact as possible. Next slice the pumpkins in half, revealing their seeds.

, Use a large spoon to scoop all of the pumpkin seeds from the halves into a bowl. Save the seeds for later, since they're delicious roasted. Scoop out as many of the orange strings as you can, too.

, Finish processing the pumpkins by slicing the halves into quarters. You should now have 8 (or more, if you're using more than 2 pumpkins) wedges of pumpkin to work with.

Store the puree.",How to Make Pumpkin Puree2,", Space them evenly along the baking sheet, skin-side down. Try not to let any of the wedges touch, since they won't cook as evenly that way. There's no need to drizzle oil on the wedges; the puree should have no ingredients aside from pure pumpkin if you plan on using it in a recipe later., Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the wedges bake for about 40 minutes. When the wedges are finished, you should be able to easily slide a fork through the flesh. Remove them from the oven and let them cool.


Don't roast the wedges until they turn brown; this affects the flavor of the puree. They should be roasted until they're just cooked through.
Pour some water into the baking tray with the wedges to prevent them from overcooking. The water will create steam as it heats up, helping the pumpkin cook evenly without browning.

, Once the wedges are cool enough to handle, it's time to peel the skin away from the flesh. Use your fingers to lift the skin off of the pumpkin meat. It should come off quite easily. You can use a fork to help you separate the skin if necessary. Put the pumpkin meat into a bowl and discard the skin.

, Place it in a food processor and pulse it until it's completely smooth. Check to make sure there are no remaining lumps. If you don't have a food processor, you can use a blender or a potato masher instead.


If the pumpkin puree seems too dry, add a few spoonfuls of water to moisten it.
If the pumpkin puree seems too wet, strain it through cheesecloth before storing.

Be cautious with unripe pineapples.,
Cut the pineapple.,
Grill the pineapple.,
Heat pineapple slices in the oven.,
Simmer the pineapple.,
Sprinkle sugar over cut pineapple.",How to Ripen an Unripe Pineapple," Most of the usual signs of ripe fruit don't mean much on a pineapple. Sniff the base of the pineapple instead: a strong scent means the pineapple is ripe. If you can barely smell it, it's probably not. Cold pineapples never smell strong, so leave them at room temperature for a while before you try this.


A yellow-skinned pineapple is a safer choice than a green one, but this isn't a perfect test. Some pineapples are ripe when completely green.Others have golden or red skins, but are still hard and unpleasant to eat.;
, Pineapples do not ripen properly after they are picked.On your kitchen counter, the pineapple will become softer and juicier, but it will not become sweet. All of a pineapple's sugar comes from the starches in the stem of the plant. Once that source is cut off, the pineapple cannot make more sugar on its own.Green pineapples will usually change color as well.
It's possible that the pineapple will become even more acidic if stored too long..

, If the pineapple does have a little starch left to convert to sugar, this will be in the base of the fruit. In theory, the sugar might spread better if you keep the pineapple upside down. In practice, the effect is hard to notice, but it might be worth a try.The skin color also travels from the base upward, although this isn't relevant to the ripeness after picking.
If it's difficult to prop up your pineapple, twist off the top and place the exposed end on a damp paper towel., The pineapple should soften within a day or two. Most pineapples will quickly ferment if stored for much longer than this.If the pineapple was picked unripe, it will still be unpleasant to eat. Keep reading to find out how to improve the taste of an unripe pineapple.
If you're not ready to eat the pineapple yet, move it to the fridge for another 2–4 days.

, Very young, unripe pineapples may be toxic. Eating them can irritate your throat and have a severe laxative effect.That said, most pineapples sold commercially should be at least partially ripe, even if they look green.


Even ripe pineapple can hurt your mouth or cause it to bleed. The techniques below will help prevent this as well.

, Cut off the stem and crown of the pineapple, then stand the rest flat on a cutting board. Cut off the rind and eyes, then slice into rounds or chunks.

, Grilling will caramelize the sugars in the pineapple, adding flavor to a bland, partially unripe fruit.The heat will also neutralize bromelain, the enzyme that can cause pain and bleeding in your mouth., This has the same results as grilling: a delicious, sweet pineapple. If the pineapple is quite tart and unripe, sprinkle brown sugar over it before heating.

, Although this won't caramelize the sugar, simmering will neutralize all of the bromelain.Try this if raw pineapple hurts your mouth:


Add pineapple chunks to a saucepan along with all juice collected while cutting.
Add enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce to a simmer and heat for 10 minutes.
Drain and let cool.

, If your pineapple doesn't taste sweet, sprinkle the chunks or rounds with sugar. Eat right away, or store covered in the fridge.

Bake the squash for 40 to 50 minutes.The spaghetti squash should be completely tender if you poke it with a fork.

, Use a fork to scrape the spaghetti squash flesh into a mixing bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil and 1/4 teaspoon of ground thyme to the spaghetti squash. Stir the mixture to incorporate the seasonings.Set the spaghetti squash aside while you prepare the beef filling.

, Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil shimmers, stir in one onion that's been diced and 2 pounds (907 g) of ground beef. Season the onion and beef with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and cook it until the meat is completely browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.Stir the beef and onion frequently to prevent it from sticking to the pan.
If the ground beef is greasy, consider draining the grease from the pan before using the meat in the casserole.

, Stir 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 1/2 cups (35 g) of marinara sauce into the sauteed beef and onion mixture. Cook the mixture for another minute over medium heat.You can use your favorite spaghetti sauce in this recipe or use a homemade marinara sauce.

, Spread half of the seasoned spaghetti squash in the prepared baking dish. Spoon half of the meat sauce over the squash and sprinkle 3/4 cup (84 g) of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Spread the remaining spaghetti squash over the cheese and top that with the remaining meat sauce.Ensure that the sides of your baking dish are well greased so the casserole doesn't stick as it bakes.

, Get out a small bowl and combine 1/4 cup (25 g) of grated Parmesan cheese with 1/4 cup (25 g) of panko breadcrumbs. This will give the casserole a little extra crunch and creamy flavor.If you don't have panko breadcrumbs, you can use traditional breadcrumbs.

, Turn the oven temperature down to 375 degrees F (190 C). Sprinkle the cheesy breadcrumb topping evenly over the top of the casserole. Cover the casserole with a sheet of aluminum foil and bake it for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake it for another 10 minutes. The casserole should be golden and bubbly.For a little extra spice, consider sprinkling red pepper flakes over the casserole.

You can also slice the pineapple into cubes. You can cut the pineapple rings or cubes as thick as you'd like.;
, Put the pineapple rings in a saucepan. Pour enough water to cover the pineapple and turn the heat on to medium-high. When the water begins to boil, turn the heat down so it's bubbling gently. Simmer the pineapple until it's soft. Check the pineapple after it's simmered for 5 minutes., Scoop out the softened pineapple and arrange it in a shallow baking dish. Leave 1 cup (240 ml) of the water in the saucepan or add enough water to make 1 cup (240 ml). Add 1/2 cup (100 g) of the sugar and 1/2 cup (155 g) of corn syrup. Stir the mixture well and heat it over medium. The syrup should begin to boil and the sugar will dissolve.It's important to use the corn syrup. Because corn syrup is an invert sugar, it will prevent the glaceed pineapple from crystallizing.

, Carefully pour the hot syrup directly over the pineapple in the shallow baking dish. The fruit should be covered with the syrup. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let it sit out at room temperature overnight., The next day, remove the cover from the baking dish and pour the syrup into a saucepan.

With your hand, gently rub the skin of the zucchini while holding it under water until it no longer feels gritty.;
, Remove both the stem end and the flower end of the zucchini with a sharp paring knife.

, If the zucchini is greater than 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter then the seeds may be large and bitter. If this is the case then carefully split the zucchini from end to end, lengthwise.


Hold a spoon firmly in one hand and the zucchini in the other, run the tip of the spoon down the zucchini with gentle pressure to remove the seeds. If your zucchini are smaller then you're ready to grate them.

, Set the grater on a firm surface such as a cutting board. You can either grate the zucchini in a pile straight on the cutting board, or you can place a bowl under the grater to catch the grated zucchini and make your clean-up easier.

, Most graters have both coarse and fine patches of the grating surface. Grate a bit on each to test and see what size looks right for your purposes.

Some graters will have a mandoline-style slit for grating, which will result in thin sliced rounds of zucchini, appropriate for stir-fry, lasagna, or other uses in which you'd like to see the zucchini. This would probably be inappropriate for baking into zucchini bread, however.

, With the other hand, hold the zucchini. Evenly run the zucchini up and down the coarse-holed side of the grater while pressing down firmly.


A box grater will collect the zucchini inside, and you'll need to remove it in order to grate several zucchini. As the zucchini accumulates under the plank grater you can simply scoop it aside to continue grating.

, You'll have to reposition your fingers slightly as you gradually grate up the zucchini. Eventually, there won't be much left to hold. Don't try to grate it until it disappears, because you'll end up with a little fingertip in your cookies if you're not careful.


If you're feeling thrifty, stab the nub of zucchini left with a fork and try to grate as much as possible with that, your fingers safely out of the way.

, Affix the coarsest or largest hole grating attachment, according to your food processor's directions.


Make sure the appliance is clean and assembled properly before starting to grate.

, Depending on the size of your food processor, you might want to chop your larger cleaned zucchini into some smaller pieces before you start feeding it into the food processor.

Position the gourds in the drying area.,
Inspect the gourds regularly for mold.,
Discard any rotting gourds.,
Determine whether the gourds have dried completely.,
Handle your dried gourds with care.",How to Dry Gourds for Decorating," Drying gourds while keeping them from rotting means reducing their exposure to bacteria and fungus. The first important step in this process is to rinse any dirt and debris from the gourds' rinds with clean water. After this, use a cloth to rub a bleach solution (or full-strength distilled vinegar) over the rinds. Dry the rinds with a clean cloth.
, The drying environment is crucial; it must be dark, cool, dry, and extremely well ventilated. Moist or poorly ventilated areas will nearly always cause the gourds to rot instead of drying. To ensure excellent ventilation, open windows and run a fan in the room where the gourds are drying., After choosing an area, put the clean gourds into place for drying. Do not allow the gourds to touch each other, as this prevents adequate air circulation and can encourage microbial growth. For extra air circulation underneath the gourds, place the gourds onto a makeshift wood lattice, poultry wire, or another porous material., If you catch mold growth early, you can often remove it without damaging the gourd. If you see any black, white, or blueish-green growth on the outer rind of your gourds, scrape it off with a butter knife. Disinfect the surface again with bleach, and wipe it dry. If the rind is still hard and shows no discoloration, the gourd is still healthy., Once a gourd develops a soft, discolored spot in its rind, it has started to rot. This process cannot be undone, and if left in place rotting gourds can quickly spread their microbes to neighboring gourds. Inspect your drying gourds daily for soft spots, and throw any offending specimens into your compost pile or garbage. Note that no matter how ideal your drying environment, some gourds will inevitably get moldy., When your gourds are satisfactorily dried, you can shake them and hear the seeds rattling around inside. The entire process will take between a few weeks and a few months depending on conditions. Generally, Cucurbita gourds dry faster than Lagenaria gourds., As you plan your fall decorations, handle the dried gourds gingerly. Gourds are fragile once dried, and their shells can easily sustain cracks."

Freeze the zucchini until ready to use.Blanched zucchini can be frozen for 9 to 14 months depending on how airtight the seal is and how cold the freezer is kept.",How to Freeze Zucchini," Use firm, ripe zucchini with a uniformly dark color. The color of the zucchini is a good indication that it has not become overripe.









Do not use zucchini that is pale or soft. Also avoid zucchini that has bruises, deep scratches, or rotted spots.
If possible, use zucchini that has been freshly harvested from the garden. If buying zucchini from the store, make sure that it is in the refrigerated section and in ripe condition.
If you cannot freeze the zucchini right away, refrigerate it until you can. Make sure that it is still in firm, ripe condition before freezing it, though.;
, Rinse the zucchini under cold to lukewarm water, scrubbing it gently with your hands to remove any dirt or residue stuck to the skin.









If necessary, you could also gently scrub the skin with a soft vegetable brush.

, Determine which form you plan to use the zucchini in. Process the zucchini in that form to prepare it form blanching and freezing.









Use a sharp knife to remove 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) from each end of the zucchini.
If slicing the zucchini, use a knife to cut the remainder of the vegetable into 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) thick slices.
If cutting the zucchini into small cubes, begin by first cutting the zucchini in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds with a metal spoon and cut the vegetable into cubes.If shredding the zucchini, use a box grater to grate the remainder of the zucchini into fine shreds.
You could also use a food processor to coarsely chop the zucchini into shreds., When blanching slices or cubes of zucchini, you should fill the pot 2/3 full with water and set it to boiling over high heat.









Prepare a steaming basket for grated zucchini. Grated zucchini needs to be blanched, too, but it should be blanched using steam instead of boiling water. Fill the pot with roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water and place a steaming basket or other mesh basket over the pot. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high to high heat.
Blanching is a beneficial step because it removes the enzymes and bacteria that cause the zucchini to lose flavor, color, and nutrition over time. If you do not blanch the zucchini, it will discolor relatively quickly, even when stored in the freezer.
Do not add any salt to the water. When blanching vegetables to eat immediately, salt makes them more flavorful. When blanching vegetables to store them, however, adding salt can actually cause the vegetable to lose moisture and break down faster.

, Add a dozen or so ice cubes to a large bowl of cold water.









The cold water should be prepared before you blanch the zucchini.

, Sliced or cubed zucchini is blanched by adding it directly to the boiling water. Shredded zucchini is blanched by steaming it in a basket placed over the boiling water.









Cook sliced zucchini, uncovered, in the boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. It should still be firm when you take it out.
Place shredded zucchini in your steaming basket and cover the pot. Steam the zucchini for roughly 2 minutes, or until it becomes translucent.
You can safely reuse blanching water for up to five batches. Make sure to refill the pot with additional hot water as the water level drops, though.

, As soon as the blanching process is over, use a slotted spoon to transfer the zucchini from the boiling water or steam and into the bowl of ice water.









Suddenly dunking the zucchini in ice water immediately stops the cooking process.
Keep the zucchini in the ice water for approximately the same amount of time you kept it in boiling water or steam.

, Scoop the zucchini out of the ice water using a slotted spoon and transfer it to clean paper towels. Pat dry.









You could also transfer the zucchini to a colander and allow it to drain on its own. Either way, make sure that the zucchini is dry before attempting to freeze it.

, Arrange the zucchini so that the slices are in a single layer.









Pre-freezing the zucchini prevents the zucchini from sticking together in the freezer, making it possible to measure out precise amounts of frozen zucchini rather than thawing the entire batch.
Make sure that the pieces do not overlap or touch each other. Any pieces that overlap are likely to stick together.
Note that this pre-freezing stage is not necessary if you are using shredded zucchini.

, Place the tray in the freezer and let it sit there for 1 or 2 hours, until the zucchini has frozen solid.









Larger pieces will take longer to freeze than smaller ones.

, Scoop the zucchini off the baking sheet using a flat spatula and transfer the pieces into freezer-safe plastic bags or plastic containers.









Leave roughly 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) of empty headspace at the top if each container to allow the zucchini room to expand as it freezes.
Avoid using glass containers, which are more likely to shatter in the freezer.
If using a bag, make sure that you squeeze as much air out of the bag as possible. The closer it is to being airtight, the longer it will last without getting freezer burn or losing flavor.
Label the bag or container with the current date so that you can keep track of how long you've had the zucchini in storage.
Divide shredded zucchini into pre-measured amounts based on how much you anticipate needing at a time. For instance, you could try separating the zucchini into 1 cup (250 ml) portions. Place each portion in its own separate bag or container and label with the current date as well as the amount.

,









After thawing out the zucchini, use it within 3 days and do not attempt to re-freeze it.

Store zucchinis in the fridge.",How to Grill Zucchini," Grilled zucchini is delicious when well-seared. This requires using a grill that us at least medium-hot. Hotter grills would brand a set of appealing blackened grill lines, but if you're worried about burning your vegetables, you may want to opt for the medium heat. You can always simply cook your zucchini for longer if they aren't cooked to your liking.


Heating up a gas or electric grill is easy. Turn the grill on, start the flow of gas and hit the lighter (for gas grills), close the lid, and let the grill heat. If you are using a charcoal grill, light the charcoal. Wait until they are ashy and glowing orange. See our article on lighting charcoal grills for more information.
While waiting for the grill to heat up, do the prep work for your meal. For example, you may want to set the table, prepare the other dishes, or start chopping your zucchini (see below).;
, The key to grilling zucchini is to use thin slices, not thick pieces. Thick pieces of zucchinis may end up charred on the outside but uncooked inside. Listed below, there are several good ways to chop zucchini.


Chop zucchini into circular slices about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 centimeters) thick. These are easy to cut and easy to eat. This is a good choice when the zucchini is to be eaten as its own dish.
Chop zucchini into cubes approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inch on each side. These bite-size chunks work well for kabobs.
Chop your zucchini into wedges. Long, thin wedges cook well on the grill. Cut the zucchini into eighths lengthwise.
Slice your zucchini into long, thin strips. These are a little challenging — you need to cut the zucchini lengthwise into thin, paper-like strips just 1/16 of an inch thick or so. This requires a steady hand, but it's great for when you want to roll up ingredients in the zucchini pieces to make mini ""wraps.""

, When your zucchini pieces are all chopped up, transfer them to a mixing bowl. Drizzle about one tablespoon of cooking oil per zucchini you are cooking. Mix the contents of the bowl until the zucchini pieces are all evenly-coated. The oil will lend the zucchini pieces a little extra flavor, help them cook, and keep them from sticking to the hot grill.


Olive oil is a good choice for its flavor, but it has a low smoke point, which means it will start smoking at hot temperatures. If you don't want to deal with the extra smoke, you might want to try an oil with a higher smoke point, like vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil., Use a set of tongs to pick up the zucchini pieces and lay them on the grill one-at-a-time. You should hear a sizzling sound as soon as the zucchinis touch the hot surface. Grill the zucchini for about two minutes uninterrupted.


If you chopped your zucchinis into thin pieces, be sure to lay them at a ninety degree angle to the bars of the grill so that it's hard for them to fall through.
If you're worried about your zucchini sticking to the grill, use a grill brush or a paper towel to carefully paint the bars of the grill with oil before laying the zucchini pieces down.

, After a few minutes of cooking, the sides of the zucchini pieces touching the grill should be well-browned and tender. Flip the zucchini pieces over to cook the other side and let sit for a minute or two. Repeat as needed until the zucchinis are tender and browned all over.


For zucchinis that are evenly-cooked to perfection, flip your zucchini pieces in the same order as you added them to the grill. This ensures that all the sides will cook for the same amount of time.

, When your zucchini pieces are cooked on all sides, transfer them from the grill to a clean serving platter. Let them sit for a few minutes until they are cool enough to eat, then sprinkle them with the seasonings of your choice and serve them immediately. Congratulations — you've just made grilled zucchini.


There's no ""right"" seasoning to put on your zucchini, but if you're looking for something everyone will like, try lightly seasoning with salt and pepper. Other good choices include garlic salt and cajun seasoning!

, When you're tired of the ordinary zucchini taste, try spicing things up by soaking your zucchini in a flavorful marinade before cooking. Combine a little cooking oil with your favorite acidic ingredients (like vinegar or citrus juice), throw in the seasonings of your choice, and let the vegetables soak before cooking. A sample marinade recipe is available below:Mix 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup of olive oil. Add a few pinches of garlic powder and a spoonful of dried rosemary, basil, and oregano — whichever you have. Pour into an airtight container, add your zucchini pieces, and let them soak for at least a few hours before cooking.
If you are in a hurry and don't have time to marinate your vegetables, don't worry. Simply toss them in a bowl with about 1/4 cup of Italian vinaigrette salad dressing per zucchini and cook them immediately., Zucchini's mild taste goes great with tangy citrus flavors, the savory twang of garlic, and the richness of butter. This lemon-garlic sauce makes a great addition to plain grilled zucchini — use it in place of cooking oil to paint the vegetables before grilling.Melt 1/2 stick of butter with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Grate about a tablespoon of zest from the lemon peel into the mixture. Stir in a teaspoon of garlic powder and dried oregano. If you have some, add a pinch of curry powder as well. Paint the zucchini pieces with the sauce and grill as normal.

, Looking to add a little extra flavor to some plain old grilled zucchini pieces? Try making a citrus-tinged seasoning salt by mixing zest from your favorite citrus fruit with ordinary salt, then sprinkling it on just before serving. The recipe below uses a lemon, but you can use limes, oranges, or whatever else you want.Cook the zucchini pieces as normal, then set aside. As the zucchini cools, grab three lemons and use a fine grater or a microplane to grate the zest from the peels into a small pile on a cutting board. Add about 1 tablespoon of salt to the pile of zest, then use a knife to chop the salt and zest, combining them. Immediately use this to season the zucchini and serve. If you wait too long, the salt will dissolve.

, Zucchini is great on its own, but if you're looking for a dish that's a little more satisfying, try serving it with a hearty pesto sauce. You can dip the vegetable pieces in the salt like chips or slice them extra-thin and make mini-wraps with the sauce — it's up to you. In the recipe below, chopped walnuts can substitute for pine nuts.Cook the zucchini pieces as normal. Add 1 cup of basil leaves, a clove of garlic, 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of toasted pine nuts to a blender. Pulse until well-combined. Gradually pour in 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, pulsing as you go to form a thick, rich pesto sauce. Serve the zucchini with pesto on the side or as the filling in mini-wraps.

, Skewering zucchini pieces on a kabob by themselves or with other ingredients gives your guests a delicious, fun-to-eat meal. Zucchini pairs well with most common grilling ingredients, so depending on what you have available, you can make the exact kabob flavor combinations you desire. Good ingredients to add to a kabob with zucchini pieces include:



Vegetables: Summer squash, bell peppers, onion chunks, mushrooms

Meat: Chicken, lamb, pork, beef
See our kabob-grilling article for more information.

, Savory, nutty Parmesan cheese goes well with the moderate flavor of zucchini. Melting the cheese over zucchini pieces on the grill gives a dish that's deliciously crisp and blackened on one side and richly cheesy on the other. See below for instructions.


To make Parmesan zucchini, cut the zucchini into wide, thin pieces, then oil them and lay them on the grill as normal. Carefully sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top of each piece, then close the lid and allow the pieces to cook for two to three minutes. When the zucchini is tender and the cheese is melted, remove the pieces from the grill — you don't have to flip them.

, Looking to cook a lot of vegetables on the grill at once? One easy way to do this is to use a grill basket, which is basically a small metal cage with handles that's sold as a grill accessory. Filling a grill basket with mixed vegetables and cooking over a hot grill gives the vegetables deliciously crisp, blackened exteriors while allowing their flavors to blend together. Best of all, this keeps the rest of your grill free for meat or other dishes.


To prep vegetables for cooking in a grill basket, chop them into similar-sized pieces and toss them in olive oil. Add your favorite seasonings (rosemary and garlic powder are good choices) and stir to combine. Put the veggies in the basket and set the basket on the hot surface of the grill.
If you don't have a grill basket, you can get a similar effect by folding your vegetables into a pocket made from aluminum foil.

, Bigger is not better when it comes to finding the perfect zucchini to grill. Large zucchinis tend to have their flavor ""spread out"" through the vegetable. That is, they're usually somewhat watery and flavorless compared to smaller zucchinis, so choose the latter for grilling.


A good rule of thumb is not to pick a zucchini that's much bigger than a hand-held flashlight. Zucchinis' taste starts to suffer after they reach about six to eight inches in length., Did you know that not all zucchinis are green? In fact, perfectly-ripe zucchinis can be green, yellow, and even white.No matter what color of zucchini you get, check the vegetable to make sure its color appears rich, bright, and vibrant.


Dull or ""dead""-looking zucchinis, on the other hand, may be a sign that the vegetables are past their prime.

, A ripe zucchini that's ready for grilling should be firm and crisp. However, it shouldn't be outright hard — the flesh should give very slightly when squeezed. You'll also want to run your hand down the length of the zucchini to check for nicks, cuts, and other deformations. If you find any, pick a different zucchini.The best zucchinis have a very soft, subtle ""hair"" on them. You should be able to feel this light, bristly texture with the back of your hand.

, Fresh, high-quality zucchinis last about a week in the fridge. If you can, place the zucchini in a paper bag, rather than a plastic one. Airtight plastic materials can trap in moisture, making the zucchini get slimy and spoil faster.


Tightly-wrapped zucchinis also store for months in freezer. In this case, you will want to wrap the zucchini tightly in plastic wrap or place it in a tight ziplock bag. Blanching the zucchini before freezing it can prevent it from discoloring and losing its texture while frozen. See our article on blanching vegetables for more information."

, Wash two small butternut squash. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut away both ends of each squash. Throw the ends away and peel the butternut squash with a vegetable peeler. Rub the peeled squash across a mandolin so the squash is cut into very thin slices.While you can use a knife to cut the butternut squash into thin slices, a mandolin will give you the thinnest and most uniform slices.

, Fill a large bowl with ice water and put the slices of butternut squash into the water. Ensure that the squash is completely covered with the ice water. Soak the slices for 10 minutes before you strain the squash slices and pat them dry with a towel.Soaking and drying the slices of butternut squash gets rid of some of the starch. This makes the chips extra crispy when you fry them.

",How to Cook Spaghetti Squash in Microwave," Rinse the squash under cool, running water. Scrub it gently with a vegetable brush to remove any dirt or grime.


Dry the spaghetti squash thoroughly after cleaning it. If the squash is still wet, it may slip around as you attempt to cut it, which could cause you to accidentally cut yourself.;
, Saw the squash in half lengthwise, working from top to bottom.


To make it easier to keep the squash from rolling around on the cutting board, slice away the top or bottom first. Stand the squash on its now flat end and cut it as it stands.
Use a large, heavy kitchen knife. The knife can either be serrated or smooth-bladed, but it needs to be sturdy and sharp either way.

, Use a metal spoon to scrape away the seeds and stringy pulp. Continue scraping until the inside is clean.


You could also use a melon-baller or metal ice cream scoop to remove the inner pulp.

, Position the cut squash in microwave-safe baking dish with the cut-sides facing down.


Use a dish that is small enough to fit inside your microwave but large enough to fit both halves in a single, flat layer without any overlap.

, Pour about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of lukewarm water into the dish and around the spaghetti squash halves.

,


If your microwave rotates, you do not need to turn the squash at all during the cooking process.
If it doesn't rotate, pause the microwave after 6 minutes, turn the dish 180 degrees, and finish microwaving for the remaining 6 minutes.
The squash is done when the exterior is soft enough to be pierced with a fork.

, Wait until the squash is cool to the touch before attempting to serve it.

, Rest each half of the spaghetti squash cut-side down.


Keep the halves flat and in a single layer. If your dish is too small to fit both halves, microwave each half one at a time rather than piling them on top of each other.

, Seal the wrap around the mouth of the dish. Leave a small gap of space between the plastic wrap and one side of the dish to allow some, but not all, of the steam to vent.


Make sure that the plastic wrap is microwave-safe. Many types and brands are, but not all.

,


If your microwave does not rotate, pause the cooking every 3 minutes and turn the squash 90 degrees each time. Otherwise, it may not cook evenly.

, Use tongs to carefully pull the plastic wrap off the dish, starting with the side opposite you so that most of the trapped steam escapes away from your direction.


The built-up steam can burn you if you aren't careful.
Allow the squash to sit for 10 to 15 minutes or until it becomes cool enough to handle.

, Use a sharp paring knife to pierce the spaghetti squash in 10 to 15 places, spacing the cuts evenly apart.


It is very important that you pierce the squash before microwaving it. Otherwise, it could overheat and explode in the microwave.
Piercing the squash can be difficult, and you may need to use a forceful, stabbing motion to successfully work the knife through the exterior. Work carefully, however, so that you do not accidentally cut yourself in the process.
Do not follow the preparation instructions for cutting the squash.

,


If your microwave does not have a rotating turntable inside, rotate the squash 180 degrees after 5 or 6 minutes to make sure that it cooks evenly.

, You do not need to it to be cool to the touch, but allowing the squash to cool down for a few minutes will give it time to release some of the hottest steam and liquid through the cut marks.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the squash open lengthwise, from top to bottom.


Wear oven mitts or hold the squash with a towel as you do this. It will still be hot.
Cutting the squash open should be very easy. If it isn't, you may need to microwave it for another 2 to 3 minutes.

, Dig the seeds out with a metal spoon. The stringy pulp connected to the seeds should also come out, but be careful to avoid scraping out strands of flesh.

, With the flesh-side facing up, use a dinner fork to scrape the flesh of the squash away from the shell and toward the hollowed out center.


Move around the entire perimeter of the shell, gently pulling the flesh away in spaghetti-like strands and ""fluffing"" those strands toward the center as you work.
If you have difficulty doing this with one fork, use two. One fork can be used to hold the squash in place while the second is used to scrape away strands of flesh.

, Use the fork to gently lift and pull the strands of flesh completely out of the shell and onto the platter.


If the shell is still hot, you may need to hold it with oven mitts or a kitchen towel.

, Add these ingredients to the platter and use two forks to gently toss them into the spaghetti squash.


You can serve spaghetti squash in a variety of other ways, as well. For instance, if using it as a substitute for actual spaghetti, you could add a tomato-based sauce and Parmesan cheese.
Alternatively, you could also toss it with a 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of fresh chopped herbs, like basil, parsley, or chives.

, Wash and peel one small butternut squash that's about one pound (455 g) in size. Use a large knife to carefully cut the squash in half so you end up with a thin end and a round end. Scoop the seeds out of the round end and throw them away. Use a mandoline to slice the squash into 1/8-inch thick (3 mm) slices.The slices from the thin end of the squash will be circular slices and the slices from the round end will actually be rings that you can fry.

, Place the slices and rings of butternut squash into a large mixing bowl and drizzle them with 4 teaspoons of olive oil. Sprinkle the squash with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh herbs. Consider using:Sage
Thyme

Choose where you will pick them.,
Check the skin.,
Look at stems.,
Examine the color.",How to Select and Store Cherries1," You need to determine the location you will get your cherries from. Cherry orchards generally have the freshest cherries. You can also try the local farmer’s market. If it’s not the season, then you will not be able to obtain cherries in this manner. In this situation, you should go to your local grocery store. They will generally have cherries in stock.


If you do end up going to a cherry orchard, you should pick cherries form the trees. Doing this is simple, just grasp the cherry with your forefinger and thumb, and gently pull it off of the tree.Then, place it in a container.;
, The quality of the skin usually indicates the freshness of a cherry. Look for cherries that have firm and glossy skin. Gaze at each batch to make sure there are no blemishes on the fruit. Feel them to see how soft they are. They should feel firm to the touch.Avoid cherries that are too soft. These cherries are generally not fresh. Also, if cherries have wrinkles close to the stem, then they are generally not as fresh as they could be.
This can be dependent on cherry type as well. For example, Rainier cherries are not as firm as other cherries. Take this into account when you are checking cherries out.

, First off, you should see if the stems are still connected to the cherries. Generally cherries with stems attached are fresher than cherries without stems. If the cherries you are looking at do have stems, check their color. Bright green stems signal cherry health and freshness., You won’t necessarily be looking for a particular type of red. What you are trying to determine is the overall concentration of red. Darker cherries will be fresher than light-colored cherries.

Purchase or pick good plums.,
Place the unripe plums in a paper bag.,
Let the plums ripen at room temperature.,
Check the plums for ripeness.",How to Store Plums1," Look for plums that are free of blemishes, discoloration, and soft spots. You can ripen plums at home, so the important thing is to make sure you're picking plums from a good batch - it's okay if they're still a little hard.;
, If your plums do not yet smell fragrant and feel slightly soft to the touch, they need to ripen outside the refrigerator for a few days. As plums and other fruits ripen, they release ethylene. Placing them together in a paper bag surrounds the plums with this gas and causes them to ripen more quickly.


Don't put unripe plums in the refrigerator. They won't be able to continue the ripening process in the cold climate, and you'll end up with chill-damaged plums, which are tasteless and mealy.
If you aren't in a hurry for the plums to ripen, you can put them in a bowl on the counter instead of in a paper bag. They'll take an extra day or so to ripen.

, They'll ripen best when kept at a temperature of 68 to 77 Fahrenheit. Don't store them at a cooler temperature until they're fully ripe.


Make sure the plums don't get too hot; placing them in a sunny window might cause the to overheat, making them rot more quickly.

, Smell the plums. Do they smell rich, fragrant and fresh? Feel the plums. Do they indent slightly when you press your thumb into their sides? If so, the plums are ripe, and ready to either eat or go into longer-term storage.Plums' skin takes on a dusty look as it begins to ripen.
Catch the plums before they get too soft, or juice begins to squeeze out from the skin; this means they're overripe.

Try butternut squash tater tots.",How to Deep Fry Butternut Squash," When choosing an oil to deep fry your butternut squash in, it’s important to pick one that has a higher smoke point than the cooking temperature. For example, if you have a food that needs to be cooked at 350 degrees F (176 C), then use an oil that doesn’t smoke until 375-400 degrees F (190-204 C). Oils like sunflower, soybean, and peanut are the best for frying at high temperatures.You can also use vegetable shortening or lard. However, avoid olive oil and butter as they have low smoking points and burn easily.;
, If you don’t have a deep fryer, use a large pot with high walls. Ideally, there should be ten centimeters to four inches of space between the oil and the top of the pot. However, you want to make sure that you have enough oil to submerge your food, so use your best judgment. For deep fryers, simply fill the fryer up to the oil line with the oil of your choice.When working without a deep fryer, try filling the pot only halfway. This will help prevent spillover and splattering.
Heat the oil to 350 degrees F (175 C). You can use a candy thermometer or other kitchen thermometer that hooks onto the pot to monitor the temperature.

, You can prepare your squash in any manner that you like. However, make sure to cut it up before you put it into the deep fryer as it is too large to fry whole. Try cutting it vertically into one inch strips for fries or into small, thin rounds for chips. You can even shred or mash the squash to mix with flour and egg for butternut squash fritters., Depending on what recipe you’re using, you may season your squash before or after you deep fry it. For example, if you are making butternut squash fries, try putting the cut up slices into a plastic bag with a tablespoon or two of cornstarch and shaking it. You can also add a bit of paprika and garlic salt for a kick.


If you are making fritters, try mixing flour, baking powder, and salt with milk, maple syrup, and an egg. You can then add your mashed or shredded butternut squash to this mixture., Be very careful when placing your squash into the heated oil. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to set the squash in gently. Try not to drop the pieces in as this can cause splash back that is dangerous. You should also only deep fry a small batch at a time, as overcrowding the fryer can cause the butternut squash to stick together.


If you notice pieces beginning to clump together, lightly separate them with your tongs or spoon.

, Once the squash is golden brown it is usually a good sign that the squash has finished cooking. However, you should still check the inside to see if it has truly cooked through. If it hasn’t, reduce the temperature and cook a little longer. This should take anywhere between two to eight minutes., As the butternut squash cooks, remove finished portions to drain on a paper towel. You may have to change the sheets as you continue cooking, however, you should only need a few pieces. You can also use an extra paper towel to gently dab oil from the cooked squash.


Once dry, allow everything three to five minutes to sit and cool.

, Cut your squash into small, thin rounds and soak them in a bowl of ice water for 10-15 minutes. This will help get your chips crisp. After they've soaked, pat the slices dry with a paper towel. You can then drop them into the deep fryer in small batches for two to three minutes until they reach a chip-like texture. Once you've removed them from the fryer, drain them on paper towels and season them with Parmesan cheese and salt., Rather than the usual taco accompaniments of ground meat, chicken, or fish, try adding your fried butternut squash to healthy, vegetarian tacos. You can keep the usual ingredients like cheese, shredded lettuce, and salsa, or you can try adding sliced red pepper, avocado, and sprouts. You can also bread the squash with a mix of Panko crumbs, garlic powder, chili powder, and cumin before frying., For this recipe, cut the butternut squash into cubes and bake at 400 degrees F (204 C) for 12-15 minutes. Then place the squash into a food processor with spices like garlic, paprika, and salt, as well as a bit of flour like chickpea or wheat flour. Once blended, simply roll the ingredients into tater tot shaped cylinders and deep fry."

Freeze cherries.",How to Select and Store Cherries2," Unless you are going to dry them, your cherries should be placed in a dark, cool place. Cherries should at no point be placed in an area where they will be exposed to a large amount of sunlight. This exposure will shrink and wrinkle them which will sap their flavor.

, Cherries stay fresh in cold temperatures. Only keep your cherries at room temperature for a very short time. To keep your cherries fresh, you should refrigerate them. You just need to put the cherries in a resealable plastic bag, and then place the bag in the refrigerator. They will stay fresh for 3–5 days, or even up to two weeks.


If you keep cherries at room temperature, then you should be prepared to eat them immediately. For the cherries will only be good for up to 2 days. Make sure to wash and dry all cherries before eating.

, Cherries will pick up flavors from other items in your fridge. Therefore, if you don’t want your cherries to taste like your stew or garlic, then you need to put them in a space that doesn’t contain any fragrant items.


To help avoid this, make sure that you seal your cherries in containers or plastic bags. This will make it harder for the cherries to be permeated by smelly items in your fridge.

, By freezing cherries, you will make sure that they keep their freshness and flavor. You should choose whether you want to pit them or not. You don’t need to pit them, but some prefer to do this. After you make this decision, then you just need to get your materials ready. Pull out a baking sheet, line the cherries in one layer then put them in the freezer. Wait for an hour, take them out and drop them in a couple of bags. You should make sure they are completely firm before you do this.


When you put them in bags, make sure to squeeze as much air out as possible to avoid freezer burn. Frozen cherries can be kept for up to a year."

Preheat your oven.,
Clean your cherries.,
Arrange the cherries.,
Put the cherries in the oven.",How to Select and Store Cherries3," You should set the heat on your oven at 165°F(74°C). As you are preparing your cherries to be dried, the oven will be heating up. This should take about an hour.

, Wash the cherries that you have thoroughly. You are going to want to use room temperature water to clean them. After you clean the cherries thoroughly, you should dry them with paper towels., You should then place them on a baking sheet. Be sure to leave a bit of space between the cherries. They should be about half an inch apart from each other.

, Decrease your oven’s heat to 135°F(57°C). Now, you should place the cherries in the oven. Give the cherries six hours to heat up. They will look like raisins when they are done. You should then place them in containers and put them in the freezer.You can also dry the cherries in the sun. Simply wash, pit, and dry them first, then place them on trays. Now leave them in a place where there is plenty of sun for two to five days. You may want to toss them in the oven for about thirty minutes afterwards to get rid of any bacteria."

Store ripe plums in the refrigerator.,
Prevent bruising by storing plums inside old egg cartons.,
Eat plums soon after picking or purchasing.",How to Store Plums2," This will keep them in top shape and prevent fast deterioration. Place them in an open plastic bag - not a sealed one. Plums stored in the refrigerator will last two to four weeks.Make sure your refrigerator is clean and free of heavy smells. Plums tend to take on the smell of the refrigerator after a few days.
Put them in the crisper section of the refrigerator.

, One plum per egg space does the trick. Make sure heavier produce doesn't get stored on top of the plums.

, Plums can be stored for several weeks, but they definitely taste best when they're fresh. The sooner you can eat them after they ripen, the better. If you have a big bushel of plums to use up, try making one of these delicious dishes:



Plum cake is a popular way to celebrate summer's bounty of plums.

Vodka-infused plums are a flavorful topping for ice cream.
If you have little ones in your house, plum puree makes a special, healthy summer treat.
Spoiled plums don't have to go to waste - they can be stewed.

Freeze plums.,
Make plum jam.",How to Store Plums3," Frozen plums will keep for several months, and up to a year. Choose plums that are at their peak flavor and ripeness - underripe plums won't taste good when you thaw them.


Wash the plums and dry them.
Slice the plums into wedges and remove the pits.
Lay the wedges on a cookie sheet.
Freeze the plum wedges.
Place the frozen wedges in a food storage bag or bin.
Label the food storage bag or bin with the date and put it back in the freezer.

, This is an excellent way to preserve your plums so they last for months to come. You'll need to peel your plums to remove the skins before combining the flesh with sugar, pectin and lemon juice. Store your jam in sterilized jars and enjoy it all through the winter months.

Get a paper bag.,
Add your fruit to the bag.,
Let the peaches ripen.,
Check the peaches.,
Enjoy your peaches.",How to Ripen Peaches1," Brown paper bags are perfect for ripening peaches. The fruit releases ethylene gas naturally, and the thin paper traps the gas without also trapping moisture. Plastic bags on the other hand, cause peaches to ripen too quickly and then rot.;
, Place the unripe peaches into the bag. For added ripening powers, place a banana or apple into the bag with the peaches. These fruits give off high levels of ethylene gas and will cause the peaches to ripen faster.

, Leave the bag in a dry area at room temperature for 24 hours. The number of peaches and the original ripeness will determine the total amount of time to ripen the peaches fully.

, After 24 hours, check your peaches to see how ripe they are. If they give off a soft scent and are slightly soft to the touch, then they are ripe and ready to eat. If not, then replace them in the bag for an additional 24 hours. Repeat this process until they are ready.


If they are not ripened, leave in for another 12-24 hours.

, Once all your peaches are ripened, they are ready to eat! They are good stored at room temperature for several days, but can be kept longer when placed in the fridge."

Pick the right sized knife.,
Bake a squash first if it's very tough.",How to Cut Winter Squash," Before you prepare any food to eat, you should always wash it. Place your squash under running tap water. Turn the squash as necessary to get the full surface cleaned off, rubbing off dirt and grime as necessary. You will be submerging the squash in water after this, so there's no need to dry it., You will need a pot or a pan large enough to submerge the full squash. Place the squash in the pan and fill it with water. This is to see how much water you will need.Allow the water to boil. You should actually remove the squash here, as you don't want to boil it.
Once the water is boiling, you can place the squash back in the pot or pan.

, Reduce the heat on the stove to a simmer as soon as you place the squash in the pan. Allow the squash to simmer for about two to three minutes before removing it from the pot or pan.Make sure to be careful when removing the squash. Use tongs or spoons to lift it from the pan. Do not use your bare hands.
Sometimes, some of the water evaporates during the boiling process. If the squash is not fully submerged in the water, simmer one side for two to three minutes, flip the squash, and simmer for an additional two to three minutes.

, You do not need the bottom or the stem-end of the squash. These parts are not used for cooking. Use a very sharp knife here, as this will cut the squash most easily. Cut an even slice 1/4 of an inch from the top and the bottom of the squash.Your squash will probably still be hot after your remove it from the water. Either use gloves to handle the squash or let it cool for a few minutes before cutting it.

, Take a vegetable peeler and run it along the sides of the squash. The hot water will make the squash's skin come off easily. Running the peeler from the top of the squash to the bottom, peel the squash until you remove all the skin.Check your recipe before peeling the squash, however. Some recipes require you keep the skin on.
You should still let the squash simmer in boiling water, even if you're not peeling it. Squashes are much easier to cut after being softened by warm water.

, Take a sharpened chef's knife and a cutting board. Stand the squash up on the cutting board, with one of the two chopped ends seated on the board. Usually, the non-stem end is a bit wider, and easier to set down on the cutting board. Slice down the middle of the squash, cutting it into two halves of roughly the same size and shape.Make sure to go slowly and have a firm grip on the squash. You do not want to accidentally harm yourself.

, Once the squash is cut in half, you will notice two small semi-circles on either half. These semi-circles will be filled with seeds. Take a spoon and scoop out the seeds. You do not need them when you cook the squash.Many people roast squash seeds, much like they roast pumpkins seeds, so set the seeds aside if you plan on roasting them.

, Lay down each side of the squash on the cutting board. Start with one section. Cut the section in half lengthwise, and then slice the two new halves into long, thin slices. Repeat with the other side. You should be left with a pile of long slices of squash, about half an inch wide. Many recipes require or recommend cubed squash slices. If your recipe calls for this, cut each slice of squash into small cubes., Always work on a stable surface. If your squash slips out of your hand while you're cutting it, you could easily cut your hand with a knife. Place your cutting board on a level surface. It can also help to place a damp towel below the cutting board, as this will help hold it in place., Make sure the blade of the knife is roughly as long as your squash. Trying to cut a squash with a short, stubby knife will be ineffective and increases the likelihood of kitchen accidents.You should also avoid serrated knives, like bread knives, when cutting squash. You want to be able to make quick, clean slices.

, Some squash are easier to cut than others. If you're working with a squash that's very thick and difficult to cut, don't strain yourself trying. This increases the likelihood of the knife slipping from your hands. Instead of pushing yourself too hard, pop the squash in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit and leave it alone for 10 minutes. When you remove the squash from the oven, it should be much easier to cut.Make sure to let the squash cool for a few minutes before handling it when you remove it from the oven.

Enjoy your ripe peaches.",How to Ripen Peaches2," Select a clean, dry area (such as a space on your kitchen counter) to lay out a linen or cotton napkin. Make sure that it is flat for optimum use of space.

, Place your peaches stem-end down on the linen towel. Spread them out so that they are equidistant from each other, and so none of them are touching (even if you are ripening many peaches).

, Place a second linen or cotton towel over the top of the peaches. Cover them completely, and if possible tuck the sides so that the edges are closed off to fresh air.

, Ripening your peaches with a linen towel may take several days, but will provide juicier fruit. Check your peaches 2-3 days later, paying attention to their softness and looking for that classic peachy smell. If they aren't quite ready, replace the towel and check back a day later.

, When your peaches are soft to the touch and have a great aroma, they are ready to be eaten! Have them fresh or store them in your fridge if you have a surplus you want to extend the life of."

Boil a pot of water.,
Prepare a bath of ice.,
Slice an ""x"" at the bottom of each plum.,
Blanch the plums for 30 seconds.,
Plunge the plums into the ice water.,
Peel the plums.",How to Peel Plums," The pot should be large enough to hold at least four or five plums. Use enough water to allow you to submerge the plums completely. You want the water to come to a full, rolling boil so you won't have to leave the plums in the hot water for too long. If you over boil them, they'll get mushy.;
, Fill a large bowl with ice and water to create an icy bath for the plums. After you blanch them, you'll need to immediately cool them down by plunging them in the ice water.

, Creating a little cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem) will make it supremely easy to peel back the skin. There's no need to make the cut too deep or large; just use a paring knife to make a little ""x"" that pierces the skin and is large enough to poke your finger into.

, Drop them carefully into the water and boil them for 30 seconds. Make sure to time the boiling so you don't end up overdoing it. If you boil the plums even a few moments too long, they'll begin to break down. Use a slotted spoon to remove the plums from the water after the time is up.


Don't blanch more than four or five plums at once. If you put too many plums in the water at the same time, the water will cool down, and the plums won't cook quickly enough.
If you would prefer, you could instead place the plums in a large bowl and carefully pour the boiling water over them. Let the plums soak in the hot water for 30 seconds. This technique is useful when you're peeling very delicate plums that you want to make sure you don't overcook.

, Let them soak in the ice water for 30 seconds, then remove them and allow them to drain.

, Place your finger under one of the little flaps formed by the ""x"" you sliced into the bottom of the plum. Pull back the flap, and the skin should easily come loose in one big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. Continue until all of the plums are peeled.


If you encounter a tricky plum, use a paring knife to help gently loosen the skin.
If the skin won't budge, you may need to try blanching the plums once more. Make sure the water comes to a full boil and the plums cook for 30 seconds to loosen the skin.

Skewer your squash.,
Coat your squash.,
Season the squash according to your taste.,
Place the skewers over a medium heat portion of the grill.,
Grill the squash for 3 to 4 minutes per side.",How to Grill Squash1," Use cool water to remove any dirt or pesticides from the skin.Then take a sharp knife and cut off the top and bottom of your squash. The top should have a woody stem, and the bottom is usually thick skinned and rounded., To do so, you'll first need to slice your squash in half. Lay your squash on a cutting board or some other kind of cut-safe surface, and use your knife to cut it down the middle into two even parts.


Lay each part so its soft core is pointing upwards and use a spoon to scoop the seeds from the squash's center.
You can throw the pulpy, seedy bits away in the garbage, or use it as compost material.

, The two most common ways to cut your squash is by cutting each half into several pieces lengthwise or width-wise. The way you cut your squash will depend on how you want to present it after grilling.


You should cut the squash into pieces ranging in size from 3/8 to ½ inch (1 to 1.3 cm) thick. This will make it easier to skewer.
Cutting your squash lengthwise will result in french fry shaped grilled squash. Your kids might even find this veggie more palatable in this form, especially if give this food a fun name, like ""squash fries."", Take your pieces of squash one at a time and push the skewer through the middle of the piece. Slide the skewered piece toward the base of the skewer, then add another piece in this fashion until all your pieces are on the skewers.


You should leave some space between your pieces of squash on the skewer. Packing them too closely together can result in them being uncooked in the middle.If you plan on using wooden or bamboo skewers, you should soak these for a half hour before hand to prevent them from burning or getting charred.

, Put some olive oil or melt some butter in a small bowl. Dip a pasty/basting brush into the oil or butter and paint both sides of your squash with the coating.This will help prevent your squash from sticking to the grill.


The coating you use will also help your seasoning stick to your squash.

, Take your seasoning and sprinkle a moderate amount onto your squash. Try to be consistent with your application of seasoning. Missed spots might taste bland. Salt and pepper work well, as does steak seasoning.If you want your squash to be well-seasoned, you may want to turn the skewer to season both sides.
Be careful not to over season your squash. Doing so may make the flavor of the seasoning too strong.

, Many grills have a vegetable rack to prevent your veggies from overheating as they cook, and this might work well for cooking your squash. You can also use the corners or sides of the grill where your veggies will be more distant from the heat of the flame.Using medium heat when grilling your squash will help you achieve the best results.

, You can use a spatula, tongs, or even a flame resistant glove or mitt to turn your skewers after 3 to 4 minutes have passed. After another 3 to 4 minutes, it should be done.You'll be able to tell when your squash is done by its lightly browned sides and tender consistency. Poking the squash with a fork should help you discern its tenderness.
Be careful not to grill your squash too long. Doing so can result in your squash turning out mushy.

You should also sort through the plums and remove any small bits of stems, leaves, or other contaminants.
Toss out any soft, mushy fruit. Only use plums that are fresh and ripe for your jam.;
, Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil over high heat, then quickly dunk the plums in the boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds.Using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer the blanched plums to a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.
You only need to blanch the plums if you plan on removing the skins. Skins can be included in the jam, if desired, but may give your preserves a chewier texture.

, Pinch the skin of each plum in between your fingers and slide it off the fruit.


If the plums are ripe, you should be able to remove the skins without difficulty. Unripe plums may need a longer blanching time before you can remove their skins.

, Cut the plums in half and dig out the pits with a spoon. Continue chopping the plums into small pieces.


As you chop up the plums, discard any brown spots or mushy portions.
Note that you could also grind the fruit or chop it into slightly larger pieces if you would prefer the jam to be smoother or chunkier, respectively.

, Place the plum pieces in a large mixing bowl and add the lemon juice. Toss the plums with the lemon juice until well-coated.


The lemon juice isn't strictly necessary, but using it will help prevent the plums from browning as you work.

, Place the plums in a 6-qt to 8-qt (6-L to 8-L) pot, then cover the fruit with 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water. Set the pot on the stove over medium-high heat.


Stir the contents of the pot as they heat up to prevent the plums from burning.
If you prefer thinner jam, you can use up to 1-1/2 cups (375 ml) of water. Adding too much water could prevent the jam from setting properly, though.

, Once the water reaches a full boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pot. Allow the plums to simmer for 5 minutes.


Note that it will usually take 5 to 10 minutes for the water to reach a steady, rolling boil. Only reduce the heat after this ""full boil"" stage has been cleared.

, Sprinkle the sugar into the pot and add the butter. Turn the heat back up to medium-high and allow the contents to reach another full boil.


Leave the pot uncovered and stir its contents continuously to prevent the plums from burning.
The use of butter or margarine is only optional. Adding it can help reduce the amount of foaming, but if the mixture hasn't developed much foam by this point, the butter probably won't be necessary.

, Add the pectin to the contents of the pot, stirring it into the mixture as quickly as possible. Boil the entire mixture for an additional minute.Continue stirring the contents of the pot continuously during this final minute. You should also skim off any foam that develops using a large metal spoon.
You don't need to use a cooking thermometer to test the jam, but if you do opt to use one, the temperature of the jam will need to reach approximately 220 degrees Fahrenheit (104.4 degrees Celsius).

, Test the consistency of the jam by removing a spoonful using an ice-cold metal spoon. Let the jam cool on the spoon and note its texture.Remove the jam from the heat source while testing it to avoid accidentally over-cooking it.
Keep the metal spoon submerged in ice water before the test so that it is thoroughly cold by the time you use it.
Wait until the mixture cools to room temperature on the spoon. If the jam thickens to your desired consistency, it's ready to use and ready to can. If it's still too thin, boil the jam for another minute and test again.

, Wash the jars and screw bands in hot, soapy water, then rinse them off with warm water. Pour boiling water over the flat lids, cleaned jars, and cleaned bands, then allow them to soak for at least five minutes.


Note that you can also wash the jars in your dishwasher if your machine has a “sterilize” setting, but the lids and bands should still be washed by hand.
You can prepare the jars after the jam is finished, but to improve efficiency and reduce the total amount of time, you may wish the sterilize the jars, lids, and bands before or while you work on preparing the jam.

, Fill a boiling water canner halfway with water. Set it on your stove and allow the water to reach a full boil.


If you don't have an actual boiling water canner, you can use a large stockpot. Place a metal rack at the bottom of the stockpot before adding and boiling the water. This rack should prevent the glass canning jars from coming into direct contact with the heat source.

, Fill eight 8 half-pint (250 ml) jars with your plum jam, leaving 1/4 inch (1.25 ml) empty head space at the top of each jar.After filling the jars, wipe away any spilled jam using a clean, damp towel, then secure the lids and screw bands over the top of each jar.
Note that pint-sized (500-ml) jars may also be used, but you'll only need about four of them.
Leave the same amount of headspace regardless of the jar size. The headspace prevents the jam from expanding and cracking the glass jars.

, Use jar tongs to lower the filled, sealed jars into the boiling water of the canner.


Keep at least 2 inches (5 cm) of space in between the jars to prevent them from hitting each other as they process.
Note that there should be at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water covering the tops of the jars. If there isn't enough water in the canner, add more boiling water before you begin processing the jars.

, Cover the canner and process the jars of jam for 5 to 15 minutes, depending on your altitude.Keep the water boiling throughout this entire time.


For altitudes between 0 and 1000 ft (0 and 305 m), process the jars for 5 minutes.
For altitudes between 1001 and 6000 ft (305 and 1830 m), process the jars for 10 minutes.
For altitudes above 6000 feet (1.83 km), process the jars for 15 minutes.
Also note that these processing times should remain the same for both half-pint (250-ml) and pint (500-ml) jars.

, Carefully remove the processed jars of jam from the hot water. Transfer them to a cloth-covered surface and allow them to cool to room temperature.


Make sure that the jars do not hit the canner or each other on the way out. The glass may break if this happens.
It will usually take several hours for the jars to completely cool. You may even need to wait overnight depending on when you started the process.

, Once the jars are completely cool, test the seal by pressing down on the button at the center of each lid. That button should not move up and down when pressed.


Test the seal on each jar. Do not assume that all seals are fine just because the first one or two seem secure.
If the jar has not been sealed correctly, transfer it to the refrigerator and use the jam within a few weeks.
If you do not want to use any unsealed jam immediately, you could also try reheating the jam, placing it a new jar with a new lid, and processing it again.

, Label the jars with their contents and the current date, then store the finished jam in a cool, dry, and dark place for 6 to 8 months.


After opening a jar of plum jam, store it in your refrigerator and use it within three weeks.

Serve and enjoy your grilled squash.",How to Grill Squash2," Use cool water to wash off any dirt or pesticides from it.Because winter squash is thick and dense, it helps to partially cook it before grilling. Puncturing the skin with a small cut will keep steam from building up in the gourd and prevent it from exploding in the microwave while partially cooking.


Winter squash can also be quite difficult to cut in raw form. Partially cooking it will help you to cut it more easily., Put the winter squash on a microwave-safe dish and microwave it for approximately 6 to 8 minutes. After it is finished microwaving, the squash will take about 10 minutes to cool.


Handling your squash too soon after microwaving could result in you getting a minor burn or scald., Hold the squash by its top with your free hand to keep it in place and use a sharp knife to cut the outer skin free. You may need to rotate or flip the squash upside down to remove the skin completely.


You don't have to remove the skin around the stem. This portion of the squash is usually too woody to be eaten., First, cut the squash in half. You'll notice that inside the hollow part of the squash there are seeds and stringy, goopy bits. Use a spoon to scoop out these.The seeds and pulp can either be thrown away or used as compost material.

, Generally, these should be about about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) thick, though you can cut these in either long or narrow strips. Cutting your squash too thick can result in it not cooking throughout, and cutting it too thin can make it difficult to skewer.Try to cut your squash into even pieces. This will help ensure your squash cooks evenly while grilling.

, Since winter squash is thicker and meatier, if you use wooden or bamboo skewers, they should be very sturdy. For this vegetable, metal skewers may work best. Be sure to leave some space between the skewered pieces so the squash cooks throughout.


If you plan on using wooden or bamboo skewers, you should soak these for a half hour before hand to prevent them from burning or getting charred.

, Put oil or melt butter in a bowl and use a basting brush to lightly coat the skewered squash. Then, turn the skewer over and coat the opposite side as well. This coating will help prevent the squash from sticking to the grill. After your squash is coated, sprinkle on your seasoning of choice to add flavor to it.


You can also season your squash to suit your preferences. The sweeter flavor of winter squash might work well with citrus flavors, like lemon pepper.

, The thickness of winter squash requires strong heat to cook thoroughly. For best results, place your squash on the grill where it receives indirect, high heat and close the lid of your grill., Depending on your squash and its thickness, you'll need to grill each side for about 7 to 10 minutes. After that time has passed, turn the squash, and cook it for another 7 to 10 minutes or until the squash is fork tender.Your squash and skewer will be quite hot at this point. You should use a tool, like tongs or a spatula, or an appropriate heat safe mitt/glove to turn your squash.

, You can bring out the natural flavor of your squash with a mixture of ¼ cup melted butter and 2 tbsp of honey. Brush the grilled squash with with this mixture after removing it from the grill, then allow some time for the squash to cool., After five minutes or so, your squash should be ready to serve. Most people enjoy grilled squash while still warm from the grill, so you shouldn't wait to long before enjoying this dish with your meal.

",How to Grill Squash3," You may be planning on using skewers to pierce the pieces of your squash in shish-kabob style. However, if you plan to use bamboo skewers, you'll want to soak these in water beforehand for a half hour to prevent the wood from charring.You can also use metal skewers for your squash. You won't have to worry about soaking these, as the metal will not burn.
When using metal skewers, you should be careful not to burn yourself. The metal will become very hot quickly when upon the grill.
If you don't have skewers, you can simply lay the squash upon the grill and use a spatula to turn it when it is ready.

, Make sure that flammable materials are a safe distance away from your grill while grilling. If you are using a propane grill, check the hoses to make sure they are fastened securely to the grill and there are no leaks or breaks in the line.If you are using a charcoal grill, you may also want to use a long lighter to prevent getting burned when using an accelerant, like lighter fluid.
You could also use matches to light lighter fluid. A wooden/cardboard match can be lit and then tossed into the grill to set the fluid on fire., Charred bits of food from previous grilling can build up on your grill and rub off on your squash when you are grilling. This can give your squash an unpleasant charred flavor. Use a scraper to knock free and remove built up char.


A wire brush can also come in handy when cleaning your grill. This can help break up buildup in the nooks, crannies, and corners of your grill., It can take time for your grill to heat up, so doing this in advance can help you get your food served faster. For summer squash, you'll want to use medium heat. For winter squash, you should use high heat., To prevent your squash from sticking to the grill, you'll need to brush a thin layer of melted butter or olive oil onto your squash. You'll also likely want some kind of seasoning on hand so you can apply it to your squash after coating it in butter or oil.


A simple seasoning of salt and pepper works well for grilled squash.
Steak seasoning also works well with the solid, meaty texture of summer squash.Winter squash has a slightly sweet taste that pairs well with a honey glaze.The sweeter taste of winter squash may pair well with lemon pepper.

You'll want to plant the okra seeds in early spring, after the last frost of the year, when the temperature doesn't dip below 55 degrees at night. If that doesn't happen until late spring or early summer where you live, then it's better to start your seeds indoors 2-3 weeks before the last frost. When the seedlings are sturdy and the weather warms up, you'll transplant them to your garden patch.


To start seeds inside, plant the seeds in peat seed starter and keep them well-watered. Put them in a warm, sunny room or use grow lamps to keep them warm during the germination period. Keep the temperature between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
When the weather warms up and you're ready to transplant the seedlings, follow the same steps you'd use to grow okra from seed outdoors.;
, Okra grows best in full, hot sun. If you try to grow it in a shady spot, it won't produce much fruit, if it lives at all. Okra should be planted in a location that gets at least 6 hours of full sun every day. Don't worry that it'll get too hot - okra really gets going at summer's peak, when the sun beats down on the garden at its hottest.

, Okra grows best in a soil with a pH level between 6.5 and 7.0. test your soil's pH level to determine whether it is in the proper pH range. You can work in limestone or bone meal to increase the soil's pH. If you'd prefer not to change the pH level of your soil using any drastic measures, you can simply work in plenty of compost, which will drive the pH towards neutral, or 7.

, Okra grows well in very rich soil that's packed with nutrients. You can enrich your soil using compost, bagged organic fertilizer, or 4-6-6 slow release fertilizer.Either way, till the soil to a depth of 12 inches (30.5 cm) and work in 4 inches (10.2 cm) of compost or fertilizer using a garden rake so that it's evenly distributed.


Neglecting to add nutrients to the soil may result in okra plants that don't produce a lot of fruit.

, When the weather is warm, it's time to plant the okra in your garden. Sow your seeds 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart at a depth of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). If you started your seeds indoors, handle the seedlings very carefully and plant them 1 foot (0.3 m) apart in rows 3 feet (0.9 m) apart. Dig holes large enough to hold the root balls and gently pat the soil around the base of the plants. Water the garden to help set the soil.


If you want to speed the germination of your seeds, you can soak them overnight the night before planting, or freeze them to crack the shells.
If you're transplanting seedlings, do not break their tiny taproots. If they get crushed, the seedlings will not grow., Okra should be given at least an inch per week of water. Water every morning to thoroughly moisten the soil, except after heavy rains. Okra can withstand a bit of drought, but it grows much better when given plenty of water throughout the summer.


It's best to water okra in the morning so that the plants have time to dry before nightfall. If the water stands in the garden bed overnight, it could cause the plants to start rotting.
When you water okra, try not to get water on the leaves. When the sun starts beating down on the okra plants, the water will act as a magnifying glass and burn the okra leaves.

, When the seeds you planted have sprouted and grown to 3 inches (7.6 cm) high, thin out the smaller seedlings and leave the strongest ones standing. Thin them so that the remaining seedlings are spaced 1 foot (0.3 m) to 2 foot (0.6 m) apart, in rows 3 feet (0.9 m) apart. If you transplanted seedlings that you started indoors, you can skip this step.

, While the okra is still young, cultivate the bed to eliminate any weeds. Then cover the area around the seedlings with a heavy layer of mulch, such as pine straw. This will prevent additional weeds from sprouting and taking over the bed., Since okra needs plenty of nutrients to grow, it's a good idea to continue adding compost throughout the summer. You should side dress the okra with compost three times: once after thinning the seedlings, once after the first pods begin to grow, and a third time halfway through the growing season. To side dress, simply rake in a few inches of compost around the plants, so that the soil there gets enriched.


You can also side dress with more bagged fertilizer or slow release fertilizer.
Don't side dress the plants too often; three times is enough. Adding too much compost or fertilizer can hurt the plants more than it helps.

, Aphids, stinkbugs, and corn earworms all like to feast on okra plants. The plants are hardy, and usually won't fail on account of pests, but it's a good idea to keep their populations low to get the most out of your okra crop. Inspect the stems and leaves regularly for holes, yellow leaves and other signs of pest infestation. You can pick the bugs off by hand or spray the leaves with soapy water to keep the pests away.

, About 8 weeks after planting the okra, the pods will start to grow. Once you see the first okra pods emerge and mature, you can start regularly harvesting them. Use a scissors or a hand pruner to cut the okra pods just above their caps, where their thick stems meet the branches of the plant. Once you make a cut, another okra pod will emerge from the same spot. Keep harvesting the okra throughout the summer until the growing season slows and the plants stop producing new pods.


Harvest the pods when they are 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long.
Harvest the okra every other day, and every day in warm climates and during the peak of the season, to encourage fast regrowth. You may even need to harvest twice per day to keep up with growth at the peak of the season. If the pods get too big, they will become woody and tough.
You might want to wear gloves and long sleeves when you harvest the okra. The leaves and pods are covered with spines that can irritate the skin., Okra's taste and texture are best within a few days of harvest. You're likely to have an abundance of okra you can use to make classic dishes like the following:


Fried okra
Gumbo
Stewed okra

, This is a great way to preserve the okra's flavor and texture for months to come. You can pickle okra the same way you pickle cucumbers, using a salty brine. Pickle okra right after you harvest it for best results.

, If you simply have too much to eat, or you want to be able to enjoy okra during the winter, freezing it is a good option. To freeze okra, blanch it for 3 minutes, plunge it into an ice bath to stop it from overcooking, then chop it into bite-sized pieces. Place the pieces on a tray and freeze them until firm, then transfer them to a freezer bag for long-term storage.

Fry the okra.",How to Freeze Okra," Don't attempt to freeze okra that is underripe or past its peak, or you won't be pleased with the taste and texture of the okra when you thaw it later. Choose brightly-colored, well-formed okra without mushy spots or bruising.


If possible, pick the okra fresh. This enables you to freeze the okra before it starts degrading, and will result in the best-tasting okra later on.
If you don't grow your own okra or can't get to a farm, try buying it a farmer's market or from a store that regularly restocks. You don't want okra that's been sitting on a shelf for several days.;
, Rinse away dirt and debris using a steady stream of cool water. Handle the okra gently, massaging away dirt instead of scrubbing it off. Okra is a rather fragile vegetable and will bruise easily if handled roughly.

, Use a sharp knife to trim off the tips of the okra. Don't remove the entire cap that covers the seed cell; just trim the stems. Exposing the seed cell will cause the okra to break down quickly when you blanch it.

, Pour water into a large pot and bring it to a rolling boil over high heat. This will be used to blanch the okra.

, Fill a bowl with ice and water. The okra will be plunged into the bowl immediately after blanching to stop it from overcooking.

, Place the okra in the boiling water. If the okra pieces are large, they'll need to be boiled for 4 minutes. Blanch them for just 3 minutes if they're on the small side. After the time is up, remove the okra from the pot with a slotted spoon.


If you have a mixture of small and large pieces of okra, sort them before blanching. Blanch the small pieces for 3 minutes and the large pieces for 4 minutes. Doing it separately will preserve the texture of each.
Blanching vegetables kills the enzymes that cause them to continue to ripen and eventually rot, thus helping preserve their color, flavor and texture. If you neglect to blanch the okra before freezing it, you'll end up with mushy, flavorless okra when you thaw it.

, As a general rule, you should chill blanched vegetables for the same amount of time that you blanched them. So if you blanched small pieces of okra for 3 minutes, chill them for 3. If you blanched large pieces for 4 minutes, chill them for 4.

, Place the okra on a cutting board or tray and let them dry before proceeding.

, Think ahead to what you plan to use the okra for. If you're putting it in a stew, chop it horizontally to create chunks. If you plan to serve it as a side dish or stuff it, chop it lengthwise to create strips. Leave the seeds intact.


If you want to make fried okra, it's best to bread it before freezing. Follow the steps in the next section.

, Lay out the pieces in a single layer and make sure none of them are touch.

, Put the tray in the freezer and freeze the okra for 1 hour, or until the pieces are firm and slightly icy. Don't leave the okra in the freezer uncovered for longer than this, or the chill will affect their texture.

, Fill each freezer bag to within an inch of the top with the frozen okra pieces. Close the top of the bag, leaving just enough space to stick a straw into the empty headspace. Suck the air out of the bag so that it closes tight around the okra, then remove the straw and seal the bag.


Removing the air will keep the okra from breaking down as quickly.
If you have a vacuum sealer, the machine will remove the air for you.
Consider labeling your bags with the date they were packed.

, Frozen okra can be added to stew, soup, and casseroles without thawing it first. In fact, it's best to immediately cook the okra instead of thawing it first. The more the okra is handled, the likelier it is to get mushy.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the okra into bite-sized pieces that will fry evenly.

, Fried okra is typically breaded with cornmeal, or a mixture of cornmeal and flour. It's fine to roll it in plain cornmeal, or cornmeal mixed with a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Whatever mixture you choose, each piece of okra in a thin layer of breading, and shake off the excess.


Don't use a wet batter to bread the okra before freezing, though, since it won't hold up well in the freezer over time.

, Place the okra pieces on a baking sheet in a single layer. Put the baking sheet in the freezer for an hour. Remove it from the freezer when the okra pieces are firm enough to hold their shape., Fill each freezer bag to within an inch of the top with the frozen okra pieces. Close the top of the bag, leaving just enough space to stick a straw into the empty headspace. Suck the air out of the bag so that it closes tight around the okra, then remove the straw and seal the bag.

, When you're ready to use the okra, heat vegetable or peanut oil in a large stockpot. Let the oil get hot enough to sizzle when you add a piece of cornmeal to the pot. Put the frozen okra pieces directly into the hot oil and cook them until they're golden brown and crispy. Season with salt and pepper to serve.

",How to Prepare Okra," You can buy okra from many fruit and vegetable suppliers. Make sure that the okra is fresh.









While it may be difficult to harvest your own okra , it is possible and proves inexpensive.;
, Too large and the okra will have a flat taste, and may be too tough to eat. Too small, and the okra will be difficult to cook.









Avoid okra that look shriveled or are soft when squeezed.
The okra should snap rather than bend.

, Do this without cutting the pod itself. The conical stem attached to the pod can be carefully trimmed around to remove if desired. Remove the thin layer with your fingers. Doing this ensures that the whole vegetable is edible but it is time-consuming to do.








, The fuzziness on okra doesn't have to be removed before cooking on young okra. To remove it from older okra:









Defuzz under running water. Rub the pod gently using a fine nylon scourer, paper towel, or a vegetable brush.Pat the okra dry inside a dishcloth or spread it out to air dry.

, This can be done by giving the okra a vinegar treatment, although you will need to do this well in advance.








Pour half a cup of vinegar into a bowl for every 500 g (1 lb) of okra.
Gently swish the vinegar over the okra to coat all okra in the bowl.
Leave for 30 minutes to soak in the vinegar.
Remove the okra and rinse well. Dry and use as suggested by the recipe.

, There are different ways to prepare okra depending on how it is being cooked:









Slice into even-sized pieces for Cajun and Creole stews (e.g., gumbo) that are thickened using okra after topping and tailing it.
Cut into slices or leave whole for frying (see below).
Leave whole (but cleaned and prepared) for stews and casseroles where the recipe requires this. If the okra is cooked whole, it is not able to release its gelatinous substance.If using as a thickener, blanch the whole okra first. Slice the okra and add to the dish 10 minutes before cooking time finishes., Okra goes well with eggplant, onions, peppers, and tomatoes.







, These are tough, with little flavor; see the instructions above.








, If you cut them too thick, they will take longer to cook.








,, Don't use flour, as this will cake up and the okra will end up mushy.








,,,, When the okra is golden, take it out and let drain on paper towels. Enjoy.

Drain and serve.",How to Make Fried Okra1," Pour 1 qt (1 L) of vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed skillet. Set the skillet on the stove and allow the oil to heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).A cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven works best, but any skillet with a heavy bottom will suffice. You can also use an electric deep fryer.
The oil should be at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep, if not a little deeper. Do not allow the oil to fill more than half the depth of the pan, however.
Heat the oil over a medium-high heat setting, and adjust this setting as needed to maintain the temperature throughout the frying process. Check the temperature continually using a frying or candy thermometer.;
, Place the okra in a colander and rinse it thoroughly under cool, running water. Afterward, allow the excess water to drip off by letting the okra sit in the colander for 30 to 60 seconds.

, Using a sharp knife, slice the okra into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces. Keep the pieces as uniform as possible.

, Sift together the cornmeal, flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. Whisk lightly until evenly combined.


These seasonings will create a traditional Southern flavor profile, but you can vary them based on personal preference. For instance, you could also add paprika, chili powder, or onion powder.

, Place the eggs in a medium bowl and beat them lightly using a whisk or fork. Toss the sliced okra in the beaten eggs, stirring until all sides are evenly coated.


If desired, you could use 3 to 4 egg whites instead of using 2 whole eggs. Doing so will make the final coating lighter and crispier in texture., Working in half batches, lift the okra out of the egg and allow the excess to drain back into the bowl. Quickly toss the okra into the dry breading mixture, stirring to coat all sides.


Working in two batches instead of one will ensure a more even coating. Crowding the bowl, on the other hand, may create pockets of uneven coating.

, Toss the breaded okra into the hot oil and fry the pieces for 3 to 6 minutes, or until the breading turns golden brown.


Work in two or more batches while frying the okra.
Stir the okra gently to prevent the pieces from sticking together and to ensure that all sides brown. Do not stir too quickly, however, since doing so could cause the breading to break off.

, Using a slotted spoon, remove the finished okra from the hot oil and transfer the pieces to a plate covered with paper towels. Enjoy the fried okra after letting it drain for 30 to 60 seconds.

",How to Cook Okra," Always wash fresh produce before eating it. Run your okra under tap water, turning it as necessary, to clean all sides. Shake off the okra to dry or dab it dry with paper towels., Start by slicing and discarding the stems on either end. Then, slice the okra into thin, round slices.Use a chef's knife or paring knife to slice the okra.

, Okra sometimes comes out a little slimy. To prevent this, soak your okra slices in vinegar after cutting them. Combine a cup of vinegar with a quart of water. Immerse your okra in this mixture. Allow it to soak for one hour., Do not cook wet okra. This can contribute to sliminess. Let okra air dry on a paper towel. If you need to cook your okra fast, you can pat it down with paper towel until it dries., Lightly salt as much water as you need to submerge all your okra. Place your pot over high heat and bring the water to a boil.Try drizzling some lemon juice in the water. Some people find this cuts down on sliminess and it can also add some flavor., Once your water is boiling, add your okra to the sauce pan. Cover the pan and set a timer. Okra takes between 8 and 10 minutes to cook.Okra should be soft and tender when it's done cooking.

, Make sure you get all the water out. Use a colander to drain out all the water. Shake the colander if necessary to get out excess water. Okra is prone to sliminess, so keep it as dry as possible., Okra can be seasoned with a little butter, salt, and pepper. Boiled okra does not require a lot of seasoning, but if you prefer a particular flavor profile you can season the okra how you want. For example, you can add dried basil and garlic to your okra., Fried okra should be coated in flour, cornmeal, salt, and any spices you want. Mix half a cup of flour, half a cup of cornmeal, and half a teaspoon of salt together. Then, add a quarter teaspoon of any spices you want, such as black pepper or cayenne pepper.You should also prepare a liquid to coat the okra in first so the coating sticks. Beat one egg together with one egg with a tablespoon of milk.

, Coat a pan with a light amount of cooking oil such as olive oil. Heat the the pan over medium high heat for a few minutes.To check if the oil is ready, toss a small bit of food into the pan. If it sizzles, the oil is ready to use.

, One by one, coat your pieces of okra. Set them aside on a plate until they're all coated. Dip the okra in the egg milk mixture. Then, dip it in the flour mixture until all sides are evenly coated., Add as much okra to the oil as fits. Pieces of okra should not touch and have a little space around one another. Fry the okra for three to four minutes per side. Each side of the okra should be golden brown by the time it's done cooking., Use a slotted spoon to remove okra from the oil. Place your okra on a plate covered in paper towel. Allow the okra to cool for a few minutes before eating.,"

Examine the pineapples in the produce section.,
Remove the top leaves, commonly known as the crown.,
Cut off the bottom of the pineapple.,
Remove the pineapple center, or core.,
Slice off the skin of the pineapple.,
Decide which shape of pineapple pieces you prefer.",How to Choose and Slice a Pineapple," Pineapples are harvested when they are already ripe. The quality of the pineapple will decline over time, so choose the freshest fruit available. When shopping for a pineapple, look for bright green leaves rather than dry, brown ones. The pineapple should feel hard and have clear skin. Avoid pineapples that have visible bruises or feel soft to the touch.;
, There are 2 ways you can go about this. One is to grab all of the leaves in your hand and twist them, using some force, to remove them. The other is to lay the pineapple down on a cutting board and use your knife to cut them off. Throw the crown away.

, Lay the pineapple down on it's side on a cutting board. Use a knife to cut the base of the pineapple off with one hand, while holding the fruit with the other. Toss the part you cut off in the trash.

, There are specialty tools called pineapple corers that can easily remove the core of the pineapple with little to no effort. Place the pineapple upright, put the corer even with the center of the pineapple and push down with force while turning the corer until you reach the bottom of the pineapple. Pull the corer up and out of the pineapple to remove the core. Throw the core away. If you do not have a pineapple corer, move onto removing the pineapple skin.

, With the pineapple still in an upright position, use a kitchen knife to cut the skin off the pineapple in thin slices. After you remove all of the skin, you might notice some brown 'eyes' still left on the pineapple. Take a paring knife and carefully remove these brown spots.

, You can choose to cut pieces or pineapple rings. If you prefer pineapple rings, lay the pineapple on it's side and slice the pineapple. How thick you cut the slices is up to you. If you have not already removed the core, take your paring knife and carefully cut the core out of each pineapple slice. If you want pineapple pieces, cut the pineapple into manageable wedges. If you have not already removed the core, slice the core away from the center of each wedge, and slice each wedge into the desired thickness and size.

If you haven’t done so already, you should also cut up the onion and green chili pepper. The onion should be cut into thin slices, while the green chili pepper should be minced into small pieces., Pour 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of vegetable oil into a large skillet. Allow the oil to warm up on the stove over medium-high heat for approximately 30 seconds.

, Place the two ingredients in the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes or until the onions begin turning translucent.


You should also notice a stronger aroma coming from the onion and green chili pepper. This aroma signifies that the flavor of the two ingredients has been infused into the cooking oil.

, Place the sliced okra in the pan alongside the onion and green chili. Sprinkle it with the salt, turmeric, and red chili pepper, then toss to combine.

, Cook the contents of the skillet, stirring frequently, for another 6 to 9 minutes.The okra should be cooked through after about 6 minutes, but it may retain a slimy texture. Cooking it for several more minutes should make it crispier.
Note, however, that cooking the okra too long could cause it to lose much of its color and nutrients.

, Transfer the stir-fried okra to serving plates and enjoy it while it's still hot.


This recipe has its origins in Indian cuisine. Traditionally, it can be served with plain white rice and a sprinkle of lemon juice or dried mango powder. You can also serve it with flatbread and a dollop of plain yogurt."

Following the contour of the fruit will help prevent loss of flesh where the pineapple bulges in the middle.
Do not remove the eyes (brown spots) while cutting away the skin, or you will lose too much of the good flesh.


, Eye spots will all line up in diagonal rows on the pineapple. Cut a V-shaped groove along the diagonal line to remove each set of eye spots. The remaining flesh is ready for cutting now.









You will lose a bit more of the good pineapple flesh by removing the eyes this way, but it takes significantly less time than removing each eye one by one.

Purchase several pineapples from a supermarket.,
Let your pineapple ripen fully.,
Remove the top and the bottom from the pineapple.,
Slice off the tough skin.,
Remove the “eyes.” Notice how the prickly brown dots on the pineapple form at a diagonal line from top to bottom.,
Slice your pineapple in rings or chunks.,
Preheat your oven to the warming or low setting.,
Cover 1 to 2 baking sheets with a layer of parchment paper.,
Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven.",How to Dehydrate Pineapple1," You can wait for a sale when the supermarket is overstocked and get pineapples for $.99 per lb. or less.;
, Once the pineapple starts to have a strong, sweet smell, the sugars are concentrated and it is ready for dehydration. Drying it too early will result in sour pineapple slices.

, Set the pineapple on its side on your cutting board. Slice approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the spiky green top of the pineapple and 1 inch above the bottom section.

, Set the pineapple upright on your cutting board. Cut straight down from the top of the pineapple to the bottom in 1 slice.


Try to cut just inside the hard outer layer.
Turn the pineapple and repeat until you have exposed the flesh of the pineapple.

, Take your knife and cut approximately 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) into the pineapple at an inward angle from the right.


Go to the other side of the line of eyes and cut at an inward angle from the left.
Peel back the strip of eyes and discard it.
Then, find the next diagonal strip and repeat.
When you finish cutting the eyes out of the pineapple, the surface will form a spiral pattern around the entire parameter.
This method of cutting a pineapple takes some practice, but it will result in more flesh being saved than cutting deep enough to remove the eyes and the skin together. , If you want your pineapple to be dried in rounds, slice the pineapple horizontally and thinly. Then, cut out the center with a paring knife.


If you want to dry the pineapple in chunks, cut vertically, separating the flesh from the hard center, then cut into thin chunks.
The thinner, the better when drying. It will dry faster and more evenly.

, Try to aim for 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) for best results. Set the oven no higher than 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius).


Dehydrating works best when set at low heat for a long time. You do not want to cook the pineapple.

, Use as many baking sheets as you can fit in your oven.

, Set it for 24 hours. It may take up to 36 hours.


Test to see if it is done. If it is chewy throughout and slightly flexible, it is done. "
